Introduction The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 22, 1994 when it also approved the ESAF and extended arrangements to support Pakistan's medium-term adjustment and reform program. 1/ The Executive Board concluded the mid-term review under the first annual ESAF arraneement and the first review under the extended arrangement on September 9, 1994. 2/ At that time, Executive Directors welcomed the authorities' achievement in implementing the program, noting the sharp improvement in international reserves, despite supply shocks that had adversely affected exports, growth, and inflation. Directors called for further improvements in the fiscal position and budget structure and for tightening monetary policy and broadening the privatization program. The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were conducted concurrently with negotiations for the second review under the extended arrangement and request for the second annual arrangement under the ESAF. z/ The delay in comoletine the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions was due to attempts to combine these discussions and program negotiations. In the wake of balance of payments pressures and the adoption of a package of measures on October 28, 1995, the authorities have requested Fund assistance in the form of a stand-by arrangement (SBA). Discussions are now underway with the authorities to assess the package of measures and to design an adjustment program that could be supported by a SBA. A supplement will be issued reporting on these discussions. Pakistan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from July 1, 1994. Pakistan received two disbursements under the first-year ESAF arrangement and made three purchases under the extended arrangement. No use of Fund resources has been made since December 1994 due to nonobservance of one December 1994 performance criterion as well as the 1/ EBS/94/9 and Supplements 1 and 2. L/ EBS/94/159 and Supplement 1. I/ The Pakistan team comprised trhe Advisor to the Prime Minister for Finance and Economic Affairs, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, the Finance Secretary, Special Assistants to the Prime Minister, and other senior officials. In addition, the staff met the President and Prime Minister in March. The mission teams comprised Messrs. Short, Furtado, Tareq and Hirschhofer; Mesdames Moalla-Fetini and Liu (all MED); Messrs. Kouwenaar (PDR) and Ruggiero (FAD); Mesdames Boesch and Redman (Assistants, MED); and Miss Palazzo (Assistant, PDR). The missions were assisted by the Fund's resident representatives in Islamabad. Messrs. Snoek and Tareq. Messrs. Chabrier, El-Erian (both MED), and Lachman (PDR), as well as Messrs. Mirakhor and Ahmed (OED). participated in various policy discussions. Messrs. Byrd and Fardcust (World Bank) attended many of the policy discussions.

As of end-September 1995, Fund purchases and loans outstanding amounted to SDR 982.69 million (130 percent of quota). 1/ The authorities have provided the staff with economic data on a frequent basis and in a timely manner. The quality and coverage (as well as frequency and timeliness) of the core data have been sufficient for the staff to follow economic developments closely as well as to form a view of medium-term prospects. u II. Backeround and Recent Developments In mid 1993, in response to a severe balance of payments crisis, Pakistan embarked on a comprehensive medium-term program of macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform with support from the Fund, J/ the World Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral donors and creditors. The program emphasized financial discipline and broad structural reforms (especially in the budget) to increase the efficiency of resource allocation, promote saving and investment, and raise productivity and income. Substantial progress was realized in 1993/94 in implementing fiscal and other adjustment measures as well a$ structural reforms. These policies reduced macroeconomic imbalances and led to some important achievements in 1993/94 (Table 1). In particular, international reserves rebotided strongly to USS2.3 billion by the end of 1993/94 (12.6 weeks of imports). However, real GDP erowth rose to only 3.8 percent (cf., 2.3 percent in 1992/93) well below the objective of 7.5 percent as output was restrained by cotton virus and drought: which affected agriculture as well as related industries and services. Moreover, annual average CPI inflation rose to 11.2 percent (cf. I 9.3 percent in 1992/93 and an objective of 8 percent) reflecting, inter alia, the supply side shocks. As part of the first review under the ESAF and extended arrangements, the authorities formulated a program for 1994/95. The objectives were to raise growth to 6.6 percent, reduce inflation to 7 percent, narrow the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) to 3.1 percent of GDP (from 3.8 percent in 1993/94), and improve international reserves to about 14 weeks of imports. To achieve these objectives, the 1/ Pakistan's relations with the Fund are described in Appendix II and its relations with the World Bank Group are summarized in Appendix III. 2/. Statistical issues are covered in Appendix IV. J/ Fund support was initially in the form of a stand-by arrangement approved September 1993 (EBS/93/140 and Supplements 1 and 2). It was replaced by the ESAF and extended arrangements referred to above in February 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3- Table 1.

Tightened demand management was to be accompanied by structural measures, including implementing the first phase of a comprehensive tariff reform, broadening the base of the general sales tax (GST), reducing tax exemptions and concessions, extending the base for agricultural taxation, continuing the privatization program while using the proceeds mainly to reduce government debt, and reducing the scope of mandatory and concessional credit schemes. Policy implementation in 1994/95 fell considerably short of the program, particularly in the fiscal area. Some budget measures were reversed; administrative difficulties were encountered in tax collection; further tax exemptions and concessions were granted; and retail petroleum product prices did not keep pace with costs. In addition, growth and inflation were again adversely affected by poor weather and crop disease as well as by a deteriorating security situation in Karachi. By mid-1994/95, it was recognized that it would be difficult to achieve the programmed level of government revenue and reach the growth and inflation objectives. Following extended discussions, specific understandings were reached with the staff in April 1995 on (i) a revision of the 1994/95 growth and inflation objectives to 5.1 percent and 13.2 percent, respectively; (ii) stabilization measures for the rest of 1994/95 to contain the fiscal deficit to 5.6 percent of GDP and monetary growth to 14.6 percent; and (iii) the elements of a second-year program under the ESAF and extended arrangements corresponding to the 1995/96 fiscal year that would bring the program back on track. Performance in 1994/95 in relation to the revised policy targets was mixed. The revised fiscal deficit was met after a vigorous revenue collection effort in the last half, especially the last month (Table 2). However, this level of the deficit reflects the changes in three practices without which the deficit would have amounted to 6.5 percent of GDP. IJ Relative to GDP, total revenue was fractionally lower than in 1993/94 due to decreases in "ontax receipts and the surcharge on oil and gas (as retail petroleum prices were not adjusted to keep pace with rising costs) as well as elimination of the import license fee. These reductions relative to GDP L/ One such factor was the change i" the method for recording i"terest on central bank purchases of treasury bills from the issue date to the maturity date. This caused a one time reduction in government interest expense. Another practice was excluding the use of privatization proceeds loaned to a state enterprise. Under the understanding reached in March 1995, such use of privatization proceeds would be included in government spending with a corresponding entry in domestic nonbank financing. Finally, in September 1994, two provincially owned banks were reclassified as deposit money banks, As the provincial governments were "et depositors with these banks, this step reduced the measured bank financing of the deficit.

'.<.,.,i expenditure was also somewhat lower than in 1993/94 as declines ir; development, defense, and interest outlays were partially offset by a rise in unidentified federal spending. With regard to the revised monetary program. domestic liquidity grew by 16.6 percent, with a greater expansion in net domestic assets and lower accumulation of net foreign assets (Table 3). The greater expansion of NDA (12.6 percent) than envisaged (9.4 percent) was mainly due to higher credit to some public enterprises and to the private sector under government- sponsored credit schemes, much of which came in a surge of credit during June. The increase in the central bank's NDA--mainly arising from government sponsored schemes, direct financing of the budget deficit, and the monetary effect of use of the privatization proceeds from abroad-- contributed half of the 18.3 percent increase in reserve money. Following the two step depreciation of the currency in July 1993, the State Bank of Pakistan has followed a managed floating exchange rate policy that has sought to strike a balance between maintaining an adequate level of competitiveness and providing stability to the economy. In reflection of this policy, the currency appreciated in real effective terms by only a small amount between June 1993 and July 1995 (Chart 1). However, given that domestically produced raw cotton is now at international prices there were indications that the traditional textile sector was suffering from weakening competitiveness. In June 1994, the SBP withdrew from providing forward foreign exchanee cover for imports, allowing commercial banks to take over this business. In several steps during 1994/95, it raised the forward cover fee for foreign currency accounts to avoid an ex ante subsidy. The SBP continues to keep the fee under review. As regards the balance of uavments, mainly as a result of the fiscal and monetary outturns being more expansionary than programmed, but also as a result of a rise in machinery imports for private investment and a 10 percent increase in unit values (in particular for edible oil); total imports grew by 17 percent in 1994/95, compared with a programmed rate of 11 percent (Table 4). Exports also grew by 17 percent, largely as programmed, with strong growth in cotton manufactures and nontraditional exports more than offsetting a downcurn in other traditional exports. As a result, the current account deficit widened to 4 percent of GDP in 1994/95. At the same time, private investment inflows other than from the partial sale of the telecommunications company (PTC) were below program projections, particularly in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, the balance of payments still registered an overall surplus of US$250 million, having benefitted from receipt of US$860 million from the partial privatization of PTC and commercial borrowing by the Government (including a US$150 million Eurobond issue), which was partly offset by retirement of US$530 million in short-term debt by the SBP. At the end of the fiscal year, international reserves were USS2.7 billion (13 weeks of imports), only slightly less than the USS2.8 billion originally programmed.

At the end of 1994/95 the debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 43.4 percent, lower than the previous two years. During 1994/95, the debt service ratio was 22.5 percent of exports of goods and services, in line with. the levels in 1992/93-1993/94. but it is projected to rise to 23.2 percent in 1995/96. At the end of 1994/95, the ratio of government domestic debt to GDP was 43.5 percent. The growth and CPI inflation uerformance at 4.7 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively, fell short of the program‘s targets (Table 1 and Chart 2). The lower than targeted growth was mainly due to poor cotton and other agricultural crops and their impact on tither sectors. The acceleration of inflation reflected high monetary expansion, as well as the above mentioned hupply-sfde shocks, higher prices of a few major imports, and some administered price adjustments. Progress was also mixed in implementing structural reforms during 1994/95. The first phase of the comprehensive tariff,reform was undertaken by incorporating several import charges (amounting.to 12 percent) in the tariff structure and by lowering the maximum all-inclusive tariff rate from 92 percent to 70 percent. HOWeVer, this was to.have been accompanied by a substantial broadening of tge bases of the GST and the agricultural wealth and income taxes in order to compensate for the revenue lost from the tariff reform. In the event, the bases of the GST and taxes on agriculture were not broadened by the extent that was required. In the case of the GST, certain measures that had been adopted with the budget (such as the elimination of capacity schemes for tax assessment) were reversed and further tax exemptions and concessions were introduced as a means to encourage investment. On the expenditure side of the budget, a high priority Core Investment Program (CIP) was implemented and outlays in the Social Action Program (SAP)' were'raised to 1.9 percent of GDP (from 1.8 percent in 1993/94). Moreover, despite continued regional tensions, defense expenditure was kept to 5.6 percent of GDP (cf.., 5.7 percent budgeted and 5.9 percent in 1993/94). In the financial area, the SBP made progress in shifting from direct to indirect monetary instruments, thus allowing the credit-to-deposit ratio to be gradually relaxed during 1994/V5 and to be eliminated in October 1995. In addition, the minimum lending rate on all concessional credit was raised by 1 percentage point to 13 percent in November 1994, while the caps on banks' rates of charge on loans and rates of return on deposits were removed in March 1995. HOWeVer, the yield on treasury bills declined to an annual average of 11.7 percent from 12.4 percent in 1993/94, although there was a somewhat higher level in the second half of 1994/95 when the auctioning of treasury bills was fully integrated with the SBP's open market operations, Progress was slow in privatizing the.two remaining nationalized banks (the largest banks) and on phasing out concessional and mandatary credit programs.

This and the Government's increased demand for nonbank financing, which led to an increase in the rates of returns on some government debt instruments held by the nonbanking sector that were designed for individuals, contributed to segmentation of the credit market and posed the risk of financial disintermediation. With respect to the trade reaime (besides the reduction in the maximum tariff rates), most textile items were removed from the negative import list, while cotton exports and imports were liberalized. Another significant action was opening the enerw sector (including oil and gas exploration as well as power generation) to private investment, although this was accompanied by incentive packages which will adversely affect tax revenue in the future. III. Policv Discussions In April 1995, understandings with the staff were reached on the elements of program for 1995/96 that called for a substantial strengthening of budgetary operations as the foundation for steering the economy back to the path envisaged under the original framework in support of which the ESAF and extended arrangements were approved. However, the budget presented in June 1995 fell considerably short of tzhe understanding as regards both adjustment and structural measures. Thereafter, the discussions with the authorities covered the reasons for this divergence and the likely impact on macroeconomic balance of the authorities' course of action. During discussions in August and October, emphasis was placed on the sharp deterioration of the external position since end-June 1995, the stubbornly high inflation rate, and the policy alternatives to redress the macroeconomic imbalances. At the end of October 1995, the authorities introduced a package of measures to address the macroeconomic imbalances and improve the external position, on the basis of which discussions are presently underway toward a stand-by arrangement. 1. The 1995/96 budget The program on which understandings were reached in April 1995 had as its obiectives to raise real GDP growth above 6 percent in 1995/96, slow average CPI inflation below 10 percent, contain the current account deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP, increase international reserves to USS3.1 billion (14 weeks of imports), and reduce domestic and external public and publicly guaranteed debt to about 40 percent of GDP each. In support of these objectives, the budget deficit was to be reduced to 4 percent of GDP with both adiustment measures and a range of structural uolicies. The programmed bank financing arising from this level of the deficit was to be a main element in reducing monetary growth to 12.5 percent. Structural policies included measures to reduce segmentation of the credit market and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public12 impediments to fully market-based credit allocation, as well as sectoral pol,icies. The authorities' policies for 1995/96, as incorporated in the budget, fell considerably short of those agreed with the staff in April, both in terms of adjustment measures and structural improvements. Moreover, there was doubt as to whether the policies were sufficient to attain the authorities' targets. The budget provided for a reduction in the deficit to only 5 percent of GDP, with double the agreed level of bank financing, and the structural measures were only partially implemented. On the basis of these policies, the authorities projected an external current account deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP in 1995/96, with a decrease in international reserves of X$835 million to USS1.9 billion (8.1 weeks of imports). I/ The corresponding decrease in the banking system's net foreign assets would partly offset the higher bank financing of the budget, thereby keeping monetary growth at 13 percent. The authorities expected real GDP growth to be 6.5 percent with single digit. inflation. In discussing the policies for 1995/96. the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to continue adjustment and structural reform over the medium term, but added that breathing space was needed in 1995/96 given the delicate domestic socio-political situation. Other reasons for the.slower pace of adjustment and reform were concerns that revenue growth from the GST might be slow to material&e due to administrative difficulties, and that some of the agreed fiscal measures on which understanding had been reached would contribute to inflation. The staff warned that such weakening of adjustment measures and structural reforms posed risks regarding higher inflation, a wider trade deficit, and market perceptions that could affedt the external capital account. In the circumstances, the authorities and Fund staff decided to follow economic performance closely during 1995/96 so as to create appropriate conditions to bring the structural reform program back on track at a later stage. 2. Developments in the first auarter of 1995/96 Several developments in the first quarter of 1995/96 were cause for concern. The trade deficit widened to over US$950 million, more than double the level in the first quarter of 1994/95 (Chart 3). Reflecting continued demand pressures built up in the second half of 1994/95, imports were 22 percent higher, while exports were 4 percent lower. In addition, expatriate workers' inward remittances decreased (which partly reflected expectations of a devaluation) and outflows took place from nonresidents' foreign currency accounts. As a result of these developments, as well as 1,' This projection excludes estimates of privatization proceeds. Although the authorities were not in a position to quantify them, they expected privatization proceeds to more than offset the projected loss of gross reserves. The main sources of privatization proceeds would be further sales of PTC and divestiture of one power plant (Kot Addu).

By mid-November, gross reserves had reached US$l.l billion. A number of fFnancia1 indicators suggested wariness in the markets. The premium of the kerb exchange rate above the official rate had increased to about 6 percent by the second,half of October (cf., 2.5 percent six months earlier; Chart 4). In addition, one international rating agency downgraded Pakistan's credit rating in July. Finally, PTC privatization vouchers were trading at about two-thirds of the level at which they were issued in September 1994. On the positive side, harvests of basic food crops in the first quarter were good, coming on top of a good wheat crop at the end of 1994/95. In addition, the prospects for the cotton crop were promising so that the target of 9.5 million bales would at least be met (cf., 8.6 million bales in 1994/95). On the basis of this encouraging start, the authorities felt that their growth target of 6.5 percent for 1995/96 would be reached. However, despite good agricultural output and higher imports, inflation had remained near 13 percent per annum in the first quarter, partly reflecting the surge in liquidity at the end of 1994/95. Monetary growth in the 12 months ended September 1995 was 17 percent, reflecting, inter alia, the surge in credit in June 1995, as well as continued substantial bank financing of the Government. Only partial information is available on government finances. Tax revenue was 10 percent above the authorities' target for the first quarter due to much higher than projected direct tax receipts. Nevertheless, the Government borrowed PRs 33.6 billion from the banking system (64 percent above the authorities' target for the first quarter and 12 percent above the amount budgeted for the whole year) and used PRs 6 billion in privatization proceeds (half of the amount envisaged for the year), which also has a monetary impact. 3. Discussion of stabilization and structural reform policies The developments in the first quarter of 1995/96--particularly the gaping trade deficit, falling international reserves, persistent inflation, and higher-than-budgeted government borrowing from banks--demonstrated the emergence of large underlying macroeconomic imbalances. The most recent discussions with the authorities concentrated on the extent of disequilibrium and an appropriate policy response. a. &era11 macroeconomic issues The staff emphasized its concern in July-October that the policy stance (rspecially fiscal policy) was not sufficiently tight to reduce the underlying macroeconomic imbalances. Moreover, it was open to question b:lethel- the budget target could be achieved.

In addition, the sharp compression of current spendir!& tl:, the Federal Government implied in the budget might not be attained, parl~iy due to the awards for salaries and pensions (amounting to 0.1 percent of GDP), which are to be absorbed in the current budgetary allocatiorls. An intangible was the situation in Karachi. The staff pointed out that privatization proceeds (from sale of a further part of PTC, one power plant (Kot Addu), and part of the second largest bank (United Bank) which could generate additional foreign exchange resources) should "or be used to offset persistent weakness in the budget and the balance of payments. A more appropriate use of such foreign exchange proceeds would be to reduce the imbalance in the banking system's foreign currency position. Domestically, proceeds from abroad should not be used to raise government expenditure but to replace domestic bank borrowing and to retire debt held by the SBP. Any other use of privatization proceeds from abroad would accelerate monetary growth. As evidence of fundamental imbalances became clearer, the staff advocated prompt implementation of a comurehensive stabilization "ackaee. The key part of the package would have to be strong and quick acting measures to reduce the fiscal deficit. Among the measures suggested by the staff to improve the fiscal stance were: (i) raising retail petroleum prices to reverse the erosion of revenue from costs rising more than prices, (ii) scaling back the widespread use of tax exemptions and concessions, (iii) imposing a minimum duty on imports, (iv) increasing the standard GST tax rate (presently at 15 percent), end (v) deferring "oncore investment while preserving the CIP. Other elements of the package would be: tightening monetary policy to reduce bank liquidity and raise interest rates; reducing the flow of government-directed bank credit to nongovernment sectors; and depreciating the exchange rate to improve the trade account and reverse market sentiment. Against the background of further evidence of weakening in the external position, at the end of October the authorities introduced the following measures: (i) a 7 percent devaluation, (ii) a 7 percent increase in retail petroleum prices to cover the higher costs resulting from the devaluation, (iii) a minimum duty of 5 percent on all nondutiable imports, with a few exceptions, 1/ (iv) a 10 percent import surcharge. 2/ (v) reduction in "oncore development expenditures and grants to enterprises and local L/ The exceptions are wheat, fertilizer, pulses, newsprint, and machinery for power plants exceeding 3,000 mw for which letters of support have already been issued. 2/ The full surcharge applies to all """zero rates at 55 percent and below; a 5 percent surcharge applies to the 60 percent rate; and there is no surcharge on the 65 percent rate so that the maximum rate remains 65 percent.

The market's immediate reaction to the measures has been guarded. However, the pace of international reserves loss slowed to around US$200 million in the. 3 weeks after the measures were announced, while the kerb exchange rate premium narrowed to about 3.5 percent above the official rate. b. Fiscal policy Despite a number of encouraging tax and expenditure reforms in recent years, the budgetary structure continues to be constrained by competing claims and objectives (Box 1). The staff has stressed that these fiscal constraints highlighted the importance of increasing tax revenue in order to recoup that lost in zhe tariff reform through: (i) rolling back tax exemptions and concessions, while not granting any new ones, and (ii) extending the GST into a broad based VAT in a timely manner. Equally important is using privatization proceeds to reduce debt directly or indirectly by replacing current borrowing so as to open space in the budget in the future. These were integral elements of the ESAF and extended arrangements medium-term programs. Box 1. Budgetary Constraints On the expenditure side, rigidity arises from the importance of providing for (i) national defense consistent with regional circumstances, (ii) domestic and foreign debt service, (iii) improvement in social welfare through the SAP (especially in view of Pakistan's unfavorable social indicators), and (iv) CIP outlays for infrastructure and development (including counterpart funds for projects promoted by the international community). On the revenue side, the budget is constrained by the need to persist with tariff reform so as to improve productive efficiency and take advantage of the opportunities opened by the Uruguay Round Agreements. Overriding these considerations is the need for a lower budget deficit as a prerequisite for macroeconomic stabilization. Compounding the complexity is revenue sharing between the Federal Government and the four provinces. 1/ The gross impact of the measures in (i)-(v) is estimated at PRs 22.5 billion (1 percent of GDP). This will be discussed further in the forthcoming supplement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - The thrust of the tax reform in the medium-term program was to shift taxation from international trade to domestic consumption. The original tariff reform envisaged decreasing the maximum tariff to 45 percent at the start of 1995/96 and 35 percent for 1996/97. .Although the authorities only reduced the maximum rate to 65 percent in 1995/96, they reaffirmed their commitment to reach the tariff reform's original targets within relatively few years. In their view, the delay partly involved the need to generate offsetting revenues from the GST. The authorities expressed caution about extendine. the GST to wholesale and retail trade by April 1, 1996 (as foreseen under the agreed program) due to anticipated political opposition. Instead, they have considered extending the GST to the wholesale trade and in several stages to retail trade. The staff cautioned that piecemeal extension would not yield significant revenue while compounding the administrative difficulties. I/ One of the cornerstones of the ESAF/EFF policy framework was the removal of most tax exemptions and concessions which have been used to promote investment despite adversely affecting government revenue. Although the authorities have repeatedly agreed not to extend any new exemptions and concessions, as well as to phase out existing ones, exemptions and concessions have continued to be granted. 2J The staff has advocated that, in those cases where direct tax exemptions could be justified, the industrial objectives could be achieved instead by allowing well defined tax credits for priority investment. In line with the medium-term ESAF/EFF policy framework, the agreed program for 1995/96 contained two other structural improvements--to adjust retail petroleum prices automaticallx with costs and to double the Productivity Index Unit (PIU) for the agricultural wealth tax. The staff views a mechanism for automatically adjusting oil prices as important for preserving a valuable government revenue source in real terms, as well as for promoting efficiency and protecting the environment. The higher PIU I/ The staff recommended several structural measures for the GST reform: (i) broadening the base within the manufacturing sector and imports by limiting general exemptions to only a few necessities, (ii) extending the GST to the entire trading sector in one step, (iii) reducing the number of tax rates, (iv) removing sector specific and regional exemptions, (v) establishing of a turnover-based registration threshold consistent with administrative capabilities, and (vi) replacing sector-specific exemptions for capital goods with a general provision for immediate crediting. ZJ In the second half of 1994/95, exemptions and concessions were granted for twelve Special Industrial Zones, Export Processing Zones, an industrial area already set up in NWF Province, the electronics industry, the energy sector, agro-based industry, tractor imports, and the tractor industry. Although the 1995/96 budget allowed several time-bound concessions to expire, thereafter concessions have been granted for the textile, computer software, and mining industries as well as newsprint.

The authorities have indicated that they will introduced an automatic mechanism for linking retail petroleum prices to costs and that they intend to implement a further increase of the PIU for 1996/97. Another complication in implementing the tax reform has been the revenue shariw arrangement between the Federal and provincial government*. Under the present arrangement, the Federal Government receives 100 percent of the revenue from taxes on international trade but only 24 percent of the revenue from the GST. Thus, the tax reform measures (shifting taxation from import duties to GST) automatically raise the federal fiscal deficit without a mechanism that would ensure a corresponding improvement in the provinces' fiscal position. The authorities recognized the difficulties in the revenue sharing arrangement but pointed out that any modification would have to await the outcome of the deliberations of the National Finance Commission 0, which was appointed in July 1995 to review and make recommendations to the President on revenue sharing. 1/ Moreover, the nature and timing of the NFC's recommendations were uncertain. Pending new revenue sharing arrangements, the National Economic Council has been making decisions on intergovernmental transfers for development and on the level of provincial development spending in order to realize the overall budget target. As a result, federal transfers and loans to the provinces have been reduced to partly compensate for shifts in revenue* to them. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism has almost run its course as federal loans and grants are approaching a low level. Development-oriented outlaw have not expanded ** a share of GDP as was envisaged in the ESAF/EFF framework. In 1995/96, the budgetary Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) is planned to remain at 4.4 percent of GDP which is the same level as in 1994/95 but below the levels of previous years. The authorities recognized that slow growth in investment and social outlays was not desirable but, given the need to contain the budget deficit and the rigidities on the revenue and expenditure sides of the budget, there was little alternative other than to restrain development outlays. However, they stressed that SAP-related expenditure would be raised by 0.1 percent of GDP in each coming year. c. Monetarv policy The authorities emphasized that important structural initiatives had been taken in 1994/95. They explained that, in 1995/96, further structural improvements would take the form of removing the credit-to-deposit ratio and increasing the role of open market operations. Market-oriented monetary policy would be supported by continuing to improve bank supervision and privatizing the United Bank. 1/ Federal and provincial government* are represented on the NFC. which is chaired by the Prime Minister. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public18 - The staff expressed concern that the authorities' target of 13 percent monetarv growth in 1995/96 might not be achievable. particularly since reserve money was to grow by 19 percent. Achieving the monetary growth target would depend crucially on the Government'* capacity to limit its borrowing from the banking system to PRs 30 billion (3.9 percent of the beginning money stock), consistent with the budget deficit of 5 percent of GDP. For this to be achieved, domestic nonbank financing would have to be double the *mount of bank financing (20 percent more than nonbank financing in 1994/95). Other crucial factors would be limiting the credit needs of public enterprises and the scope of government directed programs through both the commercial banks and development finance institutions. It would also depend on the SBP's ability to use indirect monetary instruments more effectively, in view of the elimination of the credit-to-deposit ratio. During the discussions from July to October, the authorities acknowledged the risk of monetary overrun, indicating that, if there were an overrun in credit to government, to public enterprises, or in mandated schemes, they would be reluctant to curtail other credit to the private sector as this would impinge on growth. To achieve the revised target for domestic nonbank financing in 1994/95, the rates of return on a few government savina schemes (which are nonmarketable but redeemable since they are meant for small savers) were raised and these schemes were opened to nonbank financial institutions. The staff expressed concern that this practice was leading to a more segmented financial market characterized by attractive rates of return on some nonbank financial instruments, while rates of return on bank deposits were negative in real terms. Accordingly, the staff recommended that the authorities work on ways to enhance the rates of return on bank deposits. The authorities replied that much of the difficulty in raising deposit rates hinged on the inefficiency of the publicly owned banks. These banks were characterized by disproportionately large nonperforming portfolios and high operating co*ts. In this regard, the authorities added that the United Bank was expected to be privatized by the end of 1995 and that plans were also being considered to privatize Habib Bank (the largest commercial bank in the country). 1/ d. External sector policies The authorities indicated that they would continue to manage the exchange rate flexibly to balance the maintenance of external competitiveness of tradable goods against the avoidance of cost-push inflationary pressures. In response to balance of payments pressure, they leaned more toward adjusting the exchange rate than raising interest rates. An increase in interest rates would induce a short-term capital inflow, further raising Pakistan's short-term foreign liabilities, which are already at a high level, possibly leading to complications in the future. Moreover, 1/ These actions would leave only the National Bank of Pakistan and three specialized banks in the public sector. There are no plans to privatize these banks at present. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 higher interest rates would add to government interest expenditure and slow economic growth. Thus, the authorities preferred to take steps to try to improve export competitiveness and promote import substitution through exchange rate adjustment. The staff welcomed the authorities' willingness to continue to manage the exchange rate flexibly, but stressed that it would need to be supported by an appropriate degree of demand restraint. Furthermore, although the staff has consistently recommended that the authorities implement an exchange rate adjustment sufficient to assure the external competitiveness of Pakistan's export industries, it has noted that exchange rate action cannot substitute for sound fiscal and monetary policies. IV. Medium-Term Balance of Pavments Outlook The staff's medium-term framework for the period 1995/96-2000/2001 as detailed in the staff report for the September 1994 program review (EBS/94/159) has been revised to take into account changes in the external environment, current macroeconomic developments and policies, and projected energy investments (Table 6). The starting point is the macroeconomic framework outlined by the authorities at the beginning of the current budget year before the deterioration of financial imbalances that occurred in the first quarter. For 1995/96, they expected a current account deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP, based on 14 percent export growth (underpinned by a good cotton crop) and a slowdown in import growth to 10 percent, still several points above real GDP growth in volume terms. With capital flows projected at somewhat lower levels than in 1994/95--reflecting lower program aid disbursements and commercial borrowing by the Government--the balance of payments was projected to move into a deficit of some US$600 million, resulting in a drop in end-period official reserves to the equivalent of eight weeks of imports (from 13 weeks at end-1994/95). The October measures ( along with the prospects for a good cotton crop, go a way toward realizing the authorities' original projection. Beyond 1995/96, based on the authorities' expressed intention to resume the adjustment and structural reform program and on a real growth assumption of over 6 percent, the balance of payments projections would show modest surpluses from 1996/97 onward. On the basis of renewed strong export growth and tight financial policies to contain import growth, the underlying current account deficit would drop to below 3 percent by 1997/98, reflecting a gradual decline in the government deficit to below 3 percent and a further improvement in private sector savings. HOWeVer. increased private investment-related imports, in particular for foreign-financed energy projects, would maintain the current account deficit above 3 percent in the following years.

These projections for the current and capital accounts ( coupled with substantial Fund repurchases over the coming five years, would result in a stabilization of Pakistan's reserves at about six weeks of imports, underlining its vulnerability to domestic policy slippages as well as exogenous shocks. 1/ This scenario assumes a strong commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit, limit money growth, and maintain external competitiveness. A pessimistic scenario of considerably weaker policies would suggest a current account deficit on the order of 5.5-6 percent of GDP, lower private capital inflows, withdrawal of foreign currency deposits, and a corresponding decline in reserves. Such a scenario would rapidly become unsustainable and could jeopardize the progress made during recent years in opening Pakistan's trade and exchange system. V. Staff Auuraisal At the present time, Pakistan's economy has entered a period of macroeconomic imbalances, which are most conspicuous in the form of persistent inflation and continuous losses of international reserves. The origins of these difficulties are a weakening in fiscal performance and a slackening in the process of structural reforms. The weakening in the fiscal area goes back to 1994/95 when some budget measures were reversed, tax exemptions and concessions were extended, and administrative difficulties in tax collection were encountered. Moreover, the 1995/96 budget provided for a slower pace of fiscal consolidation and structural reform than originally envisaged, which did not provide the basis for a second-year program under the ESAF and extended arrangements. The continued rapid rate of monetary growth in 1995/96 is again mainly the outcome of the high and unsustainable fiscal deficit as well as the government-directed credit programs. In the wake of severe balance of payments pressures in recent months, a remedial package of measures was taken by the authorities at the end of October 1995. While it is to be welcomed that this package provides the basis for a substantial reduction in the budget deficit in the remainder of the fiscal year, it is to be regretted that this package relied so heavily on an import surcharge. The main priority of policy in the period ahead 1/ Compared to the scenario presented at the time of the mid-term review (September 1994), export projections are somewhat more cautious--with average growth of 12 percent of the 6 year period, while factor payments have been revised upward to reflect new foreign investment inflows. As a result, the projected reserve build-up is considerably lower, also reflecting that new use of Fund re.sources has not been incorporated. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public22 - must be to reinvigorate the process of structural reform, especially in the budget area. In this context, particular emphasis should be placed on the extension of the GST and the elimination of tax exemptions and concessions that have weakened past budget performance. The staff believes that the budget measures adopted to date should be reinforced by further expenditure reductions in noncore areas and by the introduction of a more fully articulated program. A comprehensive stabilization package of mutually reinforcing measures is necessary for forcefully addressing the serious imbalances and restoring market confidence. It is also crucial to gain control over monetarv erowth and, in particular, to reduce the rate of increase in reserve money substantially in 1995/96. At the same time, an important facet of the monetary tightening should be a sizable reduction in government-directed subsidized credit schemes, which the authorities have started. The steady widening of the trade deficit over the first quarter of 1995/96 also illustrates the importance of maintaining an appropriate level of the exchange rate. Opportune adjustment of the exchange rate (as part of the stabilization package) is essential for retaining external competitiveness, restoring market confidence, and safeguarding international reserves. The staff welcomes the recent exchange rate action and urges that the rate be managed so as to achieve a balance between the above goals and containing inflationary pressures. To that end, it is important that exchange rate policy is fully supported by restraint in fiscal and monetary policies. Relying on privatization proceeds or ad hoc foreign financing to slow the loss of international reserves would not be in Pakistan's best interest. Following this path would only delay the needed adjustment and, by allowing imbalances to worsen, would require a stronger adjustment effort in the future. Using privatization proceeds to raise government spending mu.st also be resisted. Rather, privatization proceeds offer a unique opportunity to reduce the banking system's foreign currency exposure and to open space in the budget by using the proceeds to retire government debt. Action is crucially needed to reinvigorate the reform process in order to address the remaining structural issues. An energetic implementation of a package of structural reforms, as well es stabilization policies, could prepare the way for returning to a program supported by ESAF and extended arrangements. While the tariff reform in 1994/95 succeeded, inter alia, in reducing the maximum tariff rate, further progress is needed in this area. The other key fiscal reforms would be broadening the GST base, removing tax exemptions and concessions, implementing a mechanism for automatically linking retail petroleum prices to costs, and extending agricultural taxation. Another essential step is to redesign federal-provincial revenue sharing arrangements so as to protect the federal and consolidated budgets in light of the ongoing shift in revenues from import duties to the GST and to provide an incentive to provinces to mobilize their own revenues. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public23 Attention must also be given to reducing,unproductive expenditure and raising budgetary outlays for high priority CIP projects and SAP. In the area of monetarv reforms, the authorities have removed the ceiling on banks' rates of return, eliminated the credit-to-deposit ratio, expanded the use of indirect monetary instruments, reduced the subsidy element in concessional credit schemes, and started to improve prudential bank supervision. Nevertheless, the authorities should accelerate their efforts to phase out mandatory and concessional credit schemes and to strengthen bank supervision. Moreover, they should proceed promptly with the privatization of the remaining nationalized banks. Pakistan maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Since the acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, with effect from July 1, 1994, the remaining exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice have been eliminated. The authorities settled outstanding balances under a bilateral payment agreement with a member, which expired at end- 1994. After the elimination of the forward foreign exchange cover operations (except for foreign currency accounts) of the SBP in June 1994, the increase in the SBP's forward cover fee in the course of 1994/95, and the maturing in May 1995 of the forward cover contracts on foreign currency accounts that existed at the time of adoption of Article VIII status, there is no multiple currency practice arising from an ex-ante loss on these contracts. The staff has received good cooperation from the authorities in providing data which are of sufficient coverage, quality. frequency, and timeliness for assessing economic developments and forming a perspective on medium-term prospects. A few deficiencies can be removed by improving parts of the statistical infrastructure, most notably in the areas of government finance statistics and national income accounts. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Pakistan be held on the standard twelve-month cycle.

The Middle Eastern Department stationed a staff member at the State Bank of Pakistan for a three-month period, beginning in February 1994, to assist in strengthening the macroeconomic framework for liquidity programming. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 APPENDIX II b. The Fiscal Affairs Dewrtment provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance on the implementation of a General Sales Tax (February, July, September, and November 1989, January/February and March 1990, and April 1991) and on expenditure control and monitoring (April 1990). A diagnostic mission on tax policy and administration visited Pakistan in September/October 1991 and submitted its recommendations to the Pakistan authorities in January 1992. A mission on the broadening of the General Sales Tax visited Pakistan in October 1993; follow-up missions visited Pakistan in July 1994 and in July 1995 to assist in the operational aspects of the GST broadening. In May 1995 a technical assistance mission made recommendations for the reform of the social safety net system. FAD provided technical assistance at headquarters for Pakistani officials on tax exemptions and concessions. In November 1995, two technical assistance missions assisted the authorities in drafting a new GST law and in estimating the revenue impact of broadening the base of the GST. A tax advisor to the Ministry of Finance was assigned for a period of nine months starting in March 1995. c. The Monetarv and Exchawe Affairs Deuartment provided technical assistance to the State Bank of Pakistan on the Bank's reorganization and on public debt management (June/July 1989). In addition, an MAE expert was in the field during March 1990-February 1992 to assist the authorities in developing an action plan for improving public debt management and instituting a system for auctioning government securities. In December 1992, a technical assistance mission on the transition to indirect monetary control visited Pakistan. In July 1994, MAE conducted a workshop on supervision and regulation of financial institutions at the State Bank of Pakistan. In September 1995, a technical assistance mission helped establish a detailed action plan for strengthening bank supervision activities. An advisor in monetary analysis and research was assigned for one year starting January 1995. d. A multitopic technical assistance mission of the Statistics Department--on monetary, balance of payments, national accounts and price statistics--visited Pakistan in November 1992. Two follow-up missions in February 1993 and in May/June 1995 assisted in designing a plan for implementation of the recommendations of this mission on the compilation of monetary statistics. The Statistics Department has also provided technical assistance to the State Bank of Pakistan on monetary statistics and bank reporting and to the Ministry of Finance on expenditure control and monitoring and on public finance statistics (January 1989). Earlier Statistics Department work included assistance to the State Bank of Pakistan on price index methodologies (July 1983) and on balance of payments statistics (December 1983 and August: 1984). e. The Leeal Department provided technical assistance to the State Bank of Pakistan in reviewing the existing banking legislation with a view to proposing changes in the context of the undergoing reform of the financial sector and international practice (August 1992). In November 1995, a technical assistance mission helped in drafting the GST law. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - APPENDIX II f.

Of these amounts, lJS$1,565.5 million has been repaid and US$2,798.1 million remained undisbursed as of September 30. 1995. Disbursement performance has improved over the past two years, helping to reduce undisbursed balances from very high levels in the 1980s and early 1990s. Since 1958, IFC has made commitments in Pakistan totalling USS805.6 million, of which USS223.1 has been repaid, sold, terminated or canceled. Of the balance of USS582.5 million, US$512.11 represents loans and USS70.39 million equity. As of end-August 1995. Pakistan accounted for about 6.3 percent of IFC's investment portfolio, making it one of the Corporation's largest clients. MIGA has been active in Pakistan since 1991. As of June 30, 1995, Pakistan accounted for approximately 10 percent of MIGA's portfolio with a total of fifteen contracts of guarantee for a maximum of USS158.9. IBRD and IDA assistance to Pakistan steadily increased over the last decade, with average annual commitments growing from about US$225 million in the early 1980s to US$640 million during FY 1985-1987. During the period FY 1988-91, the annual average commitment level increased to about US$730 million, owing largely to substantial adjustment lending in support of the Government's reform program. In FY 1992 and FY 1993, new commitments slowed to about US$400 per annum, reflecting mainly delays in reaching agreement on new adjustment lending and slow progress in finalizing a large power development loan. New commitments in FY 1994 and FY 1995 averaged US$722 million. The composition of IBRD/IDA lending has shifted significantly in recent years, reflecting the emphasis on human resource development. In FY 1980-1988, 70 percent of total commitments went to agriculture (including irrigation) and infrastructure (mainly energy). Industry followed with 17 percent, and the social and urban sectors each accounted for 6 percent. Over the last four years, by contrast. commitments to the social sectors have averaged 27 percent. Commitments to agriculture have fallen to 8.5 percent and those to infrastructure (including energy) to 30 percent. The more market-friendly reforms pursued by the Government over the past few years have allowed IFC to increase significantly its investment commitments and participate in a more diversified range of activities. IFC- financed projects have been in textiles, cement and construction, tourism, timber, pulp and paper, oil and gas, chemicals, petrochemicals, fertilizers, infrastructure, and capital markets. With regard to MIGA's activities, 1/ Prepared by World Bank staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 31 - APPENDIX III guarantees have bee" issued for projects in the banking, telecommunication and manufacturing sectors. ProPram focus The overriding objective of the Bank Group's assistance strategy is to help Pakistan reduce poverty so that people see improvements in their living standards quickly and permanently. To do this effectively, the Bank Group is working with the Government to more fully involve communities, the private sector, and Pakistani NGOs in all Bank Group services. Partnership with these groups is necessary for both the Bank Group and the Government to deliver results on the ground faster. This is the case in three strategic areas of development on which the Bank Group is focusing its assistance strategy: improving the delivery of core social services; maintaining macroeconomic stability and creating fiscal space for development spending by completing fiscal adjustment; and establishing a competitive enabling environment for the private sector. Successful implementation of the program calls for a strategic alliance among IBRD/IDA, IFC and MIGA. IBRD and IDA will focus their assistance strategy on public policy, institutions, and critical public investments for private-sector-led growth. IFC will focus its investment strategy on pushing the frontier for private investment and leading the supply response to the enabling environment. In addition to opening up new sectors to private investment, it will continue to provide opportunities for public- private dialogue on reforms to improve the enabling environment. MIGA's insurance coverage for the political risks faced by private investors into Pakistan will complement the Bank's and IFC's assistance to the private sector, as it has already done for banking and infrastructure investors. Sustaining the SAP to expand access and improve the deliverv of core social services The Bank Group's strategy for improving the delivery of core social services enters around the Government's Social Action Program (SAP) under which four basic services--elementary education, primary health care, population/family planning, and rural water and sanitation--are targeted. The Bank Group's support for the SAP and related social sector projects emphasizes improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of service provision while further expanding access, particularly for women. To that end, Bank Group assistance is being used to increase the participation of people in designing, implementing, and monitoring programs that improve their lives quickly, jncreasingly through NGOs and the private sector. IDA, in collaboration with the donor community is assisting the Government to prepare a second umbrella project to support the SAP. It will focus on the following key policy, programming, and implementation changes: the provincial annual operational plans, and putting I." place st:::grefining . . implementation and monitoring systems; (ii) reorienting staff rules toward performance and need; (iii) provision of adequate resources for materials and supplies; (iv) implementing policy changes in curriculum development and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX III textbook production; (v) getting closer to clients by devolving some provincial functions in primary education and health to responsive local governments, and expanding beneficiary participation; and (vi) expanding government collaboration with NGOs and community-based organizations to broaden service delivery and to raise its quality. IFC is considering complementary investments in private schools and health facilities. IDA's financial assistance for the SAP includes not only the umbrella projects, but also complementary projects in education, health and population, end nutrition. These projects are needed to create sustainable institutions, address specific bottlenecks and constraints in each of these sectors, and further expand access. IDA plans to make more active use of the sector investment approach employed in its support of the SAP. Financing a time-slice of sector programs--with agreement on annual operational plans that specify critical policy reforms and actions--is promising to be'an effective way to address the key changes needed to improve the delivery and quality of social services, while raising the efficiency of increasingly scarce concessional aid through stronger donor collaboration. Assisting the comoletion of fiscal adiustment To help Pakistan create the much larger fiscal space it needs to undertake development-related spending without excessive borrowing, IBRD/IDA--in collaboration with the IMF--is maintaining an active dialogue and outreach on fiscal reform and public expenditure restructuring. IBRD/IDA will respond quickly to requests from the Government for technical assistance atid advisory services, providing short policy notes on pressing economic management issues and organizational support for seminars to build constituencies for fiscal reform. IBRD/IDA will also continue the annual review of the public investment program--including the Core Development Program and SAP resource needs-- gradually expanding the coverage to recurrent expenditures as well, in order to better inform the policy dialogue and public debate on expenditure restructuring. IBRD/IDA are also encouraging a stronger provincial resource mobilization effort and greater devolution of social and other public services to local governments, communities, and the private sector through studies on inter-governmental fiscal relations and provincial finances. Supporting a more competitive environment for private investment and accelerated growth The strategic alliance among IBRD, IFC, and MIGA is most evident in the Bank Group's supporc for private sector-led development in Pakistan. Pakistan has already advanced significantly ahead of other South Asian countries in the privatization of public enterprises. To further accelerate the process, IBRD is focusing on public policy interests surrounding privatization, e.g., providing advisers to the Privatization Commission under an Institutional Development Fund grant, helping to establish the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 33 regulatory framework needed to privatize PTC, and providing assistance for the privatization of two thermal power plants. IFC enters in on individual transactions, such as the privatization of the Faisalabad Distribution Area Electricity Board, for which it is the financial advisor. IBRD, IFC, and MIGA assistance for reducina infrastructure1 constraints also invokes each institution's comparative strength to enhance the Bank Group's impact. Having helped the Government establish the policy framework for private power investments, IBRD end IFC are now extending this assistance to other infrastructure subsectors, as in the implementation of the "open access" policy for private railway transportation of fuel oil to power stations, and the introduction of private participation in the water and sanitation subsector. Support of private energy projects will continue through IBRD guarantees and the Private Sector Energy Development Fund, IFC equity investments and "A" and "B" loans, and MIGA guarantees. The Hub thermal generation project--for private financing--was the first private infrastructure project supported by the IBRD in Pakistan. IBRD and IFC are currently jointly preparing two guarantee operations. for power and freight transport projects. IBRD and IFC will continue to provide assistance for needed policy reforms in infrastructure through lending to those subsectors that are expected to remain predominantly public sector (e.g., the proposed Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project), through policy dialogue (e.g., dissemination of Energy Options Study), end other nonlending services (e.g. I IFC technical assistance on development of oil, gas, and mining activities). To foster a competitive environment, IBRD and IFC have combined their respective expertise to identify the required trade, regulatory. judicial, and governance reforms through the joint production of the Private Sector Assessment. The Bank Group plans broad dissemination of this report throughout Pakistan. Should the Government request, assistance would be offered to strengthen existing judicial institutions, beginning with a workshop on judicial reform. IBRD would also consider adjustment lending to support other reforms identified in the Private Sector Assessment, in the event that an accelerated pace of reforms is adopted by the Government. As was done in 1994 and 1995, IBRD end IFC will continue to facilitate private sector seminars to foster an exchange of views between the Government and investors on major deterrents to private investment. IBRD, IFC, and MIGA are also joining forces to increase investment finance with assistance for improving financial intermediation. IBRD will continue to provide support for a range of prudential policy reforms and institution-building through implementation of the Financial Sector Deepening and Intermediation Project approved in FY 1995. Having encouraged the removal of regulatory obstacles to the development of a corporate bond market, for example, IFC is now working to broaden financial instruments available to private businesses and introduce new financial institutions (e.g.. credit rating agencies) to improve the functioning of securities markets. MIGA is, at the same time, providing insurance coverage for private financial institutions. IFC also expects to establish the first Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX III private life insurance company, and to introduce Pakistani companies into international financial markets. IBRD and IFC plan to work together on improving financial intermediation for small-scale and "micro" enterprises using NGOs. To further improve the industrial sector's capacity to meet higher quality standards in both domestic and international markets, IBRD and IFC plan to provide support for institutional strenethening of Pakistan's technology institutions. A proposed IBRD-financed Technology Development Project will implement policies to transform publicly funded technology institutions into independent, client-oriented centers deriving the major portion of their income from the provision of services to private firms. The project would also support changes in the legal and regulatory framework to permit venture capital financing of local entrepreneurs. IFC is actively exploring an investment in a venture capital company that is being formed to take advantage of the opportunities that these changes will create. The Bank Group's initiatives to build a competitive business environment and improve financial intermediation will also target agricultural producers. Getting government out and putting farmers in charge are expected to have a big payoff in raisine aaricultural productivity. To halt the serious deterioration of the irrigation and drainage system that underpins Pakistan's agriculture, IBRD/IDA is working closely with the Government to give more responsibility to farmers to manage water resources and collect fees. These reforms are part of the new national drainage program that IBRD/IDA will be supporting. IDA is also supporting community-owned and operated minor irrigation schemes and forestry protection initiatives in parts of the country. To promote agricultural diversification, the focus of the Bank Group's dialogue with the Government is on liberalizing output and input markets and orienting research and extension to producers‘ needs. New commitments bv the Bank Grow The Bank Group is using the current fiscal year to monitor the Government's progress towards resumption of an accelerated pace of macroeconomic and structural reforms. If the Government is seen to be taking concrete action to keep the macroeconomic situation in check, if it sticks to its fiscal targets, and does not backtrack on reforms already implemented, Bank Group assistance levels are expected to remain relatively stable. A serious deterioration in the macroeconomic situation would be accompanied by a reduction in IBRD, IDA, and IFC assistance; MIGA can be expected to do the same given the likely adverse impact on demand for insurance coverage in Pakistan. New IBRD and IDA commitments (including guarantees) for FY 1996-1998 would likely fall within range to US$1.50-2.25 billion, depending on the pace and depth of structural reforms. IBRD guarantees will be extended if Pakistan remains creditworthy for IBRD lending. E's expected net approval volume in FY 1996 would approach $180-200 million. IFC plans to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - APPENDIX III significantly contract its assistance in.FY 1997 if Pakistan does not resume an accelerated pace of reform. m's assistance is not easily projected, since it depends both on private investors' view of the political and investment climate in Pakistan, and on capacity constraints.

Some of these areas are being addressed with technical assistance from the Fund and other organizations. The authorities provide timely data with good periodicity, mainly through the resident representative's office. a. Real sector The current methodology of compiling national accounts extrapolates certain components of GDP using a variety of indicators and data sources that have limited coverage. These deficiencies are being addressed through the project on the Improvement of National Account Statistics in Pakistan (INAS) sponsored by the Dutch Government. In this context, the authorities undertook a series of surveys of institutional sectors in the economy, including surveys of households and enterprises. However, it is not clear how the results of these surveys have affected the compilation of the national accounts. Wholesale and consumer price indices, trade values and volumes all use a base year of 1980/81. The CPI is also being produced with base year 1990/91 though this index was not published until recently. The Federal Bureau of Statistics produces three price indices: CPI, UP1 and a sensitive price indicator (SPI). The SPI is compiled on a weekly basis, based on 46 essential commodities for the lowest income group. The weights for the 46 items are the same as in the CPI. The CPI is based on the survey "Family Budget Survey." This survey was conducted in 1991 to develop the new base for the CPI subsequent to which the basket of goods and services covered in the CPI was also revised. Data on wages and employment are not reported b. Government finance The authorities have reported revised data for 1993 and 1994 and new data for 1995, which will be published in the 1995 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. A summary of these data are also published in IFS. These data cover the activities of the Central Government only, and no data is being provided on the operations of the provincial and local governments. In addition the reported data continue to suffer from some deficiencies, including unreliable information on grants, lack of information on functional classification of central government public expenditures, and lack of details on domestic financing of the Federal Government's budget deficit.

Monetary accounts The use of disparate and multiple sources of information for monetary data and the lack of a coherent framework for sectorization and instrument classification creates the potential for inconsistent definitions, thereby impairing the usefulness of the data for monetary analysis. The February 1993 money and banking statistics mission recommended the introduction of a new consolidated balance sheet for the State Bank of Pakistan to coincide with the introduction of the new monthly call report forms for banks. The May/June 1995 money and banking statistics mission evaluated the implementation of the new data collection system and found that, due to an insufficient number of personal computers, the Statistics Department of the State Bank of Pakistan had stopped using the new data to produce the monetary survey in July 1994. As a result, and because of the better quality of the monetary statistics that can be produced from the new monthly reporting system, the mission recommended that priority should be given to processing the monthly returns to improve the monetary survey and bring it up to date. It is expected that the authorities will soon begin reporting monetary data compiled from the new monthly reports of banks. d. External sector The authorities' reporting of balance of payments data is generally satisfactory. The main shortcoming is, however, the timeliness of data reporting on capital flows, including both official assistance and private investment flows (other than flows to foreign currency accounts), for which data reporting with a timelag of less than a month would be desirable.
