Neuhaus (Head), Tweedie, Lewis, Caetano, and Levy Yeyati (all WHD), Mr. May and Ms. Castro (World Bank), and Ms. Henriquez (Assistant-PDR) held the 1995 Article IV consultation discus- sions in Bogota during November 13-20, 1995. The mission met with the Minister of Finance, the Director of Planning, the General Manager and Directors of the Banco de la Republica, and other senior officials. Mr. Calderon, Alternate Executive Director, participated in the discussions. At the conclusion of the last consultation on January 11, 1995 (EBM/95/3), Directors saw the persistence of inflation in the 20-30 percent range as posing an important challenge, and noted that macroeconomic balance over the medium term called for checking the growth of public expenditure and implementing the fiscal decentralization program in a timely fashion. II. Recent Developments Box 1. Background Colombia has a record of sound economic management which helped sustain real GDP growth at 4.5 percent a year on average since 1970. However, inflation has remained in the 2@30 percent range, partly reflecting widespread informal indexation (Chart 1). The Gaviria Administration (1990-94) imple mented important reforms to liberalize the trade and financial systems, rationalize public sector opera- tions, increase labor market flexibility, and strengthen central bank autonomy (see background paper for the 1994 Article IV consultation-SM/94/312). Higher public spending on infrastructure, security, and the social sectors was financed largely through increased tax revenues, and near fiscal balance was maintained while external public indebtedness was reduced from 37 percent of GDP in 1990 to 21 Percent of GDP in 1994. However, difficult challenges remained to be addressed, including the persistence of inflation, large regional and socioeconomic income disparities, serious gaps in infrastructure, and an unsettled security situation. Output growth averaged 5 percent a year in 1992-94 (Table 1 and Chart 2), buoyed by the disman- tling of trade restrictions, large oil discoveries, and higher coffee export prices in 1994. Inflation fell from 32 percent in 1990 to 22 112 percent in 1993--reflecting the combined effects of a policy tightening at the beginning of the period, trade liberalization, and a real appreciation of the peso. However, inflation leveled off in 1994 and little progress was made in dismantling wage indexation. The external current account shifted from a surplus in 1990-92 to a deficit of 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 as imports increased on average by 34 percent a year during 1992-94, and private transfer receipts declined. However, positive interest rate differentials and increased investor confidence attracted large private capital inflows, despite the imposition in 1993 of an unremunerated deposit requirement on nonconces- sional foreign borrowing (the requirement was extended in 1994 to cover loans of up to five years’ maturity). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2 - The Samper Administration that took office in August 1994 indicated its intention to increase public spending on the social sectors and infrastruc- ture, maintain competitiveness, and promote employment growth. These objectives were incorporated in the Development Plan for 1995-98, which also seeks to reduce inflation to 10 percent by 1998, bolster private savings, and consolidate the earlier structural reforms. For 1995, the Government aimed at an inflation rate of 18 percent, a moderate gain in international reserves, and output growth of 5.5-6 percent. To achieve these objectives, a target of fiscal balance or a small surplus was established, and a firmer monetary policy adopted in the second half of 1994 was to be main- tained. lJ To help achieve the inflation target and encourage more forward-looking wage and price setting behavior, the Government sponsored a social pact in early 1995 premised on voluntary wage restraint and limited increases in administered prices. 2J Inflation slowed from 22.6 percent in 1994 to 20.1 percent by November 1995, and is likely to end the year slightly below 20 percent. However, the decline mainly reflected slower public tariff and food price increases---the Central Bank's measure of "basic inflation," which excludes these items, shows an increase of 22 percent through November. Moreover, partial data suggest that wage settlements were lower on average than in 1994 but still above the level that would have been consistent with the inflation target. Indicators for the first three quarters of 1995 suggest that output growth declined from 5.7 percent in 1994 to 5.3 percent in 1995, reflecting a slowdown of private consumption and investment spending in response to the monetary tightening in late 1994, rising household indebtedness, and the added restrictions on foreign borrowing (as discussed below, public spending continued to grow rapidly). The unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent in September 1995 from 7.6 percent a year earlier, as activity in the labor- intensive residential construction sector fell after three years of strong growth. The slowing in output was moderated by the coming onstream of the Cusiana oil field and the impact of favorable weather on farm production. IJ To curb demand pressures, the Central Bank raised the interest rate on open market bills by 8 percentage points in late 1994. w The schedule agreed previously with the World Bank for increasing power tariffs toward long-run marginal cost and reducing cross-subsidization was postponed, and gasoline prices were to be maintained at about 15 percent below world prices.

Statistical Issues 0 Data covering the core areas generally are published on a timely basis and the authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund. However, there is a pressing need to improve information on local government finances and reduce reporting lags on other fiscal data both above and below the line. 0 Monetary survey data are subject to long reporting lags (latest sectorized data showing net credit to the nonfinancial public sector refer to March 1995). l This year the authorities began to produce quarterly balance of payments statistics and flash estimates of quarterly GDP. a The authorities have responded favorably to the Fund’s proposal to implement standards for members’ publication of economic and financial data. See Appendix II for a more detailed discussion of the mission’s findings. Colombia did not suffer a major fallout from the Mexican crisis in early 1995 because economic fundamentals were strong, monetary policy was relatively tight, and the Government--which does not have significant short- term external debt--met its financing needs by drawing down deposits held abroad. However, recent business opinion surveys suggest that investor confidence has slackened, in part because of a domestic political crisis that emerged in July over allegations of illegal contributions to the 1994 presidential campaign. Stock market prices in Bogot& fell by 21 percent in U.S. dollar terms between July and mid-December 1995, and the peso has moved close 'to the more depreciated end of the exchange rate band--following a real effective depreciation of 8 percent during the first ten months of 1995 (Chart 3). The external current account deficit widened as anticipated in 199.5 to 5 l/4 percent of GDP (compared with 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994), in spite of the postponement of some large import-intensive projects in the energy sector. The trade deficit was little changed in relation to GDP, as con- tinued strong import growth (20 percent in U.S. dollar terms) offset a sharp rise in oil and nontraditional exports, while coffee receipts were flat. However, the deficit in the services account widened, in part reflecting an increase in earnings reinvested abroad by oil companies. Private financing was lower than anticipated, owing to the postponement of investments in the energy sector, confidence factors and the restrictions on external borrowing, but public capital inflows increased markedly as the Government drew down deposits held abroad. A small net international reserve gain (US$150-200 million) is estimated for 1995, notwithstanding significant central bank intervention to support the peso during the latter part of the year. Underlying the slower than envisaged reduction of inflation and weakening of the external accounts in 1995 were a deterioration in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- fiscal position and a relaxation of monetary policy in the second half of the year (Tables 2, 3, and 4, and Chart 4),. A nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) deficit of close to 1 percent of GDP is estimated for 1995, owing to a shortfall in income tax collections, continued growth in public spending (more than 30 percent in nominal terms), and a weakening in the finances of the National Coffee Fund (FONCAFE). u The Government announced modest spending cuts in June but these were insufficient to compensate for the above-mentioned deviations from the fiscal program. The cuts were part of an agreement with the Central Bank to lower interest rates by some 5 per- centage points, including through a reduction of yields and shortening the maturity of open market paper, and the imposition of temporary caps on lending interest rates (lifted in August). Reflecting the easier policy stance, the interbank rate subsequently remained close to the lower end of the official target range (15-45 percent) for several months. The disper- sion of reserve requirements also was reduced in 1995, through the introduc- tion of a marginal requirement in May and a further narrowing in the range of ratios in June and December (the latter included a phased increase in requirements on time deposits to be implemented in the first quarter of 1996). Growth in the money and credit aggregates slowed somewhat in 1995; broad money and credit growth remained strong in real terms and there was a further shift away from narrow money balances (Ml) toward quasi-money--a trend evident since 1994. u III. Policy Discussions Notwithstanding some deviations from their original program, the authorities expressed broad satisfaction with the outcome for 1995. They noted that inflation had fallen by close to 3 percentage points and that, in contrast to previous years, this had been achieved without an appreciation of the currency in real terms. They considered that the lagged effects of tighter financial policies in late 1994 had helped curtail excess demand. They noted that growth in 1995 was based on a more sustainable balance between the tradable and nontradable goods sectors than in the previous two years. In this connection, they expected the real effective depreciation of the peso in 1995 to help achieve balanced growth in the period ahead. For 1996, the authorities have announced an inflation target of 17 percent, with output growth of 4.5-5 percent. While specific policies to achieve these L/ Beyond the financing costs of higher inventories under the retention agreement among producing nations (which called for a 10 percent reduction in export volumes during the year ending July 1996), FONCAFE's outlays were increased by an assistance package for farmers in May, and the decision in September to suspend the formula for adjusting domestic producer prices in line with world prices (notwithstanding a sharp drop in export prices during the ‘second half of 1995). u Private Ml growth slowed to around IL7 percent in 1995 (Table 3). The official Ml series reported by the Centra'l Bank shows a more marked deceleration because it includes public sector deposits (see Chart 2).

While cautioning that the fall in reported inflation in 1995 may overstate the decline in underlying price pressures, the staff agreed that growth performance had been satisfactory-- taking account of the domestic political crisis and uncertainties associated with developments elsewhere in the region. Moreover, it welcomed the authorities' efforts to pass key tax and other legislation (see below) and considered that prospects for con- tinued robust growth in the medium term remained favorable. However, the staff considered the credit policy easing in mid-1995 premature in view of the deviations from the fiscal program, the failure to achieve the inflation target, and the widening in the external current account deficit. Moreover, it questioned the adequacy of policies to achieve the official targets for 1996, and noted that vigilance would be needed to ensure that the lagged effect of the easing in financial policies and the currency depreciation during the second half of 1995--combined with the one-time effects on the price level of tax increases and public tariff adjustments in early 1996-- did not reignite inflationary pressures. Against this background, discus- sions focused on policies required to achieve a further significant reduction in inflation, bolster the external position, and enhance medium- term growth performance. 1. Fiscal policy Official projections currently point to a further increase in the NFPS deficit (excluding privatization receipts) to 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1996. The central government deficit would increase from about 3 percent of GDP in 1995 to close to 4 percent in 1996, but would be partly offset by surpluses in the rest of the public sector--primarily the social security sector. Public spending would slow slightly in nominal terms but would increase further in relation to GDP; central government outlays would rise by 17 per- cent in real terms, including an increase in the wage bill on account of real adjustments agreed for teachers, health care workers, and the military. These projections incorporate the effects of a tax reform package approved in December 1995 that includes a temporary increase in the VAT rate from 14 to 16 percent (to be reduced to 15 percent in 1998), a reduction in the maximum income tax rate from 37.5 to 35 percent, a new presumptive tax on gross assets, and other measures to close loopholes and reduce evasion. The authorities estimate the yield from the reform at about 1 percent of GDP in 1996, and 1 l/2 percent of GDP in subsequent years. Efforts are also underway to strengthen tax administration, including separation of customs and inland revenue functions within the tax department, improved information systems, and nation-wide campaigns against tax evasion and smuggling. The staff expressed concern that continued rapid growth in public spending would strain domestic resources and make it difficult to achieve the inflation target. Also, the yield from the tax reform was uncertain, as almost half of the increase in collections in 1996 was to result from a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - reduction in evasion, despite limited success to date. The staff noted tlhat there was also a danger of slippages in local governments, whose finances may be weaker than suggested by official estimates, 1/ as well as in FONCAFE, given the suspension of the formula for adjusting coffee producer prices in line with world prices. Moreover, data problems preclude a cle.ar assessment of the fiscal implications of t'he 1994 social security reform, including whether (i) the cash surplus in the public pension scheme signals growing long,-term imbalances associated with unfunded obligations; and (ii) current contribution rates cover the cost of increased health care benefits. To improve prospects for reducing inflation and taking account of the risks underlying the fiscal outlook, the staff recommended targeting fiscal equilibrium or a small surplus for 1996, implying a significantly tighter stance than currently envisaged. A more prudent fiscal position would ease the burden on monetary policy, avoid crowding out the private sector, and bolster the external accounts. The approach recommended by the staff, which was endorsed by the World Bank, would protect social spending but seek savings in nonessential current outlays (including by devolving spending responsibilities to local governments and avoiding duplication), and target a more moderate and selective increase in capital outlays. The staff also urged the authorities to adjust gasoline prices and power and telephone tariffs to economic levels, and lower coffee producer prices in line with export prices. The authorities were. reluctant to implement additional spending cuts at this stage, given the expectation of higher spending created under the Development Plan u and concerns that fiscal tightening could have adverse short-term output consequences; they added that internal security problems precluded significant expenditure cuts in that area. The authorities shared the staff's worries about the weakening in control associated with the fis- cal decentralization, but indicated that progress in this area would require congressional approval of changes to the revenue sharing legislation that they plan to introduce in 1996, taking account of FAD and World Bank recom- mendations. s/ Provisioning requirements on loans to local governments were increased in 1995, and draft legislation tightening limits on local government borrowing is before Congress. Also, the Government plans to J.f No reliable data exist on local government finances in recent years (Appendix II). Official projections assume that the local government sector is in balance for 1995-96, though the authorities estimated a deficit for the sector of 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994. 2/ The Plan envisaged an increase in social spending from 9 percent of GDP in 1991-94 to 14 percent in 1995-98, but the authorities scaled down the 1996 investment budget for the Central Government by close to 1 percent of GDP bwing to lower projected revenues. 3J An independent commission formed in August to study the rationaliza- tion of public spending is to make recommendation3 shortly on transfer3 to local governments.

The authorities said they plan to increase electricity tariffs in real terms in 1996 to reduce subsidies, and that they will explore the scope for catch-up adjustment3 in gasoline prices. The authorities anticipate asset sales in 1996 of close to 1 percent of GDP, including Banco Popular, some power plants, and concessions to operate domestic long distance telephone services. They have sent to Congress a draft privatization law to facilitate the sale of shares held by the public sector, and also plan to consolidate the Government's phased return to international capital markets initiated in 1995. Total external public debt outstanding would be broadly maintained in constant dollar terms (after a modest increase in 1996), with a gradual reduction in the share of multi- lateral and commercial bank debt in favor of more international bond place- ments. In September 1995, Moody's upgraded Colombia's rating to investment grade in line with Standard and Poor's, increasing the scope for market diversification and enhancing access to institutional investors. 2. Incomes nolicv The authorities plan to continue the social pact in 1996. They con- sider that the pact helped improve industrial relations and moderate wage and price increases in 1995, though they acknowledged that its main direct contribution to price restraint had come from slower increases in public tariffs. Moreover, the available data on collective wage contracts does not suggest any breakthrough in terms of reducing the pervasive backward-looking wage indexation. To enhance the effectiveness of the pact, it would be important that the Government achieve its inflation target in 1996, while fiscal and efficiency considerations would preclude continued reliance on slower public tariff increases. In the staff's view, these argument3 strengthen the case for adopting a tighter macroeconomic stance in 1996. Subsequent to the mission, it was decided to increase minimum wages by 19.5 percent in 1996, compared with 20.5 percent in 1995. 3. Monetary policy The Banco de la Republica (the central bank) has been using narrow money (Ml) as its intermediate monetary target, while also setting guide- lines for broad money and credit. As noted, movement3 in Ml were affected in 1995 by the fall in public sector demand deposits and the ongoing shift in private money demand toward quasi-money. In view of these changes, the staff recommended monitoring a broad range of variables to gauge the stance of monetary policy, and noted that most indicators--low and stable overnight rates, a positively sloped yield curve, the recent exchange rate weakening, and continued high nominal growth rate3 for broad money and credit--sug- gested that monetary condition3 were relatively loose during the second half of 1995. Given normal monetary policy lags, an early tightening of policy was key to facilitating the targeted reduction of inflation in 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - Government officials did not share the staff's view that monetary con- ditions had been relaxed. They pointed to past volatility in the interbank rate as reducing its usefulness as an indicator of the stance of monetary policy, and noted that deposit and lending rates remained significantly positive in real terms and that nominal money and credit growth rates had declined. In their preliminary program for 1996, the monetary authorities adopted a target for Ml growth of 18 percent in the context of a forecast for growth of financial system liabilities to the private sector of 25 per- cent (29 percent in 1995). They viewed the monetary program as consistent with the higher public sector borrowing requirement, a slowdown in private sector credit growth from 37 percent in 1995 to 29 percent in 1996, and a US$300 million gain in net international reserves. The program parameters will be kept under review during 1996 and adj'usted as needed to achieve the inflation target. In this connection, however, they noted that there were limits to the scope for tightening monetary conditions given the Govern- ment's concerns over the potential fallout on activity. l.J Also, there was a concern about proposals that were made by the Government in mid-1995 to reduce central bank autonomy, although no actions in that direction have been taken so far. Subsequent to the mission, the Central Bank tightened liquidity somewhat and the peso strengthened from the most depreciated end of the band. 4. External sector policies The authorities forecast a widening in the external current account deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1996: export growth would slow, with declining world prices for coffee, while a further strong increase in capital goods imports was projected. The current account deficit would be financed largely by higher direct investment in the energy sector and inf-ra- structure and net official foreign borrowing. The staff supported the authorities' intention to maintain the current exchange rate band, L?/ which provided some flexibility for the determination of the rate consistent with the inflation target. However, the staff stressed that some real appreciation of the peso in 1996 (within the current band) might be unavoid- able, especially if the fiscal stance is not tightened. It recommended that in the first instance, financial policies be adjusted so as to facilitate a gradual return of the peso to the midpoint of the band. The authorities indicated that there are no immediate plans to eliminate the restrictions on external borrowing, though they may consider at some point a reduction in the maximum maturity of loans subject to the restrictions. I/ The monetary authorities also noted that the potential adverse impact of tighter policies on the health of the financial system would need to be kept under review. Nonperforming loans had increased significantly during 1995, particularly for consumer credit, but the authorities considered that they remain at an acceptable level (about 6 percent of total loans). L?/ The band has a slope of 13.6 percent (measured against the U.S. dollar) and a width of 14 percentage points.

They felt that member- ship in the WTO and commitment to the Andean Pact common external tariff (CET) had helped them resist protectionist demands from certain groups during 1995, though safeguard measures against rice and sugar imports from Venezuela had been implemented. New anti-dumping regulations are being prepared, following a WTO request for changes in regulations governing safeguards- -including more time for documenting cases and less scope for agricultural safeguards. Colombia has sought Andean Pact approval for a gradual phase-out of tariff exemptions on intermediate and capital goods imported by producers of nontraditional exports, in line with the four-year period for removing exemptions to the CET. Colombia continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, and maintains multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to approval under Article VIII, resulting from taxes on remittances of profits from direct investment in Colombia and on inflows of foreign exchange earn- ings from personal services and transfers, as well as the issuance of tax credit certificates for exports (CERTs); these practices have not been approved by the Fund. There are no immediate plans to dismantle the MCPs, but the recent tax reform reduced the profit remittance tax for the oil sector from 15 percent to 7 percent (in line with that applying to non-oil investments in 1996), and lowered the withholding tax rate on inflows of service receipts and transfers from 10 percent to 3 percent. The policy on CERTs is to reduce the rates to a level roughly equivalent to the duty draw- back costs by 2003- -the WTO's deadline for elimination of export subsidies. Box 3. Poverty and Environmental Issues A macroeconomicpolicyconduciveto sustainedgrowth will bekeyto poverty alleviation. While Colombia has made significantprogressin improving socialindicators overthe past20 years,it still has a considerable unfinished social agenda with large regional and socioeconomic gaps. The World Bank esti- mates that incomes of one fifth of the Population are insufficient to cover basic food needs, and infant mortality and schooling indicators remain very unsatisfactory in some regions. As noted, the Administra- tion has made social progress a priority, and the Development Plan proposes sharp increases in social spending, including through the Social Solidarity Network--a combination of measures ranging from subsi- dies for poor families to job creation. Also, the Constitution envisages a growing role for local govem- ments in providing social services. Notwithstanding its abundant natural resources and relatively low population density, Colombia faces serious and growing environmental problems. The Bank has identified deforestation, poor water management, and worsening urban pollution as priority issues. A Ministry of the Environment was created in 1993 with broad authority for pollution control, natural resource management, and environ- mental assessments. One of the Ministry’s immediate priorities is to limit potential environmental damage from large projects, particularly in the oil sector, Air quality control legislation has been passed, and standards are planned for clean water and toxic waste disposal; pollution standards also are to be strengthened for automobiles and industry.

Medium-Term Outlook The Development Plan's goals are to reduce inflation to 10 percent by 1998 with continued robust output growth, despite significant central gov- ernment deficits that would be only partly offset by surpluses elsewhere in the public sector. The revised program for 1996 includes a less ambitious inflation target than in the Plan (17 percent rather than 15 percent), but as noted earlier, even this more modest goal may prove difficult to achieve under current policies. Taking account of slippages in performance to date, the staff has pre- pared a revised medium-term framework that envisages a reduction of infla- tion to 10 percent by 1999 (a year later than originally targeted by the authorities), though it urged the authorities to adhere to, and if possible advance, the original timetable for reducing inflation. Output growth is projected at an average of 5 percent a year during the period 1997-2001. Oil exports would peak in 2000, boosted by a sharp rise in production from the Cusiana fields (to 500,000 bpd by 1998) and the coming onstream of three newly discovered fields whose output would reach 300,000 bpd by 2001. Although the external current account deficit is projected to narrow grad- ually after 1996 as investment in the oil sector declines and production increases, deficits of close to 4 l/2 percent of GDP are still in prospect for the outer years, as it is assumed that total private sector investment would remain at high levels during the projection period. 1/ Gross for- eign reserves would decline in relation to imports of goods and services from five months in 1995 to just under four months by the end of the period, but would remain at adequate levels. The projections assume a considerable rise in public savings in 1997 from the official forecast on the strength of fiscal surpluses averaging close to 1 percent of GDP a year during 1997-2001. The fiscal projection3 assume that the Oil Stabilization Fund approved in 1995 (to smooth the absorption of revenues from recent oil discoveries) would aid importantly in bolstering public savings, 2/ and incorporate the additional yield from the tax reform and a more moderate real increase in public spending than currently envisaged. In the staff's view, targeting moderate fiscal sur- pluses in the period ahead is key to underpin the reduction in inflation and protect the external accounts, as well as to compensate for the JJ A sensitivity analysis suggests that the annual external current account would change by 0.2 percent of GDP on average during the period 1997-2001 in response to a 10 percent change in coffee export prices, or a 10 percent change in the world price of crude oil; a 1 percentage point increase in LIBOR would worsen the current account by an average of 0.3 per- cent of GDP a year. 2J In contrast, current official projections suggest that the savings of the Oil Stabilization Fund would be more than offset by deficits elsewhere in the public sector.

Although significant current account deficits are projected throughout the period, the staff considers them to be manageable given that the level of external debt is projected to remain relatively low, and provided the authorities continue to pursue macroeconomic and structural policies that make Colombia an attractive place for foreign investment, particularly direct investment. Nevertheless, failure to implement the recommended fiscal adjustment would make it difficult to achieve the inflation targets without crowding out the private sector. Alternatively, the persistence of stubbornly high inflation would increasingly distance Colombia from the inflation experience of other countries in the region; I/ and weaker policies also could jeopardize medium-term growth prospects. v. Staff Anpraisal The Administration that took office in August 1994 inherited a sound economy, buoyed by recent substantial oil discoveries. Important reforms had been implemented by previous governments, but difficult challenges were left to be addressed, including the persistence of moderate inflation; large regional and socioeconomic income disparities; serious gaps in infrastruc- ture; and an unsettled security situation. Also, in recent years public expenditure had been rising rapidly and private savings had been falling, perhaps because broader consumption and borrowing opportunities had opened up with the liberalization of the economy. The 1995-98 Development Plan aimed at preserving the gains from earlier reforms and securing a gradual decline in inflation, while increasing public outlays to alleviate social and infrastructure deficiencies. The rise in public spending was to be largely financed through higher tax and oil rev- enue, while a recent boom in private spending was expected to abate as a result of controls on external borrowing and tighter credit policies. The external current account deficit was expected to widen somewhat in the first two years of the Plan because of large investments in the oil sector, but to remain manageable without excessive reliance on short-term financing. In 1995, inflation likely will fall below 20 percent for the first time in many years, albeit by less than in the original program, while there will be a further rise in per capita income despite some deceleration of activ- ity, and a modest gain in foreign reserves. Also, notwithstanding the domestic political crisis, the Government was able to return to interna- tional bond markets and pass key pieces of legislation--notably, the tax reform and an Oil Stabilization Fund. l/ Projected inflation in Colombia at end-1995 will be higher than in several countries in the region that previously had experienced much higher inflation rates (see Chart 1). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - Nevertheless, it is a matter of concern that the authorities could not muster political support to compensate for the deviations from the fiscal program that emerged during the year or to maintain the firm monetary policy adopted in late 1994. The inflation rate was dampened in 1995 by one-time factors --lags in public tariff adjustments and a slowdown in food prices-- and despite the recent slowing in economic activity, inflation could rebound in 1996. It should also be noted that the external position weakened in 1995 despite the postponement of import-intensive investments in the energy sector. Colombia now faces a choice: it can build on recent progress and move more decisively to a low inflation environment that would enhance medium- term growth prospects and bolster investor confidence. Or it can opt for a weaker policy stance that is bound to be more expedient, but that could rekindle inflation or further erode the external accounts. In these circumstances, policies being developed for 1996, especially the fiscal stimulus that is in prospect despite the passage of a tax reform, carry significant risks. In particular, the Central Government may have difficulty financing its mounting deficit, while monetary policy would need to carry a heavy burden to attain the targeted decline in inflation to 17 percent--with adverse consequences for private sector activity. Hore- over, investor confidence could be affected, and access to international capital markets hindered, if the external accounts weaken unduly as a result of growing domestic imbalances. The staff thus urges the adoption of a stronger and more balanced policy mix than now appears to be in prospect. The fiscal stance, in particular, should aim at balance or a small surplus in 1996--with priority given to keeping government spending below authorized levels. This would hinge on securing economies in current outlays (especially on wages and in areas where local government expenditure is rising as a result of the revenue sharing formulas), and phasing in the envisaged growth in investment spending in a more gradual and selective manner. Of equal importance would be improving the finances of the National Coffee Fund (by realigning pro- ducer prices with export prices), and adjusting gasoline prices and utility tariffs to economic levels. Restraint in public spending also is needed over the medium term to protect the dividends from higher oil export revenues. To foster fiscal consolidation, every effort should be made to amend the formulas for revenue sharing and expedite the devolution of spending responsibilities to local governments. Moreover, it would be essential to deepen privatization, curtail the accumulation of unfunded social security obligations, and recon- cile the medium-term fiscal plans with the principle underlying the creation of the Oil Stabilization Fund, so that higher oil income effectively contri- butes to increasing public savings. The social pact has helped to moderate wage settlements somewhat in 1995, but it would be important to achieve greater progress toward Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - forward-looking settlements in 1996, with a view to breaking entrenched inflation expectations. To avoid overruns in collective bargaining and given the need for catch-up adjustments in public tariffs, the credibility of the official inflation target should be underpinned by stronger fiscal and credit policies, as noted earlier. Indications that the Central Bank has begun to tighten credit over the past several weeks are encouraging, and vigilance will be needed to avoid an easing in conditions next year. Indeed, the monetary authorities may need to tighten policy further, especially if fiscal policy is not strengthened to the degree recommended by the staff. The Government would be advised to refrain from any actions that could infringe on the Central Bank's autonomy in the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policy. The supervisory bodies also need to monitor developments closely and be prepared to tighten pruden- tial standards further if needed to forestall a deterioration in loan portfolios. The Central Bank's resolve to maintain the existing exchange rate band appears to be appropriate given the inflation target. To benefit from the flexibility inherent in the current system and reduce the risk of specula- tive attacks, financial policies should seek a gradual return of the cur- rency toward the midpoint of the band without jeopardizing the solid foreign reserve position. Meanwhile, a relaxation of restrictions on external indebtedness could be considered to ease pressures on domestic interest rates, so long as domestic savings are bolstered by stronger fiscal policies. Colombia continues'to maintain multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. While these practices are being reduced gradually, the authorities should take steps to remove the few that are remaining and accept the obligations of Article VIII. In the absence of a firm timetable for the elimination of multiple currency practices, approval of their retention by Colombia is not recommended. The staff recommends that Colombia's statistical database be upgraded without delay, so as to facilitate the design and monitoring of economic policies, and meet the more demanding standards expected from emerging market economies. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held within the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - Tab10 1.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: In January 1994, the Banco de la Republica (BR) adopted a managed float of the exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar within a 14 percentage point band. To limit foreign capital inflows, a 43-140 percent nonremunerated deposit at the BR is required for all foreign loans with a maturity of five years or less, except for loans to finance imports of capital goods, trade credits with a maturity of six months or less, credits to finance investment abroad, and credit cards. In August 1994 all foreign capital inflows for real estate purchases were prohibited. Multiple currency practices that result from taxes on profit remittances from direct investment in Colombia and on foreign exchange earnings from personal services and transfers, and export tax credit certificates (CERTs) have not been approved under Article VIII. At end-November, the Banco de la Republica's selling exchange rate was Co1$998 per U.S. dollar.

However, there are deficiencies that leave Colombia short of the standard that could be expected of emerging market economies in terms of timeliness and cov- erage. It would be particularly important to improve the ability to monitor the public sector borrowing requirement in a comprehensive and timely fashion, and reduce substantially the lags in producing "sectorized" data on monetary aggregates and credit to the private sector (i.e., excluding deposits of, and claims against, the nonfinancial public sector). Efforts since late 1994 to increase the frequency of data (e.g., with quarterly estimates of GDP and the balance of payments) are aimed at under- pinning the development of quarterly financial programming, which to date has been based only on annual data. 1. Real sector The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is developing quarterly GDP estimates that are expected to become available in 1996. Meanwhile, earlier this year the National Planning Department (DNP) began to produce flash estimates of quarterly GDP based on partial indicators, and the Central Bank (Banco de la Republica, BR) has begun to develop a set of current indicators of economic activity. The base year currently used for annual national income accounts in constant prices (1975) has become outdated and needs to be revised. 2. Financial sector statistics The BR publishes monthly data on the main monetary and credit aggre- gates with little delay. However, these data include liabilities and credit to the nonfinancial public sector, and therefore do not permit a timely monitoring of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) from below-the- line, nor of trends in private money demand and credit to the private sector. The sectorized financial data needed for this purpose had been produced through 1994 (albeit with a significant lag), but no data have been reported for periods since March 1995. The authorities have recently taken steps to reduce these lags.. The staff has also recommended that, to facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, the BR develop and report periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) indicators of liquidity in the financial system (excess reserves deposited at the BR plus holdings of open market paper with a short period to maturity). 3. Government finance statistics 'The staff has recommended that priority be given to the production of more complete, reliable and timely data on the financing of the nonfinancial public sector. The further development of quarterly balance of payments statistics should help improve the timeliness and comprehensiveness of data Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX II on external financing. In addition to the problems with the monetary data noted above, another area of weakness in the financing data relates to domestic bond financing, where systems need to be established to monitor secondary market transactions in government securities. Reliable data on local government finances are several years out of date. A central bank project to compile local government data for the period 1987-94 is nearing completion, but there remains a need to establish a system for the timely and continual monitoring of local government finances (from above- and below-the-line). Although more timely sectorized financial data would cover a significant part of local government financing, there still will be a need to monitor other data from below the line, including local government bond financing. There is a lack of data needed to monitor the effects of the ongoing reform of the social security sector, including trends in the number of contributors to the public pension scheme, as well as in the number of contributors and beneficiaries of the public health care system. Also, there is scope for improving the timeliness of information on social security finances within the public sector. 4. Balance of navments and external debt Since late 1994 the BR has been developing quarterly balance of payments data; initial results for 1994 and the first half of 1995 have become available in recent months. The aim is to produce quarterly estimates with a reporting lag of no more than three months. Efforts to compile quarterly data have resulted in improvements in the quality of the annual data, but there remains a need for more timely data on public external borrowing and debt service. The staff also has recommended the production of official data series on price and volume indices of merchandise trade.
