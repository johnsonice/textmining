Background In recent years, economic deregulation and a improved incentives have elicited a strong output and trade response, and established private sector confidence after an era of protective policies. However, trade liberalization coupled with an expansionary fiscal policy also contributed to large external current account deficits. Despite the recent progress, the exchange and payments system is still complex and segmented; foreign trade is regulated; most prices are set administratively; and the domestic banking system is constraining private sector activity. Moreover, oil production in Syria has peaked and the outlook for oil prices is not encouraging. Syria has also accumulated sizable external payments arrears, including those owed to the World Bank. Against this background, Syria is facing an uncertain external payments position over the medium term in the absence of a broader and intensified reform effort. 2. Policv discussions The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff on the key elements of an integrated reform program, but favored a more gradual approach in order to gauge market reaction as reforms proceed. The staff recommended an early unification of the exchange rates at a market-based rate. An immediate unification at the most depreciated official exchange rate would also constitute a credible effort, provided that the unified rate was moved to a market rate within a year. Parallel measures would include the liberalization of the trade and payment systems and the development of an active interbank foreign exchange market. Price reform would need to ensure that the exchange rate adjustments are fully reflected in prices to avoid the emergence of subsidies and financial losses for public sector enterprises; and that more price-setting autonomy is granted to public sector enterprises. Further reductions in the budget deficit would be required to achieve single-digit inflation rates and to support a stable market-based exchange rate. Revenue would benefit from the exchange rate unification and from the introduction of a broad-based sales tax, possibly preceded by a turnover tax. The incomes policy would need to be tightened and development expenditure would need to be scaled back. The success of the reform effort and the viability of the external payments position are contingent on continuation of external financial support. The authorities were urged to normalize financial relations with all creditors as soon as possible. Weaknesses in Syria’s statistical base constrain in-depth economic analysis and surveillance. Early action supported by Fund technical assistance is needed to remedy these shortcomings in order to develop an effective policy response to the emerging challenges.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with the Syrian Arab Republic were held in Damascus during December 2-13, 1995. l/ The mission met with H.E. Salim Yassin, Deputy Prime Minister; H.E. Mohammed Al-Imady, Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade; H.E. Khaled Al-Mahayni, Minister of Finance; and the Honorable Bashar Kabbarah, Governor of the Central Bank of Syria; as well as with other senior government officials and with representatives of the private sector. Mr. Shaalan, Executive Director, and Mr. Gaspard, Advisor, attended the policy meetings. In concluding the 1994 Article IV consultation (on March 13, 1995), Executive Directors welcomed the authorities' policy initiatives to expand the role of the private sector, relax controls and regulations, reduce subsidies, and improve the budgetary position through price adjustments. At the same time, they called for an acceleration of the pace and a broadening of the scope of reforms to stabilize and diversify the economy, and urged the authorities to unify the multiple exchange rates at a market-based level and tighten demand management. Directors also expressed concern about the persistence of sizable external payments arrears, especially those owed to the World Bank, and called for an early normalization of financial relations with all creditors. Syria continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangement under Article XIV. 2J Weaknesses in Syria's statistical base in terms of coverage, consistency, and periodicity continue to hamper in-depth economic analysis and effective surveillance. 3J II. Background and Recent Economic DeveloDments and Policies The Syrian economy is in transition; as such, it is important to place the recent developments and policies in a longer-term context. For many years, most aspects of economic activity in Syria--including pricing and production, distribution, and foreign trade --were dominated by the public sector, while various rules and regulations constrained the activities of a small, but dynamic private sector. These policies allowed progress in building a modern infrastructure and improving income distribution, but they also created widespread disincentives and distortions, holding back economic u The staff mission comprised Messrs. Nashashibi (Head), Bisat, Elhage, Erbas, and Sassanpour (all MED).

In the late 1980s the impact of economic distortions was compounded by the loss of traditional trade links with the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and by reduced levels of external financial support from regional sources. Economic growth slowed, underlying price pressures intensified, and external payments problems began to emerge. Moreover, with private sector imports being restricted and public sector imports constrained by the lack of foreign exchange, widespread shortages of imports appeared in the market. 1. The reform nroaram In response to these pressures, the Syrian authorities initiated, from 1987 onward, a major policy shift to ease controls, restore price incentives, and re-establish private sector confidence within a more competitive economic environment. The reform process had several interrelated elements, including: (i) opening new areas of investment to the private sector; (ii) liberalizing foreign trade and easing private sector access to foreign exchange; (iii) more realistic pricing of foreign exchange; and (iv) improving market signals through increased price flexibility. The transition was facilitated by an increase in external resources as domestic oil production rose and Syria received significant external support in the aftermath of the 1990-91 Gulf crisis. a. Investment nromotion After an era of nationalization and public sector dominance, Investment Law No. 10 of 1991 provided the first important opening of the domestic economy to domestic and foreign private investment. Through fiscal incentives and the liberalization of imports and external payments, the investment law initially attracted foreign investment in the service sector, with quick returns but with limited value added and employment creation opportunities. Subsequently, investment was channelled to other areas through the approval process, and, by the end of 1995, Investment Law No. 10 had attracted some 1,400 projects with an investment commitment of about US$5 billion, mostly originating with Syrians living abroad, of which about two thirds were in the manufacturing sector, mostly in agro-based industries and textiles. In response to the improved investment climate, the private sector made inroads in many areas of economic activity traditionally dominated by the public sector. Increased competition from the private sector and import liberalization also prompted greater efficiency in public enterprises. At the same time, the Government undertook large-scale investments in transportation, telecommunications, and electricity to ease the bottlenecks which had constrained economic growth in the past. Nevertheless, while much progress has been achieved in liberalizing the Syrian economy, remaining controls (Box 1) may inhibit private sector investment from reaching its potential.

After more than two decades of nationalization and protective policies, measures aimed at strengthening incentives system and opening up foreign trade have helped to restore private sector confidence. The private sector has already made important inroads in many areas of economic activity which were traditionally dominated by the public sector. private and public sector economic activity The private sector is estimated to have contributed about one-half of the value added generated in the economy in 1994. This contribution to GDP may in fact be higher since the official national income accounts tend to underestimate the extent of private sector activity. While mining (petroleum and phosphate), utilities, the communication network, and the formal financial sector are either public sector monopolies or are heavily dominated by the public sector, agriculture and most services are almost entirely in the private domain and the private sector acwunts for a large share of manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade. Data for 1994 suggest that the private sector accounted for close to 60 percent of total investment in the economy and the relative contribution of the private sector to total investment is increasing, reflecting the improved investment climate and incentives offered under the Investment Law No. 10 of 1991. In the area of foreign trade, the private sector contributed 82 percent of non- oil exports and 65 percent of non-oil imports in 1995. Pricing Most price increases have to be approved by the Ministry of Supply on a cost-plus basis, including predetermined profit margins which vary from 10 percent to 40 percent depending on commodities. Approvals for price adjustments are provided liberally, and in the case of the private sector almost automatically. In fact, because of increased competition, private sector prices in some cases fall below the approved prices. Foreign trade Imports are regulated through various import lists and a licensing requirement. However, the scope of imports is very broad and import licenses are granted liberally, albeit through a lengthy and costly approval process. Payments for imports are subject to a set of restrictions regarding the source of foreign exchange. Labor market The private sector is free in its wage setting and in its employment practices. Wages, in the private sector substantially exceed wages in the public sector at all levels. Public enterprises are more wnstrained in their employment practices as they can only release redundant labor if alternative employment is provided elsewhere in the public sector.

Over the years, protective policies had created a highly fragmented exchange rate system, catering to the needs of the public sector, and a highly overvalued exchange rate structure. Beginning in the late 198Os, the exchange system was gradually simplified by eliminating a number of appreciated exchange rates and moving transactions toward more depreciated rates. Moreover, as foreign trade was gradually opened up and restrictions on the use of foreign exchange were eased, private sector transactions were shifted to the free rate. Currently, the Syrian pound is traded at about US$l = LS 50 in free markets in neighboring countries, a rate which has remained remarkably stable over the last five years. (The structure of exchange rates is summarized in Table 1.) At present, the foreign exchange market is segmented into two: one for public sector transactions, and another for private sector transactions. While the private sector does not have access to official foreign exchange resources, the authorities have refrained from utilizing private sector foreign exchange resources to further strengthen private sector confidence. The public sector market includes the official exchange rate (US$l = LS 11.2) but its significance has been declining as transactions have gradually been shifted to a more depreciated rate (US$l = LS 42), which has become the operating exchange rate for public enterprise transactions (Table 2). Oil exports valued at the official rate allow the financing at that rate of rice imports, the servicing of some external debt, and some government imports related to infrastructure projects. While private sector transactions mostly take place at the free market rate, some luxury imports can only be financed through an "exports proceeds market" where private sector exporters may sell their foreign exchange proceeds retained in the domestic banking system to importers. The rate in this market fluctuates around US$l = LS 55, the premium reflecting the financing restriction. Private sector exports --with the notable exception of agricultural exports-- are implicitly taxed (at a 16 percent rate) by the requirement to surrender 25 percent of export proceeds at the exchange rate of US$l = LS 42. This injection of foreign exchange resources into the public sector pool has enabled the Commercial Bank of Syria to liquidate its external arrears and substantially reduce its external liabilities. As more transactions were transferred to market rates, the weighted average exchange rate (measured in nominal effective terms) was depreciated by 36 percent between 1989 and 1994 (Chart 1). In real terms, there was still substantial effective depreciation (of more than 20 percent) during 1989-92 that was associated with the initial intensive phases of exchange liberalization. However, in subsequent years, the real exchange rate has been appreciating, largely as a result of Syria's inflation rate outpacing those of its major trading partners. Trade liberalization proceeded in parallel with exchange reform and provided added incentive for private sector economic activity. Starting from a virtual public sector monopoly, foreign trade became increasingly accessible to the private sector and the permitted lists of imports have Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public&aBC8Y aUbc ozoLI ZZOZS u-442 wm %;I’” &ii5 c-4 *u-t 802,“: li%:a: *1”W” 2Q “E!ii w 0 lbw KWO 423CP a w mu WSUE 0 m u-4 0 SQC a as ‘2 ;1Z” w4 -C\ B%?Z8 rtQ.L1. cr 600 : -ZJJZ E:%Kaz. *uoww;: bl wo 0 ggiia wz a850 .“bli we -4u iii:, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - Table 2.

Currently, imports are regulated through a number of positive lists, a negative list, and public sector monopoly on imports of a few commodities. In the initial phases of trade liberalization, private sector imports were financed from own sources mostly mobilized abroad. As the authorities eased the restrictions on the use of foreign exchange, private sector exporters were permitted to retain 75 percent of their foreign exchange export proceeds to finance own imports and, subsequently, to sell these proceeds to other importers. Proceeds from agricultural exports can be fully retained. C. Price reform Price liberalization, which complemented reforms in the trade and exchange areas, has been carried out through several channels. First, through frequent price adjustments, the range of subsidized commodities has been gradually reduced to a few sensitive items (bread, rice, sugar, and electricity). Second, administered price adjustments have allowed public enterprises to fully reflect their costs, thus eliminating the financial losses stemming from the unrealistic prices which prevailed in the past. Third, although remaining subject to administrative procedures, the private sector sets its prices on a cost-plus basis, including profit margins of up to 40 percent. Finally, to stimulate import substitution after the food shortages that occurred in the 198Os, agricultural procurement prices have been adjusted to international price levels (converted at the free market exchange rate), exceeding them in most cases (see Box 2). 2. OutDut. investment. and inflation During the second half of the 198Os, growth was moderate, despite the sharp increase in oil production (Chart 2). During the first half of the 199Os, notwithstanding a deceleration in the expansion of the oil sector, the gradual decontrol of the economy and the improvement of the incentive system generated high rates of growth and investment. Annual real GDP growth fluctuated between 6 percent and 11 percent during 1991-94, averaging 8 percent, well above the population growth rate of 3.5 percent (Chart 2). In 1995, real GDP is estimated to have increased by 6 percent, reflecting a deceleration in agricultural production associated with lower rainfall. Particularly noteworthy is that increases in procurement prices in agriculture elicited a strong supply response: wheat output doubled between 1990 and 1995 to 4 million tons, eliminating the need for imports, and the substantial increases in output of other agricultural products permitted Syria to become a net exporter of agricultural products (see Box 2). In response to investment incentives and a better investment climate, private sector investment increased from 10 percent of GDP in 1991 to 17 percent in 1994. During the same period, public investment in relation to GDP also rose from 8 percent to 13 percent, reflecting the implementation of a number of large-scale power projects and infrastructure development. Only about half of the increase in domestic investment was met by higher domestic savings which increased from 10 percent of GDP to 16 percent between 1991 and 1994.

Liberalization and growth in agriculture Since 1988, the agricultural sector has been gradually liberalized and allowed more pricing flexibility. Producers have been allowed to retain 100 percent of their export proceeds from fruits and vegetables and they have benefited from the free market exchange rate. In addition, they have been exempted from the domestic production tax. Input subsidization came to an end in June 1993 when the subsidy on fertilizer was removed. Through substantial investment in agriculture, the proportion of irrigated land in relation to total cultivated land increased from 15 percent in 1988 to 22 percent in 1994. To attain its growth objectives, the Government moved away from production targets emphasizing instead price incentives. During 1988-94, procurement prices for crops increased by about 20 percent annually. In 1995, procurement prices for most crops were either close to or slightly higher than international prices. The increase in procurement prices helped secure a strong supply response. Wheat and barley production increased from an average of 1.5 million tons and 0.6 million tons in 1989-90 to an average of 3.9 million tons and 1.6 million tons in 1994-95, respectively, and Syria has become self-sufficient in cereals. Total agricultural exports increased from US $0.32 billion in 1988 to over US $1.0 billion in 1995, mainly on account of an increase in fruit and vegetable exports which increased from US $43 million to over US $400 million during the same period, turning Syria into a net exporter of agricultural products. lnmillionsofU.S.doUan Developments in the Agricultural Sector, 1985-95 Index. 1!290=100 . - 160 * 2.500 - . d- - 140 s - , (_ e.- - - . 2,~ - crops production ’ ‘.. . , ” , --------- - 120 (right scale) ,-Lmvr- --- de ' - . - . ,' . /- ,?. - - ' / d- - 100 1,500 - s -. . / . ’ Domestic agtia~ltural prices . .; ‘. - , relative to international prices I/ (tight scale) - 80 / / 1mJ - Agricultural exports 500 - ..“.“.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .._......... .

On the one hand, the strong supply response and import liberalization increased the availability of goods and fostered competition, and moderate monetary expansion dampened demand pressures. On the other hand, price adjustments, associated with the shift to more depreciated rates and a reduction in subsidies, put pressure on prices. As a result, the rate of inflation accelerated from 10 percent during 1991-92 to 14 percent during 1993-94. The rate of inflation in 1995 is estimated at 12 percent as the pace of administered price adjustments moderated. 3. Financial policies a. Fiscal oolicv The large increase in oil revenue and in external grants associated with the Gulf war made it possible for the Government to raise expenditure on infrastructure while still generating small overall surpluses in the Central Government's budget in 1991-92. With the virtual disappearance of foreign grants from 1993 onwards, and a decline in oil prices, budgetary pressures began to develop again with the budget moving from a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP (including foreign grants) in 1992 to increasing deficits reaching 3.8 percent of GDP in 1995 (Table 3 and Chart 3). The Central Government's budget excludes the operations of the Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) through which bread, rice, and sugar are currently being subsidized by borrowing from the Central Bank. lJ Price adjustments in recent years have reduced the PSF deficit. Nevertheless, the overall deficit, including the PSF deficit, rose from 1.8 percent of GDP in 1992 to 6.2 percent of GDP in 1995. A number of measures have been taken in recent years to raise non-oil revenue and improve its structure. 2J These included: (i) a gradual shift from the official exchange rate to more depreciated levels as a basis for customs valuation; (ii) increases in fees and charges; (iii) imposition of a consumption tax on hotels and entertainment; (iv) an increase in real estate tax; and (v) adjustments in inheritance tax. Moreover, the distribution of shared revenue with municipalities has been revised in favor of the Central Government. Also, greater efforts have been made to improve tax collection, including arrears, and to settle accumulated balances. Notwithstanding these measures, the budget still has a narrow domestic tax base, in addition to other structural weaknesses, notably: JJ In addition to the explicit subsidy provided in the budget, imported rice benefits from an implicit exchange rate subsidy equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP. u Oil export receipts to the budget only account for 18 percent of tax revenue because oil is valued at the official exchange rate. A valuation of oil receipts at the market exchange rate would raise the share of oil export receipts in the budget to about 50 percent.

This reduces the responsiveness of budgetary revenues as imports rise, and is the major factor behind the decline in the revenue/GDP ratio. While oil revenues are also valued at the official exchange rate, surcharges on oil products have been raised by the authorities to make up for most of the loss in revenues and to bring the major product prices to international levels, converted at the market exchange rate (Box 3). Box 3. How Extensive are Implicit Subsidies in Syria? Implicit subsidies and taxes are bound to arise whenever an exchange rate is used in the budget (or in the public sector) which is more appreciated than the market rate. The use of the highly appreciated official exchange rate (US$l = LS 11.2 up to 1995 and US$l = LS 23.0 in 1996)foroiI export proceeds has implicitly financed certain govennnentimportsand payments also valued at the official exchange rate. l While the crude oil transfer price to the refineries reflects the official exchange rate, the Treasury recaptures this implicit subsidy by imposing excises on petroleum products which raise consumer prices to international levels and beyond. Only fuel oil and consequently electricity benefits from a large implicit subsidy. l Of the three subsidized food staples (wheat, rice, and sugar) only rice is imported in significant amounts and benefits from the implicit subsidy. The largest subsidies on domestic wheat and sugar are fully budgeted and broadly reflect the difference between prices paid to farmers and those charged to consumers. l It is estimated that about 20 percent of total imports are at the official exchange rate. These are all government imports, including rice, materials and supplies for administrations and capital equipment, not finan& by foreign loans. In addition, the government services its external debt at the official rate. While budgetary expenditures for these items may be understated, so is the oil export revenue which finances them. l All other public sector imports (mostly inputs for public enterprises) are imported at the rate of USSl = IS 42. Depending on the pricing of the final product and on the import content, a small subsidy may accrue to the enterprise and/or to the consumer. Private sector imports are all at the free market rate US$l = IS 50. l The business profit tax yields very little revenue--2 percent of GDP--(when oil-related activities are excluded) because of the low profitability of public enterprises.

Monetary oolicy Monetary policy has been accommodating the borrowing needs of the public sector. The rate of monetary expansion decelerated steadily from 26 percent in 1991 to 11 percent in 1994, and that of net domestic assets declined from 16 percent to 7.5 percent of the initial stock of money and quasi-money (Chart 3). Although claims by the banking system on the public sector increased during 1991-93, this was offset by large valuation and other contractionary adjustments. In 1994, bank borrowing by public enterprises declined due to liquidation of some commodity stocks and the assumption by the Government of some of the debt of public enterprises. In 1995 broad money is estimated to have increased by about 15 percent. The state-owned Commercial Bank of Syria--the only commercial bank--has not kept up with the increasing demand for financial services and intermediation. Real interest rates continue to be negative and, with the exception of small increases, the interest rate structure and levels have remained unchanged for many years. 1/ 4. Balance of navments develoDments and orosnects The stagnation of oil experts, coupled with import liberalization and an expansionary fiscal policy, was reflected in a turnaround in the current account deficit from a substantial surplus in the 1989-91 period to a deficit equivalent to about 3.5 percent of GDP in 1993-95 (Table 4). After a steady increase in oil exports since the mid-1980s, oil export receipts stabilized at just below US$2 billion during 1991-94 as volume increases were offset by a decline in prices. After peaking at USS1.8 billion in 1990, private sector exports collapsed to US$650 million in 1992 as in-kind repayment of debt to the Russian Federation was suspended. Nevertheless, the private sector managed to reorient its exports to other countries-- reaching USS1.7 billion by 1995-- and to increase its share in non-oil exports. Import volume increased at rates averaging 22 percent annually during 1991-94 as a result of trade liberalization, increasing domestic investments, and an appreciating real exchange rate. The private sector u Lending rates are in the range of 4 percent to 11 percent, and rates of return on deposits and investment instruments range from 2 percent to 9 percent. The annual inflation rate averaged 12 percent during the 1991-95 period. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - Table 4.

The trade surplus of the public sector declined on account of stable oil receipts and higher capital imports associated with public development projects. As official transfers declined from exceptionally high levels in the aftermath of the Gulf war (USS1.5 billion in 1991-92) to about US$lOO million annually in 1993-95 (Chart 4), the public sector resorted to borrowing, mainly from regional development institutions and from bilateral sources. Moreover, external payments arrears also increased. Recurring overall balance of payments surpluses allowed the coverage of foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank to be maintained at about 2% months of imports since 1991. Although the Commercial Bank of Syria also holds substantial foreign assets (about USS3.6 billion at end-1995), these are mostly the counterpart of residents' foreign currency deposits. Syria's medium- and long-term public or publicly guaranteed external debt to bilateral creditors --excluding military debt and interest on arrears--and multilateral institutions is estimated at USS5.2 billion at end-1995 (31 percent of GDP). In addition, the Russian Federation has reported Syria's external debt, as of December 1, 1994, in the amounts of Rub 6,873 million; US$180 million; and fstg 71 million. Syria has accumulated sizable external payments arrears, including US$526 million owed to the World Bank, and about US$950 million owed to Paris Club creditors. Under an agreement reached with the World Bank in 1992, Syria pledged to make monthly payments of US$6 million in order to freeze the level of arrears and work toward their settlement. Although monthly payments were suspended in March 1995 discussions with the Bank are continuing. Discussions with some Paris Club creditors on data consolidation and on settlement of arrears are in progress. Debt service payments to the Russian Federation were suspended in 1992, although negotiations on the settlement of these countries' debt have continued since then. Balance of payments projections for the period 1996-98, based on broadly unchanged policies but assuming rapid normalization of financial relations with creditors, JJ suggest sizable financing gaps (Table 4). Oil production in Syria has reached its peak at 600,000 bpd, and is likely to fall in the coming years unless new discoveries are made and enhanced recovery techniques sustain production from existing fields. Net oil exports are likely to decline even more, as rising demand for energy consumption in Syria will only partly be met by the higher utilization of natural gas. In the absence of tight financial policies, and in response to further trade liberalization measures and higher private investment, imports are projected to continue to rise sharply. Robust private sector export lJ It is assumed that debt to Paris Club creditors will be rescheduled in 1996 either through a multilateral agreement or through bilateral negotiations and those to the World Bank will be regularized. Possible agreements on debt settlement with other creditors (e.g., the Russian Federation) have not been incorporated in the balance of payments.

The current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is expected to increase from 3.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to about 6.5 percent of GDP in 1998. Although net capital receipts are assumed to remain at the same level as in 1995 over the next two years, there would be a definite shift toward more long-term financing; however, a rising debt repayment burden is projected toward the late 1990s as debt contracted in recent years falls due. Against this background, Syria faces a net external financing need that is projected to rise over the medium term (Table 4). The outlook is further complicated by two downside risks. First, international oil prices are volatile and may weaken over the medium-term, particularly if Iraq resumes oil exports. Second, delaying the settlement of Syria's payment arrears would have a negative impact on private sector confidence, and may reduce foreign capital inflows below what is assumed under the above scenario. III. Policv Discussions The medium-term projections suggest that Syria faces an uncertain external payments position in the absence of a broadening and an intensification of the reform process. The staff recognizes that the authorities' reform initiatives have resulted in improvements in the price, trade and exchange systems, spurring growth and regaining private sector confidence. However, to build on these gains and to improve the balance of payments outlook, the staff stressed the need for accelerating liberalization, strengthening demand management, and bringing all the reform elements into a comprehensive and integrated framework so as to firmly establish an outward-oriented, market-based economy. The Syrian authorities were in broad agreement with the staff on the need for an integrated and a more accelerated reform program. Their measured response in the past had reflected concerns about the possible social and political implications of abrupt policy shifts. Accordingly, the staff engaged the authorities in a discussion of the broad parameters of a reform program which would sustain high rates of economic growth and improve the balance of payments position over the medium term, while addressing the concerns of the authorities about the social aspects of reforms. 1. Exchange rate. trade. and oavments systems The authorities agreed with the staff that the unification of exchange rates and further liberalization of the trade and payments systems would be the cornerstone of an integrated reform program. Their aim is to unify the exchange system at a market-based level within a year, and maintain the stability of the market rate thereafter. They feel that a cautious approach would enable them to gauge market reactions more closely and avoid a policy reversal if excessive pressures should develop. In particular, the authorities are of the opinion that current levels of official foreign exchange reserVes are inadequate to address speculative pressures on the foreign exchange market that might arise in conjunction with the unification. They also recognize that most import regulations constitute an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - unnecessary burden on private sector transactions, and they intend to substantially reduce and simplify these regulations in 1996. As regards external debt, the authorities are keen to clear, through bilateral negotiations, all outstanding payments arrears and remain current thereafter. The staff urged the authorities to take advantage of the current stability of the market exchange rate to unify the exchange rates into a single market-based rate as soon as possible. As a first step, the immediate unification of the exchange rates at the most depreciated official exchange rate (US$l = LS 42) would constitute a credible move in the direction of establishing a market-based unified rate within a year. Unification of official exchange rates at US$l = LS 42 would not likely lead to major price increases, since public enterprises already operate at this rate. While changing the customs valuation rate from US$l = LS 11.2 to US$l = LS 42.0 would increase import prices, this could be moderated by a reform of the customs tariff, and by reducing the surcharges imposed on petroleum products. Similarly, no substantial pressure on the foreign exchange market would be expected to develop. In response to further trade liberalization, the demand for foreign exchange by the private and public sectors would likely rise to finance higher imports. At the same time private and official inflows would be expected to increase, provided an early normalization of financial relations with all creditors was achieved. Such normalization would improve Syria's access to cheaper and longer-term foreign financing, mobilize external financial support for the reforms, and encourage autonomous capital inflows. Finally, exchange rate unification and the development of an active interbank foreign exchange market would provide public enterprises with greater flexibility in obtaining foreign exchange. In this respect, the authorities stressed that the unification of the private and public sector foreign exchange resources into one market would need to be preceded by effective prudential bank regulations on limiting foreign exchange exposure to safeguard private sector foreign currency deposits. In parallel to the reforms of the exchange and payments system, and for efficiency reasons, remaining restrictions on foreign trade should be eliminated and import procedures simplified. While recent years have witnessed a welcome opening of foreign trade, the authorities' gradual approach has resulted in a proliferation of import lists and a segmentation of the import market, both of which are a deterrent to investors. Accordingly, the staff recommended the substitution of the various positive import lists with a single temporary negative list that could include, on a transitional basis, imports currently restricted for protection of domestic industries. Tariff reform, which would be undertaken in conjunction with exchange rate unification, would aim at reducing effective protection, eliminating widespread exemptions, and narrowing tariff dispersion, in compliance with the provisions of the Barcelona Agreement to which Syria is committed. The staff also urged the authorities to consider joining the World Trade Organization at an early stage so that Syria could benefit from a better access for its exports and from other privileges associated with membership.

Price reform The authorities explain that the thrust of government policy has been to promote private sector activity by allowing price flexibility and access to foreign exchange and other production inputs in virtually all spheres of economic activity. Agriculture production, almost entirely in the private domain, would continue to benefit from procurement prices adjusted to border prices and from increasing the share of irrigated land in total land use. In the manufacturing sector, official policy is to encourage private sector participation--especially in areas where public enterprises are still dominant-- through investment incentives and through provision of adequate power and other necessary infrastructure. In the case of public enterprises, increased price flexibility, tighter access to credit, and greater accountability are expected to lead to higher efficiency and profitability. The staff agreed with the authorities that increased price flexibility had improved the cost-price relationship and enhanced production incentives. There were nevertheless two key remaining steps for the completion of the price reform. First, exchange rate unification would need to be fully reflected in prices to avoid the emergence of larger subsidies and/or quasi- fiscal losses for public enterprises. Second, the number of goods subject to administered prices should be reduced to a few essential commodities, and a greater price setting autonomy should be given to public sector enterprises, thus replacing the present cumbersome administrative procedure of price approvals and controls with a broader system of price monitoring. In the case of the private sector, since price approvals have been granted liberally, most of these procedures were redundant and could be easily removed. With regard to investment policy, the mission expressed the view that although fiscal incentives to private investors may have initially encouraged investment, they would eventually erode the domestic tax base in coming years as the share of private sector activity expands. There is a need to review these exemptions, especially since the simplification of the exchange and payments system, the development of infrastructure, and the improved macroeconomic climate have reduced the need to provide fiscal incentives for attracting private capital. 3. Fiscal nolicy The 1996 budget is based on a more depreciated exchange rate (US$l = LS 23) as an intermediate step toward moving to a market-based rate in the next fiscal year. The Central Government's budget deficit (excluding grants) is projected to increase to 5.1 percent of GDP in 1996, compared to 3.8 percent of GDP in 1995, primarily reflecting the decline in revenue and the increase in capital expenditure in relation to GDP. However, subsidies (the PSF deficit) are expected to decline to 2.1 percent of GDP as a reduction in subsidized quantities are anticipated. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit on an accrual basis is expected to widen from 6.2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 7.3 percent in 1996 since the increase in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - business profit tax revenues stemming from the change in the exchange rate valuation of oil --would accrue only in 1997. However, on a cash basis, the higher revenue is expected to materialize through advance payments from the oil company (Table 3). Also, in line with past trends, development outlays are expected to be about 90 percent of the budgeted amounts. Taking these two factors into consideration, the staff estimates that the overall fiscal deficit will decline (including the PSF deficit) to the equivalent of about 4.5 percent of GDP. According to the initial policy intentions of the Syrian authorities, the positive impact on 1996 budgetary revenues arising from the change in customs valuation for 1996 would be more than offset by two factors: a sharp reduction in the surcharges imposed on petroleum products, and a reduction in tariffs to moderate the increase in import prices. If these intentions are fully implemented, the mission has estimated that tax revenues would actually decline from 17.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to 16.3 percent of GDP in 1996. On the expenditure side, the authorities indicated that a tight incomes policy, coupled with savings effected on account of defense, security, and development projects, would result in a reduction of overall expenditures from 26.8 percent of GDP in 1995 to 24 percent of GDP in 1996. Staff analysis suggests that moving to a market-based exchange rate should have a potentially strong positive impact on the budget. In the first instance, the increase in budgetary oil revenue should only be partially offset by a reduction in surcharges on petroleum products. The adjustment of the customs valuation rate should also generate significant resources for the budget, even after allowing for tariff reductions, lJ provided it is largely reflected in the price system. Should the price pass-through for sensitive commodities be viewed as excessive, a temporary and well-targeted budgetary subsidy could be appropriated to moderate the price increases. The staff argued that, despite the initial improvement, additional measures would be needed to reduce the budget deficit further with a view to eliminating it over the medium term, thereby bringing inflation down to the single-digit level and ensuring the stability of the exchange rate. This was particularly important since the reliance on customs revenue would tend to decline over time with the reduction in tariffs, and because additional expenditures would likely emerge in conjunction with the restructuring of public enterprises and the banking system. IJ Currently, close to 80 percent of dutiable imports are valued at the official rate for customs purposes.

This would contribute the equivalent of 1 percent of GDP. Tariff reform and valuation of imports at a realistic exchange rate should aim at increasing revenues from customs duties by about two percentage points of GDP. Moreover, corporate tax rates would need to be unified at a single rate (35- 40 percent) in the context of a reform of the corporate income tax to conform to international standards and improve compliance. Z?/ On the expenditure side, the staff indicated that wage awards provided in the past in compensation for price increases had perpetuated inflationary pressures. Instead, wage awards should be based on anticipated inflation to facilitate convergence of the inflation rate with those of Syria's trading partners. Moreover, wage adjustments in the public sector would need to be harmonized with a comprehensive reform of civil service employment to reduce overemployment. While overall subsidies should be reduced with exchange rate unification, explicit subsidies may initially be expected to increase. However, the aim should be to reduce and eventually eliminate them within the framework of a well-targeted social safety net to protect the vulnerable groups. In addition, the level of capital expenditure could be scaled back from the current high levels (13 percent of GDP), and greater attention should be paid to the efficiency of investment. Finally, further cuts in defense expenditure should be possible as the ongoing peace process progresses. 4. Monetary nolicv and financial sector reform Although targets had not yet been established for 1996, it was the monetary authorities' intention to limit credit extended to the Government in line with the reduced borrowing requirements of the budget and the PSF. Further price adjustments were also expected to improve the financial position of public sector enterprises. This would allow the private sector greater access to bank credit within a smaller overall credit expansion. The major policy issues in the financial area were: (i) enhancing incentives for financial savings and rationing credit more efficiently; (ii) reasserting the leading role of the Central Bank; and (iii) structural reforms to deepen financial intermediation and increase competition in commercial banking activities. The staff indicated that monetary policy L/ Recommended by two FAD technical assistance missions: in 1990 "Syrian Arab Republic: Taxation and Possibility for Reform," prepared by K. Nashashibi, A.

Tazi. u At present there are many corporate tax rates up to 58 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - should play a more active role in support of inflation and external current account objectives in the context of a stable exchange rate. Accordingly, increases in nominal interest rates should aim at establishing flexible and positive real rates at an early stage to help mobilize financial savings and serve as a basis for credit allocation. Over the longer term, sales of government debt instruments with competitive yields should also be considered to reduce reliance on bank financing and develop instruments of indirect monetary control. Over the years the banking system has become a major constraint to the expansion of private sector activity. Monetary policy geared toward meeting the credit requirements of the public sector has weakened the role of the Central Bank in setting policy direction. Virtually all commercial banking activities are centered on the Commercial Bank of Syria and little financial intermediation takes place. The authorities were aware of these difficulties and have already initiated a broad reform to re-establish the pivotal role of the Central Bank in setting monetary, interest, and exchange rate policies. In particular, the Bank's Council for Money and Credit should resume its function after being inactive for many years. The Fund is providing technical assistance to the Central Bank in support of these reforms and to strengthen bank supervision. The Commercial Bank of Syria would also need to be restructured to better serve the needs of a growing market economy and improve financial intermediation. At the same time, the establishment of other commercial banks would revitalize the banking sector and generate a more competitive environment. This would become even more important when an interbank foreign exchange market is established in Syria. The authorities indicated that they intended, at least in the near term, to keep banking within the public sector, but were exploring possibilities of establishing joint public/private financial institutions. 5. Statistical issues The staff received full cooperation from the Syrian authorities in providing data and information. Despite improvements in the data base, statistical shortcomings related to quality, coverage, currentness, and consistency of data continue to hamper in-depth economic analysis and policy formulation. Data deficiencies reflect several factors, including: the absence of a central statistics authority; inadequate dissemination of information between government agencies; compilation difficulties arising from controlled prices and a multiple exchange rate system; and the shortage of trained personnel. While data shortcomings extend to a number of areas, monetary statistics are particularly weak and there are significant discrepancies between the banking and fiscal data because of lags in settlement and differences between cash and accrual. The staff emphasized the urgent need to address these difficulties in order to facilitate monitoring of economic developments and formulating effective policy responses to emerging challenges. To assist the authorities in addressing these shortcomings, the Fund has recently provided two technical assistance missions: on national incomes accounts (December 1995); and on balance of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - payments statistics (January 1996). A third mission on monetary statistics is scheduled for March 1996. The authorities agreed to supply the Fund staff with a core set of statistics on a regular basis. IV. Staff Annraisal After three decades of nationalization and inward-looking policies marked by widespread restrictions and distortions, the Syrian authorities initiated, in the late 198Os, a program of economic liberalization to establish a market-based economy. The reform program had several mutually- reinforcing elements but essentially focused on improving price incentives. The encouragement of private sector investment through fiscal incentives was supported by increased price flexibility, import liberalization, and moves toward a more realistic pricing of foreign exchange. Public enterprises also benefitted from greater price flexibility, and agricultural procurement prices were set in line with international prices. The Government provided additional support through large-scale investments in infrastructure to loosen the bottlenecks which had emerged in telecommunications, transport, and electricity. These policies elicited a strong supply response, evidenced by a high rate of economic growth, a significant increase in private sector exports and imports, and sharp gains in agricultural production which made Syria self-sufficient in wheat and some other foodstuffs. In the process, the private sector made substantial inroads in many areas of economic activity which were dominated for decades by the public sector. Currently large investment commitments by the private sector indicate that this growth momentum could be sustained in the period ahead, provided further reforms are forthcoming and the balance of payments constraints are eased. The reform process proceeded at a measured pace as the authorities cautiously gauged investors' responses to the new incentives and tested public reaction to price increases. The downside of this approach was that the fiscal reform lagged behind the pace of liberalization of the trade system, which contributed to large and widening overall fiscal and external current account deficits. In addition, remaining administrative controls have continued to prevent the Syrian economy from realizing its full potential. Prices of major products are still set administratively and price adjustments are subject to government review and approval. Notwithstanding a large expansion in the scope of imports, foreign trade continues to be burdened by various regulations and administrative procedures. The external payments system is equally complex, compelling private importers to arrange financing outside the banking system. The financial sector, operating in a noncompetitive environment, is accommodating public sector needs while constraining private sector activity at a time of large expansion in private sector investment and trade. Financial savings are low, real interest rates are negative, and credit is rationed mainly by nonprice mechanisms. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - The recent policy gains on the economic front augur well for the success of a more ambitious pace of reforms. The staff welcomes the authorities' commitment to deepen and accelerate the reform process. More forceful policy action is needed in a number of areas in order to bring all the reform elements into a comprehensive and consistent framework, with the ultimate objective of developing an outward-oriented economy with clear market signals and financial discipline. This is particularly important considering that Syria's medium-term external prospects remain uncertain, especially since net oil exports are likely to decline and oil prices remain volatile. More rapid liberalization of the economy, underpinned by strong demand management, would achieve a substantial and durable improvement in the external payments position. Such a reform effort would also permit Syria to benefit from the Euro-Mediterranean initiative and the improved economic climate in the region. While measures are needed on a broad front, perhaps the most urgent task is to simplify the exchange rate structure by unifying the multiple exchange rates at a market-based level as soon as possible. This would increase transparency, eliminate implicit subsidies, and improve resource allocation by setting more realistic relative prices. The authorities' step-wise approach to exchange rate -unification, by means of introducing more realistic rates and shifting transactions to more depreciated rates, is a move in the right direction, but the process complicates the exchange rate structure without eliminating the distortions. The staff agrees with the authorities that such a unification would be facilitated if the external position was stronger. However, a comprehensive reform initiative would attract additional official and private capital inflows, thereby strengthening the balance of payments and the official reserve position. Given the liberal import policy, the multiplicity of import regulations could be easily reduced to one negative list on a temporary basis. In general, the regulatory framework needs to be simplified and made more transparent to create more favorable conditions for the promotion of export- oriented investment. Exchange rate unification accompanied by full price pass-through is unlikely to lead to widespread and substantial price increases, provided financial policies are firmly restrained. In areas where substantial price increases may be expected (i.e., public sector imports of subsidized foodstuffs and some capital goods), a transparent policy of temporarily subsidizing some essential foodstuffs, coupled with customs tariff reduction, would moderate the price impact and protect the most vulnerable social groups until a well-targeted social safety net is worked out. Commendable effort has been made to reduce budgetary subsidies, contain defense-related spending, and redirect expenditure toward capital investment. These policies are expected to continue. However, a further tightening of fiscal policy and a sustained reduction in the budget deficit are essential in support of a unified and stable exchange rate. This would require a broadening of the tax base and a prioritization of expenditures, particularly with respect to the civil service and development projects. To that end, the staff recommends the implementation of a general sales tax at Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - the manufacturing level as soon as possible, possibly preceded by a turnover tax to mobilize domestic revenue in the interim period. Adjusting customs valuation to the unified rate of exchange, and the removal of some import duty exemptions, should raise government revenue from imports to norms prevailing in other countries. In the period ahead, the banking system will be called upon to play a critical role in mobilizing savings and allocating them more efficiently, and in establishing a foreign exchange market in Syria. Accordingly, the Central Bank would be expected to have more autonomy in setting policy and fulfilling its supervisory role, and the Commercial Bank of Syria would need to be restructured to better serve the needs of a growing market-based economy and improve financial intermediation. The authorities should also consider easing entry restrictions to commercial banking activities, and encourage the development of an interbank domestic money market. To pave the way for a restructuring of the financial system and for unifying the foreign exchange market, it is important that a regulatory framework with adequate bank supervision be put in place. To promote financial savings and allocate credit more efficiently, nominal interest rates should be raised with the aim of establishing positive real rates in the near term. Thereafter, the interest rate structure and interest rate levels should be flexible enough to reflect market conditions. The success of any fundamental economic reform in Syria is critically dependent on the continuation of external financial support from bilateral and multilateral sources. The persistence of large external payments arrears has reduced the availability of longer term financing, increased the cost of borrowing, and limited the flow of autonomous capital to Syria. The implementation of macroeconomic adjustment policies, together with an early normalization of financial relations with all creditors, including clearance of arrears to the World Bank and rescheduling of obligations in a multilateral context would improve Syria's access to foreign financing and strengthen its external payments position. So far, the authorities have favored the bilateral creditor approach to arrears and debt rescheduling. While such an approach is politically attractive, experience in a number of countries suggests that it is lengthy, costly, and inefficient inasmuch as it delays sending the proper signals to private investors and creditors. Despite recent liberalization, Syria continues to maintain, in accordance with Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Syria also continues to maintain restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, including (i) multiple currency practices arising from different official exchange rates; (ii) an advance import deposit requirement; and (iii) exchange rate restrictions evidenced by external payments arrears. Syria also maintains bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation, and Sri Lanka; the latter two are inoperative. In the absence of specific measures to eliminate the restrictions and multiple currency practices in a timely manner, the staff does not recommend that the Executive Board grant approval for the retention of the exchange practices Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - under Article VIII. The staff urges the authorities to unify the exchange rates and eliminate these restrictions as soon as possible, and accept the obligations under Article VIII. Effective policy formulation to respond to the challenges ahead requires a significant improvement in data quality. Fund staff has already provided technical support in a number of areas and the database would benefit from the early implementation of these recommendations. The staff urges the authorities to address the remaining deficiencies as soon as possible and invites them to draw further on Fund technical assistance. Syria is on the standard consultation cycle. The staff recommends that the next Article IV discussions with Syria take place within 12 months, after the completion of the 1995 Article IV consultation.

A multiple exchange rate system consisting of the official rate, the "rate in neighboring countries", the promotion rate, and a government fee rate is maintained. Since January 1, 1988, the official exchange rate has been maintained at US$l.OO - LS 11.20/11.25. This rate applies to oil exports, government imports including imports of capital goods not financed by foreign loans, and some government debt service payments. Other public sector transactions are effected at the rate in neighboring countries (US$l.OO = LS 42.00/43.00), with the exception of certain student allowances which are effected at the promotion rate (US$l.OO - LS 20.00/22.00). A government fee rate (US$l.OO = LS 42.95/43.00) applies to a limited number of government service transactions. The airline exchange rate, although still legally a separate exchange rate, was effectively merged with the rate in neighboring countries. Various exchange rates are used for customs valuation purposes. In addition, a market based on export proceeds has emerged. In Syria, some goods may be imported by using own foreign exchange generated through exports. Other importers may purchase foreign exchange earnings retained by exporters in the export proceeds market. The exchange rate in this market is determined freely, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX II stood at LS 55 - US$l.OO in December 1995. The market rate for the Syrian pound in neighboring countries is currently about LS 50 - US$l.OO. Virtually all private sector transactions take place at the market rates. In recent years, the Syrian pound in the official market has moved toward market rates through the elimination of highly appreciated rates, the transfer of transactions from the official rate to the rate in neighboring countries, and the increase in share of public sector transactions at market rates. VIII. Article IV Consultations: (a) Syria is currently on an annual consultation cycle. The last consultation was held in December 1994 and was completed on March 13, 1995. (b) The staff report for the 1994 Interim Article IV consultation (SM/95/37) was issued on February 16, 1995. The Executive Board's decision (Decision No. 10921-(95/23)) was as follows: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the exchange measures of the Syrian Arab Republic subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted on April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/95/37, the Syrian Arab Republic continues to maintain restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, except that the multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions described in SM/95/37, including those evidenced by external payments arrears and advance import deposits, are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The Fund encourages the authorities to unify the exchange rates and eliminate these restrictions as soon as possible. IX. Technical Assistance: (a) In January 1996, STA provided technical assistance on balance of payments statistics. (b) In December 1995, STA provided technical assistance on national income accounts.

Following the cessation of debt service payments to the World Bank in 1986, the World Bank suspended disbursements on all loans to Syria, canceled remaining undisbursed balances on all loans, and, in early 1987, placed Syria in protracted arrears status. Arrears rose to about US$400 million by March 1992 when an agreement was reached under which Syria would make monthly payments of US$6 million for new debt service falling due so as to freeze the stock of arrears, pending formulation of an arrears workout plan. No agreement was reached on a workout plan and monthly payments stopped after March 1993. By November 1993, an understanding was reached on a possible workout plan that envisaged donor contributions to help settle the arrears. As part of this understanding, Syria made up for the missed monthly payments from April 1993, and resumed monthly payments. However, efforts to conclude an arrears workout plan stalled, in part because Syria's arrears status with most of its bilateral creditors was not conducive to mobilizing donor support for the workout. Monthly payments of US$6 million continued through March 1995 after which they stopped again. Notwithstanding the payments made since April 1992 to cover new debt service falling due, arrears had risen further to over US$500 million because of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the currencies in which most of the arrears are denominated. As of end- December 1995 total arrears stood at the equivalent of about US$526 million, of which about half each in principal and interest arrears. In addition, an amount of about US$200 million in principal was outstanding but not yet due by that date. Since July 1995 additional discussions have taken place between the Syrian authorities and the World Bank on possible arrears clearance scenarios, although no agreements have been reached to date.

Real sector The national accounts are compiled by activity and by use. Although aggregate estimates of GDP in current and constant prices are based on a substantial database, problems with undercoverage and underreporting remain. A December 1995 STA technical assistance mission noted that improvements could be made to the estimates by use. The mission found that household private consumption expenditure is calculated as a residual, changes in inventories are not estimated, and the consumption of fixed capital is estimated as a constant ratio of output. Net income flows between residents and nonresidents are derived from the balance of payments (see below). Given these methods, the estimates of saving, investment and net borrowing from abroad are unreliable. Among its recommendations, the December 1995 STA mission suggested that the authorities regularly disseminate their national accounts estimates. There is no consumer price index for the economy as a whole. Data are available on the Syria retail price index, which is based on a 1985/86 household survey that probably does not reflect current consumption patterns. This index is referenced to 1990=100. A new wholesale price index uses 1990 as its base year and has been reported on an annual basis through 1994. Submission of IFS real sector data to STA is also irregular. Only one report was received from Syria in 1995. The report covered only exports, imports, and the retail and wholesale price indices; it excluded information on the national accounts. b. Government finance Foreign financing reported in the budgetary accounts cannot be confirmed by the balance of payments accounts. With regard to net credit to Government, there are discrepancies between the monetary survey and the fiscal accounts provided by the Ministry of Finance. This is due largely to differences in coverage and timing and differences between cash and accrual. Central bank credit extended to the Price Stabilization Fund is classified outside the budget. Similarly, the Central Bank occasionally assumes the accumulated debt of public enterprises to the banking system through the issuance of government bonds; the staff was not able to identify such operations in the monetary accounts. The present budgetary reporting does not permit an accurate breakdown between interest and principal payments on domestic and foreign debt. Moreover, coverage includes only some extrabudgetary units and there is a need for reclassification of some tax revenue items to nontax revenues.

However, the reported data are partial, too aggregated, and do not include extrabudgetary and social security accounts. No data on financing and debt are provided; there is no breakdown for current and capital expenditure, and lending minus repayments is reported as zero. Syria does not report monthly or quarterly GFS data for publication in IFS. C. Monetarv accounts A number of methodological errors have been identified in the monetary statistics compiled by the Central Bank of Syria. The monetary data for the central bank are based on incomplete accounting data, and, as a result, their coverage is not comprehensive. The use of different exchange rates by the central bank and the commercial banks for valuing foreign currency- denominated accounts on their balance sheets affects the accuracy of measuring narrow monetary aggregates in the monetary survey. d. Balance of payments Balance of payments data suffer from incomplete coverage, and valuation problems arising from the presence of multiple exchange rates. The current account data do not include re-exports, temporary imports, and military imports, and do not fully reflect remittances by Syrians working abroad. Estimates of travel, including both credit and debit, could also be improved. In addition, the statistics in the balance of payments for official transfers differ significantly from figures provided from other sources such as donors. Data on external debt continue to be incomplete and exclude military debt. Arrears on external debt are not recorded in the balance of payments statistics. Coverage deficiencies also include absence of data on direct and portfolio investment and the capital movements relating to "other sectors" (private). Part of the latter may have been misclassified with resident official sector capital. A balance of payments statistics mission, which visited Syria during January 7-20, 1996, addressed these issues. It is expected that the authorities will make an effort to improve the coverage of the data. C. Core data The core data provided by the authorities are adequate for continuous surveillance between consultations, provided that their timeliness improves.
