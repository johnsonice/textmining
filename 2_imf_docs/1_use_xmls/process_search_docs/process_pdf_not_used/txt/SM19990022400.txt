The overall fiscal deficit was reduced slightly to 3.2 percent of GDP, and the external current account deficit widened. Following a significant reserve loss, in September the authorities raised interest rates and took steps to restrain government expenditure. NIR recovered subsequently but dropped by US$150 million to US$760 million for 1998 as a whole. Real GDP growth picked up to 6.2 percent, while end-year inflation rose slightly to 12.4 percent. Developments in 1999 point to a slowdown in economic activity in the agricultural and commer- cial sectors, with real GDP growth projected at 5 percent for the year as a whole. The fiscal position deteriorated in the first half of the year owing to a weak revenue performance and higher interest payments. Since end-1998 the central bank has stepped up placements of open market paper and certificates of deposit, which has helped reduce the pace of bank lending. Owing to the tighter credit stance and a large bond placement in international markets, NIR increased to US$1.2 billion (2.2 months of imports of goods and services) through end-May, remaining about unchanged thereafter. Central bank interest rates have been lowered following the improvement in the reserve position. With a drop in prices of agricultural products, the 12-month rate of inflation declined to 9.1 percent in July; end-year inflation is targeted at 10 percent. Policy discussions: Discussions focused on policies for 1999 and the medium term. The staff estimated that the fiscal deficit could increase to 4.3 percent of GDP in 1999 and would remain above 3% percent in 2000. The authorities’ medium-term objectives include the achievement of sustained real GDP growth of 6 percent a year, together with a reduction in inflation to 7 percent. The staff stressed that attaining these objectives required a strengthening of the public finances to ease pressures on interest rates and reduce the vulnerability associated with the large domestic public debt, and an acceleration of structural reforms. The authorities indicated that their main priority was to build political support for their structural reform agenda, and that they needed to proceed gradually in the fiscal area. They were more optimistic than the staff regarding the fiscal outlook for 1999-2000 and felt that fiscal pressures would ease in 2OOI- 2002, following the phasing out of export subsidies. The authorities saw little scope for substan- tive revenue measures at this stage, but intend to adopt a tighter wage policy, reduce expenditure rigidities, and take certain revenue actions. They also indicated that they would stand ready to raise interest rates as needed to achieve a reserve accumulation of at least US$200 million for 1999 as a whole. The current policy of adjusting the exchauge rate daily on the basis of the differential between inflation in Costa Rica and its main trading partners, which has been largely successful in avoiding an erosion of external competitiveness, will be maintained. In the structural area, the authorities attach high priority to opeuing up key sectors to private sector participation and reforming the pension system. However, so far they have been unable to build congressional support for these reforms. In the financial system, there is a need to level the playing field between state and private banks; scale down the activities of the Banco National; and privatize the second largest state bank. Efforts should continue to strengthen prudential regulations and establish an effective consolidated supervision of financial intermedi- aries.

Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation with Costa Rica were conducted in San Jos& on May 10-21, 1999,’ and were followed by several contacts between the staff and the authorities in June-July 1999. 2. In October 1997 understandings were reached on a staff monitored program (SMP) that was in place through April 1998, to facilitate an orderly transition to the administration of President Rodriguez, which took office in May 1998. Costa Rica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains a system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments for current international transactions. Fund Relations with Costa Rica are summarized in Appendix I. 3. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on March 18, 1998 (EBM/98/30), Executive Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to avoid a repetition in 1997 of the usual political-economic cycle and stressed the importance of a sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic policies. In particular, t.hey urged the new administration to move forcefUlly in the area of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, including by selling public assets and applying the proceeds toward reducing public debt. 4. Although some progress has been made recently in improving the money and banking statistics, the overall quality of macroeconomic statistics in Costa Rica needs to be strengthened substantially. Main concerns include the timeliness and coverage of the national accounts, delays in the availability of commercial bank data, and weaknesses in the compilation of the balance of payments. Moreover, there are no data available on the external debt of the nonbank private sector, The quality of the data and its availability inhibit a timely analysis of demand management policies and balance of payments developments (Appendix IV). II. BACKGROUND AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 5. During the 1990s Costa Rica has continued to make progress in opening up the trade system, diversifying it!; export base, attracting substantial inflows of foreign direct investment, and improving social conditions. However, successive administrations have been unable to reduce the fiscal deficit on a su.stained basis and to implement several structural reforms that are needed to accelerate economic growth (the rate of growth of real GDP per ’ The staff team consisted of J.C. Di Tata (Head), J. Bailin, M. Dehesa, F. Frantischek, and C. Paiva (all WHD). Mr. Rodriguez, former Advisor to the Executive Director for Costa Rica, also participated in the discussions.

In particular, little progress has been made in reducing the size of the public sector, including in the financial system, which remains dominated by large ineffrcient state banks. The relatively large domestic public debt with short-term maturity has also added to the vulnerability of the economy. 6. Macroeconomic policy in 1998 was characterized by a strong expansion in aggregate demand fueled by a large increase in credit. Bank credit to the private sector grew by 49 percent during the year, reflecting mainly a substantial increase in lending by the two largest state banks, In late September, amidst international market turbulence, the authorities raised interest rates on central bank paper, accelerated slightly the nominal rate of depreciation of the colon, and took steps to restrain government expenditure. While these measures helped stem the loss in reserves, for 1998 as a whole NIR dropped by US$150 mil- lion to US$760 million (equivalent to 1.5 months of imports of goods and services).2 The surge in domestic demand, together with the initiation of operations by a multinational company that produces computer parts (INTEL), helped boost real GDP growth to 6.2 percent in 1998, with open unemployment declining slightly to 5.6 percent. End-year inflation rose to 12.4 percent, from 11.2 percent in 1997, notwithstanding the sharp decline in international oil prices (Table 1 and Figure 1).3 7. The overall deficit of the public sector (accrual basis) is estimated to have declined slightly to 3.2 percent of GDP in 1998, from 3.4 percent in 1997 (Tables 2, 3, and 4).4 Tax revenue relative to GDP increased, reflecting higher receipts from income and consumption * The figures for NIR presented in this report, including those for years previous to 1999, have been revised by the staff to exclude some bilateral claims under negotiation with Nicaragua, which are not readily available (these claims amount to about US$500 million, of which US$232 million are included in the official figures as reserve assets) (see footnote 21 below). 3 Developments under the SMP for the period January-April 1998 are summarized in Appendix III. The quantitative benchmarks on NIR, the net domestic assets of the central bank, central government noninterest current expenditure, and the central government wage bill for January-April were not observed, while the benchmarks on the net borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector and its net domestic financing were observed mainly because of a better-than-projected performance of tax revenue and lower capital outlays, At the same time, several structural benchmarks under the program were missed. 4 On a cash basis, the deficit declined to 2.8 percent of GDP in 1998, as interest payments were reduced by about I% percentage point of GDP through the issue of zero coupon bonds instead of regular bonds. The operational public sector deficit widened to 0.7 percent of GDP, from 0.3 percent in 1997. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Figure 1.

The stock of private financial assets increased by 19.4 percent during 1998, or about in line with nominal GDP (Table 5). There was a significant credit expansion by the state banks (credit to the private sector by the Banco National doubled during the year), supported by a reduction in their holdings of government and central bank paper and a drawdown of their foreign currency deposits at the central bank. In late September the central bank issued guidelines aimed at slowing credit growth and suspended its program of gradual reductions in reserve requirements.6 The guidelines were largely unsuccesstil in containing the credit expansion by the state banks during the remainder of 1998, and in January 1999 President Rodriguez ratified them by decree, which increased their effectiveness. Interest rates on six- month central bank and government paper rose by 500 basis points from June to October 1998 to 24 percent, a level at which they remained through May 1999. This was accompanied by a slow increase in bank deposit and lending rates, which on average peaked at around 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively, in March 1999 (Table 6). 9. The external current account deficit is estimated to have widened to 4.4 percent of GDP in 1998, from 2.2 percent in 1997, owing largely to strong import growth associated with the large credit expansion (nonmaquila imports increased by 17 percent) (Table 7). Available data show that nontraditional exports grew at a strong pace during 1998, but this reflected substantial overinvoicing induced by export subsidies.7 As INTEL’s plant came on 5 Central government noninterest current expenditure rose by 0.8 percentage point of GDP to 14.2 percent of GDP in 1998, owing to higher outlays on wages (due in part to new incentives for teachers), settlement of arrears to the social security institute, a substantial increase in export subsidies, and transfers to political parties related to the presidential elections (see Table 3). 6 The credit guidelines apply to both state and private banks. They seek to contain bank credit growth to 30 percent during the period October 1998-December 1999 and establish additional provisioning requirements in case banks exceed this limit. From December 1997 to March 1998 reserve requirements on demand deposits and deposits with maturities of less than 30 days were reduced from 18 to 15 percent. Presently, reserve requirements on all local currency deposits are 15 percent, while those on foreign currency deposits with maturities above 30 days are 5 percent. The difference in reserve requirements has encouraged dollarization. ’ Following the discovery late in 1998 of substantial export overinvoicing, the authorities are working on revising the export data for 1998 and previous years. At the same time, legal action has been initiated against the companies involved. The counterpart of the overinvoicing in the capital account has been higher outflows of private capital.

In the capital account, inflows of foreign direct investment remained at about 5 percent of GDP, but they were partially offset by outflows of other private capital prompted by global uncertainties and the relatively unattractive domestic interest rates that prevailed until September (see Table 5).8 As a result of the method of adjusting the exchange rate, the colbn remained virtually unchanged in real effective terms from December 1997 to June 1999 (Figure 2). 10. Developments so far in 1999 point to a decline in domestic demand growth following the increase in interest rates in the second half of 1998, and to a slowdown in activity in the agricultural and commercial sectors (coffee production fell in the first half of the year). In contrast, INTEL’s operations continue to increase at a strong pace. On this basis, the authorities project real GDP growth at 5 percent for 1999 as a whole. The fiscal position deteriorated significantly in the first half of the year. Relative to the same period of 1998, tax revenue increased by only 10% percent, owing to a court ruling that suspended some sanctions for tax noncompliance and a drop in nonmaquila imports that affected adversely customs receipts. Central government expenditure rose by about 20 percent, reflecting higher outlays on wages and a substantial increase in ,interest payments9 11. Since end-1998 the central bank has stepped up placements of short-term paper and 3-5 year dollar-denominated certificates of deposit to mop up liquidity. These actions, together with the ratification of the credit guidelines by presidential decree, have contributed to a decline in the pace of credit expansion to the private sector. Aided by a placement of bonds in international markets last April, NIR increased by US$425 million to about US$1.2 billion (2.2 months of imports of goods and services) from end-1998 to end- May, remaining at about that level thereafter.” Following the improvement in the reserve position, interest rates on open market paper have been reduced in steps by 450 basis points to ’ The interest rate differential between the 6-month rate on central bank paper (adjusted by the nominal rate of depreciation of the col6n) and -LIBOR remained at less than 1 percent during the first half of 1998, rising gradually to about 7% percent by end-1998. ’ In the first half of 1999, the deficit of the cemral government rose by about 1% percentage points of GDP to more than 5% percent of GDP on an annual basis. However, based on some measures discussed below, the staff estimates that the central government deficit would be 4.8 percent of GDP for the yealr as a whole. lo In April the authorities placed US$300 million (2.7 percent of GDP) in lo-year government bonds in international markets, with a spread of 412 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasury bonds. In mid-August 1999, NIR were equivalent to about 70 percent of the sum of base money and foreign currency deposits by resident banks at the central bank. < Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public180 160 140 120 100 80 60 Figure 2.

Although Costa Rica’s external debt indicators remain within an acceptable range, the average maturity of the domestic public debt is relatively short. Out of the total stock of domestic public debt (equivalent to 29 percent of GDP at end-1998), 60 percent (or more than 17 percent of GDP) was short term. At the same time, the foreign reserve cover of the short-term liabilities of the public sector (base money, central bank and government paper, and foreign currency deposits) was only 20 percent (Table 8). The external public debt relative to GDP has been falling in recent years, and at end-1998 it was equivalent to 28 percent of GDP, with virtually no short-term component. The ratio of gross international reserves to short-term external debt on a remaining maturity basis was 92 percent at end- 1998.‘* III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 13. The policy discussions focused on the authorities’ macroeconomic and structural policies for 1999 and the medium term. Early in 1999, the authorities announced their macroeconomic objectives for the period 1999-2001, which include the achievement of sustained real GDP growth of 6 percent a year, together with a reduction in inflation to 7 percent, by 2001. The staff cautioned that the policy stance envisaged by the authorities was likely to prove insufficient to achieve their objectives. In particular, it was felt that additional fiscal measures were required up front to avoid excessively high real interest rates and reduce the vulnerability of the economy, particularly in view of prevailing uncertainties in international financial markets. Also, the staff thought that it was important to accelerate the pace of structural reforms. 14. The authorities stressed that at this stage their main priority was to build political support to carry out their structural reform agenda, and that their room for maneuver in the fiscal area was limited by the need to avoid political disruptions that could affect adversely the negotiations on these reforms, They were more optimistic than the staff regarding the fiscal outlook for 1999-2000 and felt that fiscal pressures would ease significantly in 2001-2002, ” Following the recent reductions in interest rates, the differential between the 6-month rate on central bank paper (adjusted by the nominal rate of depreciation of the colon) and LJBOR is on the order of 3]% percent. ‘* This ratio excludes the external debt of the nonbank private sector due to lack of information.

A. Fiscal Policy 15. Discussions on fiscal policy focused on the recent deterioration in the fiscal position and possible ways to address it. Early in the year the authorities announced their intention to keep the overall public sector deficit at 3.3 percent of GDP in 1999. As the fiscal trends through May suggested that this target could be exceeded by a substantial margin, in July the government introduced budgetary cuts equivalent to 0.6 percentage point of GDP for the remainder of the year. Moreover, the assembly approved a new tax code restoring sanctions for tax noncompliance, which removes the features of the previous legislation that were considered unconstitutional by the courts. Partly because of more optimistic revenue projections but also due to the inclusion in revenue of some operations considered as financing by the staff, the authorities were of the view that the overall public sector deficit would be below their original target. l3 16. Even after taking into account the budgetary cuts and the possible revenue improvement associated with the new tax code, the staff estimates that the overall public sector deficit would widen to 4.3 percent of GDP in 1999, with the overall primary surplus declining to 1.7 percent of GDP, from 2 percent in 1998 (see Table 2). Notwithstanding the weak revenue performance in recent months, the staff projections indicate that for the year as a whole tax receipts relative to GDP would remain broadly unchanged in 1999, reflecting the full-year effect of an increase of 15 percentage points in gasoline taxes put into effect in August 1998, the phasing out of income tax incentives to the tourism sector, and the decision to subject export subsidies to the income tax. At the same time, central government expenditure would increase by about 1 percentage point of GDP, owing to higher interest payments and an increase in outlays on road infrastructure.‘4 In spite of recent adjustments in public prices,15 the financial position of the rest of the public sector is projected to register a l3 The authorities’ projections include as revenue the forgiveness of central government debt by several public agencies not included in the consolidated fiscal accounts. These operations, which are equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP and are of a nonrecurrent nature, have been classified as a financing item by the staff, I4 The wage bill relative to GDP is projected to increase somewhat in 1999, with government wages rising by 11% percent, or somewhat more than projected inflation. The wage bill will reflect additional effects from the incentives granted to teachers in previous years, and increases in employment in education and security. r5 Following the rise in international oil prices, gasoline prices were increased in several stages by about 60 percent during 1999 (presently the price of regular gasoline is equivalent to (continued. . ) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- slight deterioration in 1999, while the losses of the central bank would increase somewhat owing to higher interest payments. The staff prepared some preliminary projections for 2000, which suggest that the overall public sector deficit would decline to 3.8 percent of GDP due to an increase in tax revenue and lower interest payments. These projections incorporate the impact of several revenue measures that were postponed this year.lG 17. In view of the fiscal outlook, the staff stressed the need to take additional fiscal measures on the order of 1% percent of GDP on an annual basis, which together with lower interest payments, would allow for a reduction in the fiscal deficit to about 2 percent of GDP in 2000, and for its gradual elimination over th.e medium term. To that end, the staff recommended several possible options, including a substantial reduction of VAT exemptions, increasing the VAT rate from 13 to 15 percent, eliminating revenue earmarking to reduce expenditure rigidities (Box), aldopting a policy of wage restraint, and modifying certain special pension regimes with overgenerous benefits. l7 The authorities observed that at this stage it was not politically feasible to proceed with substantial modifications to the VAT or the special pension regimes. They indicated, however, their firm commitment to eliminating subsidies to nontraditional exports at end- 1999,” as well as their intention to adopt a mechanism of adjustment of government wages based on projected inflation rather than past inflation. In addition, following the recent rejection by the courts of an appeal against earmarking practices US$1.84 per gallon). Electricity prices were ralised by an average 14% percent in May 1999; cross subsidies were reduced by raising residential tariffs substantially more than industrial tariffs. l6 These revenue measures consist of a limited reduction of VAT exemptions (mostly on purchases by the public enterprises and insurance services); modifications to the income tax (including a reduction of exemptions and the unification of corporate income tax rates at the highest rate of 30 percent); an increase in the tax on cigarettes, beer, and alcoholic beverages (to be submitted to the assembly shortly); and the elimination of the tax on gross assets, several excises with low yields, and export taxes on coffee and bananas. (In the discussions, the staff favored to maintain the tax on gross assets, provided that exemptions are eliminated.) The staff estimated the combined yield of these measures at 0.4-0.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis. I7 For instance, pension benefits for teachers are substantially higher than those under the general regime administered by the Social Security Institute, and are subject to automatic price indexation. ” Export subsidies are provided by issuing certificates to cancel tax obligations. Subsidies will be eliminated at the end of the year, in line with existing contractual commitments, but their fiscal impact on a cash basis will continue until mid-2001.

Box. Earmarking of Revenues The central government budget displays a significant degree of rigidity stemming from the earmarking of revenues. Revenue earmarking is determined through several laws addressing specific revenue categories. The main specific earmarking provisions are: 30 percent of income taxes, together with 97% percent of property taxes must be transferred to the Special Fund for Higher Education (FEES); 20 percent of the value-added tax must be transferred to the Fund for Social Development and Family Allowances (FODESAF); 50 percent of the registration tax on automobiles is allocated to the minisuy of public works; and receipts from the special tax on fuels introduced in August 1998 are allocated to the National Highways Commission (CONAVI) to finance road infrastructure. Generally speaking, the main sources of earmarking are the income tax (approximately 45 percent is earmarked), the VAT (22 percent), and the special tax on fuels (100 percent). Besides the specific earmarking practices described above, which are specified in ordinary legislation, constitutional provisions introduce additional rigidities to the budgetary process. In particular, the constitution establishes that budgeted expenditures for the judiciary should be as a minimum equivalent to 6 percent of current revenue. If this constitutional provision is taken into account, the estimate of revenue earmarked for specific purposes rises to about 40 percent of total revenue, or close to 7 percent of GDP. B. Monetary Policy 18. The authorities’ credit program for 1999, which is consistent with a fiscal deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP, assumes an increase in private financial assets somewhat faster than nominal GDP (in line with developments so far this year), and targets a reserve accumulation of at least US$200 million for 1999 as a whole (NIR are projected to decline during the remainder of the year because of the need to cover the financing requirement of the public sector). Given the larger fiscal deficit now in prospect, the staff envisages that private credit expansion would need to slow to about 19% percent in December 1999 in order to achieve the targeted reserve accumulation (see Table 5). The staff cautioned the authorities to monitor credit developments closely and offer interest rates on open market paper sufficiently attractive to absorb the required amounts of liquidity. The authorities observed that notwithstanding the recent reduction in interest rates, the central bank had continued to place significant amounts of paper. They noted that interest rate policy would be primarily geared at keeping interest rates attractive vis-a-vis dollar rates, but that they would stand ready to raise interest rates as needed to comply with their reserve target. They also indicated that they would maintain the credit guidelines in place at least through the remainder of the year in order to facilitate a further reduction in the pace of lending by the state banks. So far, these guidelines have not been binding for the private banks. 19. The authorities have taken steps to facilitate the development of the secondary market by standardizing the securities sold in the primary auction conducted by the central bank. Also, they are studying extending participation in the auctions-which is currently restricted Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- to brokerage houses-to large investors at the retail level in order to increase competition. However, a number of distortions still prevent an efficient finctioning of the central bank auction, as well as the develo:pment of the interbank market, The staff is of the view that correcting these problems requires the elimination of certain preferential treatment currently enjoyed by state banks, which has contributed to market segmentation and a concentration of liquidity in these banks (see paragraph 26). Also, the government should set the yield of Treasury securities placed with nonfinancial public entities at market rates, to reflect transparently the true cost of financing the central government deficit.lg In addition, in line with MAE recommendations, the authorities need to improve the weekly forecasts of the financing needs of the public sector, so as to better determine the amount of securities to be auctioned. C. External Sector Policies 20. Staff projections point to a decline in the external current account deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 1999 (see Table 7). Although the trade deficit is projected to drop markedly because of a tirther substantial increase in net maquila exports by INTEL, this improvement would have a counterpart in a corresponding increase in profit remittances. Nonmaquila exports would fall by almost 9 percent in 1999, owing to the drop in average coffee prices and a decline in nontraditional exports attributable in part to the correction of export overinvoicing registered in the past and, to a lesser extent, to slower regional growth and increased competition from third countries in the U.S. market. Nonmaquila imports would remain virtually unchanged in 1999, owing to the tighter credit policy stance. The external current account deficit is expected to be more than covered by the surplus in the capital account. Net external borrowing by the public sector would be on the order of 1% percent of GDP in 1999, as a significant increase in amortization payments would be offset by the recent bond placement in international markets and the expected disbursement of remaining tranches under two structural loans from the IDB.*’ In the private capital account, inflows of direct foreign investment would decline to some 4 percent of GDP because of lower investment by INTEL, while other private capital flows woulld shift to a small surplus. lg This would also remove the incentive that these entities have to deposit their excess funds in the state banks, which offer more attractive interest rates than those paid by the Treasury on this specific type of securities (public entities are not allowed to make deposits in private banks). *’ These disbursements would support the revenue measures planned for 2000, improvements in tax administration, some reforms in the prudential framework for the banking system, and the completion of the regulatory framework for the securities law.

Costa Rica is expected to provide debt relief on its bilateral claims on Nicaragua on terms comparable to those agreed by Paris Club creditors. In the discussions, the authorities expressed concern about the adverse impact that granting such relief could have on Costa Rica’s external position.*’ 22. Regarding exchange rate policy, the authorities indicated that they intend to continue adjusting the exchange rate daily on the basis of the differential between inflation in Costa Rica and its main trading partners. Since its adoption in the mid-1980s, this policy has been largely successful in avoiding an erosion of external competitiveness, and the staff supports its maintenance. Although nonmaquila exports are projected to decline in 1999, to a large extent this reflects temporarily depressed coffee exports and the statistical implications of the problem of export overinvoicing referred to above. The staff underscored that competitiveness will be further enhanced by strengthening the fiscal position and implementing structural reforms to improve productivity. Also, the inflationary inertia associated with the present exchange rate policy could be reduced by introducing a mechanism for adjusting minimum wages in the private sector by projected inflation rather than past inflation. 23. As noted above, during the 1990s Costa Rica has made substantial progress in the area of trade liberalization. The weighted average import tariff was reduced to 6.3 percent in 1999, from about 20 percent in 1990, and on the lo-point scale of trade restrictiveness developed by Fund staff, Costa Rica has an estimated index of 4. In line with the Central American Common Market, in July 1999 the authorities lowered tariffs on imports of intermediate goods from outside the Central American region from 7-12 percent to 6-l 1 percent, and those on consumption goods from 17 percent to 16 percent. Tariffs on intermediate and consumption goods would be lowered further to 5-10 percent and 15 percent, respectively, by January 2000.** The authorities are working on accelerating tariff reductions under a trade agreement with Mexico and are involved in bilateral trade negotiations with Chile, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. Moreover, in 1998 Costa Rica concluded a bilateral trade agreement with the Dominican Republic. *’ The authorities argued that Nicaragua’s debt with Costa Rica was large (about 5 percent of GDP) and that granting debt relief on terms comparable to Paris Club creditors would affect significantly Costa Rica’s international reserve position (as noted in footnote 2, part of this debt, amounting to US$232 million, is included in the reserve assets of the central bank). ** Presently, only 6 percent of the tariff lines are subject to tariffs above 20 percent, and there are no quantitative trade restrictions. Several items (in particular poultry, some agricultural and dairy products, and automobiles) are still subject to tariffs between 50 percent and 105 percent, and a few to tariffs of 250 percent. In December 1998 the authorities lowered import taxes on new cars and raised those on used cars, and last January they reached agreement with representatives of the agricultural sector on a program of tariff reductions for some agricultural items, including milk and poultry.

In the structural area, many initiatives are being considered but the prospects for early results are unclear. Shortly after taking ofice in May 1998, the current administration initiated a process of consultations with different sectors of society to build consensus on a structural reform agenda. However, so far the authorities have not been able to garner congressional support for the proposals that emerged from these consultations.23 The slow progress on the structural front has delayed negotiations on new structural reform loans from the IDB and the World Bank. 25. The authorities indicated that the opening up of key areas still controlled by state monopolies (electricity generation, telecommunications, and the insurance sectors) to private sector participation was crucial to improving the quality, reducing the cost, and meeting the projected increase in the demand for these services. Although so far legislation for these reforms has encountered difficulties in the assembly, the authorities remain hopeful that it could be approved before end-1999. In the area of pension and severance payments reform, the authorities have submitted draft legislation to introduce mandatory private pension funds that would supplement the existing publicly managed pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system; extend coverage of the poor under the existing noncontributive pension system; and reform the severance payments regime by establishing that contributions will be deposited in the workers’ individual accounts.24 Progress on these reforms is linked to the evolution of the political negotiations for the demonopolization of key sectors. Also, the authorities intend to 23 Progress was made in 1998 in the area of price deregulation through the elimination of price controls on coffee, cement, and milk. Aside from regulated public services, the only remaining item subject to price controls is rice. 24 Under the current regime employers are expected to make provisions (8.33 percent of wages) to cover severance payments equivalent to one monthly wage for every year of employment, up to a maximum of 8 years, in case of unjustified dismissal. Under the new regime, employers would make mandatory contributions (3 percent of wages), which would be deposited in each worker’s individual account (2/3 of these contributions would be automatically transferred every month to the worker’s individual pension fund). Severance payments in case of dismissal would be equivalent to the whole amount accumulated in the worker’s account (without any time limit), plus an additional 5.33 percent Iof wages for every year of employment, up to a maximum of eight years. In case of voluntary separation, workers would be entitled to receive the whole amount accumulated in their accounts. The new regime would increase labor costs (which are relatively high) for small- and medium-size firms, given that in practice most large firms are already meeting their severance obligations every year by paying voluntarily one monthly salary in December.

As noted above, the Costa Rican financial system is dominated by large state banks, which account for more than 75 percent of deposits (Table 9). At the same time, relatively high nonremunerated reserve requirements and the requirement that private banks deposit 17 percent of their demand deposits with state banks at below market rates have encouraged off-balance-sheet operations and the development of a large unregulated banking sector formed by offshore affiliates of domestic banks. The authorities were of the view that the financial system was sound, noting that the available indicators show an improvement in recent years (nonperforming loans are estimated at 4*X percent of the total loan portfolio, compared with 6% percent in 1996) and that all banks were complying with the capital adequacy requirement (Tables 10 and 1 l).*’ However, it is very difficult at this stage to make a proper assessment of the overall system because of inadequate information about the status of off-balance-sheet operations (estimated to be equivalent to 170 percent of the total assets of the system) and offshore operations (which are at least as large as onshore activities). In addition, although information provided by the Superintendency of Financial Institutions (SUGEF) suggests that the large credit expansion by the Banco National during 1998 had not led so far to a deterioration of the quality of the bank’s loan portfolio, the authorities recognized that they need to continue monitoring developments in this area very closely. 27. As a first step toward establishing a consolidated supervision of financial intermedi- aries, effective November 1998 the government introduced new regulations requiring all financial conglomerates to register with the SUGEF, which would allow the authorities to obtain better information about their offshore activities. The staff underscored the need to move expeditiously toward implementing an effective supervision on a consolidated basis by bringing these activities under the supervisory scope of the SUGEF, and stressed the importance of tightening regulations concerning connected lending and shortening the period during which banks are allowed to accrue interest on problem 25 Presently, the minimum retirement age is 60 for women and 62 for men. The authorities plan to increase the minimum retirement age gradually to 65 for all individuals. The legislation to open up the insurance sector envisages using part of the proceeds from the sale of the commercial portfolio of the National Insurance Institute (INS) to strengthen the noncontributive pension system and the special pension regime for teachers. 26 State banks are subject to the same prudential regulations applicable to private banks. Last January the capital adequacy requirement was raised from 9 to 10 percent. Although the Superintendency intervened two cooperative banks (Federal and Bancoop) in the last quarter of 1998 because of problems in the real estate sector, and more recently two small nonbank financial intermediaries due to fraudulent activities, these episodes did not have systemic repercussions.

An MAE mission is expected to visit San Jose before end-1999 to further examine the situation of the banking system and the prudential framework. 28. The government has initiated consultations with representatives of the financial sector and members of the assembly to modify financial sector legislation. Reforms under consideration include the removal of some impediments to the establishment of branches of foreign banks (the existing law allows only the establishment of fully-owned subsidiaries), eliminating the above-mentioned requirement that private banks maintain minimum balances with state banks, and introducing a limited deposit insurance scheme for ah banks (presently deposits at state banks enjoy full government guarantee but those at private banks are unprotected). At the same time, the assembly is considering a draft central bank charter law that authorizes the remuneration of reserve requirements (currently remuneration is only allowed for reserve requirements in excess of 15 percent), and gives more autonomy to the board of directors 29. The staff urged an acceleration of these reforms, but cautioned the authorities to maintain for the time being the full deposit guarantee for state banks while introducing limited deposit coverage for private banks (with funding provided by premiums levied on all banks), so as to ease possible concerns of depositors at state banks. In May 1998 the authorities began implementation of a gradual plan to recapitalize the central bank wit.h nonnegotiable long-term government instrumlents remunerated at rates that increase over time. The staff underscored the need to speed up the recapitalization with negotiable instruments that could be used for monetary operations. Recently the assembly passed legislation authorizing the use of remaining disbursements under the structural loans from the IDB to repay government debt with the central bank. 30. The authorities are evaluating the possibility of privatizing the Banco de Costa Rica (the second largest state bank) and using the proceeds to repay domestic debt (a proposal along these lines submitted by the previous administration was rejected by the assembly). In addition, they are giving consideration to scaling down the commercial activities of the Banco National and transforming it into a second-tier development institution, and to privatizing BICSA (an international bank owned by state banks) and the state liquor company (FANAL). Some of these initiatives have been delayed on several occasions in recent years. The authorities were not in a position to specify a timetable for these reforms. 27 Current regulations establish that the sum of loans to connected parties should not exceed 80 percent of a bank’s capital. In practice there is no bank with a ratio above 50 percent. The supervisory authorities indicated their intention to reduce the limit to 50 percent within a short time, and then gradually to 25 percent, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- E. Social, Environmental, and other Policies 31. Costa Rica’s social indicators remain among the strongest in Latin America and the developing world. Official estimates indicate that the incidence of poverty has declined from 32 percent of households in 1991 to 19.7 percent in 1998, with central government outlays on the social sectors increasing from 8 percent of GDP in 1991 to more than 10 percent in 1998. As part of its strategy to reduce poverty further, the present administration has submitted to the assembly draft legislation aimed at eliminating the earmarking of resources to programs that are not well targeted to the poor. Also, the authorities intend to strengthen the database to better identify the population in poverty conditions and to eliminate overlapping in social expenditure. Furthermore, the allocation of resources in the education sector could be improved by redirecting resources from tertiary to secondary education. 32. In August 1998 President Rodriguez established the Commission 2000 to coordinate the government’s strategy to deal with the Y2K problem. The authorities indicated that they were confident that the country’s main nonfinancial public institutions, the central bank, the stock exchange, and the large commercial banks would be ready to deal with the problem without major disruptions. However, some problems have been detected in the customs area and the local governments, and uncertainties remain with respect to the degree of readiness of smaller financial institutions, Presently, institutions are at the stage of testing the operational suitability of critical systems, which is expected to be completed in September. Both the public entities and financial intermediaries have been required to prepare contingency plans to deal with possible difficulties. 33. Concerning the environment, in April 1998 the assembly approved legislation to promote biodiversity, protect the ecological system, and improve water utilization; the government is currently working in the regulatory framework for its implementation. Also, in mid-December 1998 the authorities submitted to the assembly an initiative that seeks to establish appropriate user charges for environmental services. In addition, the assembly is considering legislation to combat corruption and strengthen accountability in the use of budgetary resources, and steps have been taken to reduce corruption in the customs area. 34. As noted above, Costa Rica’s statistical base presents several weaknesses (see Appendix IV). The authorities indicated that they would like to subscribe to the SDDS. To that end, they are working on strengthening the monetary and balance of payments statistics with technical support from the Fund, and have requested assistance from STA through a long-term expert to improve the public finance statistics2* In addition, they have been working on improving the methodology for calculating the national accounts, which is 28 In the discussions the authorities indicated that they intend to extend the coverage of the public sector accounts to several public entities not included in the sample, which have been recording surpluses in their operations.

The staff stressed the need to develop statistics on Icorporate external debt. IV. MEDIUM-'TERMOUTLOOK 35. The staff has prepared both a passive and an active scenario for [the period 1999- 2003 that incorporate updated projections of commodity prices and possible financing flows. 36. The passive scenario assumes a gradual fiscal adjustment effort (in line with the authorities’ plans), and no major advances on structural reforms over the medium term. Following a decline to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2000, the overall public sector deficit would narrow f?u-ther to 2.6 percent by 2003, based on the phasing out of export subsidies and a gradual decline in interest payrnents (Table 12). Mainly because of the lack of progress in the structural area, the need to maintain relatively high real interest rates to tap domestic markets, and the low level of investment in infrastructure, real GDP growth would slow to 4 percent a year over the medium term (the average growth rate experienced over the past decade), while inflation would remain in the double digits. 37. The external current account deficit would narrow to about 3 percent of GDP in 2002, reflecting the gradual improvement in public savings. In the capital account, the scenario assumes bond placements of US$250 million a year in 2000-2003, as there would be difficulties in accessing structural loans from multilateral institutions because of the slow progress on structural reforms. Direct investment flows relative to GDP would decline somewhat over the medium term, and NIR would increase slightly to less than 2 months of imports of goods and services (Table 13). Under these circumstances, Costa Rica would remain highly vulnerable to changes in the external environment, particularly taking into account the heavy dependence on foreign financing in international financial markets. 38. The active scenario incorporates additional fiscal measures equivailent to 1.2 percent of GDP on an annual basis and assumes the implementation of the government’s structural reform agenda. The overall public sector deficit would decline to about 2 percent of GDP in 2000, before moving gradually to balance in 2003 (Table 14) (the operational balance would shift from a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 1999 to a surplus of 0.2 percent in 2003). Under these circumstances, real domestic interest rates would decline substantially, and the improvement in public savings would provide room for an increase in public investment in the outer years. Real GDP growth would be lower than in the passive scenario in 2000 because of the initial impact of fiscal adjustment, but would increase gradually to 5% percent a year in 2002-2003. Inflation would decline to 6 percent by 2002, in line with the authorities’ medium-term objective. The external current account deficit is projected to narrow to below 2 percent in 2002 (Table 15). In the capital account, the projections assume disbursements of US$lOO million a year from multilateral institutions in support of structural reforms, bond Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- placements equivalent to US$150 million a year in 2000-2001, and the privatization of the Banco de Costa Rica in 2001. Direct investment flows relative to GDP would be higher than in the passive scenario, with FJIR strengthening to about three months of imports of goods and services by 2002. Because of lesser reliance on external borrowing, the external debt and debt-service ratios would be lower than in the passive scenario (Table 16). V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 39. During the last decade Costa Rica made significant progress in opening up the trade system, diversifying its export base, attracting foreign investment, and improving social conditions. However, successive administrations have been unable to reduce the fiscal deficit on a sustained basis and deepen structural reforms. Moreover, the economy has remained vulnerable because of the relatively large domestic public debt with short-term maturity. 40. While real GDP growth picked up sharply in 1998 to 6.2 percent, the large credit expansion, particularly from state banks, contributed to a weakening in the external position and an increase in inflation. The outlook for 1999 is for a slowdown in growth to a still comfortable rate of 5 percent, a weakening of the fiscal position, and a decline in inflation- although this would still be in the double digits. The international reserve position has strengthened in recent months following a large government bond placement in international markets and steps to slow credit growth. 41. The authorities’ medium-term objectives are to achieve sustained real GDP growth of 6 percent a year, together with a reduction in inflation to single digits, by 2001. While these objectives are feasible, their attainment would require putting the public finances on a sounder footing and accelerating structural reforms. 42. The staff believes that the fiscal stance envisaged by the authorities is likely to prove insufficient to achieve their medium-term objectives, and that additional fiscal measures are required to ease pressures on real interest rates, lower the heavy domestic debt burden, and reduce the vulnerability of the economy, particularly in view of uncertainties in emerging markets. The staff has indicated that possible measures to reduce the deficit include reducing VAT exemptions substantially, increasing the VAT rate, and modifying certain special pension regimes with overgenerous benefits. In addition, following the recent rejection by the courts of an appeal against existing earmarking practices, the authorities should press ahead with legislation to reduce budget rigidities, eliminate unproductive outlays, and improve resource allocation. Adoption of a policy of wage restraint in the public sector, including by adjusting wages on the basis of projected inflation rather than past inflation, will also contribute to fiscal consolidation. The staff welcomes the recent approval of a new tax code restoring sanctions for tax noncompliance, as well as the authorities’ commitment to eliminate export subsidies by year-end. It also encourages them to move ahead with their plans to improve targeting of social expenditure to the really poor.

In the monetary area, since end-1998 the central bank has intensified placements of open market paper and certificates of deposit. However, achievement of the reserve target for 1999 requires a further decline in credit growth to the private sector during the second half of the year. To that end, the authorities should monitor credit developments closely and stand ready to raise interest rates on central bank and government paper as needed to absorb the required amounts of liquidity. The efftciency of monetary instruments is seriously impaired by market segmentation and the dominant role played by st.ate banks. Moreover, the practice of setting interest rates on Treasury securities placed with some nonfinancial public entities at below market levels should be corrected promptly to enhance fiscal transparency. Also, the authorities are encouraged to widen participation in the central bank auctions and improve forecasts of the financing needs of the public sector to better estimate the amounts to be auctioned. 44. The current policy of adjusting the exchange rate daily on the lbasis of the differential between inflation in Costa Rica and its main trading partners has been largely successful in avoiding an erosion of external competitiveness, and has served Costa Rica well. Achieving a sustainable improvement in external competitiveness over the medium term requires a strengthening of the fiscal position and implementation of structural reforms to increase productivity. Moreover, introduction of a mechanism of adjustment for minimum wages in the private sector based on projected inflation rather than past inflation should contribute to reducing inflationary inertia. 45. Prospects on structural reforms remain unclear because of uncertainties about the outcome of negotiations in the assembly. The most pressing need is to open up electricity generation, telecommunications, and the insurance sectors to private sector participation, so as to facilitate modernization, reduce costs, and satisfy the projected increase in demand for these services, In addition, there is a need to move ahead with pension reform by introducing private pension funds and adopting measures to ensure the actuarial viability of the publicly managed system. 46. In the financial system, the competitive advantage enjoyed by state banks, together with relatively high nonremunerated reserve requirements, has encouraged large off-balance sheet and offshore operations. The recent adoption of regulations to obtain information about offshore activities is a good though modest start. The authorities should move expeditiously to bring these activities under the regulatory scope of the Superintendency of Financial Institutions through the establishment of an effective consolidated supervision. In addition, regulations on connected lending and accrual of interest on problem loans should be tightened, and the authorities should continue to monitor closely the loan portfolio of the Banco National, following its large credit expansion last year. 47. To begin leveling the playing field between state and private banks, the authorities should act without delay to eliminate the requirement that private banks deposit part of their demand deposits with state banks at below market interest rates. In addition, there is a need to move forcefully with the privatization of the Banco de Costa Rica Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - and BICSA and use the proceeds to repay domestic debt; scale down the activities of the Banco National by transforming it into a second-tier development institution; and remove existing impediments to the establishment of branches of foreign banks. Also, the government should speed up the recapitalization of the central bank with negotiable instruments. Regarding deposit insurance, the authorities will be well advised to maintain for the time being the full deposit guarantee for state banks while introducing limited deposit coverage for private banks, with funding provided by premiums levied on all banks. 48. Efforts should be intensified to strengthen the statistical base, which presents several weaknesses and inhibits an adequate surveillance of macroeconomic developments. In particular, there is a need to improve the national accounts data, further strengthen the monetary statistics, revise the export data in light of large export over-invoicing, and start developing statistics on corporate external debt. 49. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Costa Rica be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Areas of concern include the consistency of data on the financing of the public sector, timeliness and coverage of the national accounts by use, delays in the availability of commercial bank accounts, weaknesses in the compilation of some components of the balance of payments, and deficient trade statistics. The authorities are cooperating fully in providing available data to the Fund through electronic means and aim at subscribing to the SDDS by end-1999. In addition, the National Institute for Statistics and Census was created in November 1998 with the objective of monitoring the collection and quality of macroeconomic data. Real sector The quality of source data for the national accounts needs to be improved by strengthening statistical legislation, establishing an economic sampling frame, and conducting economic censuses. The estimates of GDP using the expenditure approach contain weaknesses related to the estimation of private consumption, gross fixed capital formation, and changes in inventories. Presently, the central bank is working on updating the base year (from 1966 to 1991) used to estimate the national accounts at constant prices. Preliminary estimates suggest that GDP at current prices could be up to 25 percent higher than is estimated using the 1966 methodology. A STA technical assistance mission will visit San Jose in November 1999 to assist the authorities with the implementation of the new system of national accounts. Government finance statistics The staff has noted some problems in the compilation of data on the operations of the central government, which derived from combining inappropriately information on a cash and an accrual basis. Moreover, there are significant discrepancies between the above-the-line fiscal figures and estimates of the deficit from the financing side. Costa Rica reports data for publication in IFS and the GFS yearbook. Monetary statistics Following two technical assistance missions in 1998, improvements have been made to the classification, coverage, and timeliness of the money and banking statistics, in particular those pertaining to the Central Bank of Costa Rica. However, problems remain regarding the reports of other depository corporations, which lack the degree of detail to clearly identify the sources of deposits and users of loans to facilitate the sectorization of accounts of banks. There is also a need to collect more information and extend the coverage of data to some transactions that are currently recorded as off-balance-sheet operations, to offshore Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - APPENDIX IV operations of bank conglomerates, and to financial institutions that are de facto performing the functions of depository corporations (e.g., cooperatives, mutual savings and loan associations). Balance of payments statistics In 1998 the central bank modified the balance of payments presentation in line with the fifth edition of the Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual, making some necessary revisions to the historical data. Definitive balance of payments data are produced with a delay of at least one year and are oflen subject to large revisions in subsequent years. The wea:knesses in the balance of payments data stem from delays in undertaking, processing, and validating surveys of private companies, inaccurate trade statistics, and inappropriate recording of some financial transactions of the nonfinancial private sector. There are no reliable data on the external debt of the private sector. STA sent a balance of payments statistics mission to Costa Rica in mid-July to assist the central bank in the collection of balance of payments data.

RECENT ACTIVITIES The first and second tranches of a Public Sector Reform Loan and an Investment Sector Loan were disbursed in the last quarter of 1995 and in December 1997, respectively. In addition, during 1997 the IDB approved a technical cooperation program for US$12.7 million to support structural reforms, as well as an education loan for US%28 million to support preschool and junior high education. Following a request from the Costa Rican authorities, a Multisector Credit Program was canceled in 1996. III. FUTUREPLANS The third tranches of the two sectoral loans referred to above, for a total amount of US$58 million, are expected to be disbursed this year. In addition, the government has been working with IDB staff on the design and implementation of a large Sectoral Reform Program, but the nature of structural reforms is still being discussed by the authorities with the opposition. The authorities have also requested a new loan for US$60 million to finance a reform to the official land register.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Costa Rica On October --- , 1999, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Costa Rica.’ Background During the 1990s Costa Rica has continued to make progress in opening up the trade system, diversifying its export base, attracting substantial inflows of foreign direct investment, and improving social conditions. However, efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit on a sustained basis have proven elusive, and there is a pressing need to open up key sectors to private sector participation and to move ahead with reforms of the pension regime and the financial system. Macroeconomic policy in 1998 was characterized by a strong expansion in aggregate demand associated with a large increase in credit to the private sector by the two largest state banks. The overall public sector deficit (accrual basis) declined slightly to 3.2 percent of GDP owing in part to an increase in tax revenue. In the balance of payments, the current account deficit widened to 4.4 percent of GDP, from 2.2 percent in 1997, because of strong import growth. Inflows of foreign direct investment remained large, but they were offset in part by oufflows of other private capital. Net international reserves declined through September but recovered subsequently as the authorities raised interest rates on central bank paper and took steps to restrain government expenditure. For 1998 as a whole, NIR dropped by US$150 million to the equivalent of 1 W months, of imports of goods and services. Real GDP growth picked up to 6.2 percent in 1998, reflecting the surge in domestic demand together with the initiation of ‘Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Inflation rose to 12.4 percent, from 11.2 percent in 1997, notwithstanding the decline in international oil prices. Developments in 1999 point to a slowdown in real GDP growth to 5 percent for the year as a whole, and a decline in end-year inflation to about 10 percent. The staff estimates that the overall public sector deficit could increase to above 4 percent of GDP in 1999, owing mainly to higher interest payments. Following steps to slow credit growth and a large government bond placement in international markets, NIR strengthened by US$425 million to 2.2 months of imports of goods and services from end-1998 to end-May 1999, remaining at about that level thereafter. Central bank interest rates have been lowered following the improvement in the resewe position. With a drop in prices of agricultural products, the 12-month rate of inflation declined to 9.1 percent in July. In the structural area, the current administration has submitted draft legislation to the assembly to open up electricity generation, telecommunications, and the insurance sectors to private sector participation; as well as to reform the pension and severance payments systems. However, so far the authorities have encountered difficulties to garner congressional support for these reforms. Executive Board Assessment <Begin Typing Here> Public Information Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public.
