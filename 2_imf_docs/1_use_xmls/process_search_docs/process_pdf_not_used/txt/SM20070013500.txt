INTRODUCTION 1.      The main economic challenge facing Turkmenistan is to transform itself into a market economy and better utilize its natural resources for the benefit of its people. During previous Article IV consultations, staff recommended measures to reduce inflation, improve fiscal management, and undertake systemic reforms. The authorities have been responsive to a number of macroeconomic management recommendations and have reduced inflation considerably. However, there has been little progress at systemic reforms. The late President Niyazov, who led Turkmenistan from independence in 1991 until his death in December 2006, stressed economic policies guided by central plans that focused on state control of strategic sectors. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has ranked Turkmenistan as having made very little progress in transition.  2.      Since his inauguration in mid-February 2007, President Berdymukhamedov has stated that overall policies will continue broadly unchanged, but he has also initiated reforms in social, agricultural, and information technology areas, and sought to strengthen international relations.     3.      Reflecting the streamlined procedures of this Article IV consultation, the discussions focused on two key policy issues — the appropriate macroeconomic policy mix to keep underlying inflation low, and the unification of the exchange system.   II.   RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK 4.      The external environment has improved considerably since the 2005 Article IV consultation. Turkmenistan’s gas export prices increased from $44 per thousand cubic meters (tcm) in 2004 (with half under barter arrangements) to $65 per tcm in early 2006 (all for cash), and to $100 per tcm from late 2006.1 The current account surplus widened in 2006 reflecting the resulting strong growth of export revenue, as well as a decline in imports as some large projects were completed. Gross international reserves almost doubled to $8 billion (18 months of imports) in 2006, with half of hydrocarbon export revenue over the past two years effectively saved, while external debt was reduced further.                                                  1 This price is still well below the Russian gas price for western Europe ($230 per tcm).

Economic growth appears to have remained robust. The staff estimates that real GDP growth in 2006 was in the 8–10 percent range, with strong performances in the construction and services sectors. This is lower than the authorities’ estimate of 16 percent real growth, mainly due to methodological differences in apportioning the recent increase in hydrocarbon export prices to quality improvements.  6.      The authorities pursued tight fiscal and monetary policies to reduce inflation to 7 percent in late 2006, just below the Central Bank of Turkmenistan’s (CBT) target of 8 percent. The absence of wage increases combined with smaller food price increases also helped to lower inflation. The outcome in nominal terms for total government expenditure in 2006 was lower than the budget by about 2½ percentage points of GDP due to the tighter implementation of pension eligibility requirements, increases in medical user charges (netted against expenditure), and saving of the budget’s contingency allowance. Hydrocarbon revenue exceeded the budget by 3 percentage points of GDP due to higher gas export prices. As a result, the state budget registered a surplus of 5 percent of GDP compared to a planned zero balance. However, off-budget government investment remained very high. Credit to state enterprises was virtually flat during the year (after a significant write-off of agricultural debts) but credit to the private sector increased by 15 percent. Manat broad money growth of 11 percent was substantially below the growth of nominal GDP.  024681012141618Mar-03Sep-03Mar-04Sep-04Mar-05Sep-05Mar-06Sep-0612-month percentage changeOverall CPI Food, drink, & tobaccoSource: Data provided by authorities.

Economic prospects for 2007 and the medium-term remain favorable. Volumes of gas exports are expected to increase in 2007 and beyond, with further investment in gas fields as well as intentions to develop alternative gas markets (only existing pipelines are included in the projections). Gas export prices are likely to rise further over the medium-term. As a result, the current account is projected to remain in large surplus with continued sizeable increases in international reserves. With the very low external debt and large international reserves, there are no financial sustainability concerns. The authorities aim to limit reserve money growth to 12 percent and manat broad money growth to 19 percent in 2007.2 They explained that these targets were consistent with their objective of reducing inflation to 6 percent by end 2007, and expected that the significant increase in imports would help to dampen demand pressures.  III.   MAIN POLICY CHALLENGES 8.      The two interrelated policy challenges at the core of this year’s consultation were: (i) the appropriate macroeconomic policy mix to keep inflation low; and (ii) the unification of the official and the parallel exchange rates. Unification would not only provide pressure for broader structural reforms, including market mechanisms for key agricultural products, but also support macroeconomic reforms, such as for fiscal management, monetary policy, and banking, as well as to ensure funding for social sector initiatives.                                                  2 Total broad money is projected to grow much more rapidly due to the continued rapid increase of foreign currency deposits of state enterprises at the CBT. Since these deposits (mainly the Gas and Oil Fund) are redeposited abroad by the CBT, they do not have a significant domestic monetary impact. 200520062007Est.Est.Proj.Real GDP growth 1/9.09.010.0CPI (end-of-period)10.47.26.0Reserve money 3.316.412.0Manat broad money5.511.019.0Budget balance, percent of GDP0.85.10.4Current account balance, percent of GDP5.115.312.2Gross reserves, months of imports14.918.222.5   Sources: Turkmen authorities and Fund staff estimates and projections.Selected Macroeconomic Indicators, 2005–07(Annual percent change)   1/ Real GDP for 2005 and 2006 are staff estimates, which differ from those by the authorities.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 6   A.   Macroeconomic Policy Stance 9.      The authorities reiterated their commitment to align their budgetary stance with their macroeconomic objectives. The 2007 budget was framed as balanced, with a 10 percent increase in both revenue and expenditure compared to the 2006 budget. In comparison with the 2006 outcome, hydrocarbon revenues were assumed at only a slightly higher nominal level (despite a 30 percent increase in gas export prices), and expenditures would be increased by 30 percent, with greater spending for road construction and the social sector. Reflecting the new government’s initiatives in the social area, and in line with previous Fund advice, a planned mid-year budget adjustment will increase spending by an additional 1 percent of GDP to cover new programs in education, health, and social security. Nevertheless, the overall fiscal balance is expected to remain in a small surplus because hydrocarbon revenue is likely to be significantly higher than budgeted.  10.      The authorities agreed with staff that wage and pension increases announced for 2008 should be reviewed. They explained that the proposal made in late 2006 to double wages at the start of 2008 was only an intention, and that the government is now considering lower increases, based on affordability and consistency with other macro-economic objectives. Increases in the 50–75 percent range (the first in three years) are under consideration, which would result in a deficit of 2–3½ percent of GDP.3 No wage increases are planned for 2009. 11.      The CBT acknowledged that care is needed in managing monetary policy in view of the large swing in the fiscal position. The staff concurred that the approach adopted in 2005–06 of tightening macroeconomic policies had reduced inflation, but was concerned that the use of direct credit and other controls had tightly constrained bank lending and were distortionary. Using these “expenditure-reduction” instruments to offset the demand impact of the widening of the nonhydrocarbon budget deficit in 2007–08 would again substantially crowd out the private sector. The staff stressed that reforms to monetary policy operations were needed to enable the authorities to meet their 2007 inflation target with their monetary program, which assumes higher credit and manat broad money growth than in 2006.                                                  3 Without sterilization, the 2008 budget deficit would increase manat broad money by 30 percent and add considerably to inflation. While sterilization would cost about $0.6 billion at the official exchange rate, the envisaged exchange system reforms would reduce this cost to about $0.1 billion.  2008BudgetActualBudgetAdj.Proj.BudgetTotal revenue19.822.521.823.628.5Total expenditure19.716.621.523.031.6Overall balance0.15.80.40.5-3.1Nonhydrocarbon balance-8.9-6.3-12.3-13.6-19.3Overall balance0.15.10.30.4-1.9Nonhydrocarbon balance-7.8-5.6-9.1-10.0-11.7State Budget, 2006–0820062007Sources: Turkmen authorities; and Fund staff estimates.(In trillions of manat)(In percent of GDP)Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 7   12.      In the context of balance of payments surpluses, the staff argued that it would be better for monetary and exchange rate policies to divert domestic demand into imports rather than reduce demand further. This could be achieved by allowing an appreciation in the free market exchange rate by selling foreign exchange into this market. This policy would sterilize the monetary effects of the higher nonhydrocarbon deficit and reduce inflation via the appreciation of the market exchange rate.4 Some changes in the exchange system would be needed to enable this, especially an increase in the foreign exchange held directly by the CBT and available for discretionary monetary and foreign exchange operations (the bulk of international reserves is kept in the Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund), and the reactivation of the commercial bank market for foreign exchange.  B.   Exchange Rate Unification  13.      The authorities recognized that the current multiple exchange rate system has important disadvantages and that unification would be easier with the favorable external environment (Box 1). The CBT agreed to review the issue, develop a phased approach to unification, and seek approval from other parts of the government. Staff discussed specific mechanisms for unification and offered follow-up technical assistance. The authorities indicated that they would initially draw on their earlier experience with the commercial bank market (that operated up to 1998) to address the foreign exchange market issues. However, their greatest concern was the impact on inflation, key prices, and the social sector. 14.      In support of the dialogue, the staff held a seminar on the experiences of Belarus, Iran, and Libya (countries which had unified their exchange rates over periods of about 2–3 years) and presented scenarios for phased exchange system unification in Turkmenistan. Under these scenarios, the official and market rates would converge, with a depreciation of the former and an appreciation of the latter and the removal of related nontariff barriers. Three important points were:  • Reactivating the commercial bank foreign exchange market5 would create a venue for market-based central bank sales of foreign exchange, as recommended above (reducing the required sales to only a small proportion of the balance of payments surplus);  • Allowing the market rate to appreciate could offset much of the inflationary impact of the phased depreciation of the official rate because of the small (4 percent) share of controlled prices in the CPI basket; and • Setting a lower wage increase would not only reduce the direct effect on inflation, but also provide greater scope for unification at a more appreciated exchange rate.                                                   4 The staff conducted a seminar in November 2006 to explain the advantages of this strategy. 5 Commercial banks would not lose from a more depreciated exchange rate since they have a small net foreign exchange long position.

Turkmenistan: Exchange Rate System Turkmenistan has had a multiple exchange rate system for much of the period since independence. Previous attempts to unify the system were not sustained. The last attempt was in April 1998 when the official rate depreciated by 25 percent to manat 5,200 per US dollar to unify with the commercial bank rate. Shortly afterwards, however, the negative shocks from the Russian crisis and related problems in the payment for gas exports resulted in a gap between the two rates. Consequently, the commercial bank market was closed in December 1998. The official rate has remained pegged, while the parallel rate depreciated rapidly in 1999–2000, resulting in a very large spread with the official rate.   Demand in the official market is very tightly constrained by exchange and trade restrictions. In effect, the auction only supplies foreign exchange for state enterprises and government agencies and some private sector debt service obligations under government guarantee. Foreign exchange is supplied by surrender requirements, mostly from gas and oil exports (25 percent and 35 percent, respectively). Cotton exporters and private enterprises are free from surrender requirements.   Most transactions outside the official market are handled in the parallel market. The staff found that the parallel market has become widespread as a result of the tight constraints in the official market (prices of most consumer goods appear to reflect the parallel rate, save a few goods with regulated prices). This gives rise to multiple currency practice subject to Fund jurisdiction due to official action causing spreads between the official and the parallel market exchange rates. After depreciating further in 2004, the parallel rate was relatively stable in 2005–06, and the spread remained at about 450 percent. Thus it remains very depreciated in real effective terms (although inflation in 1999–2002 may have been underestimated), in contrast with the nominal and real appreciations of many other currencies in the region experiencing large foreign exchange inflows and major improvements in their terms of trade.

Although the staff’s analysis pointed to a unified exchange rate between the current official and parallel rates, it did not identify a particular target. The sustained real depreciation of the parallel rate since 1998, and the relatively low wages (in dollar terms at the parallel rate) compared to other CIS oil exporters, suggest that a significant appreciation would be appropriate. However, uncertainties about price data, especially in 1999–2002, the size of the prospective wage increase, and the extent of the relaxation of trade and exchange restrictions make a more precise estimate difficult. Thus, the staff recommended that the market rate be allowed to appreciate flexibly to converge on an equilibrium that would not result in excessive dollar wages. 16.      The authorities agreed that unification involving a depreciation of the official exchange rate would have a positive impact on budgetary revenues. This could provide scope to finance the higher wages and pensions as well as increase social spending, while still registering a surplus (only a modest portion of expenditure is denominated in foreign currencies). Some of this surplus could also be used to delay price increases for some sensitive goods, but the authorities recognized that less sensitive prices should be adjusted. The staff stressed that this expansion of the budgetary envelope should be accompanied by a reduction in off-budget government spending in order to avoid inflation. 17.      Although it will raise revenue, the depreciation of the official rate will also substantially increase the manat cost of off-budget government investments. These off-budget projects currently rely heavily on foreign exchange bought at the overvalued (i.e., subsidized) official rate. Thus a depreciation would have the beneficial effect of making government finances more transparent. The much higher manat cost should be used as a signal to tighten the effective budget constraints, thus reducing these off-budget investments to make room for greater budget spending. Socially important projects could be transferred onto the budget and funded by the additional budget revenue. In principle, other off-budget government operations should either be eliminated, or also transferred onto the budget—hough the staff recognized that this would not be likely in the immediate future.  IV.   OTHER ISSUES  18.      The authorities reported that banks meet all prudential ratios.6 However, given the lack of clarity in the local accounting standards the staff was not able to assess bank soundness. The authorities are also reforming the required reserve ratios, and in support of                                                  6 At end–2006, 97 percent of banking system assets were of state-owned commercial banks, and 88 percent of bank credit to the economy was to state enterprises.

It was agreed that the next Article IV consultation would look more closely at the banking sector, and at accounting and auditing practices.  19.      The authorities explained that they were taking significant steps to strengthen their Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism framework and that they stood ready to cooperate with the responsible international agencies. The authorities requested technical assistance from the Fund to help bring their framework up to international standards. 20.      The authorities are steadily improving data quality and reporting. To meet the obligation of reporting international reserve assets and liabilities, the authorities are providing data on net international reserves and reserve liabilities. Poor data quality, particularly of national accounts statistics, continues to hinder effective surveillance. In view of the methodological differences with the authorities on the estimates for real GDP growth, the authorities indicated that they intend to request technical assistance in national accounts and prices. V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 21.      Following several years of lack of progress in market-based reforms, recent policy initiatives in the social and agricultural areas are welcome. The staff strongly supports this new direction and the authorities’ steps to strengthen engagement with other countries and international agencies. The authorities should use the favorable external environment and the foundation set by their prudent macroeconomic policies to initiate further market-based reforms.  22.      Restrained fiscal policy in 2006 contributed to a large budget surplus, a build-up in external reserves, and a reduction in inflation. Going forward, a measured relaxation of the very tight restraint on spending, with increases in wages and pensions, other social spending, and government investment, would be appropriate given the country’s needs and the expected further increase in hydrocarbon revenue. However, monetary policy reforms to offset the inflationary impact of this fiscal expansion are essential to avoid further crowding out of private expenditure and investment.  23.      Staff is encouraged by the CBT’s commitment to maintaining low inflation. To unwind the tight constraints on banks from direct credit and other controls, and to sterilize the large increase in the nonhydrocarbon budget deficit in 2007 and 2008, market-based monetary policy mechanisms should be developed. In particular, in view of the continued large balance of payments surpluses, adequate sales of foreign exchange into the reactivated commercial bank market at a market exchange rate should be initiated in 2007 as a first phase of exchange system reforms. Sales of foreign exchange would help withdraw excess liquidity from the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position. The resulting appreciation of the market exchange rate should reduce inflation and encourage the switching of expenditure from domestic production to imports. Without such measures, inflation is likely to be considerably Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 11   higher than the target in 2007 and especially in 2008 with the large increase in wages and the concomitant fiscal expansion. 24.      Staff welcomes the authorities’ recognition that the multiple exchange rate system is a major problem. Given the entrenched history of multiple exchange rates, it is understandable that the CBT will need to build a consensus to craft their own phased approach to remedy the situation. Nevertheless, the staff urges that such a plan be developed expeditiously. The unification process should involve some combination of a depreciation of the official exchange rate and appreciation of the market rate to progressively reduce the gap between them. Imports financed through the commercial bank market should be free of all trade and exchange restrictions associated with the official market.  25.      Staff encourages the authorities to adjust their fiscal operations (on and off-budget) as exchange system reform progresses. While there would be sufficient budgetary resources to delay the pass-through effect on the most sensitive prices, staff recommends that the authorities raise the prices of less sensitive and tradable goods, such as petroleum products. The reform would also imply the elimination of the substantial implicit subsidy provided to off-budget government investment programs. This should promote their rationalization, with some operations (especially those with an important social focus) transferred to the budget and other (low return) investment programs cut back. The resulting public spending framework would thus be both more transparent and efficient. 26.      The authorities are making noticeable progress in data compilation and reporting to the Fund. As a result, the staff believes that Turkmenistan’s data reporting meets the requirements under Article VIII, Section 5. Nevertheless, the quality of statistical data continues to hamper surveillance. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities’ request for technical assistance in national accounts and prices. 27.      Turkmenistan maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval by the Fund under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) or 3, as described in the Informational Annex.

Real GDP growth was in the 8–10 percent range, driven by construction and services sectors. The external current account surplus widened due to higher gas prices and a decline in imports as some large projects were completed. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) , particularly in the hydrocarbon sector, continued to rise and financed a significant portion of the imports. Official foreign exchange reserves rose further to 18 months of imports at end-2006, implying that half of the hydrocarbon export revenue over the past two years was saved as international reserves, while external debt was reduced further.   The authorities pursued tight fiscal and monetary policies to reduce inflation to 7 percent in late 2006.  Fiscal policy outperformed budget projections due to larger hydrocarbon revenue and lower spending, resulting in an overall fiscal surplus of 6 percent of GDP. However, off-budget government sector investment remained high. Credit to the public enterprises was virtually flat (taking into account a significant write-off of agricultural debts) but credit to the private sector increased significantly. Manat broad money growth remained modest at 11 percent.                                                   1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the May 11, 2007 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Growth is expected to remain strong and the inflation rate to decline to about 6 percent in 2007. The 2007 budget is expected to be in a small surplus despite a significant increase in spending on education, health, and social security. Volumes of gas exports are expected to increase with further investment in gas fields and development of alternative gas markets. A continued large external current account surplus, rapidly increasing foreign exchange reserves, and declining external debt point to very low external vulnerability.   There has been little progress in systemic reform. The state’s dominant role in the economy continues to hamper private initiative and the parallel exchange rate is 4½ times more depreciated than the pegged official rate. While President Berdymukhamedov, inaugurated in mid-February 2007, has stated that the overall direction of policies will remain broadly unchanged, some reforms are being initiated in the social, agricultural, and information technology spheres, and international relations are being strengthened.
