The  staff team met with the  Acting  Prime  Minister, the outgoing Minister of Finance, the  Governor of the  Central Bank of  Swaziland, senior  officials  at  the  Ministries  of  Agriculture,  Economic  Planning  and  Development, Enterprise  and  Employment,  Health,  Justice, and Public  Services and  Information,  and representatives of the  banking,  business,  labor, and international  communities. In December, the team met with the  reappointed  Minister of Finance in Washington. The  staff  team  comprised V. Arora  (head),  J.-F.  Dauphin,  A.  Jayaratnam  (Research Assistant), M. Yulek  (all  AFR), and E. Canetti (ICM).  Mr.  Mamba  (OED) participated in some  of  the  meetings.  The mission overlapped with an  MFD  technical  assistance mission. Political  situation.  The discussions  took  place  against a shfting political  background. An unresolved  crisis in the  judicial  system  arising  from  the  resignation  of  all  the  judges in the  appeals  court in 2002, uncertainties about  the  draft  constitution  expected  to  be finalized  by  the  end  of  2003, and concerns  about governance in  general  were  fueling social  tensions and hurting  investor  and donor  sentiment.  The  cabinet  was  dissolved on September 30 in advance of elections in late  October  for  the 55 elected  parliamentary seats  (out of 95). The  new  cabinet and parliament appointed  after  the  elections will influence  future  policies,  but  their role is limited in the  context  of  the  absolute monarchy. Fund  relations. Swaziland has no  outstanding  use of  Fund  resources  and is not HIPC- eligible.  Swaziland  has  accepted  the  obligations  of  Article  VIII,  Sections 24, of the Articles of  Agreement,  and  maintains an exchange  system  free  of  restrictions  on payments and transfers  for  current  international  transactions.  Swaziland  participates in the Fund’s  General  Data Dissemination  System (GDDS)  and posted  its metadata on the GDDS bulletin  board in February  2003. It receives  technical  assistance  from  STA  to address  weaknesses in the  economic  data  that  hamper  policymaking  and  effective surveillance,  and from MFD on monetary  operations  and  financial  sector  issues.

A growing fiscal deficit threatens macroeconomic stability  and  external  viability,  and, concerns over governance, particularly  the  rule  of  law,  have  disrupted  social  harmony  and investor and donor sentiment. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation remains difficult, with  persistent high rates of HIV/AIDS, unemployment, and poverty, and localized food shortages. e Parliamentary elections were  held  in late October. Although  all  major decisions continue to be  made  by the King, the new parliament and  cabinet  will influence the pace and  direction of policy implementation in the period ahead. e Economic growth picked up in 2002, to 3% percent, awing to a combination of temporary factors, but it is expected to slow down Inflation  fell below 5 percent (12- month basis) as of October 2003, in line  with trends in South Atiica. The fiscal balance deteriorated substantially in 2002/03 (April-March) and so far in 2003/04, mainly reflecting higher current  expenditure. The deficit has been financed in part by a drawdown in the government’s foreign exchange reserves, contributing to  a decline in  net  international  reserves to an estimated 1% months  of imports in September 2003. The external  current  account  deficit narrowed slightly  in 2002 in response to a depreciation of  the  lilangeni  (which is pegged to the South Afiican rand) in 2001. External debt and debt-service obligations remain  relatively  low. e The fundamentalpolicy challenge in Swaziland is to address the impediments to higher growth and a broad-based improvement in living standards. In this context, it is essential to reduce the fiscal deficit (projected at over 6% percent of GDP, including grants, in 2003/04), in order  to maintain macroeconomic stability and external viability and to prepare the budget  for prospective medium-term pressures. At the same time, spending needs to be  redirected toward key social sectors. e In order for economic prospects  to improve  on a sustained basis, macroeconomic policies need to be supported by measures in a range of areas. Improved governance would provide the foundations for stronger growth and  help to attract investment and donor support. Early implementation of  a range of structural reforms, including public enterprise restructuring,  would improve economic efficiency. Strategies are needed to address the humanitarian situation, particularly to deal, with HIV/AIDS, enhance  food security,  and reduce poverty. e Although  the authorities have  made recent progress, there remains  a need to improve economic data for the purposes of policymaking and surveillance. In this context, the authorities’ participation  in the IMF’s General Data  Dissemination System (GDDS) in February 2003 is very welcome.

At the conclusion of the last  Article IV consultation  on  December 19,2002, Directors  expressed  concern  about  the  serious economic situation in  Swaziland’ They saw the main policy challenges as  improving  the  humanitarian situation, regaining macroeconomic  stability,  and  raising  the economy’s longer-term growth rate while  ensuring that the benefits were widely spread. Directors emphasized  that  meeting these challenges would  require a return to fiscal  discipline  while reorienting spending toward critical  social priorities,  structural  reforms to improve  economic efficiency, an  urgent response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and improved  governance. 2. The 2003 Article IV discussions  took place against  a  dire socioeconomic background An unresolved crisis in the judicial system arising from the resignation of  all the judges in the appeals court in  2002,  uncertainties  related to  a new constitution that was expected to be introduced later in 2003,’  and concerns about governance  in  general are fbeling social tensions and  weakening  investor and donor sentiment. A significant widening in the government’s fiscal deficit threatens macroeconomic  stability  and sustainability. Meanwhile, the country continues to face  urgent  humanitarian needs. Although Swaziland  is a lower-middle-income ~ountry,~ its  income distribution is highly  skewed  and  poverty  is widespread,  with an estimated  two-thirds  of Swazis living  on less than US$] per day. A third of the labor force is estimated to be unemployed, and a third  of adults are infected  with HIVIAIDS. The  severity of the food shortage that affected the country  in  recent  years  has lessened  somewhat in 2003,  but  access to food  remains  difficult for certain sections of society  and over 15 percent of the population (1 58,000 people) may  need  food aid. 1 Swaziland-Staf  Report for the 2002 Article IV Consultation and Swaziland-Statistical Issues  and  Statistical  Appendix, IMF Staff Country Report 03/21 and 03/22, respectively (January 2003). 2 The  new constitution was accepted by the King  on November 14, 2003. It  replaces the constitution  that  was  suspended  in  1973,  when  political parties were also banned,  and  it includes such elements as a bill of rights  but  within the framework of a monarchy. 3 Per  capita GNP is US$1,180 (2002) compared  with the threshold of US$756 used by the World Bank for classifying countries as lower  middle income.

Swaziland's  growth performance has  weakened  since  the  early  1990s, in part reflecting the erosion  of  its  advantage as an  investment  location  after South Afn'ca emerged from economic  and political isolation.

External  demand  recovered,  partly reflecting a lagged response to  the depreciation of  the South  African  rand (to which the lilangeni is pegged) in 2001  and  early  2002,  and  was  accompanied  by a policy-induced increase in domestic demand. In 2003, growth may  be  starting to slow  with the waning of the one-off factors  that operated  last  year  and the weakening investment environment. ........................................................................................ 5.0 _ ]q 4.0 - 4.0, Nonagricultural Real GDP I I 4. Notwithstanding  recent gains in  formal sector  employment, the unemployment rate remains  high,  at an estimated  one-third of the labor force Swaziland's participation in AGQA since January 2001 has  contributed to the emergence of an  export-oriented clothing industry  that  has created around 20,000 new jobs (over 20 percent of formal employment). However, limited  investment  in  other  labor-intensive industries and low productivity of communal  agricultural land (where most Swazis live) have contributed to keeping unemployment high. 5. The  central governmentfiscal balance has been in deficit  since  1999/2000 (April- March), and in 2002103 the deficit (including grants) widened further,  to 1 Figure 2. Central  Government  Operations 4% percent  of GDP (Table 2 and Figure  2).

Total government debt stood  at 25 percent  of  GDP in 2002/03. 6. Recent developments suggest a substantial widening in the central government deficit to over 6% percent of GDP in 2003A94. The  increase mainly reflects  a retroactive wage increase announced in August  2003 (over 9 percent, effective April 2002), spending on a commonwealth partnership  summit in August,  and the government’s participation in some of the so-called Millennium Projects, including a new airp01-t.~ The growing deficit has  been financed in part by a drawdown in the government’s foreign exchange reserves.’ In an effort to stem the fall in reserves, the limit  on domestic government debt was raised  from E 300  million to E 1 billion in September. 7. The scope for the Central Bank  of Swaziland (CBS) to  pursue an independent monetary policy is limited by the peg of the lilangeni to the rand and Swaziland’s membership in the Common  Monetary Area (CMA).6 The CBS reduced short-term interest rates by 500 basis points cumulatively during June-October 2003, in step with monetary easing by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). Data through September 2003 indicate that broad  money growth, which is largely  demand determined, rose to 16  percent (1 2-month basis), fiom 13 percent in December 2002 (Table 3). 8. AJter depreciating substantially in 2001 and the first half  of 2002, the lilangeni has appreciated subsequently reflecting the strengthening of the South African rand In September 2003, the nominal  and  real effective values of the lilangeni were  4 percent  and 6 percent stronger, respectively,  than a year previously (Figure  3). In 2002,  the external current account  deficit as  a  share of  GDP  narrowed to  4 percent, as  a decline in foreign income and transfers was more  than offset by a reduction in the  goods and services deficit (Table 4 and Figure 4). External debt rose to 32  percent of GDP, and the ratio of external debt-service payments to exports rose slightly to 1 % percent. Net international reserves remained equivalent to just over 2 months  of imports  (US$216 million), but had fallen to 4 The Millennium Projects  also include factory shells for foreign investors,  a convention center, a hotel  complex, a  theme part, and a new parliament building.  The budget allocated 1 percent of  GDP for the  projects in 2003/04, bringing the cumulative allocations  since 2001/02 to  2% percent of GDP. 5 During March-August 2003, the government’s foreign exchange  reserves held  at the central bank  fell  from US$143 million to US$102 million.

Inflationary pressures have eased  since late 2002 in tandem with inflation trends in South Africa (Figure 5). Falling oil and food  prices  and the appreciation of the  lilangeni contributed to  a decline in consumer  price inflation from a peak of nearly  13  percent (1 2-month basis) in October 2002 to 4.8 percent in October 2003. However, the inflation rate in October was 3 percentage  points  higher  than  in South  Africa. Moreover, the continued  fiscal  expansion, Figure 4.

Swaziland has a well-developed banking system8 Nonperforming loans of the three commercial banks fell further to an  average  of 1 ‘/4 percent of total  loans  and advances in June  2003,  from 1 !h percent a year  previously,  and  their  overall  profitability was equivalent to around  18  percent  (pretax  return  on  capital).  Their capitalization exceeds the Basel  Accord requirements,  and  their  risk  management  and  provisioning are considered by the banking supervisors to be  sound.  The SDSB has  reported  positive  financial results for the period after June  200 1, when  it  relaunched  commercial operations, but it awaits a comprehensive supervisory  assessment.’ 1 1. The  HIVZAIDSpandemic continues unabated (Box 1). Swaziland  has  one  of the highest  infection rates in the world,  with  one-third of the working-age population now infected. In  June  2003, the Global  Fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria,  and Tuberculosis announced that it was granting Swaziland  US$3 1 million in aid over the next two years. 12. The  severity of the food crisis  has diminished, but  the situation remains fragile (Box 2). Swaziland  has  suffered  from  food  shortages in recent years, as low agricultural productivity  has  left the country  vulnerable to weather conditions. No aggregate food shortage was  expected in 2003 as a result of higher domestic cereal production, reflecting relatively favorable weather,  and  improved  import capacity, but  certain segments of society remained  vulnerable  and 15 percent of the population  was  expected to need  food assistance by the end of the year.  Food aid  was  anticipated to be adequate to cover this requirement. m. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 13. The staff and the authorities agreed that the central policy challenge in Swaziland remained the achievement of sustained higher growth and a broad-based improvement in living standardi. The  Fund’s  policy advice to Swaziland  in  recent  years  has emphasized the need for fiscal  adjustment to restore macroeconomic stability and preserve external viability and  competitiveness,  and for structural  reforms,  particularly  in public enterprises, the financial sector, and  land tenure. The authorities have  broadly  agreed with this advice, and have  moved  forward  with reforms in areas such as the financial sector. During the 8 The  banking  system comprises three commercial banks-First National Bank, Nedbank, and  Standard Bank (all  with headquarters in South Africa)-and a development bank (the Swaziland  Development  and Savings Bank, SDSB). The SDSB is the smallest of the four banks; as of June 2003, it accounted for 9 percent  and  13  percent of banking sector loans and deposits, respectively. 9 The SDSB lost its commercial  banking license in 1995,  owing to poor financial performance. It  relaunched  commercial banking operations in June 2001 after it was recapitalized by the government and  adopted  new lending and  risk  management procedures.

The KIVlAIDS Situation ’ Swaziland is one of the  countries  most  severely  affected by HIV/AIDS,  with  one-third  of its adult  population  being  HIV- positive.  Life  expectancy  was  reduced  from 58 years in 1997  to  44  years in 2002,  and  the  disease  accounted  for  12,000 deaths in 2001.  Around  65,000  children  (15  percent  of  all  children  aged  0-14)  have  been  orphaned as a  result  of HIV/AIDS. 1 Table 1.  HIV/AIDS  Infection  Rate  (In  percent) Table  2.

Until  recently,  anti-HIV/AIDS  effort  resources  came  solely  from  the  government  budget.  However, in June  2003,  NERCHA was  successful in obtaining a  grant  from  the  Global  Fund  for HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and  Tuberculosis,  in  an  amount  of USS30.6  million  (equivalent  to E 230  million,  or 1.6 percent  of  GDP)  to  be  disbursed  over  the  next two years. This grant will allow  for  a  significant  increase in budget  spending  on  HIV/AIDS,  which  has so far  been  relatively  small (0.3 percent of GDP in 2003/04).  However,  the  cost  of  combating the pandemic  through  prevention  and  care  remains  challenging.  While the  government’s  official  target is to  treat 10,000 people  by  2005,  the  World  Health  Organization  estimates  that  some 35,000  people  are  already in need  of  anhretrovirals (ARVs) treatment.  Treating  all  the  patients  who  need  ARVs  would  cost E 168  million per year.2However,  the  2003/04  budget  provides for E 15  million  for  the  care  of  HIV/AIDS-related  illness, including  some  ARVs  that will only  be  available  on  a  limited  scale.  Beyond  the  increase in available resources,  a  decisive reprioritization of the  government’s  budget  will be key to  the  success  of  the  fight  against HIV/AIDS.3 In addition  to  the  human  suffering it causes,  and  the  direct  cost of treatment  and  prevention,  HIV/AIDS  undermines Swaziland’s  growth  prospects  through  declining  productivity,  a shnnlung tax base,  and  the  impact  on  pension hds of AIDS-related deaths4 Furthermore,  a  generation of orphans is developing that lacks  parental  guidance  and  thus  more broadly  social skills and  that has lower  access  to  education,  financial  support,  food,  and  health  care; this could  threaten  the country’s  social  and  economic  development. ’ Sources:  United  Nations  Development  Program, Human Development Report, 2003;  Joint UN Program  on HIV/AIDS; Swaziland Ministry  of Health  and  Social  Welfare, PHIV Sentinel  Serosurveillance Report, December  2002;  and NERCHA,  December  2002  quarterly  report. administration  (infrastructure  and  medical  staff  wages). gersons  with ARVs for  a  year.

An Update On Food Security and  Land  Tenure The  overall  food  situation  in  Swaziland has improved  in  2003 (in terms  of  price  and  import capacity),  but  a  large  section  of  the  population  remains  vulnerable.  Domestic  production of maize (the  main  cereal)  is  forecast  by  the  World  Food  Program  (WFP) at approximately  73,000  tons, which  is 6 percent  above last year’s  production  but  30  percent  below the  average  over  the  last  five years.  In  addition to commercial  imports,  Swaziland  would  need to receive  24,300  tons  of  food  aid in 2003/04 to  cover  its  domestic  requirement.  Approximately 14,000 tons of aid  had  been  received as  of  September  2003. The  overall  improvement  in  food  availability  masks important regional  differences,  and access to food  remains  difficult  for  certain  segments of the  population,  owing to poverty  and  unemployment, both  of  which are  exacerbated  by the spread  of HIV/AIDS. In July  2003,  the  Food  and  Agriculture Organization  (FAO)  estimated  that  157,750  people  could  require  food  assistance  by the end of the Year.

Land tenure is  broadly of  two types, title  deed  land (TDL) and Swazi Nation Land (SNL). ritle deed  land is held  by freehold tenure, which recognizes  exclusive  access rights and lllows the land to be  used as collateral.

During  1998-2002,  agricultural  output  declined by 7% percent annually on SNL and ncreased  by  2  percent  annually on TDL. During 1998-2002, crop yields were equivalent to Z 550 per hectare on SNL and E 2,100  per hectare on  TDL.

The policy response has  been  hampered by governance problems,  which  have eroded fiscal discipline and at times slowed down the passage  of  needed legislation, and  by limited institutional capacity. 14. e e e e e e 15. Against this background, the  discussions focused on: the macroeconomic outlook and, in particular, the policies needed to preserve macroeconomic stability and  raise the sustainable growth rate; the fiscal policy adjustments needed to ensure external viability and macroeconomic stability, address key social needs, and prepare for prospective medium-term pressures on  the budget arising from HIV/AIDS, other social priorities, and contingent government liabilities (such as  the public service pension fbnd); the continued usehlness  of the pegged exchange rate regime in providing a nominal anchor; the health of the banking system, and particularly reform of  the SDSB; strategies for improving the humanitarian situation, particularly dealing with HIV/AIDS, enhancing food security, and reducing poverty, including measures to improve the efficiency of land  use;  and improvements in governance that were critical for effectively implementing reforms, strengthening the socioeconomic situation, and increasing donor and investor  support. A. Economic Outlook It was  agreed that the near-term outlook was for a slowdown in growth  in 2003. Growth could slow to around 2% percent  in 2003, as  the weakening private investment environment offsets  the effect of expansionary financial policies and rising public sector wages,  and it could slow hrther  to 1% percent in 2004 in the  absence  of improved supply- side hndamentals. Inflation can  be expected to remain above the level  in South Africa in both years, reflecting wage increases and growing demand pressures in the nontraded goods sector as a result  of relatively loose fiscal policy.  The external current account deficit may widen to over 4% percent of GDP. 16. The medium-term outlook is clouded by  the deteriorating fiscal situation, HIWAIDS, and the need for structural reforms to address social priorities and raise economic efficiency. The staff presented two alternative scenarios  (see Appendix IV), with which the authorities broadly agreed: 0 With no change in policies, the real  GDP growth rate could fall to around '/z of 1 percent (Table 1 in Appendix IV). Inflation would remain  higher than in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- South  Africa, and fiscal  sustainability  would deteriorate sharply. The scenario clearly leads to an  unsustainable  situation,  with a drawdown of reserves to uncomfortably low  levels, a decline in credit to the private sector, and  rapid debt accumulation. e With fiscal  policy  set  on a sustainable trend and a range of structural reforms undertaken, the real GDP growth  rate  could rise to around 2% percent,  representing somewhat  higher  per capita growth than Swaziland experienced during the 1990s. Inflation  would  converge to the South Afiican level,  and the fiscal  and  external positions  would  become  more viable. The mission  discussed  with the authorities the sustainability of public debt under a range  of scenarios (Tables 2-3 in  Appendix IV). Although public debt is relatively low as a share of GDP and  most of it  is  contracted  from  abroad on concessional terms, the debt  sustainability exercise suggested  that,  under  unchanged  policies, it  would double by 2008, to 43 percent, and could exceed 50 percent  in the event of certain adverse shocks. lo 17. The  economic  outlook is highly susceptible to downside risks. Near-term growth prospects will  be  significantly  influenced by the strength of  the recovery  in South Africa. More generally, the outlook is  dependent on a strengthening in policies, particularly the restoration of fiscal  discipline, a reorientation of spending, and improved governance. In addition, Swaziland  remains vulnerable to regional  and  global trade shocks and uncertainties about the economic  impact of HIV/AIDS. 1 8. Swaziland’s longer term economic prospects depend signijicantly on its attractiveness as an investment destination, particularly relative to  South Africa The authorities and  staff  agreed  that  it  would be important to have  in place policies and institutions that  would strengthen the investment environment, employment creation, and overall economic efficiency.  Swaziland compares well with neighboring countries in terms of several  key elements that could  help to secure its  growth prospects: it  has  relatively little violent crime, good physical  infrastructure,  and corporate tax rates that are comparable to those in South Mica. However, business, donor, and nongovernmental organization representatives reiterated  that governance problems and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS were significant deterrents to investment. Addressing these issues, along with efforts to hrther Swaziland’s  integration into the global  economy and implement sound macroeconomic policies,  would  help to strengthen  longer-term growth prospects. 10 The external  debt  sustainability exercise suggests that  external debt remains  relatively modest under  most  scenarios. However, a sustained current account decline, such as one resulting from commodity price shocks or a loss of  trade preferences,  could  push external debt up to around 40 percent of GDP over the medium term.

The deterioration in  the fiscal  position was of grave concern to the mission. The authorities recognized that greater fiscal  discipline  was urgently needed to preserve  external viability  and  competitiveness,  ensure  macroeconomic stability, and  improve growth prospects,  while  maintaining a sustainable  public  debt  position.  In  addition, a reduction  in the fiscal  deficit is needed to prepare  the  budget  for  the  looming  medium-term  pressures associated  with  HIV/AIDS,  other  social  priorities,  and contingent government liabilities. 20. In 2003/04, while the  budget  envisaged a reduction in  the deficit (including grants) to 4% percent of GDP, the mission  and  the  authorities estimated that, on  the basis of current policies, the deficit could  increase  to  over 6% percent of GDR The  overrun  largely reflects lapses  in expenditure control  and  substantial spending on a few prominent items such as the commonwealth  summit  in  August.  The authorities and the mission  agreed that it  was desirable  for the deficit to be  kept  within  the original budget target in order to avoid further straining the international  reserve  position  and jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. However,  while the mission  argued that the target was feasible provided that pressures were resisted for significant  additional  spending,  such as on another round  of  public wage increases  and  on  some of the Millennium Projects, the authorities noted that public pressure for a wage increase was significant. It  was  agreed  that the deficit should be  financed by issuing domestic debt to the private sector on  market terms, since a continued drawdown of government foreign exchange holdings would threaten external viability. 2 1. A firmly implemented, front-loadedfiscal adjustment is required over the medium term The mission  emphasized that the current  level of the fiscal deficit was unsustainable relative to available financing and that such a level  would threaten macroeconomic stability and fail to prepare the bud  et for the impending pressures associated with HIV/AIDS and other  social expenditures. The  authorities  agreed  and noted that the government’s  intention, as  announced  in the February  2003  budget,  was to target a reduction in the deficit to ,Y 11 In  addition to the direct costs of treatment  and prevention, the indirect economic costs of HIV/AIDS-related deaths through a shrinking  tax  base, lower productivity, and the impact  on pension  funds  could  be over E 1 billion (cumulative) during 1999-2016. See “Assessing the Impact of HIV/AIDS” (Box 2 in IMF Staff Country Report No. 03/21) and “The  Economic Impact of HIV/AIDS on  Swaziland” (Chapter 111 of IMF Staff Country Report No. 03/22). The fiscal pressures associated with the public service pension fund are discussed in “Swaziland Public Service Pensions Fund” (Box 5 and Chapter VI in IMF Staff Country Report No. 03/21  and  03/22, respectively).

This  was  seen as a pragmatic  objective  against  which to anchor fiscal policy. l2 They noted,  however, that specific  policy actions could  only  be  undertaken after a new  cabinet had been formed. Since the increase in expenditure in 2003/04 largely reflects one-off  items,  the adjustment  path  envisaged  in the budget  was  viewed  as  realistic,  and the mission  and  the authorities agreed  that  it  was  appropriate to aim for a reduction  in the fiscal  deficit to around 2% percent  of GDP in 2004/05 and  fbrther reductions thereafter in order to achieve a primary balance over  the  medium term. 22. It  was  agreed that the bulk of thefiscal effort should focus on controlling expenditure, which was the muin  source  of thefiscalproblem The  mission  urged  restraint over the wage  bill  and transfers to public  enterprises,  which together accounted for over  two- thirds of current expenditure in 2002/03. At the same  time, spending would  have to be reoriented  toward  critical  social sectors such  as education and  health, allocations for which had been  falling  as a share of total expenditure. l3 The  announcement  in  July  2003 that plans to acquire a personal airplane for the King had  been  dropped was welcome. Improvements in expenditure management,  particularly in terms of  fiscal transparency and accountability, were seen as being crucial for strengthening expenditure control (Box 3). 23. Against this background, the government was urged to limit its participation in the Millennium Projects. In particular, the government  was  urged to abide by its original intention to devolve up-front most of the projects to the private sector and to ensure the economic viability of the few projects that may warrant its participation. The mission  pointed out that the government’s participation in some of the projects-such as the new airport, international trade fair,  and sports complex-would crowd out budgetary resources for meeting  pressing  social  needs  and  weaken donor support. While noting the serious fiscal implications, the authorities argued  that the projects could increase employment. The  mission suggested  that  any employment gains would  be  only temporary if the projects turned  out to be unviable, and that the government  risked taking on  substantial contingent liabilities. 24. The mission and the authorities  agreed that a further broadening of the tax base, building on  measures initiated in 2001/02, and a strengthening of tax administration I’ The  authorities’ efforts to move toward a medium-term fiscal framework, with assistance from an ongoing European Union  fiscal project, were seen as helpfbl in this context. 13 In 2002, health  and education accounted for 7 percent  and 19 percent, respectively, of total government expenditure, down  from 8 percent  and 25 percent in 1998 and somewhat lower than in other SACU countries.

Public Expenditure Management in Swaziland The public expenditure management (PEM)  system  in  Swaziland is similar  to that in other anglophone countries in ~frica’ Some  of  its  main  features are the  following: The  budget  is  prepared  annually  and  comprises  a  budget  for  recurrent  expenditure,  coordinated  by  the Ministry  of  Finance,  and  a  budget  for  capital  expenditure,  organized  by  projects  and  coordmated  by  the Ministry of Economic  Planning  and  Development.  The  budget  assumptions  are  not  based on a  fully comprehensive  and  consistent  macroeconomic  framework. The  budget is appropriated  for  one  year. A line  ministry  cannot  reallocate  its  appropriation  from  the  capital budget  to  the  recurrent  budget,  nor  from  one  capital  project  to  another.  However,  reallocations  across  the different lines  of  the  recurrent  budget  are  permitted,  subject to the  approval  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance. The  execution of the  budget is largely  decentralized  at  the  line  ministry  level. In particular,  line  ministries initiate  the  spendmg  process  and  commitments  are made  without  prior  control  or  approval  of  the Ministry of  Finance. Budget  accounting  is  done  only on a  cash  basis. Ex  post  reporting,  auditing,  and  accountability  of  budget  implementation are weak,  with  little  involvement by parliament. The  PEM system  in  Swaziland has similar weaknesses to those in some of the  other anglophone African countries. The  absence  of  ex  ante  control  by  the Mrnistry of  Finance  on  commitments  made  by the line ministries  prevents any  check  against  budget  appropriations  or  cash  availability. This can  lead  to  payments arrears,  but  information on arrears is scarce,  owing  to  the  lack of accrual  accounting. In practice, ad hoc  budget supplements  validate  overruns by line  ministries,  a  practice  that  weakens  the  essential  role  that  the  budget should  play  as  a  policy  tool  to  ensure  macroeconomic  stability.  These  problems  are  exacerbated by the lack  of ex  post  reporting  and  accountability. Flaws in  the public procurement system aggravate the lack of expenditure control. They include  (i)  the absence  of  control  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  awarded  contracts  stay  within  budget  allocations  and  cash availability;  (ii)  the  lack of transparency in the  awarding of contracts;  (iii)  the  absence of benchmark  prices against  which  to  assess  financial  bids;  and  (iv)  weak  ex-post  auditing  and  accountability. Some reforms have  been initiated, but much remains to be done. As part of its fiscal restructuring  project, the  government has started  to  develop  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  for  seven  pilot  ministries.  It has also embarked  on  a  comprehensive  reform  of  the  civil  service,  but  progress has been uneven. A strenghening of  PEM in Swaziland  requires  improvements in budget  discipline  and  accountability, whch, in turn, require  reforms  of  budget  procedures  and  the  procurement  system and an overarching commitment  to  enforce  rules  and  applicable sanctions. ’ See,  for  reference, Ian Lienert, 200 1, “A Comparison  Between  Two  Public  Management  Systems  in  Afnca,” [MF Working  Paper 03/2; and  Ian  Lienert  and  Feridoun Sarraf, 2001“Systemic  Weaknesses  of  Budget Management  in  Anglophone  Africa,” IMF Working  Paper, WP/O 1/2  1  1.

The  mission  welcomed the planned  introduction  of a value- added  tax in 2006,  and  encouraged  the  authorities to make timely preparations for it, such as bringing the utilities  sector into the  tax net. A need  was  noted to strengthen  tax administration, particularly in terms  of  audit  and enforcement, and to step up efforts to collect the  sizable  tax arrears. l6 Monetary policy and the exchange rate 25. It was  agreed that the pegged exchange rate system of the lilangeni to the rand remained appropriate for Swaziland in light of the financial discipline that it entailed and the close economic integration between Swaziland and South Africa" While  the  real effective value of the lilangeni was at  broadly the same level in 2002  as in 1990, it has appreciated in 2003  owing to the higher  level of inflation in  Swaziland  than in South Africa. Tighter macroeconomic  policies  were  seen as being needed to prevent  any hrther erosion in competitiveness. l8 The  mission  emphasized that improved  fiscal discipline, a monetary policy  aimed  at  securing  an adequate level of international  reserves,  and  structural  reforms l4 Steps such as the inclusion of benefits-in-kind in the tax base,  implemented in July  2003, were seen as helpfbl in this regard, although the authorities were encouraged to remain sensitive to their social impact. Further  measures to broaden the tax base could  include reducing the use of tax concessions for developmental purposes and eliminating several remaining tax  exemptions,  including those for  public enterprises, for commercial activities on Swazi Nation Land,  and any that may apply to Tibiyo Taka  Ngwane  (a national trust under the auspices of  the King). l5 Receipts from  SACU,  which  accounted for nearly  half of total revenue in  2002/03, are expected to fall over the medium  term as tariffs are reduced  under  WTO commitments and the South  Africa-EU and SADC trade agreements. In the near term, however,  SACU receipts should increase as a result of higher  imports in response to the recent  exchange rate appreciation. l6 Outstanding arrears including  accrued  interest were officially estimated at E 380  million (2.8 percent of GDP) in 2002/03. 17 South Africa accounts for nearly 80 percent of Swaziland's external trade. l8 Given its close economic integration  with South Africa, the scope for Swaziland to use  the exchange rate to influence competitiveness is limited. For  a hrther discussion of competitiveness and the exchange regime  see Chapter V of Swaziland-Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, IMF Country Report No. 03/22 (January 2003).

Although  monetary  policy  was  largely passive in Swaziland, the mission urged  the  CBS to strengthen  its  capacity  for  monetary operations because situations could arise  in  which the CBS  needed to be  more  proactive  in  influencing  liquidity conditions and reserve levels. l9 The mission  shared the authorities’  concern that a recent deterioration in the financial  position of the CBS could  compromise the central bank’s ability to absorb liquidity, and  recommended  that the authorities  monitor the situation closely and seek technical assistance  if necessary. 2o 26. The mission welcomed the authorities’ ongoing  moves to deepen financial integration within the CMA. A  reduction  in the statutory  reserve requirement on banks from 3 percent to  2% percent  on  August 1 , 2003  has  brought the requirement in  line with that in South  Africa and reduced the effective tax on  financial intermediation2’ In addition, the domestic  liquidity requirement for banks  has  been  reduced from 15 percent to 13 percent. Although the authorities were now  considering  tightening the domestic requirement in order to induce banks to invest  locally, the mission  suggested that, in order to reduce financial market  distortions  and  raise the relative  yield  on comparable assets in Swaziland, the list of assets  eligible for the requirement  could be expanded to include South African securities and the requirement  eventually eliminated. The authorities are also considering reintroducing the rand as legal tender, consistent  with the practice  that  existed  in  Swaziland  until 1986 and that prevails in Lesotho and Namibia. They  have  concluded discussions with  the South African Reserve Bank. The move is unlikely to have  significant macroeconomic implications, because the rand  already circulates widely  in  Swaziland,  but the country would receive transfers from South Mica  to compensate it  for  seigniorage  losses. 19 A  concurrent MFD technical assistance mission was assisting the central bank with setting up a secondary  market for government securities. 20 Net profits (excluding revaluation gains and  losses) of the CBS fell to 0.1 percent of assets in  2003, fiom an average of 0.4 percent  during  1993-2002, owing to lower fee and  interest income and higher operational expenses. A significant loss was recorded in the revaluation account because of  the currency  appreciation.  (Official reserves that are held  in U.S. dollars account for around 40 percent of the total, to some  extent reflecting the currency composition of Swaziland’s external  debt  service payments.) 21 At the same time, the proportion  of the reserve requirement that could  be  met  by  vault cash was reduced from 25 percent to zero  (consistent  with the practice in South Mica), mitigating both the expansionary impact and the effect on  the CBS’s income position.

In  addition to sound  macroeconomic policies, it was agreed that a  strengthening of growth prospects required actions on a  broad front to raise economic efJiciency and improve the investment environment Key actions include improving  governance,  reforming the public sector, and  addressing  the  humanitarian situation. 28. The  mission  underscored the overarching  need for better governance, which  would be critical to provide the foundations for stronger growth and attract investment and donor support. Of  particular  concern  in  recent  years  have  been weaknesses in  fiscal transparency and  accountability  and  lapses in the rule of law. The  mission strongly supported the view expressed in the CBS Annud Report that  improvements  in governance, including a restoration  of  the  rule  of  law, were crucial for strengthening confidence in the economy, attracting investment and donor support,  and  generally improving economic prospects. The authorities were frank in acknowledging  recent  governance problems, but  they  noted  that prospects for  improvement  would  depend in the first instance on the new government. Public sector 29. A careful sequencing of civil service reform would help to improve the efficiency of public services, while avoiding  an  increase  in the public wage bill. Although  wider wage dispersion could  help to attract  and  retain  skilled employees (as the Salary  Review Commission had concluded), the mission  considered that this should await a reduction in the overall  size of the civil service. The authorities could accelerate efforts under the Public Sector Management  Program to identify alternative approaches to right-size the civil  service while ensuring adequate staffing in key  social sectors. A proposal was  expected to be submitted to the new  cabinet  by January 2004 and,  if  passed, to be  implemented  soon thereafter. The authorities were encouraged to explore the possibility of using external assistance to help cushion the social and political impact of civil service reform. Meanwhile, they were advised to avoid public wage increases on the scale seen in the recent  past, as these worsen the public  finances, raise economy-wide labor costs, and reduce competitiveness. 30. Public enterprise restructuring and privatization need to  be accelerated” The  draft privatization  policy  was submitted to parliament  in  early 2003, and the mission  urged  early action to approve and  implement  it once the new cabinet was in place. The authorities were advised to follow a transparent and collaborative approach in order to gain  broad  social acceptance of the policy.  In the meantime, the mission  urged the authorities to press  ahead with other elements of  public enterprise restructuring,  in particular of the Central Transport Authority (as approved by the government in 1999), which  was a significant drain on 22 In 2002/03,  public enterprises received  budgetary transfers equivalent to 4% percent of GDP, half of which  represented subsidies. Their output accounted for 6 percent of GDP in 2001.

It was recognized that the finances of the Swaziland Public Service Pensions Fund (PSPF) could, if not addressed, represent a signijicant future liability to the government According to the latest  actuarial  assessment  (April 2002), the actuarial  deficit of the fund  is estimated to be E 2 billion (1 6 percent  of GDP). The  mission encouraged the authorities to initiate measures to put the fund  on a sustainable  path, including the actuary’s recommendations to increase  statutory  contribution rates and  adjust  other  parameters  of the pension  plan.  The  trend  of  substantial  public  wage increases adds to the financial  burden that the PSPF will  have to bear in the future. The  mission also suggested that proposed amendments  to the Retirement  Fund  Act,  which  would  recall investments held abroad by domestic pension hnds, be reconsidered, as they  could reduce the return and raise the risk profile of the PSPF’s asset  portfolio. Financial sector 32. The mission and the authorities agreed that the banking system appeared generally healthy. The  mission  noted that more  timely data on  banks’ financial indicators would  help to track developments in the sector better. Recent  changes in bank legislation that aim to reduce the concentration of banks’  loans to single borrowers and strengthen lending rules were in line with  international  practice,  but the authorities were encouraged to carehlly monitor the implications for  financial  and  business institutions and request any technical assistance from the Fund that may  be u~eh1.~~ The authorities were commended for their ongoing efforts to implement the August  2002  legislation to combat  money laundering and to collaborate with  other  members of the Eastern and Southern African  Anti-Money Laundering Group in combating money  laundering  and the financing of terrorism. 33. The mission noted that the SDSB remained a source of supervisory concern. While acknowledging the authorities’ observation  that the SDSB’s financial position  had strengthened since its relaunch  in  2001, the mission noted that the bank’s future commercial viability would  depend  on the observance of new risk management procedures and the 23 In 2002/03, transfers to the Central Transport Authority were equivalent to 1% percent of GDP . 24 The amendments include a regulation  that  limits a bank’s exposure to a single borrower to a maximum of 25 percent  of its share capital. The  banks’  main concern has  been that the loan requirement of a single borrower, the Swaziland Sugar Association, greatly exceeds the new ceiling. The CBS and two of the three commercial banks have negotiated solutions whereby the risk associated with  any  lending in excess of the single borrower requirement is borne by the South  African  parent banks.

The  mission  recommended that the CBS undertake an on-site  examination  and develop a comprehensive  supervisory action plan for the bank,25 and suggested  that  consideration  may need  to  be  given to restructuring or privatizing the bank in the fiture. Social issues 34. Notwithstanding some recent progress, substantial  social  needs  related to HIVAIDS remain unmet The  National  Emergency Response Committee on HIV/AIDS (NERCHA),  established  in  2001,  has  been  successful in coordinating a national  strategy to fight the pandemic  and  mobilize foreign assistance,  notably the recent  Global  Fund grant. However, the mission  noted  that  much  remained to be done to combat the spread  and effects of HIV/AIDS, including the prompt  provision  of antiretroviral drugs to the critically A determined focus on fighting the pandemic by the  government that included a reorientation of spending was  seen as essential. 35. The  mission  underscored the need for a strategy to reduce unemployment. The authorities felt  that the main  impediment to employment creation was  low  investment,  which they  viewed  as arising from the loss of Swaziland’s locational advantage relative to South Mica since the end  of apartheid. The  mission  agreed  but also noted that policies to improve the  investment  environment  and  control the rapid growth in public wages could  help to reduce  implicit  and  explicit labor costs and contribute to employment and growth. Completion of a skills development  study  that  was  initiated in 2002 would  help to identify the extent to which skills mismatches  impede empl~yment.~~ 36. Against the  background of a run  of poor harvests  in recent years and the relatively low productivity of  Swazi  Nation Land, it is important to implement measures to improve the efficiency of land use The authorities noted  that the spread of irrigation, through the recently  completed Maguga Dam and  prospective Lower Usuthu Smallholder Project (LUSIP) would  help to improve agricultural productivity. The mission considered that reform of the land tenure system  would  be  especially  important  in this regard and  recommended early enactment into law of measures such as  the  draft  Land Policy Act (approved by the cabinet in 1999 but  not  approved by the parliament)  which  would provide greater security  of land tenure and institute long-term leases for agricultural land. In addition, allowing the use of landholdings as collateral would contribute to investment  and productivity gains, enhance farmers’ access to commercial credit, and  help alleviate poverty. 25 This reiterates the advice given by a February 2003 MFD technical assistance mission. The official target is to provide 10,000 people  with antiretroviral drugs by 2005, although 26 the World Health Organization estimates that 35,000 people are already in  need of such drugs. 27 Analysis of the labor  market  in  Swaziland  is  hampered by significant data limitations.

Swaziland’s external trade policy is largely determined by its membership in SACU and the Southern Afican Development Community (SADc).28 In addition,  Swaziland  is seeking to reconcile its participation in the COMESA free trade area  with  its  SACU membership. 29 Swaziland  receives trade preferences  from the United States,3trimarily for apparel exports under  AGOA,  and  from the EU,  primarily for sugar exports. The  mission encouraged the authorities to remove  remaining  nontariff  barriers,  which  applied  mainly to permits for the importation  of  some  agricultural  products. D. Statistical and  Other Issues 3 8. A  lack  of timely and comprehensive data continues to hamper effective policymaking and surveillance The  mission  emphasized,  and the authorities recognized, the need to improve data quality  and  communication, to address the significant inadequacies that remain  in the economic statistics, particularly in the national  income, balance of payments, and government  accounts,  and to improve the timeliness of data reporting to the Fund. In this context, the mission  welcomed the authorities’ progress  under the General Data Dissemination  System (GDDS) Project  for  Anglophone Afiican Countries since 2001, which was  reflected in the provision of GDDS metadata in February 2003. The mission  urged the authorities to pay close attention to the ongoing  technical assistance and assessment of statistical  practices  provided  under the GDDS  that  would  form a sound  basis for strengthening the statistics. 39. The mission encouraged the authorities to allow publication of the Board documents for this year’s Article IV consultation The authorities have released the mission’s  concluding statement to the public.  The  publication of the reports last year was seen as having helped to enhance the outreach and transparency of the Article  IV process. 28 Swaziland’s rating  on the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index is 5 (on a range of 1-10,  with 10 being the most  restrictive),  which is broadly  similar to other developing countries. Tariff rates range  between zero and 60 percent,  with a simple average of 11% percent. 29 Trade among COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) countries is tariff  free,  although COMESA countries that are also members of SACU (Swaziland and Namibia) have  been  given a derogation,  which ends in April 2004. 30 Negotiations are under  way for a SACU-U.S. free trade area,  although  it  is too early to assess the implications  for Swaziland. Swaziland’s preferences under the EU sugar  protocol extend through June 2006. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Iv. STAFF APPRAISAL 40. Swaziland faces a  serious  socioeconomic  situation,  with the wideningfiscal deficit threatening  macroeconomic  stability  and  concerns  over  governance  undermining  social harmony  and  harming  investor  and  donor  sentiment. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation remains  difficult,  with  persistent  high rates of HIV/AIDS, unemployment,  and poverty. 4 1. Against  this  background, and a fragile medium-term  outlook, the staff  considers that the central  policy  challenge  is  to  address the impediments to higher  growth  and a broad-based  improvement in living  standards. It  is  essential to restore fiscal discipline in order to maintain  macroeconomic  stability  and  external viability; reorient spending toward social sectors; increase economic efficiency by implementing structural reforms,  including public enterprise restructuring;  and  develop strategies for improving the humanitarian situation,  particularly with regard to HIV/AIDS, unemployment, food  security, and poverty Improvements in governance,  notably the rule  of law, will be  crucial for ensuring  that policies are implemented  effectively  and  their full benefits realized. 42. The staff  is  greatly  concerned by the expansion  of thefiscal deficit in 2003/04. While the budget  envisaged a reduction in the overall deficit (including grants) to 4% percent of GDP, on the basis of current  policies the deficit  could increase to over 6% percent  of GDP. The staff urges the authorities to keep the deficit within the original budget target, which should  be achievable if  pressures are resisted to undertake significant additional expenditures on another round of public wage increases and  on  the Millennium Projects. Financing of the deficit  should  be  confined to external assistance and the sale of domestic debt to the private sector. A drawdown of the government’s foreign reserve holdings represents a serious threat to external viability  and  should  be  avoided. 43. The fiscal effort  should focus primarily on controlling  expenditure,  which  has been the main source  of thefiscal deterioration,  while  reorienting  spending  toward  critical social  sectors  such as health  and  education. The staff stresses the need to restrain the public wage bill  and transfers to public enterprises by, respectively, a carehl sequencing of civil service reform  that  increases wage dispersion while reducing staffing and  progress  with restructuring public  enterprises,  particularly the Central Transport Authority. The authorities are urged to abide by their  original  intention to devolve up-front most of the  Millennium Projects to the private sector and  ensure the economic viability of the few projects where government participation may  be warranted. Greater fiscal transparency and accountability are needed to strengthen the foundation for expenditure discipline. 44. The staff welcomes the government’s  intention,  announced in the February 2003 budget, to eliminate theprimaryjiscal dejicit  over the medium term Fiscal adjustment needs to be  firmly  implemented and front-loaded  in order to ensure that prospective  medium- term pressures on the budget do not  compromise macroeconomic sustainability. A further broadening of the  tax  base,  building  on  the  measures initiated in 2001/02, would  help to reduce the budget  deficit, improve efficiency, and compensate for the envisaged decline in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - SACU-related trade taxes over the medium term. There  remains a need to strengthen  tax administration,  particularly  audit  and  enforcement,  and the collection of sizable tax arrears. 45. Membership in the Common  Monetary  Area,  which  involves  a  pegged  exchange rate  with the South African  rand,  continues  to serve  Swaziland  well in light of the financial discipline  that it entails  and  the  close  economic  integration  between  Swaziland and South Africa A strengthening of public  finances,  implementation of a prudent  monetary policy stance aimed  at  securing an adequate  level  of  international reserves, and  continued structural  reforms  that  enhance  confidence  in the economy  will  be important for ensuring the credibility of the peg. 46. Swaziland  has a well-developed  banking system Commercial banks’ capitalization, risk  management,  and  provisioning  appear to be  sound,  and  their nonperforming loans are relatively low. However, the future viability of the Swaziland Development and Savings Bank remains a source of concern,  and the staff  recommends that the central bank  conduct an on-site examination and develop a comprehensive  supervisory action plan for the bank. Consideration  could  be  given to restructuring or privatizing the bank  in the future. 47. The finances of the  Swaziland  Public  Service  Pensions Fund could  represent a significant future liability  to the governmeni if they  are  not  addressed The staff encourages the authorities to initiate measures to put the fund  on a sustainable path, including the actuary’s previous recommendations to increase statutory contribution rates and adjust other parameters of the pension  plan. 48. Reform of the land  tenure  system  would  he@ to raise  agricultural  productivity) strengthen food security,  and allevide poverty. The staff recommends early enactment into law  of  measures,  such as the draft  Land  Policy Act approved  by the cabinet in 1999, that would  provide greater security  of  land tenure and institute long-term leases for agricultural land. 49. Notwithstanding  some  recent  progress,  social  needs  related to HIV/AIDS remain largely unmet. The National Emergency  Response Committee on HIV/AIDS (NERCHA) has  been  successful  in coordinating a national anti-HIV/AIDS strategy and acting as a liaison with the international community. However,  much  remains to be done in the fight against the pandemic,  including in terms of strengthening the infrastructure needed to provide  more effective care to the critically ill. A determined focus by the government on,  and a reorientation of expenditure toward, social sectors would have an impact the affected people both  directly  and through improved donor sentiment. 50. Improved  governance  will  be  critical for supporting  structural  reforms,  providing the foundation for stronger  growth  andpoverty  alleviation,  and  attracting  donor  support Efforts to increase  fiscal transparency and accountability and to address lapses  in the rule of law  would go a long  way to strengthen domestic and foreign confidence in the Swazi economy, attract investment  and assistance, and generally improve socioeconomic prospects.

The effectiveness of policymaking would be significantly enhanced by improvements in the economic data The authorities are encouraged to address the shortcomings that  remain in the economic  statistics,  particularly  in the national  income, balance of payments,  and  government  accounts, and to improve the timeliness of data reporting to the Fund. In this context, their  participation  in the GDDS and  provision of metadata  in  early 2003 are very  welcome,  and the ongoing GDDS assessment and  technical assistance should  form a sound  basis  for  strengthening the statistics. 52. It is  proposed  that the next  Article IV consultation  be  held on  the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - Table 1.

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held  in Mbabane in October 2003. The staff report is scheduled for consideration by the Executive Board on February 9,2004. IX. Technical Assistance FAD provided technical assistance in 1997 to Swaziland on  tax reform. A technical assistance mission visited Swaziland in 1999 to advise on a new income  tax bill. In 1998, LEG assisted  Swaziland in drafting a new income tax bill  and amendments to the Sales Tax Act. MFD (then MAE) provided technical assistance in 1997 to assist  in the drafting of  the Financial Institutions Act,  and,  in 1998, MFD provided an advisor to strengthen bank supervision at  the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS). Until January 2000, MFD had  provided a long-term general advisor to the CBS. In 1999, MFD also conducted several staff visits  to provide advice on improving the payments system, including the introduction of electronic payments systems. A mission visited Mbabane in February 2003 to provide technical assistance in further strengthening the CBS  and the financial system. The mission, which was the first multitopic mission to Swaziland, focused on monetary  and foreign exchange operations, development of  the government securities market, the payments system,  and banking supervision. Two follow-up missions in July and October 2003 provided advice on implementing some of  the recommendations regarding the development of the government securities market,  and regarding strengthening monetary  and foreign exchange operations at the CBS. MFD is also working with the FIRST Initiative to help develop a function for  the supervision of nonbank financial institutions. An "I) staff visit in October 2003 assisted in this effort. An STA mission visited Swaziland in 1998 with the objectives of identifying weaknesses in the statistical system and assisting  in capacity building, particularly relating to the national accounts and other real sector data. An STA  mission visited Swaziland in  April 1999 to assist with balance of payments statistics; another STA mission visited Swaziland in  April 1999 to establish an action plan for improving government finance  statistics. An initial mission in July 2002 made progress with the implementation of  the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). It was followed by a Government Finance  Statistics (GFS) mission in July  2003 and an  STA technical assistance mission under the GDDS project in October 2003. X.

Total IDA commitments amounted to US$8.4  million; IBRD commitments amounted to US$104.8 million (of which US$84.4 million  was  disbursed, US$4.4 million was cancelled,  and US$16.0 million remains undisbursed);  and IFC commitments amounted to US$23.7 million. The most  recent of these operations are an IBRD loan for an  Urban Development Project  (US$29  million)  in 1994, and an IFC loan  and equity input of US$3.3 million to Swaziland  First  Merchant  Bank  in 1999. Only the IBRD loan for Urban Development is  currently disbursing. The IDA/IBRD assistance has  been  for a broad  range of sectors: roads,  education,  power, water supply/sewerage,  rural and urban development, and development finance. The IFC's investments have  been  in support of a development finance corporation,  agro-industrial enterprises producing  sugar  and cotton, paper  pulp production,  and  textile/garment production.

The  authorities  provide available data to the Fund with a lag of one-two months,  except for the national accounts and  international trade data, which are reported  with  irregular  periodicity  and with substantial lags. As one of fourteen  countries  participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone Afiican Countries,  Swaziland  has undertaken to use the GDDS as a framework for the development  of  national statistical systems. GDDS metadata for  Swaziland  were  initially  posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board  on February 1 1, 2003,  and  updated for certain sectors in November 2003. The  Anglophone Africa  project  (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)) aims to assist  participating countries to implement  plans for improvement identified  in the metadata, to follow GDDS  recommended  statistical practices. Real sector data National accounts suffer  from serious shortcomings. For example, data on  GDP by sector of origin are available in  current  prices  only  up to 2002; data on GDP by expenditure category at  constant  prices are not available; and there is no  reporting of unemployment data on a regular basis. For  national accounts data, missions  rely on estimates provided by the Central Statistical Ofice (CSO). A STA mission took place  in October 2003. Prices The consumer price  index (CPI) was  significantly  revised in 1998. Monthly  consumer  price data are published by the CSO with a one-month  lag.  For International  Financial  Statistics PFS) purposes, the CPI  is  reported for the all-income group. Government finance statistics Fiscal data are provided to AFR staff only during missions and/or following budget announcements. The  Central Bank of  Swaziland (CBS) reports to STA fiscal data for publication  in IFS on  an irregular basis. After a long delay, the authorities reported  data  in 2001 for publication  in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS  Yearbook. A July  2003 GFS  mission  found that (a) the coverage of  government includes only  budgetary operations, and excludes the extrabudgetary accounts and the local governments; (b) an outdated MOF Economic Spreadsheet is  used to compile GFS on an irregular basis; and  (c)  fiscal statistics and  monetary statistics are not  reconciled on a regular basis. The mission  made recommendations to address these shortcomings.  It also recommended that the authorities consider modifying the budget classification in line with the  GFSM 2001  methodology  and designate an MOF staff member as GFS compiler.

The data are generally good. However, the CBS's reserve  position  in the Fund is not  included  in  its foreign assets in the report to the IMF. In  addition, the capitalization of interest may  distort credit  data,  and the circulation of large amounts of unverifiable South African rand  make data on money  difficult to interpret. Balance of payments statistics The CSO publishes data on foreign trade on a  quarterly  basis,  but the lack of sufficient computer resources continues to result  in  long lags in the production of  trade-especially import-data.  Missions use trade data provided by the CBS. The CBS now adheres to a methodology consistent  with the Fund's Balance of PaymentsManual (fifth edition). However, errors and  omissions are large  and suggest a  need to examine the quality  and coverage of data for all components of  the balance of payments.

The  mission  conducted  two  scenarios  to  analyze the medium-term economic outlook: a “baseline” scenario that assumes  unchanged  policies (that is, policies that have  already been announced), and a “reform” scenario  that  assumes the implementation of reform policies that include a restoration  of  fiscal  discipline  and the implementation of  structural reforms to raise  economic  efficiency (see Table 1). 2. Both scenarios are susceptible  to  significant  negative risks. In particular, neither scenario takes into account the costs of contingent liabilities, such as those related to the public  pension  fund,  and the potentially  higher  than  envisaged economic costs of HIV/AIDS. If these costs were to materialize,  the  needed  fiscal  adjustment  would  be correspondingly larger. Baseline scenario 3. The baseline medium-term  scenario  assumes a continuation of current policies  and developments,  in  particular the following: 0 a continued  expansionary  fiscal  policy; 0 revenue sharing under the new Southern  African Customs Union (SACU) agreement coming into effect  by 2004/05 and a reduction in SACU revenue on account  of continued trade liberalization; and 0 a continued  slowdown in population  growth,  largely due to the impact of HIV/AIDS on mortality. Reform scenario 4. The  reform scenario assumes  reform policies in a  number of areas, including a fiscal policy consistent with achieving a primary  balance  by 2007. Specific measures include the following: 0 a reduction  in the wage bill as  a share of GDP through implementation of the civil service restructuring program; 0 a reorientation of spending toward  more  focused priorities, including HIV/AIDS and poverty alleviation; 0 a strengthening of the investment  environment through improved governance; 0 a broadening of the tax base  and  strengthening tax administration; 0 public enterprise restructuring and privatization that results in  budget  savings and increases overall economic efficiency; and 0 land  reform that addresses tenure and efficiency issues.

C.  20431  USA IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Swaziland On  January  28,  2004,  the  Executive  Board  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) concluded  the  Article  IV  consultation  with  Swaziland.' Background Swaziland  faces  a  serious  socioeconomic  situation.  Although it is  classified  as  a  lower- middle-income  country,  income  distribution  is  highly  skewed, and two-thirds  of  the population is estimated  to live on  less  than  US$1  a  day. A growing  fiscal  deficit threatens  macroeconomic  stability  and  external  viability,  and  concerns  over  governance, particularly  the  rule  of  law,  are  threatening  to  undermine  social  harmony  and  investor and  donor  sentiment.  Meanwhile,  the  humanitarian  situation  remains  difficult,  with persistent  high  rates of  HIV/AIDS,  unemployment,  poverty,  and  localized food shortages. Economic  growth in Swaziland  has  weakened  since  the  early 199Os, in part  reflecting  an erosion  of  the  country's  advantage  as  an  investment  location  following  South  Africa's emergence  from  apartheid.  After  falling  to  1 W -2  percent in 2000-01,  growth  is  estimated to have  picked  up to 3% percent in 2002, owing  to  a  combination  of  mainly  temporary * Under  Article IV of  the  IMF's  Articles  of  Agreement,  the  IMF  holds  bilateral  discussions with  members,  usually  every  year.  A  staff  team  visits  the  country,  collects  economic  and financial  information,  and  discusses  with  officials  the  country's  economic  developments and policies.  On  return  to  headquarters,  the  staff  prepares  a  report,  which  forms  the basis for discussion  by  the  Executive  Board.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  discussion,  the Managing  Director, as Chairman  of  the  Board,  summarizes  the  views  of  Executive Directors,  and  this  summary  is  transmitted  to  the  country's  authorities.  This  PIN summarizes  the  views  of  the  Executive  Board  as  expressed  during  the  [January  28, 20041  Executive  Board  discussion  based  on  the  staff  report.

The  completion  of  the  Maguga  Dam  and  some  road  and  housing  projects boosted  construction,  sugarcane  production  recovered  and  had  knock-on  effects  on manufacturing  output,  particularly  food  processing,  and  clothing  production  was supported by Swaziland’s  participation in the U.S. African  Growth and Opportunity  Act (AGOA).  Economic  activity  appears  to  have  slowed  in  2003  with  the  waning  of  the  one- off effects  that  supported  growth  last  year  and  a  weaker  investment  environment. The  central  government  fiscal  deficit  (including  grants)  widened to 4% percent of  GDP in 2002/03  (April-March).  The  increase  was  the  result  of  both  higher  expenditure, particularly  on  public wages and  transportation,  and  lower  revenue as a  share  of  GDP, in part  reflecting  a  drop  in  Southern  African  Customs  Union  (SACU)  receipts. Developments  thus  far in 2003104 suggest  that  the  deficit could widen  substantially  to 6% percent  of  GDP  for  the  fiscal  year,  largely  due  to  an  increase in public  sector  wages, spending  on  a  commonwealth  partnership  summit, and the  government’s  participation in some  of  the  so-called  Millennium  Projects,  such  as  a  new  airport. After  depreciating  substantially in 2001 and the  first  half  of  2002,  the  lilangeni  has appreciated  subsequently,  reflecting  the  strengthening  of  the South African  rand  (to which it is  pegged).  In  August  2003,  the  nominal  and  real  effective  values of the  lilangeni were  3.8  percent and 4.5 percent  stronger,  respectively,  than  a  year  previously.  The external  current  account  deficit  narrowed to 4 percent  of  GDP in 2002 as  a  decline in foreign  income  and  transfers was  more  than  offset  by  a  reduction in the  goods  and services  deficit.  External  debt  rose to 32  percent  of  GDP,  and  the ratio of  external  debt- service  payments to exports to 1 W percent.  Net  international  reserves fell from  over  2 months of  imports  in  2002 to around  1 W months  of  imports  by  September  2003,  largely due  to  a  drawdown in government  foreign  reserve  holdings to finance  the  budget  deficit. The scope  for  the  Central  Bank  of  Swaziland (CBS) to  pursue an independent  monetary policy is limited by the peg of  the  lilangeni  to  the  rand  and  Swaziland’s  membership in the  Common  Monetary  Area  (CMA).  The CBS reduced  short-term interest rates by 500 basis  points  during  June-October  2003, in step  with  monetary  easing  by  the  South African  Reserve  Bank. Inflationary  pressures  have  eased  since  late 2002 in line  with  inflation  trends in South Africa.  Falling  oil and food  prices  and  the  appreciation of the  lilangeni  have  contributed to a  decline in consumer  price  inflation  from  a  peak  of  nearly 13 percent  (12-month basis) in October  2002  to  4.8  percent in October  2003.
