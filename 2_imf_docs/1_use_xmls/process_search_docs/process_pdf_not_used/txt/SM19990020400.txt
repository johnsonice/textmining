It slowed to 4 percent in 1998/99 (July-June), reflecting, inter alia, the considerable weakening of the diamond market. Consumer price inflation (I 2-month basis) reached a 13-year low of 5.9 percent in July 1998. Subsequently, as inflation in South Africa edged up to about 9 percent during the second half of 1998 and Botswana’s expansionary financial policies put upward pressures on nontradable prices, inflation picked up to 7.2 percent in June 1999. l Botswana experienced a marked deterioration in its public finances in 1998/99 (ApriI- March), when the overall fiscal balance moved to an estimated deficit of 5% percent of GDP from a surplus of 4% percent in the previous year. The sharp swing in the budgetary outcome reflected mainly the significant drop-by almost one-third, or 9% percent of GDP-in mineral revenue and substantial increases in government spending, including wage awards. . Monetary developments in I998 and the first quarter of 1999 were characterized by an excessive expansion of domestic credit. Bank credit to the private sector surged by 46 percent in 1998 (I 2-month rate) and 47 percent during the first quarter of 1999, compared with 6 percent in 1997. . The external current account surplus was reduced from I4 percent of GDP in 1997 to 1 percent in 1998, as diamond exports fell sharply and imports continued their upward trend. International reserves rose by US$266 million to US$5.9 billion at end-1998, equivalent to 29 months of imports. The large depreciation of the South African rand in 1998 caused the pula to depreciate by 14% percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. Staff position l Over the years, Botswana has established an impressive record of economic management, and, as a consequence, it has enjoyed very high real GDP growth rates under stable macroeconomic conditions. l The weakening of the fiscal position in 1998/99 was primarily the result of adverse exogenous developments. Although a countercyclical stance was appropriate under the circumstances, other factors added disproportionally to the fiscal stimulus, causing unsustainable domestic demand pressures. l The continued excessive growth in domestic credit is cause for concern and requires speedy action by the monetary authorities to reverse this trend. l The budget for 1999/2000 establishes a framework for an appropriately restrained fiscal stance, provided that the authorities are firm in adhering to the fiscal target and do not allow any slippages.

The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions with Botswana were held in Gaborone during April 27-May 11, 1999.’ 2 Meetings were held with Hon. P. H. K. Kedikilwe, Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Mr. B. Gaolathe, Governor of the Bank of Botswana, Mr. S.S.G. Tumclo, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, and other senior officials in charge of economic policy issues, as well as with business and labor representatives. 2. In concluding the 1997 Article IV consultation on March 13, 1998, Executive Direc- tors commended the authorities for their continued prudent approach to economic policy, which had contributed to sustained economic growth, low inflation, and a strong external position. Noting that Botswana’s large dependence on the diamond sector remained a source of vulnerability, Directors underscored the need for the authorities to pursue additional struc- tural policies aimed at economic diversification over the medium term. As the prospects for a substantial reduction in the fiscal surplus for 1998199 loomed, Directors encouraged the au- thoritics to take action to tighten the fiscal stance so as to preserve macroeconomic stability. 3. Botswana’s economic and financial statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, and information is provided to the staff on a timely basis. However, labor market data arc available only with a considerable time lag, and there are no time series on unemployment and labor force statistics. Different accounting periods for key economic statistics complicate analysis and policy formulation.3 In addition, there are large discrepancies between recent national accounts and balance of payments data on net exports. As regards Y2K problems, the authorities have established a National Year 2000 Coordinating Forum, which has taken steps to ensure Botswana’s readiness in the different sectors of the economy. II. ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSIN~~~~-99 4. Botswana’s economy experienced strong real GDP growth during 1995/96-1997198 (July-June), averaging more than 7 percent a year, aided by a boost in diamond production ’ The staff team comprised Mr. van Til (head), Mr. Almekinders, Ms. Kawakami, Mr. Matovu, and Mr. Yuguda (all AFR). 2 Botswana’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group arc summarized in Appendixes I and II, respectively; statistical issues arc discussed in Appendix III; social indicators are contained in Appendix IV; and a draft Public Information Notice (PIN) is contained in Appendix V. 3 Balance of payments statistics are compiled on a calendar-year basis, national accounts data on a July-June cycle, and budget data on a fiscal-year basis (April-March).

Real GDP growth slowed to 4 percent in 1998/99, reflecting, inter alia, the considerable weakening of the diamond market4 As in the previous year, real domestic demand expanded rapidly, by an estimated 18 percent, mainly on account of a sharp rise in public consumption and private sector investment (Tables 2 and 3). The latter could be attributed to the buildup of diamond inventories, as De Beers’ Central Selling Organization (CSO) introduced in February 1998 a quota of 80 percent of production (lowered to 75 percent in October 1998) on its purchases from the mining companies.

Notwithstanding the rapid economic growth in recent years, formal sector employment has expanded only marginally since the early 1990s; the decline in employment in the private and parastatal sectors has been more than offset by the rise in government employment. With a rapidly growing labor force, unemployment has been on the rise and is estimated at more than 21 percent of the labor force in 1 998/99.5 4 In 1998, world diamond sales by De Beers fell by about 28 percent. 5 Yormal sector employment data are collected annually, but labor force and unemployment statistics are available only through infrequent labor force surveys. The most recent survey (199511996 Labor Force Survey) was published in 1998. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 6. In recent years, wage increases stayed well below labor productivity gains, as rcllected in the decline in the labor income share in the nonmining sector from 56 percent in 1991/92 to 42 percent in 1996/97 (July-June; Figure 2). A turnaround occurred in 1997/98 when average monthly cash earnings rose by 29 percent, compared with only 5 percent in the previous year. The wage increases were most pronounced in the banking sector (82 percent), mining (44 percent), transport and communications (37 percent), and central government (34 percent). In July 1998, the govermncnt awarded a further 25 percent wage increase to civil servants, with most parastatals following suit. 7. Consumer price inflation (12-month basis) continued to decelerate during most of 1998, reaching a 13-year low of 5.9 percent in July (Figure 1). The steady decline primarily reflected the slowdown in prices of tradables, which-representing 71 percent of the basket-benefited from the sharp decline in inflation in South Africa. Subsequently, as inflation in South Africa edged up to about 9 percent during the second half of 1998 and Botswana’s expansionary financial policies put upward pressures on nontradable prices, inflation picked up in late 1998 and rose to 7.2 percent in June 1999. Equity prices increased moderately in 1998 (by 14 percent in U.S. dollar terms) following an increase of 92 percent in 1997.6 The foreign companies index, however, which includes dual-listed companies, fell by 28 percent in 1998, owing primarily to weak earnings in the mining sector. 8. Following many years of strong fiscal performance, Botswana experienced a marked deterioration in its public finances in 1998199 (April-March), when the overall fiscal balance moved to an estimated deficit of 5% percent of GDP from a surplus of 4% percent in the previous year (Figure 3). The sharp swing in the budgetary outcome reflected mainly the significant drop-by almost one-third, or 9% percent of GDP-in mineral revenue. In addition, expenditure pressures were exerted through the passing of three supplementary budgets in the course of the year (Box l), which raised budgetary spending limits by the equivalent of 4.6 percent of GDP (Table 4). The July 1998 increase in civil service salaries caused the government wage bill to rise by 23 percent, while nonwage recurrent expenditure also rose sharply. Although higher spending on development projects had been authorized because of cost overruns, the estimated budget outcome for capital expenditure remained well below provisions, as implementation bottlenecks slowed spending. ’ Based on the Botswana Stock Exchange domestic companies index.

Supplementary Budgets-Source of Expenditure Overruns Supplementary budgets are common in Rotswana. In recent yeas, they have allowed significant increases in spending. In 1998/99 (April-March) three supplementary budgets authorized additional spending ofP 1,018 million-equivalent to 4.6 percent ofGDP, or more than I I percent of original budget provisions without offsetting revenue measures. Instead, revenue estimates were revised downward in the second supplementary budget by almost P 800 million. Thus, the fiscal surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in the original budget turned into a forecast deficit 017.3 percent of GDP. The first supplementary budget (July 1998) included the costs of food supplies (P 67 million) and labor-intensive public works (food-for-work programs of P 88 million) that were initiated in response to the drought, as well as cost overruos in the development budget. The second supplementary budget (November 1998) took account of tbc wage increase of July 1998, whereas the third supplement (February 1999) covered miscellaneous increases in current expenditure. 9. Mdnetary developments in 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 were characterized by an excessive expansion of domestic credit (Table 5). Bank credit to the private sector surged by 46 percent in 1998 (12-month rate) and 47 percent during the first quarter of 1999, compared with 6 percent in 1997. Initially the credit expansion was supported by an accom- modating monetary policy, as-in response to lower inflation- the Bank of Botswana lowered its bank lending rate in two steps to 11% percent in April 1998. When signs of inflationary pressures began to emerge during the second half of 1998, the central bank rate was raised in three steps, reaching 13% percent in March 1999. Commercial bank prime lending rates, which follow closely movements in the bank rate, were lowered marginally to 13% percent in April 1998 but subsequently rose in line with the central bank rate to 14% percent in April 1999 (Figure 4). However, these actions appeared to have had little impact on credit demand. IO. The external current account surplus fell by 13 percentage points of GDP in 1998 to 1 percent (Table 7), largely on account of the decline in diamond exports and a tirm rise in imports, including those associated with the expansion of the Orapa diamond mine, the North-South Carrier Water Project, and the establishment of a vehicle assembly plant. The external capital and financial account fell from a surplus of US$23 million in 1997 to a deficit of US$36 million in 1998, as net outflows of portfolio and other investments of US$221 million outpaced net inflows of foreign direct investment of US$167 million; the net portfolio outflows were mainly invested in equities abroad. Consequently, international rcscrves rose by US.%266 million to US$5.9 billion at end-1998, equivalent to 29 months of imports of goods and services (Figure 5). 11. In February 1999, Botswana took the important step of eliminating all remaining exchange controls for both current and capital account transactions, thereby completing the liberalization of the exchange system. The exchange rate of the pula, which is determined on the basis of a basket in which the South African rand has a significant weight, depreciated in nominal and real effective terms in 1998 by some 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. In 1998, the pula depreciated by 14% percent (in foreign currency terms) vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, and by another 4 percent during the first half of 1999 (Figure 6).

The discussions took place against the backdrop of the substantial deterioration in both domestic and external balances in 1998. They focused on the factors underlying the deterioration, in particular whether it reflected primarily temporary or permanent conditions, Also discussed was the policy framework that would be required to achieve balanced economic growth over the medium term, including structural policies to promote diversification and employment generation. 13. The authorities explained that the deterioration in the macroeconomic situation in 1998/99 primarily reflected the sharp downturn in the external sector, brought about by the weakening of world diamond demand. They had allowed a loosening of fiscal and monetary policies to cushion the impact of this sizable but temporary external shock. While agreeing that a countercyclical fiscal stance had been appropriate during the past year, the mission expressed concern that overall macroeconomic policies had been excessively expansionary and, if continued, could place macroeconomic stability at risk. In this regard, the mission welcomed the recent steps taken by the authorities, including the more restrictive 1999/2000 budget and the recent interest rate hikes, but cautioned that additional measures would be needed. It also noted that a number of risks remained, particularly in view of the uncertain external environment. A. Economic Outlook for 1999/2000 14. On the strength of a recovery of the diamond market (Box 2), the authorities expected that economic growth would pick up in 1999/2000, although much would depend on the pace and depth of the economic recovery in Asia. Strong growth in nonmining private sector activity is expected to continue in 1999/2000 (July-June), notably in construction. Overall, real GDP growth is projected to increase to about 6 percent. Consumer price inflation is projected to rise further during the remainder of 1999, reaching 9 percent by the end of the year, as strong domestic demand and the pass-through of the depreciation of the pula are likely to exert pressure on domestic prices. 15. The external outlook, which is closely linked to developments in the diamond market, is projected to improve gradually, with a modest increase in the current account surplus as diamond exports rise and the terms of trade improve. With an expected strengthening of the capital and financial account, reflecting, inter alia, higher foreign direct investment, inter- national reserves are projected to rise by US$126 million in 1999 to US$6.1 billion, or 27 months of imports of goods and services.

Recent Developments in the Diamond Sector The mining sector has continued to remain central to Botswana’s economy, accounting for more than one third of GDP and 70 percent of exports earnings in 1997. Mineral revenue, including taxes, dividends, end royalties, constituted almost 60 percent of total fiscal revenue in FY 1997198. The mining sector employs 8,700 people, which is about 3% percent of total formal sector employment. The Debswana Diamond Company, jointly owned by De Beers and the government, produces high quality gem diamonds. Botswana has benefited significantly from the rccove!y in the global diamond market since 1994, with production increasing on average by 6 percent during 1994-96. In response to increased demand perticularly in the U.S., Debswana shifted from 5 days to 7 days a week operations in January 1997. In addition, Dcbswana embarked on the expansion of the Orapa mine in October 1996, which is expected to double the mine’s production to I2 million carats in 2000. During 199697, however, the imports of gem diamonds by Japan, then the second largest consumer, almost halved in U.S. dollars, compared to 1995, owing to the prolonged recession. The Asian crisis in mid-1997 exacerbated the already weakened global diamond market, and diamond prices fell precipitously in 1998, especially in the Asian market. De Fleers’ Central Selling Orgenization (CSO), a marketing cartel, imposed in February 1998 a quota of 80 percent on its purchases from its mining companies. In October 1998, the quota was lowered to 75 percent. As a result, while production in Rotswana declined only by 2 percent in 1998, exports fell by 32 percent in volume and by 30 percent in value. ‘There are indications that the recovery of the Asian economies has led to a pickup in the world diamond demand in the first quarter of 1999. However, as the recovery is expected to be slow, the quota is likely to remain in effect for some time, which would result in significant stockpiling in the period ahead.

I/Excluding industrial diamonds. B. Fiscal Policy 16. The sharp deterioration in the budget outcome for 1998/99 contrasted markedly with past fiscal performance. Pressures on the public finances have been gradually building, and the recent experience, although importantly the result of the downturn in the diamond market, also reflected the rapid growth of government spending that is under way. 17. The budget for 1999/2000 (April-March), which was presented to parliament on February 8,1999, aims at reducing the overall budget deficit by almost 4 percentage points to 1% percent of GDP. Total revenue and grants are projected to increase by 37 percent over last year’s preliminary outturn, mainly reflecting higher mineral revenues Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- and larger transfers from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Total expenditure and net lending are budgeted to grow by 23 percent, consisting of a 30 percent increase in development expenditure and a 17 percent increase in recurrent expenditure. The budget appropriately does not envisage civil service salary adjustments in 199912000. 18. The mission welcomed the more restrained fiscal stance embodied in the 1999/2000 budget but cautioned that there were significant downward risks to the revenue forecast, particularly for mineral revenue. In this regard, it noted that the low level of diamond exports achieved in late 1998 had not been reflected in the mineral revenue forecast for 1999/2000. While there were indications of a recovery in the diamond market, the mission expressed the view that the projected 52 percent increase in mineral revenue was unlikely to be realized. A revenue shortfall on the order of P 800 million (some 3 percent of GDP) could well emerge if the recovery in diamond exports proceeded slower than the authorities had assumed. 19. The accelerated implementation of development projects had led to a boom in the construction sector, which, in turn, had contributed to the growing imbalances in the economy. The planned 30 percent increase in development spending in the 199912000 budget would exacerbate these pressures, and the mission recommended a scaling back of these outlays, including a more gradual phasing in line with the Eighth National Development Plan (I 997/98%2002/03). This course of action would be consistent with the government’s implementation capacity and would contribute to a more balanced growth in the economy. The authorities, however, indicated that many projects had already been started, and their timely completion was deemed necessary to improve growth and employment prospects. 20. The mission underscored the importance of strictly adhering to the targeted reduction of the deficit. This would not only reaffirm the authorities’ commitment to prudent financial policies, but also ensure a fiscal stance consistent with sustainable growth and low inflation. In this context, the mission recommended the adoption of a contingency plan (amounting to about 3 percent of GDP) in order to deal with possible revenue shortfalls. Specifically, it suggested the following measures: (i) apply strict controls over new hirings, which could result in savings of about P 180 million in the government wage bill:’ (ii) reduce the growth of development spending by delaying construction projects in line with the capacity constraints in the construction sector, and thcrcby save about P 600 million; and (iii) resist the adoption of supplcmcntary budgets, which have tended to weaken budget discipline and have encouraged ministries to submit additional expenditure requests in the course of the year. 7 The budgeted wage bill of P 2.5 billion assumes that all vacancies in the central government (about 3% pcrccnt of total positions) would be filled during the fiscal year.

The authorities agreed with the need to adhere strictly to the overall budget deficit target but believed that it was premature to adopt specific contingency measures at present. They reiterated their intention, as noted in the budget speech, to enhance spending ministries’ commitments to original budget objectives. The authorities planned to achieve this goal by restricting supplementaries to emergency cases only and by insisting that ministries reprioritize expenditure plans within their own budgets if they wanted to undertake new policy initiatives, C. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies 22. The excessive credit expansion to households and enterprises in 1998 and early 1999 was a cause for concern. The authorities explained that the increase in consumer loans in 1998 had resulted primarily from sizable wage increases accorded to the civil service and parastatal employees,’ while the rapid growth in government nonwage spending and construction activity had helped spur credit to private enterprises and parastatals. They also noted that credit growth had been exacerbated by parastatal bank borrowing, which in the past had been met through public sector funds.’ 23. The mission expressed the view that the immediate challenge for monetary policy was to bring credit expansion firmly under control. In this regard, it noted that commercial bank representatives thought that the underlying credit demand was likely to persist throughout 1999. Thus, the mission urged the authorities to act quickly to reduce credit expansion and avoid a possible repeat of the macroeconomic and financial sector problems occasioned by the rapid expansion of bank credit between 1987 and 1992. Specifically, it would be critical to limit the growth of reserve money and reduce bank liquidity, so as to ensure that the monetary growth targets set by the Bank of Botswana (BOB) were achieved. The mission recommended a further increase in the bank rate and active open market operations to tighten liquidity conditions. In addition, fiscal policy would need to play an important role in supporting these efforts by building up govemmcnt deposits with the central bank. 24. The authorities shared the mission’s view that the rapid growth of credit, if left unchecked, could lead to macroeconomic instability and financial distress in the banking system. However, they were of the view that the boom in consumer lending was a temporary phenomenon and would run out of steam. They also noted that the capacity of banks to continue lending would be constrained by their reduced liquidity positions. Nonetheless, the monetary authorities were monitoring developments closely, and they stated they would act promptly if credit continued its rapid growth. * These wage increases enabled many workers to have easier access to consumer loans. 9 A gradual phasing out of parastatal borrowing from the Public Debt Service Fund started in 1996.

The mission commended the authorities for the recent introduction of a secured lending facility and repurchase agreements-two additional facilities for the manage- ment of liquidity in the banking system. As both of these allow commercial banks to borrow from the BOB against adequate collateral, their use should promote the development of the money market by reducing counterparty risk and transaction costs. 26. Botswana’s financial sector is basically sound (Box 3). However, in view of the recent surge in commercial bank credit, as well as of the liberalization of capital account transactions, the mission stressed the importance of remaining vigilant in bank supervision and developing an early warning system for potential risks in banks’ loan portfolios. In this regard, it commended the authorities for raising the minimum capital adequacy ratio from 8 percent to 15 percent of risk-weighted assets, and for strengthening the guidelines on foreign currency exposure. The BOB’S prudential supervision of the financial sector is presently limited to banks, while most of the nonbank financial intermediaries are supervised by other agencies. In this regard, the mission supported the authorities’ efforts to extend the BOB’S supervisory powers to nonbank financial institutions. D. Regional Integration, Trade, and Exchange Rate Policies 21. Given Botswana’s close economic and financial links to South Africa, the mission supported the continuation of the current exchange rate arrangement of pegging the pula to a currency basket in which the rand has a significant weight. The mission broadly agreed with the authorities’ view that the current level of the exchange rate was appropriate” and underscored the importance of safeguarding Botswana’s competitiveness by maintaining the real effective exchange rate close to its equilibrium level over the medium term. The mission emphasized the need to implement appropriate domestic policies to support the exchange rate peg, including limiting wage increases to productivity gains and keeping inflation in line with that of Botswana’s main trading partners. In this regard, developments since 199 l/92 in unit labor costs in Botswana have remained closely aligned to those in South Africa. In view of the wage leadership of the government, the mission stressed that wage moderation in the public sector would be key to moderating wage developments economy-wide. lo Staff estimates suggest that the actual exchange rate did not deviate significantly from the estimated long-run equilibrium rate over the 199G98 period.

Financial Sector Supervision The financial sector comprises the Bank of Botswana (BOB), five commercial banks (all foreign owned), and several nonbank financial institutions, including two development institutions, two savings institutions, a leasing company, and a stock exchange. The BOB’S regulatory and supervisory powers apply only to commercial banks, but the central bank, in consultation with the Ministly of Finance, is formulating guidelines to bring other financial institutions under its supervisory umbrella. Commercial banks are regulated and supervised in accordance with the 1995 Banking Act, which provides the legal framework for the ownership, establishment, prudential regulation, and supervision of hanks. Botswana’s financial sector is in good condition. All commercial banks are well capitalixd, and their operations are very profitable. Their ratio of total advances to total deposit liabilities is a modest 50 percent. Only I percent of total commercial bank loans is nonpcrforming. for which adequate provisions have been made. ‘The BOB conducts regular off-site and on-&c inspections. A capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent of unimpaired capital to risk-weighted asseti is the statutory minimum. However. in 1998. the RoR advised all commercial banks to adopt the internationally rccommcnded capital adequacy ratio of 15 percent, in view of the recent exchange control libcralization and the possibility of Year 2000 (Y2K) related risks. At end-December 1998. the capital ratio ofthc commercial banks ranged hetwcen 15 percent and 18 percent, while the ratio ofcore capital to total capital was at least X0 percent. Instead of applying uniform provisioning rcquircmcnw, the BOB assessed thcsc separately for each bank. The typical classification profile is as follows: two to three months’ arrears considered as substandard: four to six months’ arrears as doubtful of recovery; and over six months’ arrears as a loss. No commercial bank may lend more than 30 percent of its unimpaired capital to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Any loan to a single borrower or a related group of up to IO percent of a bank’s unimpaired capital must be approved by the lending bank’s board ofdircctors. Lending to internal borrowers is limited to 25 percent of unimpaired capital. The full liheralization of the exchange system prompted the BOB to strengthen the guidelines on Cooreign exchange exposure. Banks are required to limit their net foreign assets position to 30 percent. Within this overall limit, there are currcncy- specific limits of not more than I5 percent per currency for the four major currencies (the U.S. dollar, the South African mod, the euro, and the pound sterling) and 5 percent for all other currcncics. which apply to both on-balance and ofFbalancc sheet items. At end-December 1998, all banks were in compliance. In preparation for the cstablishmcnt of an international financial services center, the BOB has made a preliminary manpower assessment to cope with the expected increase in the number of financial institutions under its regulatory oversight. Ao effort is being made to consolidate various pieces of legislation on money laundering and economic crime into one law, as the current regulations are scattered among various statutes. A deposit insurance scheme has been recommended by the IloB to the government in order to protect small depositors (maximum deposit: P 20,000). The scheme would provide a maximum cover of90 perccnt and is to be funded by both the commercial banks and the government. Participation in the scheme will be mandatory for all licensed banks and it will cover all commercial bank depositors, including nonresidents. Ilowever, deposits of government agencies and public sector institutions will not bc insured. 28. The mission commended the authorities for eliminating all remaining exchange controls in early 1999, thereby establishing the full convertibility of the currency for both current and capital account transactions. The experience so far suggested that this mcasurc had not had a noticeable impact on capital outflows, which confirmed the public’s confidence in the pula. The authorities acknowledged that the full liberalisation of exchange controls, coupled with plans for the establishment of an international financial services center, would require additional efforts to ensure the soundness and stability of the financial system, including safeguards against money laundering. 29. Botswana retains a multiple currency practice arising from the exchange rate guarantee provided by the government on external loans obtained by public enterprises before October 1990 under the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme. This scheme was discontinued in 1990 and the multiple currency practice will be eliminated in 2006, when the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- last debt will have been repaid. Accordingly, the authorities have requested an extension of the Fund’s approval for the temporary retention of this practice. 30. Botswana’s membership in the SACU gives its exports duty-free access to the South African market at the cost of a loss of discretion over its external trade regime.” The recently concluded trade agreement between the European Union (EU) and South Africa will have a beneficial impact on Botswana’s import prices. However, there will be a decline in the SACU revenue pool and a possible effect on Botswana’s competitiveness.‘2 A new SACU revenue-sharing formula is under consideration, which will reduce over time government revenues. The mission supported Botswana’s position of pressing for a low, simple, and uniform external tariff structure for the SACIJ, as well as its efforts to reduce tariffs over an eight-year period for Southern African Development Community (SADC) members. E. Structural Policies 31. Although progress has been made in diversifying the economy and creating employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector (Box 4), unemployment has remained at more than 21 percent of the labor force. While the rapid employment growth in the government sector and public works programs may have mitigated the unemployment problem somewhat. the mission was of the view that a further expansion in government employment was not sustainable. It noted that a significant part of the unemployment problem reflected the skills mismatch between supply and demand in the labor market. Therefore, the mission welcomed the government’s efforts to stimulate vocational and technical training, and to improve the quality of education at all levels. 32. The authorities recently launched various initiatives designed to diversify the economy and create employment, including (i) adopting a comprehensive policy framework aimed at stimulating small, medium-sized, and micro-enterprises; (ii) promoting the establishment of an international financial services center, which would provide offshore banking, unit trusts, and insurance facilities; and (iii) addressing the weaknesses that were identified in the evaluation of the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP).13 ” In an effort to combat fraud, effective January 4, 1999, South Africa has started levying on SACU exports to South Africa a I4 percent value-added tax, which is eligible for refund after verification of the exports’ legitimacy. I2 Botswana’s exports have preferential access to the EU under the Lome Convention. I3 The 1995 evaluation identified several weaknesses, including the unsustainabihty of employment created under the program, the low survival rate of companies created under the scheme, the low cost-effectiveness ofjobs created, and the potential negative effects of the scheme on labor productivity.

Economic Diversification and Employment Despite rapid growth during the last hvo decades and some progress toward diversification, Botswana’s economic base remains narrow, with minerals accounting for one-third of GDP and 70 percent of export earnings. The manufacturing sector, which has been heavily promoted by government under various diversification schemes, has grown appreciably, although its share in GDP has remained constant at about 4.1 percent, as the mining sector also expanded rapidly. In an effort to reduce the country’s dependence on mineral-led growth, the government has introduced several policies aimed at diversifying the economy. This policy emphasis is set out in the current National Development Plan and the new Industrial Development Policy. The key objective of diversification in Botswana is to create productive and sustainable employment opportunities in the nonmining sectors. Several policy initiatives have been undertaken to this end: the Industrial Development Policy of 1984 (revised in 1997) encourages high productivity and efficient export industries; the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP), introduced in 1982, provides prospective employers with grants based on the size and location of the investment: the Local Procurement Program, introduced in 1976, aims at directing a substantial share of purchases by government, local authorities, and parastatals to local manufacturers; the Sclebi-Phikwe Regional Development Program (SPRDP), established in 1988, encourages investment in nonmining economic activities in the Selebi-Pbikwe arca; and the policy framework for Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) was launched in 1998 to stimulate small businesses. Furthermore, preparations are under way for the establishment of an international financial services center. The effectiveness of the initiatives outlined above can be analyzed from two perspectives. At the sectoral level, the concentration of the mining sector and reliance on diamond exports continue to be high, but the objective of creating employment oppormnities in the nonmining sectors has been partially achieved, particularly in the nonagricultural sector. The manufacturing sector has contributed to economic diversification and job creation. Many jobs in manufacturing were created during the 1983-92 period. However, labor productivity in manufacturing has been generally on the decline, and employment growth has been limited in the second half of the 1990s. The public sector continues to be the largest contributor to employment growth. However, a significant part of the diversification problem is shuctural, as it reflects tbe weaknesses in the agricultural sector. the shortages of skilled labor, the mismatch of skills between the labor force leaving the agricultural sector and the requirements in other sectors. the high wage levels compared with other countries in the region (with the exception of South Africa), the small size of the domestic market, the shortage of serviced industrial land, and the high costs of utilities.

A task force comprising private and public sector representatives submitted in July 1998 a white paper on privatization policy, reviewing various modalities of privatizationi4 It laid out a timetable and possible candidates for privatization, including the railway, airline, and telecommunications companies. The mission welcomed the efforts of the Botswana authorities to design an appropriate privatization policy framework but noted that progress to date had been slow. While agreeing that most of Botswana’s parastatals were not a burden on the bud@, it emphasized that privatization could increase the efficiency of their operations and would relieve the government’s administrative and management capacity. The mission urged the authorities to press ahead with the implementation of the recommendations of the task force, including the establishment of an autonomous public enterprise monitoring and privatization agency (PEMPA). IV. MEDIUM-TERM PROJECTIONS 34. The baseline scenario, which assumes a strict adherence to the fiscal targets and a tightening of the monetary stance, projects average real GDP growth of about 5 percent a year during 1999/2000-2001/2002 (July-June), taking into account the following main factors: (i) growth in the mining sector of 6 percent a year, owing to increased diamond production and the phasing in of the Orapa 2000 mining project; and (ii) further progress in diversification of the nonmining sector, which would permit a robust growth in the manufacturing, construction, and services sectors. Thus, nonmining private sector GDP would grow on average by 6 percent a year, which would require, inter alia, a reversal of the recent slowing of total factor productivity growth (Box 5). 35. The overall fiscal position is projected to gradually improve over the medium term, assuming that expenditure is successfully reigned in. Capital expenditure is projected to hover around 12 percent of GDP, while current expenditure would decline to about 26 percent of GDP, returning almost to its 1997/98 (April-March) level. Total revenue and grants are projected to amount to 41 percent of GDP in the medium term, assuming that mineral revenue continues to grow and the negative net impact of a possible new SACU revenue-sharing arrangement remains limited or is partly offset by corrective measures. It is also assumed that the introduction of a value-added tax, planned for April 2001, would have a positive impact on revenue mobilization. 36. Credit expansion to the nongovernment sector is forecast to grow in line with nominal GDP, provided that the credit policy would aim at reducing appreciably the growth of domestic credit, aided by an improved fiscal position. I4 Among the modalities were commercialization, contracting out, liquidation, the selling of assets to a single buyer, and joint venture with a strategic partner.

Sources of Economic Growth During the period 1982-89, Botswana experienced very rapid economic growth of 13 percent a year on average, nainly driven by the mining sector. I~owever, in recent years, it has been difficult to sustain such a rate of growth. An important concern in examining the growth performance is to what extent it has been intensive or xtensive, and to identify the contribution of capital, labor, and technological progress to growth. 4t an aggregate level, the pattern depicted during the period 1982-89 shows that output growth was caused by a ustained increase in both factors of production and by considerable improvement in total factor productivity :TFP). During 1990-97, both capital and labor continued to grow at the same pace as before, but output growth decelerated, mainly owing to the significant slowing of TFP. The key fmdings at the sectoral level are as follows. Average growth rates in the mining sector during 1990-97 lvere considerably lower than during 1982-89, even though capital and labor inputs grew more rapidly. Labor demand in the agricultural sector shrank in the 199Os, while TFP improved as people moved away from ;ubsistence agriculture activities. The manufacturing sector experienced high growth during 1982-89, mainly m account ofhigh capital accumulation and substantial employment growth. However, TPP in the nanufacturing sector has remained poor. Hence, output growth in the manufacturing sector was largely caused by the extensive use of Factors ofproduction.

TFP has its limitations as a measure of productivity, and the results must be interpreted with care. For example, productivity improvements could be the result of increases in the quality of inputs rather than increases in the efficiency of their utilization. Thus if the working population’s average educational attainment is rising over time, this procedure attributes a portion of economic growth to the marginal increase in the quality of labor and the associated higher wages paid For more skilled workers. Failure to isolate the effect of improvements in labor quality in growth-accounting exercises tends to overestimate TFP. By differentiating between skilled and unskilled labor. part ofthe growth could be attributed to improvement in the skills ofthe labor force. Taking this into account, the values of TFP are consistently lower. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 1% 3-i. The external current account surplus, which is estimated at about 1 percent of GDP in 1998, would gradually improve to about 8 percent of GDP by 2002, assuming exports benefit from expanded diamond production and an increase in the diamond sales quota from 75 percent during 1998-99 to 85 percent by 2002. Nonmining exports are expected to expand on average by 2.5 percent a year, while imports would grow on average by 5 percent. 38. There are downside risks to the projections, including the possibility that a slower pickup in world demand for diamonds could delay the recovery of the external sector and adversely affect the public finances.‘* In the longer term, there are risks related to the uncertain impact of the HIV epidemic. According to the 1997 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Botswana Human Development Report, one in three adults is believed to be infected with HIV, which has lowered life expectancy from 67 years to 52 years; moreover, a further lowering in the coming decade is possible. The preliminary findings indicate that population growth, at about 2.5 percent for the past decade, could come to a halt within ten years. Although the impact on real GDP growth was uncertain, the authorities were particularly concerned about the additional pressures on government spending for health and social services. In this context, the authorities have intensified the HIV awareness campaign and are providing financial assistance to IIIV patients. In addition, they are undertaking, with World Bank assistance, a study on the macroeconomic implications of the epidemic. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 39. Over the years, Botswana has established an impressive record of sound economic management that has enabled the country to enjoy very high growth rates under stable macroeconomic conditions. The prudent management of diamond resources provided the backbone to this success and enabled the government to undertake major development projects in infrastructure, education, health, and other social services. As a result, living standards have steadily increased, although the high incidence of poverty remains of great concern. 40. The weakening of the fiscal position in 1998199 was primarily the result of adverse exogenous developments. Although a countercyclical fiscal stance was appropriate in the circumstances, three factors-the very large increase in public sector wages, the Is However, a stronger recovery of the economy would be primarily associated with diamond production and exports. Notably, if the expansion of the Orapa 2000 project fully materializcs from January 2000 onward, as had been planned (instead of the two-year phasing in currently assumed in the mission’s projections), annual production of diamonds could increase by 24 percent in 2000 (instead of 10 percent); this performance would, in turn, front-load the increase in real GDP over the medium term. Should the sales quota on diamond exports be raised more quickly than currently assumed, the external position would also improve faster. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public19- implementation of supplementary spending budgets, and the growth of domestic credit-added disproportionally to the fiscal stimulus, causing thereby unsustainable domestic demand pressures. 41. The excessive growth in domestic credit is cause for concern, and speedy action is required by the monetary authorities to reverse this trend. Limiting the growth of reserve money is key to moderating credit developments, which will require active open market operations. A further raising of interest rates would also provide an appropriate signal of a tightening of monetary policy. 42. The budget for 1999/2000 establishes a framework for an appropriately restrained fiscal stance, provided that the authorities are firm in adhering to the fiscal target and do not allow any slippages. In view of the uncertainties surrounding the revenue estimates, specifically related to the recovery of the diamond market, the authorities need to prepare contingency measures that deal with potential revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns, and should stand ready to implement them if needed to achieve the deficit target. In this context, it will also be essential to enforce strict budget discipline and to abstain from supplementary budgets in the course of the year. 43. Botswana’s principal challenge over the medium term is to arrest unemployment by diversifying the economy away from the diamond sector. The adverse developments in the world diamond market in 1998 have amply demonstrated that the vulnerability of this important source of economic growth could quickly and fundamentally change the country’s external position. In order to address the skill mismatches in the labor market, the authorities have made laudable efforts to improve education and vocational training, and various initiatives have been launched to encourage job creation, including appropriate reforms of the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP), the policy on small and medium-sized enterprises, and the new industrial policy. Despite these initiatives, however, employment growth has stagnated during most of the second half of the 1990s. In this regard, it will be very important to maintain Botswana’s competitiveness by limiting wage increases to productivity gains. In view of the wage leadership of the government, wage moderation in the public sector is key to achieving this objective. 44. The central bank’s further strengthening of prudential regulations, both with respect to capital adequacy and foreign exchange exposure, is welcome. These measures will contribute to maintaining the soundness of Botswana’s banking sector. The staff also concurred with the authorities’ intention to broaden the Bank of Botswana’s supervisory powers to include the nonbank financial sector. 45. The authorities should be commended for the further liberalization of the exchange system in early 1999, which has resulted in the full convertibility of the pula in external current and capital account transactions. The absence of any signs of capital outflows associated with this liberalization is encouraging and confirms the confidence of the public in the pula.

Although most of Botswana’s parastatals are not a burden on the budget- and, indeed, some are quite profitable-privatization could lead to increased efficiency of their operations and would relieve the government’s administrative and management capacity. Thus there is a need for the authorities to press ahead with the implementation of privatization plans. 47. Botswana’s economic and financial statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. Nonetheless, the authorities need to lessen the considerable time lag in compiling labor market data, to unify the different accounting periods for key economic statistics, and to reconcile the large discrepancies between recent national accounts and balance of payments data. Botswana’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard would be an important step to help foster international confidence in the country and facilitate the planned establishment of an international financial services center. 48. The staff notes the authorities’ intention to eliminate by 2006 the multiple currency practice arising out of the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme, which was abandoned in 1990. It therefore recommends temporary approval of the multiple currency practice until August 3 1,200O or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation with Botswana, whichever is earlier. 49. It is recommended that Botswana remain on the 12-month consultation cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2I- VI. PROPOSED DECISION The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Botswana’s exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 3, in light of the 1999 Article IV consultation with Botswana conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/99/204, Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice arising from the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme applicable to outstanding external loans obtained by certain public enterprises before October 1, 1990, which is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3. 3. In view of Botswana’s discontinuance of the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme in 1990, and of its intention to eliminate the multiple currency practice by 2006, when the last loan under the scheme will mature, the Fund approves the retention by Botswana of the multiple currency practice until August 3 1,200O or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation with Botswana, whichever is earlier.

Contribution to funding of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility In July 1994, Botswana deposited with the Fund, as trustee, an amount equivalent to US$lO million for the benefit of the subsidy account of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). In April 1997, Botswana made a five-year deposit of SDR 14.6 million in the ESAF-Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HlPC) Trust. VIII. Exchange rate arrangement The exchange rate of the Botswana pula is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. On June 30 1999, the representative rate was US$l = P 4.63, and the exchange rate of the South African rand to the pula was R 1 = P 0.766. Botswana maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions except for a multiple currency practice that expires in 2006, and for which the government requests and the staff recommends approval.

Article IV consultation The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 13, 1998. The following decision was adopted. 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Botswana’s exchange measure subject to Article VIII, Section 3, in the light of the 1997 Article IV consultation with Botswana conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/98/58, Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice arising from the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme (FERRIS) applicable to outstanding external loans obtained by certain public enterprises before December 1, 1990, that is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3. 3. In view of Botswana’s definitive discontinuance of the FERRIS scheme in 1990, and of its intention to eliminate the above multiple currency practice by 2006 when the last loan under the FERRIS scheme will mature, the Fund approves the retention by Botswana of the multiple currency practice until August 3 I, 1999, or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation with Botswana, whichever is earlier.

Botswana became a member of the World Bank and the International Development Association (IDA) in 1968, and is now a contributor to IDA. There are no active IBRD/IDA projects in Botswana, although the World Bank is providing financial assistance through two Institutional Development Facility (IDF) grants (for human resource management and for a study on the macroeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS). The Economic Development Institute of the World Bank conducted a regional course on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Botswana in 1997. 2. Botswana joined the Intcmational Finance Corporation (IFC) in 1979 and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1990. At present, the IFC has no investment in Botswana. 3. No MIGA guarantees for investment in Botswana have been issued to date. Botswana has benefited from a number of MlGA’s technical assistance activities and has participated in several of its annual Africa mining investment symposia.

The core statistical data for surveillance+xchange rate, international reserves, reserve/base money, central bank balance sheet, broad money, interest rates, and consumer price index-are available on a monthly basis and arc reported to the Fund with an acceptable degree of regularity and promptness. Most economic data are made available to the general public through a number of official publications, including Annual Report and Botswana Financial Statistics of the Bank of Botswana, Annual Economic Report of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, and Statistical Bulletin of the Central Statistical Office. The integrity of the data in terms of reliability, quality, and coverage is reasonably satisfactory. However, steps need to be taken to publish quarterly national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data. Also, intensified efforts are needed to develop a unified accounting period for preparing and presenting economic data; the current arrangements-according to which the balance of payments statistics are compiled on a calendar-year basis, and the national accounts and the budget on July-June and April-March bases, respectively-impede the preparation of an integrated set of economic data. Real sector 2. The national accounts data are available on an annual basis only; the reporting has improved, with data available through 1997/98 (July-June). Provisional estimates for 1998/99 were released in the 199912000 budget. Annual employment and wage information are available but are rarely reported to STA for publication in the International Financiul Statistics (IFS). 3. The consumer price index is comprehensive and provides a breakdown of the index between urban and rural arcas, as well as between tradables (domestic and imported) and nontradablcs. In early 1997, the index was rebased from November 1991 to November 1996, and the weights were changed to reflect the findings of the 1993/94 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Fiscal accounts 4. ST.4 has received monthly government finance statistics (GFS) data up to December 1997. These data have not been published in IFS due to concerns about their quality. However, the major data problems have now been sorted out, except for unexplained differences between the annual data supplied for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) and the subannual data for IFS. The Bank of Botswana (the correspondent for KS) is currently reviewing with the Ministry of Finance (the ultimate source of GFS data and the correspondent for C;KVj the data, so as to explain/correct the differences with a view to expediting their publication.

Monetary data for publication in the IFS are reported on a regular basis, but the timeliness of reporting needs to be improved. Data for the monetary authorities are published usually one month later than data for the deposit money banks. In the July 1999 IFS, the data for the accounts of the monetary authorities were reported through December 1998 and, for the deposit money banks, through February 1999. External trade and balance of payments 6. Botswana reports data annuaIly on the balance of payments and the international investment position. In the 1998 Balance ofpaymenfs Yearbook, the latest available data on external trade and balance of payments relate to 1996. Data From 1990-94 have now been revised to conform with the principles of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.

Background 1. Abundant diamond resources coupled with sound macroeconomic policies have enabled Botswana to achieve one of the highest growth rates in the world: during 1980/8 1~ 1997/98 (July-June), real GDP growth averaged almost 8% percent a year. Although economic diversification away from the diamond sector, which accounts for more than one- third of GDP and 70 percent of exports earnings, is under way, Botswana remains vulnerable to the global diamond market, which has recently experienced a severe downturn. 2. Real GDP growth slowed to an estimated 4 percent in 1998/99, reflecting, inter alia, the impact of the significant slowdown in the global diamond market. As De Beers’ Central Selling Organization, a diamond marketing cartel, imposed a sales quota of 80 percent (subsequently lowered to 75 percent) on its purchases from its mining companies, diamond exports fell by almost 30 percent in U.S. dollar terms in 1998. 3. Consumer price inilation (12-month basis) continued to decelerate during the first three quarters of 1998, reaching a l3-year low of 5.9 percent in July, as it benefited from a sharp decline in inflation in South Africa. However, inflation in Botswana picked up subsequently, reaching 7.2 percent in June 1999, owing to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, as well as the effect of the pass-through of the depreciation of the pula. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-42- APPENDIX V 4. The overall fiscal balance moved from a surplus of 4% percent of GDP in 1997/98 (April-March) to an estimated deficit of 5% percent in 1998/99. The significant deterioration in the budgetary outcome mostly reflected the sharp drop in mineral revenue, which fell by almost one-third. In addition, civil servants’ salaries were raised by 25 percent in July 1998, which contributed to an increase in the government wage bill of 23 percent. Nonwage recurrent expenditure also rose sharply. 5. Monetary developments in 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 were characterized by an excessive expansion of credit to the private sector. Bank credit to the private sector surged by 46 percent, supported initially by an accommodating monetary policy stance. The central bank rate, which was lowered in two steps from 12% percent to 11% percent in April 1998, was subsequently raised in phases to 13% by March 1999. Commercial bank lending rates followed closely these rate adjustments, but this did little to stem the growth of credit. 6. The surplus in the external current account fell by 13 percentage points of GDP in 1998 to 1 percent, largely on account of the 30 percent decline in U.S. dollar diamond exports and the continued upward pressure on imports, which, in turn, reflected continued strong domestic demand. The external capital and financial account moved from a small surplus in 1997 to a modest deficit in 1998, as net outflows of portfolio and other investments outpaced net inflows of foreign direct investments. Overall, gross international reserves rose by US$266 million to US$5.9 billion at end-1998, equivalent to 29 months of imports of goods and services. The exchange rate of the pula, which is determined on the basis of a basket in which the South African rand has a significant weight, depreciated in nominal and real effective terms in 1998, by some 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Botswana continued to make progress in liberalizing external transactions by abolishing all remaining exchange control regulations in February 1999.
