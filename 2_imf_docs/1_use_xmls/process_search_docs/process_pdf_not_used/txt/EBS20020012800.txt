The discussions were held in Bangkok during May 13-28, 2002. The team met with Finance Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, Bank of Thailand Governor M.R. Pridiyathorn Devakula; other senior government and central bank officials; representatives from research institutes, NGOs, domestic and foreign financial institutions; and with World Bank staff. . The team comprised Messrs. Zanello (Head), Haksar, Jarvis, Baqir (all APD), Ms. Daban (FAD), Ms. Daseking (PDR), and Mr. Giorgianni (Resident Representative). Ms. Manivat (OED) attended some of the meetings. . A 34-month, SDR 2.9 billion (268 percent of quota, equivalent to $4 billion) Stand-By Arrangement for Thailand expired on June 19, 2000. The arrangement was part of a $17.2 billion official financing package from multilateral institutions and bilateral contributors ($14.3 billion of which was drawn). Outstanding obligations from the financing package were about $6.4 billion at end-June 2002, of which $1 billion (70 percent of quota) is to the Fund. Scheduled repayments to the Fund began in 2001 and have so far amounted to about $2.2 billion. . At the last Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) discussion in February 2002, Executive Directors noted that Thailand risked being trapped in a low-growth path by lingering domestic vulnerabilities. They urged the authorities to accelerate corporate and financial sector restructuring, and not to delay needed fiscal adjustment. . Thailand has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The 2001 Article IV consultation was concluded on August 2, 2001. . The authorities have not yet indicated whether they consent to publication of this staff report and the PIN. Thailand’s statistical base is adequate to conduct effective surveillance. Data issues are discussed in Annex V. . Thailand’s outstanding borrowing from the Fund has fallen below 100 percent of quota. Consistent with the guidelines for PPM, and absent concerns about capacity to continue repurchases on schedule, Thailand’s PPM could be discontinued. Close contact will continue to be maintained through the Resident Representative office and regular staff visits.

Exports are recovering and domestic demand is picking up pace, fed by a front-loaded fiscal stimulus in FY 2001-02. Inflation is comfortably within the authorities’ inflation- targeting range. a Notwithstanding some encouraging signs, the corporate and financial sectors remain sources of fragility. The quality of the restructuring promoted by the TAMC is unclear. Corporate leverage remains high and bank balance sheets are still weak. a External vulnerability continues to he low. An aggressive reserve buildup in 2001 has further increased coverage of short-term debt. Prospective balance of payments developments suggest that scheduled repayments of the official financing package would not be a problem even in a more adverse external scenario. Policy Issues The current monetary stance is consistent with the inflation-targeting framework and the need to support the recovery. A premature tightening would raise questions about policy priorities. Continued monetary support would facilitate the prospective fiscal adjustment. The budget for FY 2002/03 incorporates a withdrawal of stimulus. Consolidation is welcome given fiscal risks arising from the already high debt-to-GDP ratio, large contingent liabilities, and ongoing fiscal devolution. Debt dynamics remain sensitive to a prolonged slowdown or delays in a VAT increase now planned for October 2003. For a return to high growth in the medium term, structural and legal reforms are critical. More restructuring of corporate debt is needed to reactivate credit flows and investment. Lack of information hampers the assessment of the effectiveness of the TAMC. Privatization of state banks and bankruptcy law reform would strengthen the financial system. Other financial laws are still pending. Plans to fiscalize FIDF losses were announced in late June. The authorities are considering participation in the ROSC and FSAP process, but have not yet decided on it. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- 1. INTRODUCTIONANDBACKGROUND 1. Thailand is slowly shaking off the legacy of the 1997 crisis. After a disappointing performance in 2001, the economy has strengthened, reflecting the global recovery and the authorities’ efforts. Growth is picking up, inflation remains low, and the current account of the balance of payments strong. Important reform initiatives are underway and the thrust of macroeconomic policies is broadly in tune with cyclical requirements. However, banking and corporate sector problems still hold back the economy, the reform agenda is unfinished, and public debt dynamics remain worrisome. The key risk for Thailand is a continuation of the hesitant recovery it has experienced since 1999, and the key policy challenge is how to restore quickly high growth. 2. The main sources of vulnerability are domestic rather than external. Notwithstanding the beginning of operations of the Thai Asset Management Corporation (TAMC)-a central agency for debt workouts and corporate restructuring-and a start of fiscal consolidation in the proposed 2002/03 budget, weak bank balance sheets, highly leveraged corporates, and fiscal risks continue to cloud medium-term prospects. On the other hand, a buildup of foreign reserves and repayments of external debt have reduced external vulnerabilities. A flexible exchange rate and a well-diversified export base provide an additional buffer against external shocks. Overall, domestic vulnerabilities are not likely to spill over into any near-term external crisis. 3. Prime Minister Thaksin’s strong majority control of the lower house of Parliament creates an opportunity for decisive economic reforms. The government has ambitious reform plans centered on improving health, education, and rural development, and resolving financial sector weaknesses. However, efforts to push delayed bank and corporate restructuring, while promising, have yet to show results, and other institutional and legal reforms have lagged. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTS A. Macroeconomic and Market Developments 4. Thailand’s GDP has only just reached its pre-crisis level. The rebound from the steep output decline of 1998 has been weaker than in other crisis-hit countries in the region. Burdened by structural problems and income losses from worsening terms of trade, domestic demand has been sluggish, and the external sector has provided only modest support to the recovery over the past three years. 5. Growth in 2001 was held back by the global slowdown and a slow policy response. In 2001, monetary policy- 3” 1x Real GDP Index, latest data 200’31 25 (Pre-crisis pe&=lCQ, t=O cormponds to quatcr next t” country label) 12: Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- although broadly accommodative-was reoriented toward stabilizing the exchange rate, replenishing reserves, and supporting the income of savers.’ Furthermore, the deficit in the fiscal year ending September 2001 was some 2 percent of GDP below target, implying a fiscal withdrawal for the year. The 2001 global slowdown also took its toll: export volumes contracted by about 5% percent (after growing 22 percent in 2000) and GDP increased only by 1.8 percent. 6. However, GDP growth has picked up in the last quarter of 2001 and so far in 2002. After a flat third quarter, real GDP grew 2.1 percent (year-on-year) in the fourth quarter of 2001 and increased by 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the previous year (Figure 1). 7. The main factors underlying the pickup in growth have been: l A front-loadedfiscal stimulus package.2 The 2001/02 budget allows for an increase in the structural deficit of the comprehensive public sector of some 2 percentage points of GDP. While some under-spending is likely over the fiscal year as a whole, the budget has provided countercyclical support so far, with frontloading of some fiscal initiatives, notably the quasi-fiscal transfer programs to support rural incomes through the Village Fund (Table 5). An upsurge in domestic demand, Jueled by recovering consumer sentiment. Private consumption rose 3.1 percent, and private investment grew 4.5 percent after stagnating in the third quarter. Much of the economic activity in the fourth quarter was concentrated in construction-related sectors, as government initiatives, lower mortgage rates, and rising consumer sentiment rekindled the demand for housing. ’ The policy rate was increased by 100 basis points to 2% percent in June. 2 The main elements of the stimulus package included a 1 percent of GDP reserve fund in the budget, as well as off-budget spending on the Village Fund and a farm debt moratorium worth an additional 1 percent of GDP. For 2001/02, the authorities project a comprehensive public sector balance of 6 percent of GDP. The staff projects that the outcome could be lower by about 0.6 percent of GDP due to higher growth that would boost tax revenues and some under-spending by local governments. Slow disbursements of the reserve fund to date have been offset by a higher disbursement rate on other central government expenditures.

Export volumes grew by some 4 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2002 with a strong rebound in high-tech products. On the supply side, high-frequency indicators suggest the recovery is becoming more broad-based. 8. Monetary policy has been loosened without adverse effects on the external position or on inflation (Figure 2). The monetary tightening of mid-2001 was partially reversed in December and January 2002, with quarter-point interest rate cuts in response to weakening growth prospects, low inflation, and a stronger external position. The exchange rate has continued to strengthen and international reserves have increased. Exploiting upward pressures on the baht, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has made sizeable (sterilized) purchases of foreign exchange. Since June 2001, the baht has appreciated in nominal effective terms by 4% percent, and reserves had increased to about $35 billion by end-May 2002, or 135 percent of 2001 short-term debt (on a remaining maturity basis) (Figure 3). The continued output gap (estimated at about 6 percent of GDP for 2002) an appreciating currency, and declining oil prices have basically removed inflation. Core inflation is hovering just below the middle of the BOT target range (0 to 3% percent). 9. The improvement in the external position reflects both reduced capital outflows and a current account surplus (Figure 3 and Table 3). The current account registered a surplus of 5% percent of GDP in 2001 (compared with 7% percent in 2000), notwithstanding adverse terms-of-trade effects, shrinking export volumes, and a post-September 11 drop in tourism receipts. Preliminary data for 2002 point to a reversal of these negative factors. Although the real effective exchange rate (on a CPI basis) has appreciated by 4% percent in the first five, months of this year relative to the 2001 average, it has moved in line with regional trends and has only just returned to 2000 levels (Figure 3). 10. Market sentiment has also strengthened. The stock market has more than recovered from post-September lows, as elsewhere in the region (Figure 4). The recent gains in equities reflect renewed interest from foreign investors, ample domestic liquidity, and improved growth prospects for the Thai economy. Bond yields remain low given benign inflation expectations and relatively low risk premia, and indicators of consumer confidence have risen steadily over the last several months. B. Corporate and Financial Sector Developments 11. The corporate sector remains burdened by debt (Figure 5). The Thai corporate sector still has debt-to-equity ratios that are among the highest in the region. 3 Overcapacity also continues to be a problem. The capacity utilization index remains low at 59 percent and 3 There are noteworthy differences, however, across industrial sectors and firm sizes. An analysis is presented in the Selected Issues Paper to accompany the staff report. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- the capital-output ratio is still well above pre- crisis levels. However, there is some evidence of adjustment: excess capacity tends to be lower in traded goods sectors; a number of formerly listed companies have exited; and labor-shedding has taken place in key industries. Moreover, the extent of true overcapacity may be exaggerated if some capital has simply fallen into disuse. Corporate earnings have also improved recently, although interest cover remains low by both historical and international standards. I. DehtiEquity Ratios, 1997 vs. 2000 (in percent) 12. The financial position of banks is still weak, and credit flows are anemic. The high leverage of the corporate sector is reflected in substantial levels of distressed assets in the banking sector (Figure 6). Non- performing loans (NPLs) have fallen, but a Operating Profits of Banks, 19972002ql large part of the reduction is because of (AnnualiLcd: I” pcrcen, Of in,ercs, cming assets, transfers to asset management corporations (AMCs) and write-offs. There is also potential for further emergence of “re-entry _......_.*.. *.-.--‘*. NPLs” as debt rescheduled in recent years begins to fall due again.4 The weak position of banks has sapped their appetite for risk and led them to demand high spreads on new state bank5 lending. The net result was an increase in private credit of only about 1 percent in 2001.5 13. While bank profitability has continued to improve, overall returns remain weak. Operating profits at private banks have stabilized, supported by reductions in funding costs. Interest margins, however, have been constrained by low effective lending yields, the result of low returns on restructured NPLs and increased competition for prime customers. State banks’ income too has improved, on the back of NPL transfers to state-owned asset resolution vehicles. Overall net income for the sector remained constrained in 2001 by the 4 The initial grace periods on most of the large volume of NPLs (amounting to about 25 percent of GDP) restructured under the aegis of the Corporate Debt Restructuring Advisory Committee (CDRAC) are set to expire by the end of the year, and most debt restructuring has involved little net present value reductions. 5 The definition of private credit used here is adjusted for write-offs of fully provisioned NPLs, as well as transfers to AMCs.

However, results for the first quarter of 2002 were boosted by the end of the provisioning cycle and, in part, somewhat more liberal provisioning requirements. 14. The effectiveness of the restructuring promoted by the TAMC is unclear. As of end-April, NPLs worth about B 700 billion (13 percent of GDP) at original book value had been transferred from banks to the TAMC. About 80 percent of the total were transferred from state-owned banks, the remainder from private banks. The TAMC’s stated objective was to approve the resolution of B 100 billion in NPLs by end-March and B 500 billion in NPLs by the end of 2002. The first of these targets was met, and by end-May deals covering some B 158 billion (over 20 percent of the total) had been concluded and sent to the TAMC Executive Committee for approval. About 70 percent of these involved some form of debt restructuring. In the remaining cases foreclosure of collateral is envisaged. What is less clear is the extent of debt reduction involved or the extent of business reorganization that will accompany the debt restructurings. The TAMC has not released details of either individual deals or aggregate information on these questions. 15. Only limited progress has been made on other financial and corporate sector structural initiatives. The cabinet has approved a revised Bankruptcy Law, but this has yet to be sent to Parliament. The draft does not include earlier recommendations made by staff- a change in the commencement criterion for bankruptcy from an “insolvency” to an “illiquidity” test and an automatic conversion to liquidation proceedings in the event of a failed rehabilitation. The foreclosure process, though somewhat improved, remains very slow and perpetuates a backlog of unresolved debt restructuring cases. Privatization of banks taken over by the government following the crisis has stalled, and only limited progress has been made in restructuring the operations of the two state banks merged in early 2002. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS Against this background, the discussions focused on Thailand’s near-term outlook, and on policies to return to a high growth path while reducing the public debt over the medium term. A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks 16. The staff’s GDP growth projection for 2002 has been revised upward to 3% percent. The revision (from 2.7 percent in the Spring WEO) reflects the improving external environment and the rising momentum of private demand, supported by buoyant household sentiment and the fiscal stimulus in the pipeline. The authorities were somewhat more optimistic. In their view, the expected rebound in world demand and the pay-off from structural reforms would facilitate a growth outcome of 4 percent or better. 17. The key risks to the near-term outlook pertain to the strength of the external recovery and the durability of consumer demand. While world growth is expected to recover over the year, the exceptionally sharp pickup of Thai exports in the first quarter may moderate, while higher imports will curb the external contribution to growth. Moreover, the recent rise in consumer demand was spurred by one-off promotions and easier store-credit, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lo- and could soften later in the year. The current staff projections embody an accelerating year- on-year growth path through the first half of the year with growth moderating in the second half as the fiscal stimulus trails off. 18. There was agreement that balance of payments prospects are encouraging, despite a narrowing current account surplus. Notwithstanding the recent strengthening of the baht, Thailand’s real effective exchange rate does not appear to be overvalued when measured against both historical and regional trends (Box 1). Thailand has broadly maintained its overall market share and has recently gained ground relative to its main regional competitors. However, competitive pressures, particularly from China, are already apparent, and are unlikely to abate over the medium term. For 2002, the global recovery is set to boost Thai exports, building on the solid performance over the first four months. Nevertheless, the trade surplus is likely to shrink further, reflecting the high import content of exports as well as strong private consumption and restocking of imported intermediate goods. Consequently, the current account surplus is expected to fall below 4 percent of GDP, broadly in line with the BOT’s projections. This development will be accompanied by ongoing but reduced net capital outflows-a large part of which is due to the repayment of the official financing package (peaking this year at $3.8 billion). As a result, Thailand’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall below the 50 percent threshold by end-2002. 19. Thailand’s external vulnerability is low, though some pressure points remain. Reserves are at a comfortable level, the current account is in surplus, and external indebtedness-though still sizeable-has fallen considerably (Box 2). External debt is expected to be further reduced over the medium term. The current account surplus is projected over time to turn into a small deficit, mainly financed through non-debt creating capital inflows. Reserves are expected to increase, despite the large repayments of the official financing package falling due. Risks to the external outlook could arise from weaker external demand or increased competition (e.g., from China), which could result in a faster and larger deterioration in the trade balance. Moreover, a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate would greatly increase the corporate sector’s debt burden over the coming years, for only a small fraction is financially hedged beyond one year.” Nonetheless, even in the event of large external shocks, the debt ratio is unlikely to rise back to its post-crisis peaks. Moreover, with sufficient reserves and a flexible exchange rate domestic vulnerabilities are not expected to spill over into any external crisis in the foreseeable future. 6 About 22 percent of corporate sector debt was denominated in foreign currency in 2001.

Thailand’s export volume fell by 5’/ percent in 2001, and its terms of trade weakened by a cumulative 20 percent since 1997, raising questions about its competitiveness and its external outlook in general. However, real effective exchange rate calculations suggest that competitiveness remains sound, and Thailand’s export market share has been broadly stable, with recent gains over a number of Asian competitors. Nevertheless, Thailand has been outperformed by both China and Central and Eastern Europe, and competition is likely to remain fierce. The terms of trade deterioration over the past years may have been driven by movements in major currencies (combined with market pricing power of Japanese exporters). Thailand appears to have preserved much of its 140 competitiveness gains since the crisis. Real Effective Exchange Rate of Thailand and Asian Competitors Notwithstanding a recent appreciation, Thailand’s (Incrcasc = real appreciation, 1995 = 100) real effective exchange rate (CPI based) compares Asian Competitors CPI based favorably with both past developments and trends of regional competitors (see chart).’ Less reliable data on relative unit labor costs (ULC) point to some appreciation over the past two years, but do so _ not alter the basic assessment. 70 - Thailand’s overall market share has remained broadly stable over the past six years. Some Thailand CPI based 6o ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ 1995Ql 1996Ql 1997Ql 1998Ql 1999Ql 2CCOQl 2OOlQl 2C02Q gains achieved in selected Asian markets (such as China, Australia and, more recently, Japan) were offset by losses of market share in the U.S. (Figure 7). In relative terms, Thailand’s export performance has been comparable with most of its Asian competitors-who fared even worse in 2001-but did not match that of China and Central and Eastern Europe. Both outperformed Thailand most clearly in exports of machinery and transport equipment, which include computers and telecommunication equipment, and account for some 40 percent of Thailand’s total exports. With China’s WTO membership, competitive pressures are unlikely to abate, and export prospects for Thailand will depend on its ability to complement rather than compete with lower-priced Chinese products. A related question refers to recent movements in Thailand’s terms of trade which may have to do with market pricing behavior and movements in major currencies. The fall in dollar-denominated trade prices since the mid-1990s has been a 110 worldwide phenomenon linked to the Thai Export and Import Prices in U.S. Dollars and Dollar/Yen Exchange Rate -- 120 strong dollar. Indeed, between 1995 100 and 200 1, Thai export prices fell by slightly less than the world deflator for go - exports. Thus, the puzzle is why Thai import prices rose by 27 percent 80 - between spring 1999 and 2001 (see 70 - Export price chart). While 10 percentage points of 60 the increase are explained by higher oil 6. m -50 prices, the remainder is due to rising 1996 Jul 1997 Id 1998 JUl 1999 Jul 2Mx) JUl 2001 JUl 2002 prices for capital goods, and may be Jan Jan Jan JZUl Jan Jan JX! related to the strength of the yen vis-a-vis the dollar during this period. With Japan being the main exporter of capital goods to Thailand, and tight links through FDI, Japanese exporters had sufficient market power to raise dollar export prices in order to contain the fall in domestic currency terms that would have occurred under perfect competition. Indeed, Japan (as well as Taiwan, POC, for possibly similar reasons) are among the few non-oil exporters who saw an increase in their dollar export prices in 1999-2000. Moreover, Thai import prices have fallen since early 2001, in tandem with a depreciating yen, and since the beginning of this year, the terms of trade have started to improve. Based on this view, the past terms of trade deterioration-which found parallels in Korea and the Philippines-should not continue, unless the dollar were to strengthen further against most currencies, but weaken against the yen. ’ The competitors include China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan, POC.

THAILAND'SEXTERNAL VULNERABILITY Thailand’s external vulnerability has been substantially reduced over the last few years. Large current account surpluses have allowed a buildup of international reserves and a decline in private sector external debt, especially short- term debt. At the end of 2001, external debt had fallen below 60 percent of GDP, from more than 90 percent in 1998, and the reserve coverage of short-term debt (on a remaining-maturity-basis) was 120 percent, compared with 50 percent at end-1997. Moreover, modest holdings of Thai assets by non-residents combined with legal prohibitions on residents’ acquisition of foreign assets limit the risk of excessive capital outflow in the short term. A comfortable reserve cushion provides protection against a sudden external deterioration. A projected current account surplus of $4.7 billion (3% percent of GDP) in the baseline for 2002, together with moderate net FDI inflows of $2.7 billion would be sufficient to cover the payments falling due under Thailand’s official financing package, while financing some $3.5 billion of non-FDI capital outflows and a $0.6 billion increase in international reserves. Even in the event of a rapidly disappearing trade surplus and a complete drying up of net FDI inflows, the same non-FDI outflows could be financed with reserves remaining above $28 billion, i.e., still in excess of short-term debt (on a remaining maturity basis). Prudential regulations contain bank’s direct exposure to exchange rate risks, but a sharp depreciation would have adverse implications for corporates. The lion’s share of corporate external debt of about $30 billion (26 percent of GDP) is U.S. dollar denominated, and about one-third is falling due within a year. Although (as of end-2001) some 40 percent of companies’ short-term external debt-service payments were financially hedged, the hedging ratio was only 20 percent beyond six months and 10 percent for payments falling due after one year. Thus, the corporate sector remains vulnerable to a weakening of the baht/dollar exchange rate, in particular, if natural hedges (estimated in excess of 25 percent) were eroded by weak export earnings. That said, in the present environment, with current account surpluses and high reserves, a sharp depreciation of the baht is not likely. Indeed, CGER estimates suggest that the baht may appreciate modestly in effective terms over the medium term. Sensitivity analyses suggest that Thailand’s external debt ratio is unlikely to rise hack to recent peaks even in the event of significant macroeconomic shocks. The effects of a number of shocks most relevant to the external debt dynamics are illustrated in the Table below (see Annex I for details). They are applied as temporary deviations from the baseline, without consideration of feed-back effects, and with magnitudes based on historical standard deviations. While a 30 percent depreciation or a combined sizeable shock to growth, the current account, the interest rate, and the dollar GDP deflator would have a strong initial impact on external indebtedness, the debt ratio would still be below levels seen as recently as 1998/1999. Moreover, none of the simulated shocks would set off explosive debt dynamics over the medium term.

The picture would be less comfortable over the medium term if the structural reforms necessary to return Thailand to a high growth path are not forthcoming. Continued slow progress in corporate debt workouts would keep firms highly leveraged and banks weak, suppressing investment and growth. The lower growth would result in the public debt-to-GDP ratio remaining high in the medium term. Moreover, slow growth would weaken the position of troubled corporates still further, leaving them vulnerable to higher interest rates, and making it more likely that contingent liabilities of the government would be realized, worsening the debt dynamics further.

The sensitivity of the public debt ratio to various adverse shocks is shown in the table and in Annex I. 21. Thailand’s return to high growth depends critically on the speed and depth of structural reform. The staff’s medium-term macroeconomic scenario assumes that structural reforms and the transition to a higher growth path will be gradual (Table 6). Under this scenario, growth rates of around 5 percent should be achievable over the medium term, provided that structural reforms are continued and macroeconomic policies remain appropriate. The keys to achieving a higher growth path are a pickup in investment and total factor productivity, created by meaningful corporate restructuring, an open trade and investment regime, strong educational policies, and continuing technology transfer. 22. The authorities thought that their policies had laid a strong foundation for high growth. Specifically, they were more upbeat than staff about the payoff from current reforms and expected a faster return to a high growth path. Also, while they were ready to initiate fiscal consolidation to contain public debt, they were reluctant to commit at this stage to new tax measures with the economic recovery only just underway. B. Macroeconomic Policies Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 23. There was agreement that the thrust of monetary and fiscal policy was in tune with cyclical requirements. Since late 2001, a front-loaded fiscal stimulus had taken the lead in providing countercyclical demand support. In the second half of 2002, the policy mix is expected to be rebalanced toward a greater relative contribution for monetary policy. The authorities and the mission agreed that the need to reduce public debt and a coherent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- implementation of the inflation-targeting framework called for such a rebalancing to support private demand and a broadening of the recovery. 24. The monetary stance is consistent with the inflation outlook and the need to sustain the recovery. Inflation risks are minimal, the output gap is still large, and the fiscal stimulus is expected to taper off. Following earlier official pronouncements which suggested that the authorities would seek to maintain baht-dollar interest rate differentials, the mission cautioned against any premature monetary tightening, even if world interest rates rise later in the year. Notwithstanding an impaired transmission mechanism (Box 3) this would worsen growth prospects-especially via balance sheet effects-and could lead market participants to believe that the authorities are targeting the exchange rate. The authorities took note of these concerns and reiterated that monetary policy, in the absence of inflationary pressures, will remain supportive of the recovery in the near term. 25. Developments in the foreign exchange markets also do not warrant any monetary tightening. The authorities noted that upward pressure on the baht has so far this year been contained by official foreign exchange purchases. This strategy has helped the BOT build up its international reserves. Looking ahead, the mission pointed out that higher U.S. interest rates might be accompanied by a weakening of the baht. Such a development should not be resisted, as it would support the export sector, which has been affected by worsening terms of trade and heightened competition. More generally, the mission argued that orderly exchange rate movements (in either direction) would demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime. The authorities stressed that they needed some flexibility in the design of policy, but had no particular exchange rate or reserve target in mind. 26. Legislative reforms are needed to underpin the credibility of the BOT’s monetary framework. A revision of the BOT and Currency Acts has been on the agenda for some time. The mission noted that an early passage would strengthen the monetary framework by sanctioning the operational independence of the BOT and facilitating reserve management. The new BOT Act is being prepared for submission to Parliament soon. On the Currency Act, the authorities explained that they were considering options for reducing existing constraints on reserve management7 Fiscal Policy 27. The authorities and the mission agreed that fiscal consolidation was needed, but had different views on the extent of risks to the medium-term fiscal position. The mission argued that risks arise from the large stock of the public sector’s contingent 7 The decision, subsequent to the mission, to fiscalize the FIDF losses has addressed in part this issue. The decrees implementing this also eased some constraints in the law on the use of reserves. For further details, see 138.

TRANSMISSION OF MONETARY POLICY Recent changes in monetary policy, against the backdrop of a fragile economic recovery, highlight the importance of understanding the magnitude and channels of policy transmission. Following the crisis, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) eased and then maintained the stance of monetary policy until mid-200 1. Short-term interest rates in the repurchase and the interbank markets declined from over 20 percent in early 1998 to close to 1.5 percent by mid-2001 but the transmission to bank lending rates and private credit growth was sluggish, and growth, after an initial recovery, began to falter. Against this backdrop, recent shifts in the monetary stance raise the question of the effectiveness of monetary policy and its channels of transmission. There are several channels through which monetary policy affects economic activity. The traditional Keynesian channels operate through the interest rate and the exchange rate. Other important channels include the credit channel and asset price effects. The former involves a decline in the supply of bank lending as a monetary contraction aggravates problems of information asymmetries in credit markets. In the asset price channel, a monetary contraction depresses equity prices (and property values) lowering the market value of firms. To the extent that firms’ investment decisions are driven by a comparison of the replacement cost of capital to its market value (Tobin’s q theory of investment), this reduces investment. A large empirical literature on the U.S., and selected other countries, uses vector auto-regressions (VARs) to try to estimate the strengths of the different channels and the impact of monetary policy shocks. Results for Thailand indicate weak transmission of monetary policy through bank-lending and point to the importance of asset price effects. A reduced form VAR consisting of real GDP, the consumer price index, and the BOT’s policy rate (controlling for world interest rates) was estimated using quarterly data for 1993-2001. The analysis suggests that the policy rate helps to predict subsequent real GDP but not the other way round. The accompanying impulse response function shows that the response of output to a one standard deviation (1.8 percent) unanticipated change in the short-term interest rate peaks at about a 1 percent deviation of real GDP from baseline after about 6 quarters. The baseline model was augmented in turn to consider the role of bank lending (adjusted for bad debt transfers), the real exchange rate, and asset prices (proxied by the SET stock market index) as channels of transmission. The results indicate:’ There is little evidence that the bank lending channel is operating in transmitting monetary policy. Granger- causality tests indicate that policy rate changes do not predict subsequent changes in private credit. Closing the bank lending channel in the model has a small impact on the impulse response of real GDP to the policy rate. Asset prices seem to play a role in the propagation of monetary shocks. The response of output to a monetary contraction is measurably reduced when the asset price channel is shut down in the model. As another metric for evaluating the relative importance of different channels, a variance decomposition analysis shows that asset prices account for 40 percent of the variation in real output (at a lo-quarter horizon) after an initial exogenous shock, while the autoregressive component and the interest rate channels account for 3 1 and 22 percent respectively.

In response, the mission pointed out that the underlying growth assumptions appeared overly optimistic and that the sensitivity analysis did not adequately capture potential risks. l1 8 These issues are discussed in more detail in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper. 9 The baseline simulation in the chart assumes: (i) a gradual increase in real GDP growth to 5 percent; (ii) a reversion of the VAT rate from 7 to 10 percent in 2003/04; (iii) some modest buoyancy in revenues as the output gap is eliminated; (iv) a slightly increasing ratio of non- interest expenditures to GDP from 2002/03 onward; and (v) nominal interest rates of 6% percent over the projection period. The low-growth scenario assumes a growth rate which is half that of the baseline. The public debt includes estimated contingent liabilities and liabilities arising from quasi-fiscal activities. lo The authorities’ multi-year fiscal framework aims at capping the debt-to-GDP ratio at 65 percent, and the debt servicing burden at 16 percent of total spending. A balanced budget (in the Ministry of Finance, non GFS-compliant definition) is envisaged by 2008. Measures to achieve these goals are not fully articulated. l1 The authorities assumed that nominal GDP growth will increase from about 5 percent in 2003 to about 10 percent by 2009.

FISCAL VULNERABILITIES AND PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT The main source of fiscal vulnerability arises in connection with the management of the large stock of public liabilities. One risk stems from the uncertainty over the “true” extent of public indebtedness, due to the presence of sizable unfunded contingent liabilities. Another vulnerability stems from the uncertainty over the future path and financing structure of the debt. Some analysts contend that, despite their broad coverage, the headline debt statistics underestimate the full extent of the government indebtedness, since they neglect the presence of large unfunded contingent liabilities.’ Thailand’s debt statistics are in line with international fiscal accounting practices, which neglect contingent liabilities, including those that explicitly commit the government tofuture cash outlays. In the case of Thailand, gross contingent liabilities are estimated to be around 22 percent of GDP, with the bulk connected with the-costs of financial sector restructuring (e.g., guarantees against NPLs Headline Debt and Gross Contingent Liabilities assumed by the state). Thus, including the total of end FY 2001. In percent of GDP stock of contingent liabilities, gross public debt is around 80 percent of GDP, of which more than 1 .O 0 Fiscal initiatives 21 ’ half is accounted for by the gross costs of bank restructuring.The net indebtedness is, however, 2.7 q State AMCs 31 much smaller (about 68 percent of GDP), since most state enterprises have positive net worth, and the FIDF controls a sizable pool of assets, including equity holdings in financial institutions Source: FIDF; BOT; and IMF staff estimates. and contingent claims on recoveries from NPLs.’ l/ Includes guarantees on borrowings by Specialized Financial Institutions. !2/ Includes non-tiscalized costs of village fund & farmers’ debt suspension Although the market value of the assets carried by 31 FIDF guarantees on notes issued by state AMCs (e.g., SAM). the FIDF is uncertain, asset recovery and ,4/ FIDF exposure to NPLs under Covered Asset Pools. privatization are expected to play a key role in I reducing the debt burden. In the staffs medium term fiscal projections, the government contingent liabilities are accounted for within a traditional cash-based accounting framework, according to which the contraction of a contingent liability is not debt-creating insofar as it does not trigger a cash outlay. Therefore, in the staffs projections, debt is increased when prospective losses from contingent liabilities are realized. The carrying cost of FIDF’s off-balance sheet liabilities is, however, made explicit in the staff projections, since these are added to the comprehensive public sector deficit. The staff projections are actuarially equivalent to those produced by some analysts and rating agencies, whereby public debt is augmented up- front by the gross stock of estimated contingent liabilities, and reduced over time as assets are recovered. Another source of fiscal vulnerability stems from the uncertainty over the management of public debt. With regard to the current structure of the roughly 60 percent of GDP in headline public debt, 70 percent is financed domestically and 30 percent externally, of which half is in US dollars and the other half in yen. Including the FIDF’s unfunded maturing contingent liabilities, the refinancing need for domestic debt is substantial, with about 14 percent of GDP (equivalent to over 35 percent of issued domestic securities) to be refinanced in 2002, and half as much in each of the next four years. Even so, Thailand’s high private savings rate (22 percent of GDP), moderate external public indebtedness, high domestic liquidity (estimated at over 10 percent of GDP), and low interest rates should allow a smooth rollover of the debt maturing this year. Over time, however, movements in interest rates are a potential source of vulnerability, since just less than half of the gross debt (including the FIDF’s contingent debt) pays a floating rate. For example, it is estimated that each 100 bps increase in market interest rates raises the debt servicing cost by about 0.4 percent of GDP. Risks stemming from a depreciation of the baht are significantly lower, in light of the relatively small share of public debt denominated in foreign currency. ’ The headline debt ratio covers the direct liabilities of the central government, the debt of non-financial public enterprises (NFPE), and the on-balance sheet liabilities of the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF). 2 This assumes a 40-45 percent average recovery rate from NPLs, and conservatively neglects privatization receipts.

On the basis of their growth assumption at the time of budget formulation, the government targeted a deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP for the comprehensive balance (inclusive of off-budget activities).12 The staff projects that the deficit could be Thailand: Nonfinancial Public Sector Fiscal Operations, 2000/01-2002/03 II 2000/01 2001/02 2001/o: e of 2 2002/03 Auth.

Such a withdrawal of stimulus, if realized, would mark a first step in fiscal consolidation. 29. Looking ahead, the authorities agreed that attainment of a sounder fiscal position calls for additional measures. The mission stressed that the authorities needed to operationalize their intention to rein in the public debt. While the emphasis in the new budget has been on expenditure reduction, there is limited scope for further compression in the medium-term. In the staff’s view, a reversion of the VAT rate to 10 percent remains the most effective policy for assuring the sustainability of the public finances. The VAT increase should not be delayed beyond FY 2003/04, and should be announced now, particularly in light of the improving economic outlook. An early announcement would also be consistent with the political cycle (elections are due in 2004). The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to contain the public debt, but were unwilling to pre-commit to raising taxes until the pickup in activity gains a more solid footing. 30. The mission argued that fiscal decentralization should be implemented cautiously. Decentralization is constitutionally mandated and in its early stages. The Decentralization Act established that local governments should receive a growing share of total government revenue, which will reach 35 percent in 2006. To comply with the law, the FY 2002/03 budget includes a transfer of 0.7 percent of GDP from VAT proceeds. Decentralization of expenditure functions is to proceed in tandem with the devolution of l2 This reflects a 1.1 percent of GDP lower central government deficit arising mainly from the non-renewal of the Reserve Fund. A further 1.1 percent of GDP adjustment arises from the one-off nature of expenditures on the Village Fund and farmer debt suspension programs in FY 2001/02. The authorities project an increase in the deficit for the nonfinancial public enterprises of 0.3 percent of GDP.

This would create the potential for an unplanned deterioration of the central government balance and redundant expenditures by local governments. The authorities shared these concerns but stressed that they would ensure that decentralization is fiscally neutral. They said that steps were also underway to bolster local revenues by reforming the local property tax system. 31. The mission pointed to actions on other fronts that would ease uncertainties regarding the attainment of the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives. In particular: a Further divestment of state-owned enterprises would help reduce public debt and strengthen the supply side of the economy. Implementation has been slow and needed regulatory reform has been lagging. Investor sentiment would be boosted by stepped- up efforts and adherence to the privatization timetable. The authorities reaffirmed their commitments, but thought that strategic considerations militated in favor of timing public offerings carefully. l Greater transparency of the budgetary process would increase market confidence in the fiscal framework. Markets have increasingly focused on fiscal developments in Thailand. Their assessment is complicated by unconventional budget classifications and quasi-fiscal activities. The thrust of policy would be clearer to market participants if budgetary reporting was brought more in line with international practices and quasi-fiscal activities were fully included in the budget. The authorities acknowledged the need to strengthen fiscal transparency, and pointed out that the ongoing public sector and public debt management reforms are steps in the right direction. C. Financial Sector Reform and Corporate Debt Restructuring 32. For medium-term growth, the authorities and the mission agreed that structural reforms in the financial and corporate sectors are critical, but had different views on what needed to be done. The authorities considered that their current policies, notably the TAMC-led restructuring and other legislative initiatives, were laying a strong foundation for restoring industry and financial institutions to health. They believed that corporate restructuring was inherently a lengthy process, and that their strategy carefully balanced the l3 Detailed operational guidelines were approved in early 2002 to implement the Plan for Decentralization of Power to the Locality. Functions to be transferred to local governments cover: infrastructure; education, health and social welfare; social order; promotion of investment, commerce and tourism; environment; and arts and culture. In addition, the Plan states that the transfer of functions to local governments must be made within four years (i.e., over 2001-2004) with the allowance for a transition period of an additional six years to accomplish the full transfer of functions.

The mission agreed that there were tradeoffs between fast and deep restructuring, but noted that there was also a risk of tipping the balance too much in favor of preserving existing ownership and operations. The mission noted that corporate debt restructuring has largely involved rescheduling and there has been little business restructuring or debt reduction. As a result, distressed assets in banks remain high. 33. There was agreement that the TAMC could make a major contribution to the resolution of corporate and banking sector problems. The authorities reported a number of encouraging features in the operations of the TAMC so far. It has met its target for debts restructured for end-March; it has developed a workable plan for managing cases (see Box 5); it is making some attempts at sectoral restructuring in sectors where it holds extensive assets; and it is providing regular public information about the number and amount of restructurings approved. However, the details of restructurings agreed and the extent of debt reduction have not been released to the public, and in the mission’s view the quality of the restructuring that it has promoted is correspondingly unclear. The authorities noted that there were legal constraints on release of information concerning individual debtors. They were also concerned about the potential for disclosure to weaken credit discipline and create strategic NPLs. The mission-drawing on the experience of neighboring countries’ AMCs- stressed a number of principles that the TAMC should follow in the coming months to ensure effectiveness: a Debt reduction should be extended only to viable enterprises. Keeping unviable enterprises afloat through excessive debt forgiveness could allow them to undercut efficient producers, eroding their profitability and ability to invest. l The terms of restructurings must balance the need for debt reduction with the preservation of credit discipline and the minimization of costs to taxpayers. In particular, excessive reliance on deep “haircuts” increases the risk of strategic NPLs emerging elsewhere in the financial system. l The restructuring process should be as transparent as possible. While there are legitimate privacy concerns, fuller disclosure would protect management and boost public confidence. At a minimum, public release of the terms of completed restructurings in the aggregate is warranted. 34. Prospects for private banks remain constrained. Private banks have only marginally benefited from transfers to the TAMC and the weight of bad loans continues to impair their ability to intermediate savings. The authorities thought that given the specificity of the issues that needed to be addressed in financial institutions, the private banks’ problems would need to be resolved on a bank-by-bank basis. This process would inevitably take some time. Nevertheless, the authorities expected a strong financial system to emerge over the next few years. The staff thought that private banks will probably realize additional losses from debt restructurings, possibly requiring corresponding further capital infusions from owners.

OPERATIONS OF THE THAI ASSET MANAGEMENT CORPORATION The transfer of eligible NPLs to the TAMC has almost been completed. . As of end-March, NPLs worth 13 percent of GDP from banks have been transferred out of an eligible pool of NPLs worth 20 percent of GDP. . The TAMC has purchased these NPLs at an average price of 35 percent of the original book value (OBV). . The pool of distressed assets outside TAh4C management however remains large, especially in the case of private banks. 1.0 L !.5 !.O 1.5 1.0 1.5 hl Progress in debt restructuring The approval of initial restructuring deals has progressed rapidly, though information on the quality of these restructurings is scant. The authorities announced a target for the TAMC to restructure B 500 billion of its total NPL portfolio of B 700 billion (70 percent) by end-2002. 3nnk Distressed Assets Transferred to TAMC lnlhmls Ofbahl) In the context of this deadline, the TAMC had by end- May restructured B 158 billion of NPLs, though negotiations for many of these had already been quite advanced and the settlement speed for newer deals may fall. Moreover, “completion” at this stage refers to approval of the deals by the TAMC Executive Committee as opposed to actual implementation of the plans. About half of the deals have focused on “debt” restructuring, which could in principle involve some combination of rescheduling, equity conversion, and outright debt reduction. The specific terms of the debts restructured are not yet known including crucial information on the amount of NPV debt reduction extended to borrowers. Type of Restructuring Deals Agreed by TAMC thru end-May 2002 Sectoral Distribution of Initially Approved Deals A quarter of the cases involve “business rehabilitation” which could combine elements of plain debt restructuring with actual operational restructuring plans (including asset sales, consolidation of operations). These deals are supposed to be approved by the bankruptcy court, though their current legal status and the nature of any operational restructuring are not clear. More than half the cases involve multiple creditors while the most important sectors include real estate, manufacturing, financial, and other services. The announced deadlines establish a tight timetable for the TAMC to agree on restructuring deals. The authorities are targeting for the TAMC to restructure about 70 percent of its NPLs (at OBV), worth some $12 billion, within about 15 months of effective commencement of operations. Malaysia’s Danaharta, widely considered very effective, took 30 months to conclude deals on a similar proportion of NPLs under management, worth some $9 billion (at OBV). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Keeping this process manageable is likely to require some leveling of the playing field in bankruptcy proceedings, the likely venue for debt workouts outside the TAMC framework. 35.- Reform of the Bankruptcy Act is still under discussion. The authorities have drafted an amended law aimed at expediting proceedings, enhancing creditor and debtor rights, and reducing fees in bankruptcy cases. The mission was concerned that the changes under consideration still left the balance of power in litigations tilted too much in favor of debtors. It favored instead an approach which would make it easier for creditors to initiate bankruptcy proceedings and insist on liquidation in the event of a failed rehabilitation. 36. There was discussion of additional actions directed at producing a durable resumption of credit flows. The mission urged the authorities to seek early passage of a Secured Lending Law in order to broaden the class of eligible collateral and support bank lending, and to consider giving priority to legislation which will allow a well regulated futures market for bonds. Currently, banks cannot easily hedge their bond positions and are thus exposed to interest rate risk. Finally, the authorities are contemplating the introduction of a limited deposit insurance system that would replace the current blanket government guarantee of bank deposits. The mission supported adopting a phased approach, which would maintain a full government guarantee for most depositors until the system was well established. The authorities confirmed that their thinking was in line with this approach. 37. The mission cautioned against regulatory actions that would weaken banks further. Pending legislation (the Financial Institutions Act) gives the BOT the authority to set spreads between lending and deposit rates. The mission urged the authorities not to legislate spreads that would overrule the banks’ assessment of risks and bind their lending policies. The authorities stressed their commitment to financial system stability and said that they were mindful of the risks of tampering with market-based rates. 38. Privatization of state and intervened banks should be a high priority. The balance sheets of the state banks have been largely cleaned up through recapitalization and the transfer of bad assets to the TAMC. There is some evidence that this stronger position has led to aggressive “poaching” of prime borrowers from private banks. Delays in privatizing state banks are thus upsetting the level playing field. Moreover, they increase the scope for pressures to extend soft loans to favored sectors. The mission argued that the best policy is to proceed quickly with privatization. The authorities responded that plans to that effect are being drafted, and partial divestment of the largest state bank is slated for later this year. 39. Subsequent to the mission, in late June, long-awaited plans to fiscalize losses of the FIDF were announced. The FIDF is carrying substantial actual and prospective losses from assistance to the financial sector during the crisis. During the discussions, the authorities assured the mission that a framework would soon be announced for addressing this problem. The recently announced plan calls for floating government bonds to finance remaining FIDF losses. This will begin with the issuance of B 300 billion (5% percent of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - GDP) of savings bonds targeted at retail investors. l4 The authorities are also committed to issue government bonds to cover any additional FIDF losses that may eventually be realized. l5 The interest cost on the bonds will be borne by the budget.16 Also, the authorities have found a compromise solution for consolidating the various accounts of the BOT that does not involve changing the Currency Act. This will finally allow complete profit transfers from the BOT to the budget (which are earmarked for gradually amortizing the bonds) and will also reduce obstacles to the management of the BOT’s international reserves. Based on available information, the staff believes that the bond issuance should not have a disruptive impact on the bond market-in fact, yields have actually fallen slightly since the announcement of the plan. As regards the banking system, some of the FIDF liabilities are already held by retail investors and ample bank liquidity (see Box 4) should facilitate a switch from deposits to bonds. D. Other Issues 40. The provision of economic data is adequate for Fund surveillance. Thailand was an early subscriber to the SDDS and is in compliance with its requirements. The provision of data, both to the Fund and to the public, now goes well beyond what it was at the time of the crisis, and a wide range of statistics is posted on official websites. In addition, the BOT publishes quarterly inflation reports, and the government is working to align its presentation of fiscal accounts with the new GFS reporting requirements. Further improvements could be made to data dissemination, especially with regard to timeliness, but the authorities have made important progress in compiling and disseminating data in recent years. 41. There was discussion of the ROSC and FSAP processes. The mission noted that participation in the data ROSC and the fiscal transparency ROSC would serve two important purposes. First, it would help the authorities identify key areas for additional action to bring practice in line with international standards. Second, it would send a strong signal to markets of the authorities’ commitment to transparency and governance. An FSAP would help make clearer the actions necessary to strengthen further the financial sector. The authorities l4 This will cover payments on maturing notes issued to depositors during the crisis. The initial bonds (maturing in five, seven, and ten years) would be marketable from one year after issuance and their coupon payments will be in the budget. The BOT is expected to finance redemption at maturity out of its profits, although the Ministry of Finance will retain final responsibility for bond amortization. l5 Total prospective FIDF losses are currently estimated by the government to be about B 880 billion or 16 percent of GDP. l6 The incremental cost of refinancing the first tranche of FIDF liabilities is on the order of 0.3 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - indicated they would need to consider participation in the processes carefully, given the wide scope of the exercise and the different stakeholders involved. 42. The staff encouraged the authorities to simplify the trade regime and accelerate trade liberalization, with a priority on reducing nontariff barriers. Thailand maintains a moderately restrictive trade regime that offers room for further liberalization. Compared with other members of ASEAN, its tariffs are high, and nontariff barriers are extensive. Moreover, the difference between simple average and effective tariff rates is a sign of both large dispersion and a complex system of exemptions, both of which create distortions and reduce the transparency of the system. Trade liberalization has been governed by Thailand’s participation in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). The associated tariff cuts under AFTA began in early 2000 with a reduction in tariffs to O-5 percent across two-thirds of all tariff lines. By next year, these tariffs will be reduced to zero. Nevertheless, due to the exclusion of often heavily-traded (sensitive) goods from Tariff and Trade Restrictions Indicators for Selected Asian Countries, End-2001 the tariff-reduction scheme, the effect of Thailand Indonesia I/ Korea Malaysia Philippines AFTA has been limited. ’ In parallel to AFTA, the simple average tariff 18.4 6.8 8.9 l/ 9.2 1.1 government has begun Effective rate (revenue/imports) 3.4 2.2 3.3 1.3 11 6.6 IMF trade restriction index 6 4 4 4 4 negotiations on bilateral (10 = most restirctive) free-trade agreements with a number of Sources: Thai authorities, and IMF, PDR database. countries, including l/Data refers to 2000. Australia and China. In terms of Thailand’s own access to overseas markets, the authorities regard agricultural subsidies of developed countries and protectionist health and safety regulations as key impediments. 43. Thailand passed anti-money laundering legislation in April 1999, covering a short list of predicate offences. The legislation is being revised to include measures against terrorist activities. Thailand has signed-and is in the process of enforcing through accession-the 1988 UN Vienna Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (the principal money laundering convention). Thailand has also signed the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime and their ratification is under consideration. Moreover, it has established an Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) which is currently a member of Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units and the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 44. Thailand has made tangible progress since the 1997 crisis. Its external vulnerability has been much reduced, reserves have been rebuilt to comfortable levels, and the policy framework has been substantially strengthened. On the strength of these achievements and an improved growth outlook, the Thai authorities should opt for decisive Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - actions to tackle the still unresolved issues that may delay the economy’s attainment of a high-growth path. 45. The BOT’s accommodative stance is appropriate and consistent with its inflation-targeting framework. Low inflation, the fragility of the recovery, the comfortable reserve level, and the large output gap militate against a policy reversal any time soon. An additional reason for retaining an accommodative stance is the need to support a prospective fiscal withdrawal in FY2002/03 and beyond. A premature tightening to match a rise in world interest rates in the absence of domestic inflationary pressures would harm the recovery and the credibility of the monetary strategy. 46. Exchange rate developments too do not warrant a reorientation of monetary policy. Strong demand for the baht over the last twelve months has helped build up reserves but a monetary stance geared to reinforcing that trend would be inconsistent with inflation targeting and unhelpful from a cyclical standpoint. More generally, orderly exchange rate movements (in either direction) would demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime that is key to Thailand’s resilience to external shocks. The flexible exchange rate regime continues to be appropriate, and Thailand remains internationally competitive. 47. Fiscal policy has balanced support for economic activity with the need to secure a sustainable fiscal position. Expansionary fiscal policy helped cushion the impact of the global slowdown last year. With a rebalancing of the policy mix toward greater monetary support of the recovery, the new budget correctly aims at retrenchment in the fiscal year starting in October 2002. The targeted withdrawal, if fully realized, would mark a credible start of needed consolidation. 48. Greater efforts will be necessary, however, to dispel lingering fiscal risks. Large contingent liabilities arising from the cost of financial sector restructuring, the growth of quasi-fiscal activities and the uncertain budgetary consequences of fiscal decentralization add risks to the debt dynamics. With limited room for additional expenditure compression, future fiscal adjustment should focus on revenue measures. As a needed structural revenue measure, the reversion of the VAT rate to 10 percent should not be delayed beyond FY 2003/04, and should be announced now. In the event of unforeseen weakness, temporary expenditure stimulus could supplement the automatic stabilizers as in the current fiscal year. Debt reduction will also be aided by accelerating the privatization of state-owned enterprises. 49. The recently announced plans to fiscalize losses of the FIDF are welcome. Some details of the plan are not yet clear-notably how the authorities would respond in the event of insufficient retail demand for the new bonds-and the authorities will need to monitor carefully the effects on the liquidity of the banks. However, the plans go a long way toward dispelling uncertainty about the treatment of financial sector losses from the crisis, and hold out the promise of resolving the issue in a way which is transparent, market-friendly, and consistent with the financial integrity of the BOT. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - 50. Fiscal devolution needs to be managed cautiously. Intergovernmental fiscal relations still need to be designed in a way that ensures for local governments an adequate balance between expenditure responsibilities, on the one hand, and transfers from the center, on the other. The implementation of fiscal decentralization should also stress expenditure sharing and tax reforms aimed at boosting local revenues. In this perspective, the authorities are correctly attaching a high priority to revamping the property tax framework. Tight constraints on borrowing by local jurisdictions would help contain fiscal risks. 51. Banking and corporate sector problems still hamper economic activity and are a critical obstacle to vigorous growth. The profitability of private banks remains weak and their balance sheets burdened by NPLs. On the corporate side, there is still overcapacity in many sectors and leverage remains high. Resolving the corporate debt over-hang and reviving bank intermediation remain key requirements to sustain growth. 52. The TAMC could be a vehicle to revitalize the private sector, but its effectiveness so far remains unclear. An assessment of the TAMC’s performance is difficult, given the lack of information on the quality of the restructurings approved and the extent of debt reduction agreed. Experience shows that the effectiveness of debt workout agencies is boosted if debt reduction is extended only to viable enterprises; the terms of restructurings balance the need for debt reduction with the preservation of credit discipline and the minimization of costs to taxpayers; and the restructuring process is as transparent as possible. The Thai authorities should be mindful of these lessons in the conduct of the TAMC’s operations and the design of its communication strategy. On the latter, public release of the terms of completed restructurings at least in the aggregate should be considered. 53. The banking system remains weak and a source of fragility. The high level of distressed assets continues to hamper bank intermediation. Private banks remain particularly exposed given the low share of their distressed assets transferred to the TAMC. Weaknesses in the legal framework hold back banks’ ability to clean their balance sheets. To jump-start debt workouts outside the TAMC, the authorities should attach a high priority to revamping the bankruptcy and foreclosure framework, specifically by making it easier for creditors to initiate bankruptcy proceedings and insist on liquidation in the event of a failed rehabilitation. Early passage of a Secured Lending Law would broaden the class of eligible collateral and support bank lending. Any bank-by-bank approach to restructuring should be mindful of the need to safeguard transparency and equality of treatment. State banks have benefited the most from transfers of NPLs to state-owned asset resolution vehicles. There is a concern that this stronger position-which does not arise from superior banking practices-is distorting competition. Early privatization of the state and intervened banks would go a long way toward restoring a level playing field. 54. Planned institutional changes in the banking sector will need to be implemented carefully. Both private and state banks stand to lose if the spread between loan and deposit rates is regulated by the BOT in a manner that undermines their own risk assessment and commercial practices. The authorities should be mindful of the risks that such a move poses to the prospects for an early recovery in lending. In order to reduce bank exposure to interest Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - rate risk, the authorities should consider giving priority to legislation which will allow a well regulated futures market for bonds. The priority given to formulating policies to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities is welcomed. Finally, the planned introduction of limited deposit insurance that would replace the current blanket government guarantee of bank deposits should follow a phased approach, which would maintain a full government guarantee for most depositors until the system was well established. 55. The staff encourages the authorities to pursue the Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) process and to participate in the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP). Such decisions would not only help them to chart the path ahead, but also send an unambiguous signal to markets of Thailand’s commitment to transparency, good governance, and reform. Data provision is adequate for the purposes of surveillance. Thailand was an early subscriber to the SDDS and is in compliance with its requirements. 56. Thailand’s obligations to the Fund have fallen below 100 percent of quota. Consistent with the guidelines for PPM, and absent concerns about capacity to continue repurchases on schedule, it is recommended that PPM procedures for Thailand be discontinued. It is also recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Thailand be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

This Annex compares the staffs baseline projections for Thailand’s public and external debt against scenarios based on historical averages for the key underlying variables. The sensitivity of the debt dynamics to a number of shocks is also considered. The shocks are applied as temporary deviations from the baseline, without consideration of feed-back effects, and with magnitudes based on historical standard deviations over the past 10 years. A. Public Debt Sustainability 2. Positive medium-term debt dynamics are contingent on solid growth and fiscal consolidation. The baseline projections imply a rising debt ratio to 65 percent of GDP in 2005 and a fall to 61% percent by 2007. Compared with debt dynamics generated by historical averages for the key variables (stress test l), the baseline projections for public debt are higher in the near term (reflecting a larger primary deficit), but the two series converge in later years. The improvement in the baseline scenario after 2005 is driven by both fiscal consolidation and a gradual pickup in GDP growth on the back of structural reforms. This comparison highlights the need for measures on both fronts to achieve a falling debt ratio in the medium term. 3. The analysis of shocks to the baseline underlines the sensitivity of the debt dynamics to a sharp deterioration in economic growth and insufficient fiscal adjustment. Stress tests 2 and 6 suggest relatively modest sensitivity to the assumed increase in interest rates and to a one-off 30 percent exchange rate depreciation. Both would raise the debt ratio by some 3-4 percentage points in the medium term. The reasons are relatively low interest rate volatility in the past and a fairly small and falling share of external in total public debt (equivalent to about 30 percent), respectively. Looking forward, interest rates could react strongly to an adverse turn in market conditions. Each additional 100 basis point increase (during 2002-03) would add about 1 percentage point to the debt ratio in each year. A large deterioration in the primary deficit to 5% percent of GDP in 2002/03 (compared with a baseline average deficit of about 2 percent of GDP) would have a somewhat stronger impact with debt ratios of around 70 percent of GDP throughout the medium term (stress test 4). The effect would be slightly larger with a one-off increase in the debt ratio by 10 percentage points (stress test 7). The debt ratio would peak at 78 percent in case of a sharp fall in real GDP growth (stress test 3). Arguably, due to the high volatility of growth rates over the past 10 years, the assumed magnitude of the shock is excessive, equivalent to negative growth rate (on a fiscal-year basis) of 7% percent in 2002/03. Nevertheless, a smaller growth shock of the order of minus 6 percent-in line with actual average growth rates in 1997/98-would also lift the debt ratio above 75 percent in 2005. A similar outcome would occur in the event of a combined (but smaller) two-year shock to the key variables (with real GDP growth of minus 1% percent, an average interest rate of 6% percent, and a primary deficit of 3 percent of GDP).

The baseline projections for external debt are broadly in line with simulations based on historical values for the key variables (stress test 1). Both scenarios generate a sizeable fall in the debt ratio over the medium term with an identical ratio in 2007. However (in contrast to the public debt projections) the baseline implies a more rapid decline of external debt in the early years and a more gradual fall thereafter. This reflects the sizeable near-term surplus in the current account (implying a lower debt ratio in the early years) and the assumption of a gradual current account deterioration over the medium term (generating a flatter debt profile). 5. The stress tests suggest that Thailand’s external debt ratio is unlikely to rise back to recent peaks even in the event of significant macroeconomic shocks. The interest rate shock (stress test 2) would have a fairly marginal effect, again reflecting low historical volatility. Nevertheless, even a large spike in interest rates to 25 percent in 2002-03 would keep the debt ratio below its 2000 level-as would a sharp drop in GDP growth to minus 8% percent (stress test 3) or a deterioration in the current account to a deficit of 7% percent of GDP (stress test 5, with the non-interest current account at 5% percent).’ Moreover, the effect of the interest rate shock is exaggerated, as a sizeable share of external debt (about half of corporate obligations) is on fixed rates. A 30 percent depreciation (stress test 7) or a combined two-year shock (stress test 6)-with growth of minus 2l% percent, a current account deficit of 4% percent of GDP, an interest rate of 5% percent, and a fall in the dollar GDP deflator (representing a one-off exchange rate depreciation) of 11 percent-would have a strong initial impact on external indebtedness. However, while the debt ratio would initially jump above 70 percent of GDP and stay above 50 percent throughout the medium term, it would still be below levels seen as recently as 1999. Indeed, none of the simulated shocks would set off explosive debt dynamics over the medium term. ’ The isolated non-interest current account shock is assumed at a magnitude of one standard deviation (and half the size for the combined shock). Reflecting the high volatility over the past 10 years, a two standard deviation shock would generate an unrealistically large deterioration in the current account deficit to nearly 17 percent of GDP.

The exchange rate as of June 30,2002 was B 43.23=$1. IX. Last Article IV Consultation (August 2,200l): Directors agreed that containing vulnerability to external developments and bolstering growth prospects required supportive macroeconomic policies, accelerated restructuring of bank and corporate balance sheets, and consistency in the formulation of economic policies. Directors endorsed the looser fiscal stance, although were mindful of the need to reduce the public debt in the medium term. Most Directors were concerned over the June 2001 interest rate hike, and some saw room for reversing the tightening. X. Recent Technical Assistance: FAD: A number of FAD missions took place in 1998: in February on tax policy and structure; in July to help establish an Office of Macroeconomic-Fiscal Analysis; and in November on pension reform. Customs, tax administration, and tax policy advisors have also been working in Bangkok. LEG: Staff have advised on the reform of bankruptcy and secured lending, including visits in January, April (as part of a World Bank mission), and June 1998, and November 1999, and February 2000. MAE: In the first half of 1997, MAE consultants participating in an APD mission focused on the soundness of the financial sector, and two MAE missions provided assistance on monetary instruments and monetary management under a floating exchange rate regime. In July 1997, an MAE mission with World Bank participation outlined a strategy for financial sector reform, and in August, MAE helped integrate this strategy into Thailand’s program with the Fund. Since September 1997, MAE has provided extensive support of the implementation of the financial sector restructuring program with several MAE missions and participation in APD review missions. The most recent of these took place during the March 2001 staff visit to assess progress in the setting up of a national AMC. In June 1998, a long-term resident advisor on banking supervision was assigned to the BOT from June 1998 to June 200 1. STA: Thailand has received a series of technical assistance missions in recent years on national accounts statistics (December 1996, October 1997, March and September-October 1998, March and August 1999) mainly to improve the quality and timeliness of quarterly data. Furthermore, missions on producer price indices (June-July 1999) and on balance of payments statistics (September-October 1998, January 2002) reviewed the methodology of several price indices and the balance of payments compilation system. There have also been missions on the areas of banking statistics (April and June-July 1998, and January-February 2001), data dissemination issues (July 1996, and April-May, June, and November 1997), and Government Finance Statistics (March 2002).

In October 1998, the Bank provided a partial guarantee for a $300 million bond issue by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. The Bank has followed up on the EFAL and SIP ($300 million) loans by implementing a second Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan (EFAL II) ($600 million, fully disbursed, with another $600 million co-financing from Japan Export-Import Bank) approved by the Board in March 1999. The Bank Board approved a Public Sector Reform Loan ($400 million) on October 14, 1999, which has been fully disbursed). The Bank is preparing a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Thailand. The broad strategy of the Bank’s continued involvement in Thailand is on the basis of the Comprehensive Development Partnership (CDP) approach, which envisages provision of policy advise and technical assistance, to sustain the momentum of reforms begun under the EFAL, PSRL, and SIP loans. The CDP approach also might be associated with a limited amount of lending. The CDP would address five key areas-Competitiveness (C), Governance (G), Environment (E), Poverty (P) and Social Protection (SP). CDP (SP) and CDP (G), CDP (Poverty), and CDP (Competitiveness) have been launched. Also, please note that the disbursement data has been updated as of April 2002.

The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) pledged $1.2 billion at the Tokyo Meeting in August 1997 to support the Government of Thailand’s stabilization and structural adjustment program, focused on the financial and social sectors. Lending by the AsDB increased from $330 million in 1996 and 1997, to $550 million in 1997, $630 million in 1998 (excluding guarantee operations of $950 million), and $364 million in 1999. No loans were made to the Government in 2000 and 2001. A $300 million Financial Markets Reform Program Loan (FMRPL) was approved on December 19, 1997, with the aim of, inter alia, strengthening market regulation and supervision in the securities market and improving risk management. Under the above program loan, technical assistance and policy support has been given to the area of pension reform. The AsDB continues to support the work of the Steering Committee for Drafting Pension Provident Fund Reforms which is currently finalizing reform options for a multi-pillar pension system. To date, this assistance has led to detailed actuarial analysis, proposals for stabilizing the exisiting defined-benefit Old Age Pension, a proposed design for a mandatory savings accumulation pension system, and assessments of the legal and regulatory framework needed for an integrated multi-pillar pension system. It is expected that the Steering Committee will seek final design approval in June 2002 from the Cabinet Committee on Old Age Retirement Policy. AsDB expects to provide additional technical assistance in 2002 to support the first stage of implementation of pension reform. A $500 million Social Sector Program Loan (SSPL) was approved on March 12, 1998. The funds were disbursed in two tranches, on March 17, 1998 ($300 million) and October 28, 1999 ($200 million). The objectives of the SSPL are to mitigate the short-term ‘Prepared by AsDB staff.

The SSPL includes measures to address systemic issues in the education, health, labor market, and social welfare sectors. Specific attention has also been paid to gender and poverty issues. The AsDB is providing long-term technical assistance support under the SSPL for education management and financing, health management and financing, and capacity building for social sector reform. An Export Financing Facility (EFF) was approved on March 26, 1998. The Facility was set up to fund pre- and post-shipment financing of exports, the import of raw materials needs of exporters, and export-related plant and machinery requirements. The EFF consisted of (i) a $50 million loan to the Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM); and (ii) $950 million equivalent in cofinancing from 68 international banks to EXIM in the form of a syndicated 5-year term loan. The AsDB provided a partial credit guarantee to the commercial cofinanciers, with a counter guarantee from the Kingdom to the AsDB. However, the terms of the facility, which reflected the prevailing market sentiment of March 1998, became unattractive as interest rates declined sharply with the restoration of stability. Of the $1 billion available under the EFF, $200 million was accessed by EXIM. The availability period for this facility lapsed without further drawdowns and loans from the AsDB and the syndication of international banks were prepaid by EXIM in September 1999. An Agriculture Sector Program Loan ($300 million, plus $300 million in “Miyazawa Initiative” cofinancing from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation) was approved on September 23, 1999. The objectives are to increase productivity, enhance export competitiveness, and improve governance and management in the agricultural sector. The first tranche of $150 million was disbursed by the AsDB on December 27, 1999. Technical assistance activities are still ongoing to restructure the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. On December 21, 1999, the ADB approved a $7.5 million technical assistance package to restructure state-owned specialized financial institutions (SFIs) in Thailand. The assistance will help the government devise restructuring plans for four SFIs, namely, the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand, Small Industry Finance Corporation, and Small Industry Credit Guarantee Corporation. The various forms of Government support for SFIs and their effect on SF1 operations will be reviewed. A clear corporate governance framework for the SFIs to ensure autonomy, accountability and transparency will also be established. The assistance will explore possible roles for the SFIs in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) financing. The AsDB assistance comprises a technical assistance loan of $4.5 million, which comes from its ordinary capital resources, and a technical assistance grant of $3 million, financed by the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility, funded by the Government of Japan. AsDB’s Private Sector Group approved a $25 million equity investment in the Small- and Medium-Enterprises Investment and Restructuring Fund (SIRF) in March 2000. The fund- which has a target size of $100 million-will invest in SMEs with promising businesses in need of expansion capital. Technical assistance grants totaling $2.6 million for six projects were also approved in 200 1.

The bulk of the information used by the staff in surveillance work is obtained directly from the Bank of Thailand (BOT): key financial data are reported daily, with more general economic data reported regularly via the Resident Representative. In addition, the BOT publishes a statistical monthly release, basic data on monetary aggregates, the balance of payments, investment and manufacturing production, and the overall fiscal cash surplus (all with a lag of one-two months). The BOT also posts a wide range of economic data on the World Wide Web (www.bot.or.th). Further details are obtained from the BOT’s monthly and quarterly reports. In addition, the BOT has been publishing quarterly inflation reports since July 2000. The Thai authorities responded to the crisis by greatly improving provision of economic data together with a commitment to increased data transparency. For example, data on the key assets and liabilities of the BOT are now published regularly, including net forward obligations. In addition, the BOT has made considerable efforts to improve the reporting of comprehensive data on the position of financial institutions (including nonperforming loans and capital adequacy), data on external debt positions and rollover rates, and, continues to provide data to the Fund to facilitate effective post-program monitoring of the Thai economy. The quality and timeliness of Thailand’s data differ across sectors: l Existing data collection arrangements adversely affect the quality and timeliness of the monetary statistics. The compilation of monetary statistics in the BOT’s Data Management Group is based on a reporting system that serves primarily bank supervision purposes. Although efforts have been made within the BOT to modify the reporting format to meet the needs of monetary statistics, the reports submitted by the financial institutions are not fully compatible with statistical standards. Moreover, the monetary aggregate M2A (which includes promissory notes issued by finance companies) is compiled with a lag of six weeks. There is an even longer lag in the compilation of M3 (which equals M2A plus deposits held in state financial institutions). The banking survey is compiled with a lag of about three months. A STA technical assistance mission in early 2001 has made recommendations to remedy these problems. There are consistency problems in the interbank and intra sectoral positions in the monetary statistics compiled by the BOT. A cursory review of the underlying data undertaken by STA missions revealed significant discrepancies between asset and liability positions reported for the same group of financial institutions. These discrepancies indicate that there are inconsistencies in the sectoral classification of assets and liabilities that diminish the analytical usefulness of the monetary data. It was agreed that the authorities would review in greater detail the consistency of the interbank and intra sectoral positions and examine the causes of the discrepancies.

However, the Labor Force Survey is now conducted every quarter, instead of two to three times a year. l Quarterly national accounts have been published since early 1999, and are currently available with one quarter lag. Their introduction was tied to Thailand’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and was developed with technical assistance from STA. However, a number of technical problems remain, essentially reflecting deficiencies in the underlying source data, but also technical problems in benchmarking the quarterly to the annual data. l While the methodology for compiling balance of payments data remains adequate, a number of weaknesses in the data collection system need to be addressed in order to fully capture developments following the relaxation of the foreign exchange controls. These include: (1) an inadequate coverage of transactions by nonresidents in Thailand and by Thai residents abroad (other than banks); (2) a lack of noncash activity, such as reinvested earnings; and, more generally, (3) a deterioration in the quality of data reported under the exchange control system, partly in consequence of the increased pressure on the reporting system that resulted from the sharply increased scale of transactions. l On fiscal accounts, although the authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the GFS, their own budget presentation to Parliament and public at large does not conform to GFS, causing confusion among market participants. The transparency of the official statistics with regard to the quasi-fiscal activities of the government also needs to be addressed.
