After two decades of declining economic activity and financial imbalances, Guyana’s economy improved substantially in the period 1991-97. However, beginning in late 1997, Guyana’s economic performance was adversely affected by major external shocks and policy slippages. In 1998 real GDP declined by 1% percent and the rate of inflation was 4% percent. The overall public sector deficit (after grants) increased from 3 percent of GDP in 1997 to 3% percent of GDP in 1998 (compared with % percent of GDP in the program). Guyana did not observe several of the quantitative performance criteria for end-December 1998. . The authorities have formulated a program designed to return the economy to a sustainable growth path. The program assumes a real GDP growth of 2 percent in 1999, rising to 4 percent by 2003, and aims at containing inflation and strengthening the balance of payments. The overall public sector deficit (after grants) would decline to 3 percent of GDP in 1999 and to 1% percent of GDP by 2002. In 1999 the exchange rate used for valuing imports for customs purposes is being brought more in line with the market rate, tax administration is being improved through the establishment of a new Revenue Authority, the national airline has been closed down and, along with several other enterprises, has been earmarked for privatization, and the growth of the public sector wage bill is being contained. . Monetary policy has been tightened through the intensified use of open-market operations whose effectiveness has increased following the liberalization of interest rates on government securities. In addition to the envisaged privatization, structural measures in the program include a revision of the civil service remuneration structure to help retain qualified personnel, other civil service reforms, steps to strengthen the operations of the financial sector (including restructuring the state-owned commercial bank), and a reduction in the maximum external tariff to 20 percent. The Fund also has been requested to provide technical assistance to reform the tax system and improve bank supervision, . As required under the HIPC initiative, the program provides for increased spending on education, health and poverty alleviation programs. . While the program is appropriate to achieve the objectives specified, there are risks Despite easing of tensions, Guyana continues to face political challenges (a constitutional reform in 1999 and a general election in 2000). In addition, the government faces a major challenge to implement the agreed wage policy. The program, however, provides for compensating measures to offset any wage overrun. . The completion of the current review is a condition for reaching the completion point and delivery of assistance under the HIPC lnitiative (which at the decision point in December 1997 was envisaged to take place at end-1998). The amount of assistance to be extended to Guyana under the Initiative has been estimated at US$256 million in NPV terms.

Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation and the review under the first annual Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement were held in Georgetown, Guyana during November 2-18, 1998 and January 21-February 8, 1999. The representatives of Guyana included the Finance Minister, Mr. Jagdeo; the Governor of the Bank of Guyana, Ms. Singh; and other senior officials. Private sector representatives, including nongovern- mental organizations, also were consulted. The staffteam included Mr. Yadav (Head), Mr. Hussein, Mr. Loevinger, Ms. Torres (all WHD);Mr. Jiang (PDR), Mrs. Karkas (Assistant-WHD), and Mrs. Witmer (Assistant-SEC). Mr. Williams (Senior Advisor, WHD) and Mr. O’Brien, the Alternate Executive Director for Guyana, participated in the final rounds of discussions.’ 2. Guyana is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle and the last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 23, 1997 (EBS/97/226 and SM/97/281).2 At that time, Directors noted Guyana’s strong growth, the decline in inflation, and a strengthening of the public finances and the external position. They urged the authorities to continue to pursue fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to achieve sustained growth in output and employment, with price stability and a viable external position. 3. On July 15, 1998, the Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 53.76 million, or 59 percent of the new quota (EBS/98/101 and EDB/98/59). As of March 3 1, 1999, outstanding Fund credit to Guyana was SDR 106 million, or 116.4 percent of quota (see Attachment I). 4. In 1998 there were major deviations from the program, related to exogenous shocks (EZ Nifio, a sizable drop in export prices, and domestic political disturbances) and policy slippages. Accordingly, Guyana did not observe the following quantitative performance criteria for end-December 1998: the ceiling on the net borrowing requirement and the subceiling on the net domestic borrowing requirement of the nontinancial public sector; the limit on the increase in the net domestic assets of the Bank of Guyana; and the targets for increases in the net foreign assets and gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana ‘Staff from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) collaborated with the Fund missions, particularly in the areas of structural reforms, social sector, public sector investment’program, and debt sustainability analysis, The Alternate Executive Director for Guyana at the World Bank, Mr Slusher, also participated in major policy discussions in early February, 1999. *Guyana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, Relations with the Fund, the World Bank, the IDB, and the CDB are summarized in Attachments I-IV.

However, Guyana met all 1998 structural performance criteria and the quantitative limits on external debt. 5. In the attached letter dated April 27, 1999, the authorities review Guyana’s economic performance under the arrangement and describe their economic program for 1999 (including a medium-term policy framework) which aims to put the economy back on a sustainable growth path (Attachment VI). Under the proposed program, the authorities intend to address the policy slippages of 1998 to reduce fiscal imbalances, continue implementing structural reforms (in such areas as privatization, civil service, taxation, and financial sector) and increase social sector spending in line with the commitments under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. On this basis, the authorities request waiver of the unobserved 1998 performance criteria and completion of the review under the first annual ESAF arrangement. 6. The completion of the current review is a condition for reaching the completion point and delivery of assistance under the BIPC Initiative (which at the decision point in December 1997 was envisaged to take place at end-1998). Despite the delay in reaching the completion point, the amount of assistance to be extended to Guyana under the Initiative would remain broadly the same as determined at the decision point (US.%256 million in NPV terms),3 as the actual NPV of debt-to-exports ratio after HIPC assistance (115 percent at the completion point ,using an end-1998 base year) is within the targeted range of 97 to 117 percent (the Final HIPC Document,.EBS/97/227, December 5, 1997). 7. Guyana provides the core minimum data for surveillance, but needs to improve its macroeconomic data base to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of economic developments (Attachment V). The data weakness relates to the quality, timeliness, and coverage, particularly in the areas of national accounts, public finance, and balance of payments. II. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS A. Background 8. Guyana’s economic performance improved substantially in the period since 1990. Foll.owing two decades of declining economic activity and high inflation, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 7 percent in 1991-97; inflation fell from over 100 percent in 1991 to 3% percent in 1997; and the Guyana dollar gained stability (Table 1). The overall public sector deficit (after grants) was reduced from 16% percent of GDP in 1993 to 3 percent of GDP in 1997 through expenditure restraint, a substantial reduction in public ‘This is comparable to the US$253 million estimated at the decision point given updated exchange and discount rates.

In addition, major structural reforms were undertaken including the removal of price controls, the liberalization of external trade, the simplification of the import tariff structure, the privatization of several public enterprises (Box I) and the rationalization of others, and the reorganization of the Bank of Guyana.(paragraphs 2 and 3 of the government letter). B. Developments in 1998 9. In 1998 real GDP declined by 1% percent (compared with a growth of 3 percent assumed in the program) primarily due to a drop in major exports (sugar, rice, gold, timber) related to El Nifio, weak commodity prices, and civil disturbances that lasted through the first half of 1998 (Box 2). However, with the decline in demand and favorable import prices, consumer prices rose by 4% percent in 1998 in lbte with the program objectives. 10. The overall public sector deficit (before grants) declined from 8% percent of GDP in 1997 to 5 percent of GDP in 1998 (compared with 2 percent of GDP envisaged in the program). There was a revenue shortfall equivalent to 4%~percent of GDP, reflecting mainly the downturn in economic activity, a delay in making the new Revenue Authority operational, and a sharp decline in the operating surplus of the public enterprises due to lower sugar production, weaker export prices and technical difficulties in the government-owned bauxite and airline companies. 11. The authorities responded to the decline in revenue by cutting back expenditure (mainly capital outlays) by 1% percentage points of GDP f%om the budgeted levels. However, the government granted higher salary increases than envisaged in the program. The program had provided for a 9% percent increase in the civil service pay scales, but following a civil service strike, the authorities granted additional increases ranging from 4%20% percent (with lower grades receiving larger increases) effective July 1, 1998. While the wage bill turned out to be within the budget ceiling in 1998 because of a larger-than-expected reduction in the government employment, the additional salary increase granted in July 1998 will have a heavy impact in 1999. ‘Public sector refers to the operations of the central government, the National Insurance Scheme (NE), the nonfinancial public sector enterprises, and the Bank of Guyana.

The central government increased its spending on programs for basic education, health and poverty alleviation from 8% percent of GDP in 1997 to 9% percent of GDP in 1998 (compared with the original target of 9 percent of GDP suggested in the Final Document on the HIPC Initiative, Box 3). Government spending on education increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1997 to 5% percent of GDP in 1998 (% percentage point of GDP above the target). Spending on health remained relatively unchanged at close to 3 percent of GDP in 1998.’ In addition, actions were taken to increase the autonomy of the General Hospital, rationalize several health care centers, and introduce cost recovery fees for some medical services. Spending on poverty alleviation at around 1 percent of GDP in 1998 was somewhat higher than envisaged. Further, the government prepared a poverty map and provided additional support to implement community development projects. Box 3.

The combined operations of the public enterprises and the NIS improved less than programmed mainly because of a shift in NIS interest receipts from 1998 into 1999 resulting from a decision to buy longer-term treasury bills, technical problems with the airline and a bauxite company (L INMINE), and the adverse impact of economic slowdown on the operations of some smaller enterprises that sell in the local markets (see Table 4). 14. There was a shortfall in net external financing (5% percent of GDP) reflecting mainly the postponement of disbursement; of USS36 million (5 percent of GDP) under lDB sector ‘This was slightly below the target because spending on health was constrained by inadequate allocation of capital outlays for transportation and storage of drugs in the remote areas of the country, as well as by a sluggish procurement system.

The net domestic financing exceeded programmed levels by 9 percent of GDP. 15. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) narrowed from over 14 percent of GDP in 1997 to 13% percent of GDP in 1998 (compared with the program projection of 10% percent of the originally projected GDP). Export earnings fell, but this was virtually offset by a decline in imports resulting mainly from lower domestic demand and oil prices. With the sizable shortfall in net capital inflows (paragraph 14), the increase in the net international reserves of the Bank of Guyana was US%41 million, compared with a program target of US871 million (see Table 5 of the government letter). 16. Guyana imulemented most of the 1998 structural reform agenda, which was aimed at increasing productivity and private sector participation in economic activity (Table 8). Specifically, the two structural performance criteria-on restructuring the ministry of finance and reviewing public service rules-were observed. As to the other reforms, several public enterprises were brought to the point of sale (as envisaged in the program) although no major enterprise was sold in 1998 as investors remained concerned about the poor financial condition of many of the enterprises being offered for sale, risks in the emerging markets in general and Guyana’s political situation in particular. A strategic plan for improving the operations of GUYSUCO also was put in place. Financial sector reforms included passage of a new Bank of Guyana Act and the associated recapitalization and the reorganization of the bank and the transfer of certain foreign debt liabilities of the bank to the central govemment;6 cabinet approval of the privatization of the state-owned airline and the restructuring of the state-owned Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB); and the passage of legislation to improve the regulation of the insurance and securities sectors. 17. The civil service reform and the privatixation of the electricity company were not implemented in 1998, as envisaged in the program, the former because of delays in the completion of the survey of private sector remuneration, and the latter because the interested company withdrew its offer citing unstable political situation. A. The Strategy 18. Although the political situation has eased since July 1998, Guyana continues to face a difficult political challenge. The process of constitutional reform has just begun and a general %Jnder the new Act, the Bank of Guyana is prohibited from extending credit to the public sector and its paid-in capital was increased from G$6 million to G$l billion in 1998. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- election is due in 2000 (two years ahead of the normal five-year cycle under an agreement between the two major political parties). While the terms of trade is expected to deteriorate in 1999, export volume is projected to benefit from a rebound in production following El Mnlo and measures to increase productivity. . 19. The authorities are taking several important steps to begin to return the program closer to its original path. These include: (i) consolidating the public finances through an increase in the customs valuation exchange rate, improvements in tax administration, and the closure of a major loss making public enterprise that was a drain on the budget; (ii) controlling the growth of the wage bill, subject to the urgent need to bring the remuneration of managerial and technical staff more in line with private sector pay; (iii) reducing tariff protection; and (iv) addressing the main weakness in the banking system, GNCB. 20. The authorities remain committed to the medium-term economic objectives of creating a durable basis for a sustained increase in economic activity and reduction in poverty through market-oriented policies and promotion of private sector activity. The program assumes that real GDP will grow by 2 percent in 1999 and by 3X-4 percent a year during 2001-03 (see Table 1). Consumer prices are targeted to rise temporarily to 5% percent in 1999 (mainly because of the recent depreciation of the Guyana dollar and an increase in utility tariffs) before falling back toward the projected inflation in Guyana’s major trading partner countries. 21. In relation to GDP, the external current account deficit is projected to increase slightly in 1999 before declining over the medium term. The current account deficit will be covered mainly by concessional financing from donors (already approved or being negotiated) and direct investment. The overall balance of payments deficit would decline substantially in 1999 and shift to surpluses in the following years. The ratio of external debt service to exports (after the projected assistance under the HIPC Initiative) is estimated to fall from 19 percent in 1998 to 8% percent by 2003. Gross international reserves are targeted to be maintained at around four months of imports. B. Public Finances 22. The overall deficit of the public sector after grants is targeted to decline from 3% percent of GDP in 1998 to 3 percent of GDP in 1999 (the level as in 1997) which would be more than covered by the already committed concessional external loans. The deficit before grants is to increase (from 5 percent of GDP to 8% percent of GDP), largely because of the rise in outlays on programs financed by the projected assistance under the HIPC Initiative. Total expenditure is projected to rise by 4 percentage points of GDP in 1999 reflecting mainly the projected rise in outlays on programs under the HIPC Initiative (2.2 percent of GDP), interest payments (1.1 percent of GDP) and capital expenditure Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- financed by concessional loans.’ The public sector revenue/GDP ratio has declined in 1997-98, partly because of a marked deterioration in tax administration. The program for 1999 aims at stabilizing this ratio at 35% percent. 23. In the 1999 budget presented to Parliament on March 26, 1999, central governmknt revenue is conservatively projected to remain unchanged, The revenue projection assumes an increase of 7% percent in the exchange rate used for customs valuation effective April 30, 1999 (revenue yield of 0.7 percent of GDP). In addition, the expected entry into operation of the new Revenue Authority (which should give a major boost to tax administration) is estimated to yield revenue equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP.8 The mission recommended that the customs valuation rate be raised to the market level in the 2000 budget. 24. The fiscal program incorporates an increase in the wage bill from 8.4 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9.3 percent of GDP in 1999. This increase includes the additional cost of the wage increase granted in mid-1998 (around 0.4 percent of GDP) and the estimated cost of the salary restructuring envisaged under the HIPC Initiative (1 percent of GDP) and savings through attrition (see paragraph 26). This restructuring will entail sizable salary adjustments for managerial and technical employees to help narrow the salary gap between public and private sectors to attract and retain qualified personnel. It also will include a general salary increase which is currently being negotiated with the unions. The authorities are committed to a general salary increase of 6 percent, down from an average of 19 percent (heavily weighted in favor of lower scales) granted in 1998. The authorities are trying to complete the negotiations by end-April but they anticipate that the unions (who are asking increases of 40 percent) would delay reaching agreement until around July. 25. The mission expressed its concern about the large unprogrammed increases in civil service salaries in 1998. The mission noted that public sector wages serve as signal to private sector wage settlements, and large increases could undermine Guyana’s competitiveness. Further, large salary increases would hamper the authorities’ ability to carry out the more ambitious civil service reform that is envisaged. The mission emphasized that any wage policy slippage in 1999 also would undermine the medium-term sustainability of the fiscal position. ’ Total expenditure (excluding interest payments and HIPC related spending) would be lower than in 1997 (32 percent of GDP compared with 35% percent of GDP). ’ The new Revenue Authority has been held up by a court injunction since June 1998. The authorities have indicated that ifthere continues to be delays legislative steps will be taken to bring it into operation by end-May, 1999. With assistance from the World Bank, the new Revenue Authority would merge the functions and data base of the Inland Revenue and Customs Departments, hire more qualified staff and upgrade the computer system. Establishment of the Revenue Authority was expected to boost the collection of tax arrears to 1.2 percent of GDP in 1998. In the event, arrears of only 0.8 percent of GDP were collected. The projected yield for 1999 includes revenues from arrears that were not collected in 1998.

In addition, they assured the mission that in the event of a slippage they would implement additional measures (increase in the customs valuation exchange rate and expenditure cut backs) to achieve the fiscal objectives. In this context, the mission advised the authorities to make the customs valuation exchange rate the same as the market rate. These and other developments will be examined during the next, staff mission to Guyana scheduled for June 1999 to negotiate the second annual ESAF- supported program. 26. Since 1991, employment in the central government has been reduced by over 50 percent and in the public sector by 45 percent.9 The fiscal program for 1999 provides for a tinther reduction of 3 percent in the civil service through attrition. The authorities are in discussions with the LDB on a more ambitious civil service rationalization program which will involve severance payments. 27. The overall surplus of the public enterprises (including NE), which had averaged 1% percent of GDP in 1997-98, is projected to decline to % percent of GDP in 1999. The decline would reflect an increase in capital spending by about 1 percentage point of GDP (mainly by GUYSUCO), which would be only partially offset by an improvement in the operating balance of the enterprises. The projection takes into account the fact that Guyana Airways (which had an operating deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1998) has been closed down and is earmarked for sale. The program also assumes that the sugar company would settle on general wage increase of around 7% percent (compared with 12 percent in 1998), reduce productivity bonus from the equivalent of 18 days pay in 1998 to 12 days pay in 1999, and cut employment by 200 persons that would free up resources equivalent to 1 percent of the current wage bill. 28. The public sector deficit (after grants) would decline gradually from 3% percent of GDP in 1998 to an average of 1% percent of GDP in 2001-03 which, together with the projected assistance under the HIPC Initiative, would help reduce the public sector debt burden. Following a sharp rise in 1999, the ratio of public expenditure to GDP is programmed to decline, while the ratio of public revenue to GDP is projected to remain fairly stable’over the medium term. In view of the already high tax burden, the medium-term program does not envisage increases in tax rates but the authorities intend to improve tax administration and the efficiency of the tax system with external technical assistance to maintain the current level of revenue effort. The authorities have requested FAD assistance for ‘Total employment in the public sector (excluding teachers, health care workers, police, and army) was reduced from 65.7 thousand at end-1991 to 39.5 thousand at end-1997, while central government employment fell from 17.8 thousand to 10.8 thousand in the same period. In 1998 employment in public sector and the central government were further reduced to 36.3 thousand and 9.4 thousand, respectively.

C. Monetary Policy 29. The 1999 program calls for a tight monetary policy to achieve the inflation and international reserve targets. The monetary program takes into account the recent declining trend in the growth rate of broad money and the rise in interest rates, and it is expected that any unanticipated increase in the demand for money will be met by additional capital inflows. In’addition, it is assumed that the ratio of broad money to currency will continue to increase in line with the recent rising trend. More specifically, the program would require the Bank of Guyana to reduce its net domestic assets (Table ‘5). The reduction will be facilitated by the programmed build up of public sector deposits. In 1999 broad money is projected to rise by 4 percent, lower than the rate of growth of nominal GDP. The monetary program would accommodate an increase of up to 12 percent in private sector credit, which would be adequate to support a recovery in economic activity. 30. As envisaged in the program, the bank reserve requirement was reduced from an average of 15 percent to 12 percent, effective February 1, 1999.” In order to contain the increase in liquidity, the Bank of Guyana substantially intensified open-market operations as from January 1999. The authorities also removed the collar on the treasury bill bids in the weekly auctions to allow interest rates to reflect market forces more efficiently.” Following this action, the average treasury hill yield increased from 8.9 percent at end-1998 to 13.2 percent by mid-March 1999. 31. Commercial banks’ compliance with prudential regulations has improved. Noncompliance related mainly to the limits set for loans to individuals and groups, and the timely submission of reports.‘? To enhance compliance, the Bank of Guyana is currently seeking advice from the MAE on the possibility of amending the relevant sections of the Financial Institution Act (FIA) to allow the bank to impose penalties on a noncompliant institution without having to first obtain a summary conviction, The ratio of nonperforming to total loans is high-30 percent for the banking system as a whole, or 22 percent excluding “Also, the 1966 circulars on reserves requirements and liquid assets were revised in line with international banking standards in late 1998. “This replaces the previous system which required that the deviation in yield be no more than 2 percentage points of the yield in the previous tender. ‘*Instances of noncompliance with the single borrower limit improved from 34 instances by four banks at end-1997 to seven instances by three banks at end-1998. The timeliness of submissions of reports has also improved and the instances of late submissions have decreased.

However, loan loss provisioning continued to be within the limits prescribed by the FIA, with the ratio of loan loss provision to nonperforming loans increasing from 5 1 percent at end-1997 to 56 percent at end-1998 Commercial banks have an average capital adequacy ratio of 14 percent. The mission cautioned the authorities that they should seek to strengthen enforcement of prudential regulations and improve bank supervision in line with BASLE norms. MAE is discussing with the authorities the modalities for providing additional technical assistance in this area. 32. GNCB, which has run operating losses for most of the 1990s could threaten the soundness of the banking system (Box 4). With technical assistance from the World Bank, the authorities have engaged the services of a new international management team with sufficient autonomy to pursue policies needed to rehabilitate the bank. Their mandate inctudes taking steps to strengthen credit procedures, increase the collection of arrears and rationalise staff. The new management team is expected to submit a final report by end- 1999 on options for GNCB’s future, and the government is committed to taking decision on the options in early 2000. D. External Sector Policies 33. Guyana does not maintain any restrictions on making payments and transfers for current international transactions. Its external trade system is free of quantitative controls except for restrictions on imports of a few items relating to health and security. The authorities intend to reduce the maximum import tariffs under the CARICOM Common External Tariff from 25 percent to 20 percent effective April 30, 1999.” 34. Guyana maintains a floating exchange rate regime. Notwithstanding occasional sales of foreign exchange in the market by the Bank of Guyana, the Guyana dollar depreciated from G$144 per U.S. dollar at end-1997 to G$165 per U.S. dollar at end-1998. The implied depreciation of over 9 percent in real effective terms would offset some of the real appreciation that had occurred in the preceding years (Figure 1). The Guyana dollar continued to be under downward pressure in early 1999 and the Bank of Guyana sold US$15 million in the market. Under the program, the authorities would refrain from intervening in the foreign exchange market except to help smooth out sharp fluctuations. “Recently, the authorities informed the staff that the maximum tariff had been reduced from 30 to 25 percent in November 1997, and not from 25 to 20 percent as was previously reported to the Executive Board. However, the authorities explained that they believed that they were still in compliance with the performance criterion under the previous ESAF arrangement as they had followed the CARICOM agreement (which was revised to make it voluntary to reduce maximum tariff to 20 percent). Certain agricultural products and luxury items will continue to attract higher rates than the maximum import tariff rate.

The Restructuring of the Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB) The government-owned GNCB was established in 1970. While its market share has declined, by mid-1998 GNCB was Guyana’s third largest commercial bank, with nearly 20 percent of the banking sector’s loans and deposits. The government began restructuring GNCB in 1994 as part of a fmancial sector adjustment program supported by the World Bank and IDB. In May 1995 GNCB was merged with a state-owned development hank (GAIBANK). Nonperforming loans of about GS4.4 billion were transferred to a debt collection agency, and the central government assumed G$3.8 billion of GNCB’s liabilities (4.3 percent of 1995 GDP). A new managc- rnent team of Guyanese nationals was installed. GNCB is subject to the Financial Institutions Act 1995 (X4) and is regulated by the Bank of Guyana. To reinvigorate GNCB’s restructuring, the govcmmcnt commissioned a World Bank-funded study in 1998, which found: (9 GNCB was overexposed to the rice sector which is subject to adverse climatic conditions. The bank’s other lending was of insullicicnt volume and profitability to s&in the losses incurred on rice-related lending. Close to 60 percent of GNCB’s outstanding loans were nonperforming at the end of September 1998, and were mostly related to the rice sector. (ii) GNCB management had’adequately set aide provisions against most nonperforming loans to cover future losses. (iii) The bank’s technology end Management Information System wcrc not adequate; neither regular loan statements nor automatic arrears reminders were sent to customers. (iv) Due to a continued decline in deposits and operating losses resulting t?om high costs and nonperforming loans, GNCB’s liquid assets had declined significantly; and (“1 GNCB was meeting current capital adequacy requirements, provided that central government liabilities to GNCB wcrc trcatcd as capital (see below). The consultants noted that there was no politicill consensus to ptivatize GNCB. In February 1999, funded by the World Bank and IDB, the government t@d a management team of foreign nationals to restructure GNCR. The autholitics intend to: (i) give the new management team sutlicient autonomy, and in particular, strictly limit the Board ofDirectors’ involvement in day to day management; (ii) ban GNCB from a cooperative into a corporation, (iii) capitalize GNCB with cash or liquid securities; and (iv) rationalize staff During the fast three months of the team’s contract, while it cvaluatcs the bank’s business prospects and procedures, no new loans will bc extended to defaulting borrowa unless specifically justified and loans to new customers will be limited. Following thus uutml period, the team will prepare a plan laying out steps to recapitalize the bank, improve internal controls, and comply with prudential regulations for the single borrower. Ntcr one year, the management team will rccommc~d future options, including privatization, liquidation, continued state ownership, and downsizing. GNCB has rmi operating losses t&-most of the 1990s. Under the Ccqmlive Fimncial Act, the cmtral government is required to reimburse GNCB fully for any operating losses. As a result, rather than reducing GNCB’s capital, these operating losses have been otTset by corresponding nonmarkctablc assets (Receivables from ConsolidatedFond ) in GNCB’s balance sheet, amounting to GS4.7 billion (4.3 percent of 1998 GDP) as oflXxcmher 1998~ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- I\ : : ‘, : /----- / =: -.r; I ,’ : : : : : m : : : : &p 5 : 5 ‘: M 8 : 2 : % YJ : 2, * : 2: 5 g\ 2: : “1 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- E. Structural Reforms 35. By end- 1997 the government had sold nonfinancial public’ enterprises that accounted for more than 60 percent of the total assets held by government in 1989-90 (paragraphs 3 and 25 of the government letter, and Box 1). The authorities intend to privatize all but four entities (oil company, port services, GUYSUCO, and GNCB) by the end of this year, including selling the airline and electricity companies. Further, the government is redoubling’ its efforts to sell all major enterprises which have already been brought to the point of sale (e.g., the bauxite companies and Guyana Stores). The mission noted that if these efforts did not bring the desired results, the authorities should seek to close down loss-making enterprises to strengthen the public sector operations. Net privatization proceeds will continue to be used for reducing public sector indebtedness. The government intends to introduce new procurement legislation to enhance transparency and project implementation capacity. In the financial sector, in addition to the restructuring of the GNCB noted above, the regulations to implement the recently passed insurance and securities legislation are being put in place. 36. The government increased the budget allocation for social sectors from 9% percent of GDP in 1998 to 10% percent of GDP in 1999, or K percentage point of GDP more than the level anticipated in the Final Document on the RIPC Initiative (see Box 3). In paragraph 20 of the attached government letter, the authorities indicate that in the 1999 budget allocations for education would be maintained at 5% percent of GDP while for basic health and poverty alleviation would be increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1998 to 5 percent of GDP in line with the Final Document on the HIPC Initiative. They explained to the mission that in order to ensure that all subtargets for social sector spending are achieved, budgetary allocations for transportation and storage facilities for drugs would be increased and appropriate modifications to the procurement procedures were being introduced. The World Bank and IDB will help monitor the implementation of education reform. In the area of poverty alleviation, externally financed Social Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) and Basic Needs Trust Fund are working with the civic organizations in helping reduce poverty. In particular, SIMAF’ provides to targeted groups employment, day care centers, primary health services, and food supplements. In January 1999, with assistance from the UNDP, the government initiated the preparation of a new survey of household expenditures, which is expected to be completed this year. 37. The authorities have continued to make etforts to improve the collection and dissemination of data. Finally, with technical and financial assistance from the World Bank, the authorities have taken necessary steps to begin to deal with the Y2K problem, including the establishment of national level council and an awareness program to inform private sector. The authorities are seeking additional external assistance to deal with this problem in the ministry of finance.

The medium-term balance of payments projections described in the staff report on the request for the ESAF arrangement (EBS/98/101,7/1/98) were revised to take into account the specific policy understandings noted above, as well as recent developments, including revisions in the projections for output, exports and imports (Tables 9 and IO). 39. The external current account deficit is projected to increase from 13% percent of GDP in 1998 to 14 percent of GDP in 1999 before declining to under 11 percent of GDP by 2003, mainly because of improvements in the merchandise balance. Exports in U.S. dollar terms are projected to rise at an average annual rate of 5 percent, reflecting mainly a growth in volume. Imports in terms of U.S. dollar are expected to rise at an average annual rate of 4 percent over the medium term, with growth divided almost equally between volume and unit price. Over the medium term, the external currentaccount deficits are projected to he covered by net official borrowing (already approved or under negotiations) and net private capital inflows (assumed at around the average level in 1996-98). This, together with the projected assistance under the HIPC Initiative, would allow gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana to be maintained at around four months of imports to provide cushion against external shocks. 40. Expected debt relief under the HIPC initiative will reduce the debt burden over the medium term. In nominal terms, public sector external debt is projected to decline from 192 percent of GDP in 1998 to 180 percent of GDP by 2003 (see Table 1). Based on end- 1998 preliminary data, the ratio of NPV of debt to exports is estimated at 115 percent (after the projected HIPC assistance of US%256 million), within the target range of 97 to 117 percent determined at the decision point. The NPV of debt to exports ratio will decline from 15 1 percent (before HIPC assistance) at end-1998 to 117 percent (after the projected assistance under the HIPC Initiative) by end-1999 and will be 108 percent by year 2003. With an estimated cash flow relief of US$25 million, the ratio of debt service to exports of goods and nonfactor services will be reduced from 19 percent in 1998 to 11% percent in 1999 and to 8% percent by 2003. In terms of central government revenues, debt service payments would be reduced from 55 percent in 1998 to 33 percent in 1999 and 24 percent by 2003. 41. The authorities intend to maintain a high degree of concessionality in new external borrowing. They also have been improving the debt management capacity, with technical and financial support from the Debt Relief International (a donor mnded nongovernmental organization) and UK Department for International Development. A reorganization plan for the Debt Management Division in the ministry of finance that distinguishes clearly between recording and analytical functions is being implemented with additional technical staff and offtce equipment. A comprehensive staff training program covering both recording and analytical aspects of the debt management and computerization has been agreed with the Debt Relief International and consultants have been recruited. The training program started in February 1999 and is expected to be completed in a year.

With one modification, the second half of the first annual ESAF arrangement contains indicative targets similar to the performance criteria for the first half of the annual arrangement (Table 5 of the government letter of April 27, 1999).” There are two prior actions that are to be taken by April 30, 1999: (1) an increase in the customs valuation exchange rate from G$144 per U.S. dollar to G$lSS per U.S. dollar; and (2) a reduction in the maximum import duty from 25 percent to 20 percent. VI. STAFFAPPRAISAL 43. In the period 1991-97, Guyana improved its growth performance noticeably by reducing financial imbalances and implementing major structural reforms aimed at increasing efficiency through market-oriented policies. However, beginning in late 1997, Guyana’s economic performances was adversely affected by external shocks, and by policy slippages. In 1998 real GDP declined, the fiscal adjustment was much less than envisaged in the program, and Guyana did not observe several quantitative performance criteria for end- December 1998. 44. The program for 1999 incorporates measures to correct policy slippages that occurred in 1998. In particular, it provides for a reduction in fiscal imbalances and a sizable buildup of bank deposits by the public sector, in part through a slowdown in the growth of public sector wages (a major area of slippage in 1998), steps to improve tax administration, the closing down of a major loss-making public enterprise, and improvements in the operations of the state-owned sugar company. At the same time, monetary policy is being Gghtened and the process of structural reform is being intensified particularly in the areas of tariff reduction, financial sector restructuring, civil service reform, and divestment. 45. Revenue measures to be introduced in 1999 include an increase in the customs valuation exchange rate and improvements in tax administration by establishing the Revenue Authority by end-May 1999. As regards tlie former, the staff recommends that the authorities move to bring the customs valuation exchange rate in line with the prevailing market rate by no later than the 2000 budget. This would be one of the issues to be reviewed at the time of the discussions for the second annual ESAF arrangement scheduled for mid-1999. The authorities have requested technical assistance from FAD for conducting a comprehensive tax study, including the feasibility of introducing the value-added tax, to strengthen the tax base and revenue collection. “The modification refers to a proposal to exclude external grants from the definition of the net borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector.

Public sector wage policy is critical to the success of the 1999 program and the sustainability of the public finances. The program envisages the containment of salary increases for the general body of civil servants to no more than 6 percent compared with an average of 19 percent in 1998. In addition, to help attract and retain qualified personnel, the government will provide larger wage increases for certain selected groups to bring their wages more in line with private sector levels. Over the medium term, limiting the growth of the wage bill will require a faster reduction in the size of the civil service. Accordingly, the statf strongly supports the government’s intention to seek financing from the IDB for a more ambitious civil service rationalization program. 47. The closing down of the state airline has helped reduce pressures on the public finances. The privatization of the electricity company is also critical to strengthening of the public finances in 1999. The staff would urge the authorities to redouble their efforts to privatize the many state corporations that have already been brought to the point of sale. If these efforts are not success&l the government will need to devise strategies (including liquidation) to prevent these enterprises from being a drain on the budget. 48. The 1999 budget envisages a sizable increase in current expenditure on social sectors and civil service reform in line with the Final Document on the HIPC Initiative. The authorities should ensure that the 1999 spending targets for education, health, and poverty alleviation under.the HIPC Initiative are achieved. In particular, they would need to provide for adequate capital and current outlays in the health sector and improve the procurement procedures to avoid bottlenecks in the provision of public service. 49. The program provides for a tight monetary policy in 1999 to ensure that inflation and international reserve objectives are achieved. In this context, the staff welcomes the recent liberalization of the weekly treasury bill auction and the pursuit of a more active open-market operation policy. 50. With the introduction of a new capable management team, the authorities have taken an important step towards strengthening the operations of the large government-owned bank (GNCB) whose weakness could undermine the integrity of the entire banking system. To further strengthen the system, it is crucial that the authorities take steps to enforce prudential regulations and improve bank supervision in line with international standards. The staff strongly supports the authorities’ request for technical assistance from MAE 51. With the implementation of sound financial polices and structural reforms and aided by the floating exchange rate regime, the external current account deficit is projected to decline to under 11 percent of GDP by 2003. This deficit should be financeable by net official capital intlows (already approved or being negotiated) and direct investment. Over the medium term, with the aid of the projected assistance under the HIPC Initiative, the ratio of external debt service payments to exports is projected to fall substantially.

The authorities are urged to enhance their efforts to improve collection and dissemination of economic data to strengthen the monitoring of developments under the program. The staff notes that the authorities are taking steps to deal with the Y2K problems, with assistance form the World Bank. 53. Guyana experienced substantial external shocks in late 1997 and 1998, and the authorities were able to offset partially the adverse effects of these shocks. In 1998 there were policy slippages, but the authorities have cooperated in taking corrective measures to help bring the program back on track. While the program is adequate to achieve the objectives specified, the staff believes that there are risks. Firstly, the domestic political situation, that hampered policy implementation and weakened business climate in 1997-98, has eased, but Guyana continues to face difficult political challenges. Secondly, a major risk is the government’s ability to contain wages as envisaged. The authorities have indicated a commitment to take compensating measures to finance wage overruns. However, given the political difficulty of implementing new tax measures and the limited scope for expenditure cuts in the short run, a sizable wage overrun may be difficult to offset, It is therefore critical to the success of the program that the wage policy be implemented as envisaged. Taking these factors into account, the staff recommends waiver of all unobserved performance criteria for end-1998 and completion of the review under the first annual ESAF arrangement. 54. It is recommend that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - VII.

The main objective of the current IDA assistance strategy is to support the government’s efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth while increasing provision of social services to the poor. Achieving this objective depends on the implementation of structural reforms. This will involve: (i) continuing to improve economic efficiency and encourage economic diversification, in particular in the agriculture ind’services sectors, by mrther strengthening the role of the private sector; (ii) improving the efficiency in delivery of public services, in particular in water, education, and road infrastructure; (iii) fostering social development through increased and better-targeted allocations of public resources in health, education and other social programs; and (iv) ensuring sustainable management of the country’s vast natural wealth, in particular the forest and water resources. 2. In December 1997 the IDA Board approved HIPC assistance to Guyana subject to satisfactory implementation of measures identified in the final HIPC document. Complementing this is the second DA Buyback Operation dealing with commercial creditors, which was approved in October 1998. An H N%o project to alleviate the adverse impact of the drought conditions was also approved in October 1998 and thus far the project is being implemented satisfactorily. Other investment operations will be oriented to rehabilitate essential infrastructure, in particular through private sector participation in the water sector, and increase the quality of and access to basic education, particularly to the poorest. In addition, the IDA would work with the government, the private sector and the local communities, in improving the management of Guyana’s natural resources. A GEF-funded National Protected Areas Project is in advanced stage of preparation but has been delayed by the Amerindian land-titling issues. The current IDA program for both lending and nonlending services identified the preparation of: (i) a small technical assistance loan (TAL) focused on strengthening the reforms in the financial sector and strengthening the privatisation unit to complete the restructuring/privatization of the remaining public entities; (ii) an infrastructure project to rehabilitate the basic facilities in secondary towns; and (iii) technical assistance (TA) for improving environmental management and for improving procurement and project implementation. Should the government move rapidly on reforming the operations of the GUYWA through tariff increases, metering, and private management, the Bank may be willing to consider a followup water project in close collaboration with the British DFID and the European Union. IDB would like to take the lead role in civil service reform and IDA staff are coordinating with IDB in this area. A participatory country assistance strategy paper builds on the ongoing National Development Strategy and is to be prepared with the active collaboration of the government, the Georgetown based bilateral agencies and the local NGOs. This is now expected to be completed by July 1999. 3. After an understanding was reached in December 1997 between the IFC and Government, the IFC has stepped up its support to Guyana. It is participating in a merchant bank and is willing to support private sector participation in tourism and manufacturing.

IDB assistance to Guyana started in 1976 and is directed toward redefining the role of the state and to encourage private sector development in the context of rehabilitating infra- structure, developing human resources, reducing poverty, and protecting the environment. By 1998 the IDB had approved a total of US%621 million in loans and over 80 technical assistance projects amounting to about US$44 million. DB lending in Guyana focuses on areas that lead to significant policy reforms, institutional development, and improved delivery of public services. Adjustment lending will continue to focus on improving the public sector and environment for private sector development. Project lending will be in education, health, energy, natural resources management, Cuther infrastructure rehabilitation, and public sector reforms. 2. Since 1990, I I operations have been approved for the equivalent of US$3 18.2 million, of which USS200.6 million was undisbursed as of February 1999 (below).

Although Guyana provides the core minimum data needed for surveillance, there are deficiencies with respect to quality, timeliness, and coverage-particularly in the areas of national accounts, public finance, and balance of payments-that hamper a more comprehensive assessment of economic developments. The Fund and bilateral donors have provided a significant amount of technical assistance in the recent past, but lack of counterpart resources and poor coordination between agencies have limited the improvement. National accounts The authorities recently provided revised national accounts series through 1997 (formerly, only data through 1995 were available, and these were only partial). However, considerable work is still required to strengthen the national accounts, including completion of the Bureau of Statistics’ (BOS) register of enterprises and improvement in response rates for business surveys Prices From July 1989 through December 1994, because of concerns about the unrepresentativeness of available weights, no official consumer price index (CPI) was published. Since January 1994, a new index has been compiled by the BOS, based on weights derived from a household income and expenditure survey (HIPS) and prices collected in the Georgetown area. This series will shortly be published in Internaiiond Financial Stutistics. Government finance The June 1998 GFS mission was a follow-up to a 1993 STA multisector mission, which expressed concerns about the classification of government transactions and the need to resume GFS reporting. A 1997 MAE mission found substantial weaknesses in the public accounting system and inconsistencies in monetary and fiscal data. The 1998 GFS mission found significant deficiencies in the fiscal data. In particular, the mission found that (i) there is a lack of clarity and documentation regarding compilation procedures and available fiscal data, (ii) annual data, which (unliie monthly fiscal data sent to WHD) covered all budgetary transactions, had significant statistical discrepancies, (iii) budgetary central government data reported monthly for Fund monitoring purposes covered only revenue and expenditure transactions, (iv) some budgetary central government data were not collected on a cash basis, and the procedures for recording transactions were Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - ATTACHMENT V deficient, and (v) the Accountant General permitted unwarranted flexibility in the recording of transactions. The mission outlined a plan of action aimed at improving the compilation and reporting of these data. The plan called for, in the near term, improved reporting of GFS aggregates on the budgetary central government on the basis of improvements in the data base, reclassifications of transactions, and adjustments identified during the mission. Work needs to be undertaken ,in 1999 on compiling and reporting of consolidated data on the budgetary and social security subsectors. The plan, calling for the subsequent compilation of GFS data, explained that the timing for compiling GFS would depend on additional resources to ensure an adequate data * base, on the extent of institutional coverage and detail of compiled GFS data, and on the priority given to the work by the authorities. Monetary accounts Most of the recommendations relating to monetary statistics made by the 1993 multisector mission have been implemented, but coverage is yet to be extended to include credit unions and pension funds. The coverage will need to be reviewed in light of the new Financial Institutions Act. In addition, the coverage of nonfinancial public enterprises in the monetary statistics would have to be reviewed and updated by the authorities to reflect the privatization process which is part of the structural reforms that have been implemented in Guyana. Balance of payments The Fund assigned a balance of payments advisor to the BOG during June 1995-June 1996 to assist in establishing a compilation system for balance of payments statistics according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments A4anuul. This was followed by a technical assistance mission from November 2%December 13, 1996. The mission was in response to the need to lend further support to the Bank of Guyana (BOG) to implement the enterprise-based survey approach for compilation of BOP statistics. The authorities have made some progress in implementing the recommendations contained in the Advisor’s final report of July 19, 1996. However, BOP data in the &dunce of Puyments Yearbook is only available through 1995. The BOG Act of 1998 has designated the BOG as the official compiler of BOP statistics and has empowered the BOG to collect all data relevant for BOP purposes. A BOP unit has been created in the BOG Research Department and a BOP standing committee, chaired by the Governor, has been set up and has met four times. However, the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) will maintain its own in-house capacity for BOP compilation, as it views the BOP as an integral part of the national accounts, Deficiencies with the ASYCUDA system have not yet been resolved, and therefore, the BOS has not replaced its own system for processing customs data with the ASYCUDA system.

In accordance with the provisions of the arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) of July 15, 1998, and our letter of intent of June 12, 1998, the Government of Guyana with the cooperation of the staff of the International Monetary Fund, has examined developments under the economic and financial program adopted for 1998/99, in the context of the review under the first annual ESAF arrangement. In this letter, the Government of Guyana seeks to: (i) inform you of developments in 1998; (ii) present the broad outline of its medium-term macroeconomic program and the details of the program for 1999; and (iii) request a waiver for nonobservance of the end- 1998 performance criteria. 2. For nearly a decade, Guyana has been implementing.economic and financial reforms aimed at reducing the macroeconomic imbalances that emerged during the 1980s. Over the period, Guyana has made significant progress towards achieving sustainable growth, improving living standards, and reducing domestic and external imbalances. The turnaround was anchored around adjustment programs that laid the foundation for a market-based economy. With the aid of these programs, economic efficiency was enhanced by the removal of price controls, the simplification of the tariff structure, liberalisation of external trade, and the rationalisation of government operations through expenditure controls, tax reform and privatisation. The financial sector has been strengthened mainly through the enactment of a Financial Institutions Act; the enactment of a new Bank of Guyana Act; and the repeal of the Exchange Control Act. 3. The government privatised or liquidated more than 20 public enterprises during 1989-97. In 1998 and earlier this year, the government brought to the point of sale the national airline, the electricity company, two bauxite companies, and five other firms. During 1989-97, the government also significantly restructured its holdings in the financial sector through the privatisation and liquidation of five out of seven entities. The sixth has already been brought to the point of sale and the only other government-owned financial institution (GNCB) is in the process of being restructured. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - ATTACHMENT VI 4. During 1991-97 real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 7 percent, inflation was reduced from over 100 percent to 3% percent, and the exchange rate was stabilised. The public sector deficit (before grants) was reduced from over J5 percent of GDP in 1991 to 3 percent of GDP in 1996 and the external position improved substantially, with the current account deficit narrowing from 47 percent of GDP in 1991 to 9 percent of GDP in 1996. Gross official international reserves increased from the equivalent of 3% months of imports of goods and nonfactor services to over five months during the same period. 5. Beginning in late 1997 and continuing through 1998, Guyana experienced a temporary setback which has slowed growth, significantly reduced revenue collection, increased the public sector defidit, and widened the external current account deficit. The main factors behind this setback were: (i) the adverse effects of the drought associated with El Nifio; (ii) the sharp reduction in demand for and prices of Guyana’s major export commodities; and (iii) political uncertainties arising from the December 1997 general elections that disrupted economic activity and investment. Despite these difftculties, the government persevered with implementing sound economic policies. While economic growth turned negative in 1998, the inflation target was achieved, and the public sector deficit (before grants) was reduced by 4 percentage points of GDP to 5 percent of GDP. The programme had envisaged a larger reduction to 2 percent of GDP. The government completed most of the policy reforms under the programme. I. DEVELOPMENTS IN 1998 6. The economy was much weaker than expected in 1998, with real GDP declining by 1% percent (compared with a growth of 3 percent assumed in the programme), primarily due to the adverse effects of El Nifio, weaker demand in Asian markets, and domestic political uncertainties. However, the inflation target was achieved, with consumer prices rising by 4% percent. 7. Due to the unexpected decline in economic activity and domestic political disturbances, public sector revenues fell from 36% percent of GDP in 1997 to 35% percent of GDP in 1998. The scope for expenditure reduction is limited by the high debt-service burden and by the need to improve infrastructure and provide for basic health, education, and poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, public expenditure was reduced from 45 percent of GDP in 1997 to 40% percent of GDP in 1998 (compared with 42 percent in the programme), as capital outlays were curtailed and interest payment obligations fell. Wage increases were higher than anticipated in the budget. Nevertheless, the wage bill remained within budgeted ceilings, mainly because a part of the increase became effective in the second half of the year, funds budgeted for staffing the Revenue Authority were not used, and employment in the civil service was reduced. Operating balances of the public enterprises were lower than programmed mainly due to lower economic activity and technical problems in the airline and bauxite companies. Capital expenditure declined from 18 percent of GDP in 1997 to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - ATTACHMENT VI 14% percent of GDP in 1998, largely due to a slower implementation of externally financed projects. 8. Despite the very difficult external circumstances, the government was able to reduce the overall deficit of the public sector (before grants) from about 9 percent of GDP in 1997 to 5 percent of GDP in 1998 (compared to 2 percent envisaged in the program, Table 2). However, the overall public sector deficit (after grants) increased from 3 percent of GDP in’ 1997 to 3% percent of GDP in 1998 reflecting the decline in programmed grants. Due to the higher than programmed deficit and a substantial shortfall in external financing, the public sector’s recourse to domestic financing (principally through a drawdown of central bank deposits) in 1998 was about 1% percent of GDP compared with a piogrammed decline m net domestic indebtedness of 7% percent of GDP. The Bank of Guyana was able to keep the gro,wth of currency in circulation below program targets by reducing its holding of international reserves. 9. As regards the balance of payments, a decline in exports (due to lower export prices and the adverse effects ofEZ Nir?o) was virtually offset’by lower imports (due to lower oil prices and domestic demand), and the external current account deficit narrowed slightly. However, net capital inflows were much less than projected because of technical delays in disbursement in balance of payments loans from the multilateral institutions. Consequently, net and gross international reserve targets of the Bank of Guyana were not observed. 10. The Guyana dollar depreciated from G$144 per U.S. dollar at end-1997 to G$165 per U.S. dollar at end-1998, and remained under pressure in early 1999. The Bank of Guyana intervened over. the course of the year to help maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market. In an effort to tighten liquidity and ease exchange market pressures in January 1999, the government increased the volume of treasury bills sold and eliminated the collar on bid prices in the weekly treasury bill auction. 11. In 1998 the government carried out substantial structural reforms in the public sector and took steps to strengthen the financial sector and improve the business environment. Specifically, the restructuring of the ministry of finance and the review of the public service rules (the two structural performance criteria under the first annual ESAF arrangement) were completed. Several public enterprises were brought to the point of sale and agreement was reached on a strategic plan (which is being put in action) to improve the operations of the state-owned sugar company (GUYSUCO). Financial sector reforms in 1998 and early 1999 included: (i) the passage of legislation to reorganize and recapitalize the Bank of Guyana and the transfer of bilateral non-Paris Club foreign debt from the bank to the central government; (ii) a reduction in commercial banks’ legal reserve requirement from an average of 15 percent to 12 percent (effective February 1, 1999); (iii) the signing of a contract to install a new management team in the state-owned Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB) in January, 1999; and (iv) passage of legislation to improve the regulation of the insurance and securities sectors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - ATTACHMENT Vl 12. Social sector spending by the central government was increased from 8% percent in 1997 to 9% percent of GDP in 1998, which was % percentage point more than anticipated in the Final Document on the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). However, the subtarget for spending on health was not met mainly because of inadequate storage and. transportation facilities for drugs in rural areas and a slow procurement procedure. To strengthen the government’s capacity to spend the programmed increase in social sector spending effectively, the government will streamline procurement procedures and contract out more services. 13. In addition to increasing resources, the government also improved its delivery of social services. The government began to restructure the Ministry of Education, and trained over 500 teachers and 1000 youth. Restructuring of the Health Ministry was also initiated by providing greater autonomy to the General Hospital and rationalizing several health care centers. In addition, copayments were introduced for some dental, orthopedic, physiotherapy, laboratory and pharmaceutical services, and patients seeking private hospital rooms. The government prepared a poverty map and supported several important community development projects, The externally financed Social Impact Amelioration Program and Basic Needs Trust Fund continued to work with civic organizations to reduce poverty. 14. Due to the difficulties described above, the following quantitative performance criteria for end-December 1998 were not observed: (1) the ceiling on the net borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector and the,subceiling on the net domestic borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector; (2) the limit on the increase in the net domestic assets of the Bank of Guyana; and (3) the target for the increase in the net foreign assets of the Bank of Guyana and the subtarget for the increase in the gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana. We respectfully request that Guyana’s nonobservance of the above performance criteria for end-December be waived. II. MEDMVGTERM FRAMEWORK 15. The revised medium-term economic programme takes into account recent developments and a less favorable external environment. Real GDP growth is expected to begin to recover in 1999 and to pick up to 3%-4 percent in 2001-03 (see Table 1). After a slight rise in 1999, the rate of inflation is targeted to fall steadily to 3 percent by 2003 with the aid of a restrictive monetary policy. The programme envisages a sustained reduction in the public sector deficit (after grants) over the medium term which would permit a steady decline in the ratio of public debt to GDP. The external current account deficit is projected to increase slightly in 1999 before declining over the medium term. This, combined with HIPC relief, would allow the ratio of external debt service to exports to fall from 19 percent in 1998 to 8 % percent by 2003. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - ATTACHMEtiT VI m. PROGRAMME FOR 1999 16. The programme for 1999 assumes real GDP growth of about 2 percent and envisages a temporary increase in intlation to 5% percent mainly due to.the recent currency depreciation. The external current account deficit will increase slightly to 14 percent of GDP and gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana will be maintained at about 4% months of imports. The programme emphasises structural reforms in the areas of privatization, civil service, and the financial sector. In addition, social sector programmes Will be expanded in accordance with the programme supported by the HI& Initiative. 17. Fiscal policy for 1999 will aim at reducing the overall public sector deficit (after grants) to 3 percent of GDP. The deficit will be more than covered by the already committed concessional external loans which, together with the projected net proceeds from privatisation, would allow for a substantial buildup of public sector deposits in the banking system. To ensure achievement of the fiscal targets, the government intends to monitor public sector finances closely and will take additional measures as needed to achieve the fiscal objectives. 18. Public sector revenue is projected to increase by % percent of GDP in 1999. To help ensure that the projected revenue is realized, the government intends’to increase the customs valuation exchange rate by 7% percent on April 30, 1999 (estimated .yield of 0.7 percent of GDP) and establish the new Revenue Authority by end-May, 1999 (estimated yield of 0.5 percent of GDP mainly consisting of tax arrears not collected in 1998). Other measures include limiting tax concessions (and increasing their transparency) under recently passed legislation and improving cost recovery policies in the water sector. Furthermore, the operating surplus of the public enterprises is expected to rise from 4% percent of GDP in 1998 to 5 percent of GDP in 1999, largely due to the recovery in production and export volumes of sugar and bauxite, favorable impact of the recent currency depreciation on export earnings, cost containment and the privatization of loss making Guyana Airways and Guyana Electricity Corporation in 1999. 19. Public sector expenditure is targeted to rise from 40% percent of GDP in 1998 to 44% percent of GDP in 1999 before falling back steadily over the medium term (see Table 2). The rise in expenditure would reflect largely the additional costs of social sector spending and civil service reform under the programme supported by the HIPC Initiative. Interest payments also are projected to rise due to the tighter monetary stance. Capital outlays on infrastructure and modemization of the sugar sector will be increased. 20. The assistance provided under the HIPC Initiative would permit a much-needed increase in social spending. The 1999 budget increases allocations for social spending to around 10% percent of GDP from 9% percent of GDP in 1998. Budgetary allocations in relation to GDP are maintained at 5% percent for education, but are increased to over 5 percent (from 4 percent in 1998) for health and poverty alleviation programmes. To ensure that the subtarget for spending on health is achieved, allocations for transportation and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - ATTACHMENT VI storage of drugs have been increased. In addition, the procurement procedures are being modified, and will be further improved under the new legislation that will be tabled in Parliament by June 1999. With assistance from the UNDP, the government has initiated a survey of living conditions, which is expected to be completed by September 1999. The World Bank and IDB also are continuing to provide assistance in the social sectors. 21. As envisaged in the Final Document on the HIPC Initiative, the 1999 central government wage bill will include an allocation for a new remuneration structure for key posts in the civil service. The new structure would seek to bring wages for skilled personnel more in line with those of the private sector and hopehilly help to relieve the serious staff shortages that currently exist. With external technical assistance, the government has begun to design the new remuneration structure, which is expected to be completed when the ongoing 1999 wage negotiations are concluded. The government is committed to keeping the wage bill (including the cost of the new remuneration structure) at the level set in the programme. Further, the government will continue its current policy of allowing a gradual attrition, which given historical attrition rates, should reduce central government employment by around 3 percent in 1999. 22. The overall public sector deficit would be reduced further by 1% percentage points of GDP over the medium term, declining to about I % percent of GDP by 2003. Revenues are projected to remain approximately constant as a percent of GDP (primarily due to the increased profitability of the three remaining state enterprises). In this context, the government will continue to improve tax administration, and will seek external technical assistance to make the tax system more efficient, and develop options for offsetting potential revenue loses from tariff cuts in a future Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. Public sector expenditures would be restrained to achieve a reduction of around 4 percentage points of GDP between 1999 and 2003. 23. Monetary policy will be guided by the need to achieve the international reserve and inflation targets, while fostering stability in the foreign exchange market. The monetary programme will seek to keep gross international reserves at 4% months of imports (IJS$285 million). While making allowances for normal seasonal variations, the Bank of Guyana intends to keep currency in circulation largely unchanged during the year with the aid of open-market operations. To increase the efficiency of these operations in January 1999, the interest rate ceiling and floor on treasury bill bids were eliminated. Further, in order to increase the attractiveness of domestic assets and develop capital markets, the government intends to start issuing bonds with longer maturities. The growth in broad money is projected to be slower than that of nominal GDP. Given the projected buildup of public sector deposits in the banking system, bank credit to private sector should rise by about 12 percent. 24. The government intends to carry out several important structural reforms in 1999 in order to increase private sector participation in the economy and improve the efficiency of the public sector (Table 4). GUYSUCO’s operations will be further modernised, with a view to reducing costs and improving competitiveness.‘Steps are already being taken to rationalise the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - ATTACHMEtiT VI company through the amalgamation of management of contiguous estates. By September 1999, the government expects to reach agreement with the GUYSUCO on the scope and financing of its medium-term capital programme. In consultation with the United Nations Development Program and International Labor Organization, the government intends to complete the periodic actuarial review of the National Insurance Scheme, and implement the recommendations of the review. Finally, the government will soon table new procurement legislation, which will enhance transparency and facilitate faster project implementation. 25. By the beginning of last year, the government had sold nominancial public enterprises that accounted for more than 60 percent of the total net assets held by the government in 1989-90. By end-1999, the government aims to privatize all public enterprises with the exception of three nonfinancial enterprises (Guyoil, Guyana National Shipping, and GUYSUCO) and the GNCB. Consistent with this objective, nine public enterprises were brought to the point of sale in 1998 and early 1999:These include two bauxite companies, the national airline, and the electricity corporation. The airline is expected to be sold soon. The negotiations for the sale of the state-owned electricity company are at an advanced stage, and the sale is expected to be completed in the first half of 1999. The government would intensify its efforts to sell the remaining enterprises that are currently advertised for sale. 26. In the financial sector, as previously noted, a new international management team has been installed for,GNCB. For the first three months ofthe team’s tenure, the bank will have a restrictive credit policy. At the end of the three months, the team will submit a report indicating steps it will take to improve GNCB’s finances, particularly through the strengthening of credit procedures, and increasing collections of arrears. By the end of 1999, the team will prepare a report analysing various options for the GNCB, including maintaining state ownership, privatisation, and liquidation, The government will take decisions on the future of the bank within two months after receiving the report from the new management team. 27. Of&es of insurance and securities regulation will be established to implement recently passed legislation. To improve administration and provide a more diverse range of collateral, the government will make the Deeds Registry an autonomous agency (following the recent passage of necessary legislation), table legislation on bankable property rights, and also increase the transfer of government-owned land through the conversion of lease-holds to free- holds, sales, and long-term leases. Furthermore, the government intends to reduce the maximumimport tariff rate under the CARICOM Common External Tariff from 25 percent to 20 percent by end-April, 1999. 28. As to the other issues, the government remains committed to the pursuit of appropriate environmental protection policies and will seek passage of recently tabled legislation to regulate the manufacture and use of pesticides. The government will continue efforts to improve data collection and data dissemination, and will consider making economic and financial data available on the Internet. The World Bank is providing technical and financial assistance to help develop a strategy to deal with the year 2000 computer problem. A Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59 - ATTACHMENT VI national committee has been working to create awareness of the problem, and the ministry of finance, in particular, is seeking external assistance to stem the likely payroll interruption that could result from the computer failure. IV. PROGRAMMEMONITORING 29. In order to help monitor progress in the implementation of the programme, quantitative targets, and structural benchmarks have been established for March and June . 1999 (see Technical Memorandum of Understanding and Table 5). The central government revenue and expenditure and the operations of the public enterprises will continue to be monitored on a monthly basis, and the relevant monthly data will continue to be provided to the Fund with a lag of one month. Further, the implementation of the 1999 programme will be assessed again during the discussions (scheduled for mid-1999) for the program to be supported by the second annual ESAF arrangement. These discussions would focus on fiscal performance, progress in the reforms of the public enterprises and civil service, compliance with the HIPC programme targets for the social sector spending, and the reform of the financial sector. 30. The Government of Guyana believes that the policies set forth in this letter are adequate to achieve the objectives of the programme, but will take any further measures that may be appropriate for this purpose. During the programme period, the government will consult with the Fund on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at the initiative of the government or the Fund. Moreover, the Government of Guyana will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with Guyana’s progress in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the programme.

This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets forth the definitions of the variables used in quantifying the targets and benchmarks, and explains the adjustors to these targets and benchmarks. The limits and targets referred to in the letter dated April 27, 1999 are cumulative from December 3 1, 1998. 2. All data for monitoring developments under the Fund supported programme will be sent by facsimile or electronic mail within four weeks from the end of the relevant month or quarter. The Guyanese authorities will send through the ministry of finance monthly information on the operations of the public sector as specified in section C below, as well as the information on the monetary sector reported by the Bank of Guyana, main macroeconomic indicators reported by the Bureau of Statistics, and external debt as reported by the ministry of finance. In addition, timely information will be provided to the Fund on economic and financial measures taken by the government and changes in legislation, including laws approved by the Parliament and other key economic agencies. A. Quantitative Targets 3. The net&reign assets of the Bunk of Guyana (BOG) are defined as the gross international reserves of the BOG less current short- and medium-term external liabilities, rescheduled external liabilities, and (if any) external payments arrears of the BOG. Non-US. dollar reserve assets and liabilities are converted into U.S. dollars at the cross-exchange rate prevailing on December 3 1, 1998 except for the U.S. dollar/SDR rate which is assumed at US.81.4080 = SDR 1. 4. The net domestic assets of the BOG are defined as currency held outside the Bank of Guyana less net foreign assets of the BOG (as defined in paragraph 3 above) converted into Guyana dollars at the agreed accounting exchange rate.’ 5. The nonfinancialpublic sector (NFPS) comprises the central government, the National Insurance Scheme, the nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises and companies in which the government owns more than 50 percent of the shares), and the Guyana National Energy Authority (GNEA). The 1999 programme excludes from NFPS the following: Guyana Airways Corporation, Guyana Electricity Corporation, Guyana National Printer Limited, and Guyana Pharmaceutical Corporation. The total net borrowing requirement of the NFPS (NBR) is defined as the sum of: (i) net external financing (paragraph 6); and (ii) the net domestic borrowing by NFPS (paragraph 7). ‘The average accounting rates are as follows: for July-September 1998 US%l=G%147.30; October-December 1998 US%l=G$148.40; January-March 1999 US$l=G%170.00; and April-June 1999 US$l=G!fi165.00. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - ANNEX I . 6. Net erternalfinuncing is defined as the sum of the monthly net loan inflows in foreign currencies (as reported by the ministry of finance) to the NFPS converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction. Net flows in foreign currencies to the NFPS are defined as the sum of loan disbursements (including suppliers’ credit), less scheduled principal payments (including payments on suppliers’ credit), plus principal and interest payments rescheduled or forgiven in the period. 7. The net domestic borrowing requirement by NFPS is the sum of (i) the change in the stock of domestic debt of the NFPS; (ii) net receipts from divestment; (iii) the change in domestic or external arrears of the NFPS; and (iv) the float. The change in the domestic debt ofNFPS consists of changes in the net credit extended by the domestic financial system to the NFPS (as reported by the BOG), and changes in the stock of treasury bills, debentures, and defense bonds held by the nonfinancial private sector (as reported by the BOG). The domestic finuncial system includes the BOG, the commercial banks, and the nonfinancial intermediaries (building societies, trust funds, insurance companies, and insurance schemes). Net credit by the domesticfinancial system is defined as the sum of net credit (credit minus deposits) of the BOG; commercial banks’ advances and loans minus deposits (including PL480 counter- part funds); net credit by the nonfinancial institutions; and the change in the stock of treasury bills, debentures, and defense bonds held by the domestic financial system except for special debentures issued by the treasury to cover unrealized foreign exchange losses of the BOG and provisions for bad loans of the Guyana National Cooperative Bank. ,Treasury bills will be recorded at face value, except for those held by the banking system which will be recorded on a purchase price basis. 8. Changes in the externulpayments arreurs of thepublic sector will be defined as the difference between the external scheduled debt service of the public sector that has fallen due and actual debt service as reported by the ministry of finance and the BOG less amounts programmed to be rescheduled, forgiven, or in dispute. Scheduled debt-service obligations are defined as projected scheduled principal and interest obligations on outstanding debt, including rescheduled debt and debt arrears plus projected principal and interest on new debt to be contracted. For purposes of the limit on arrears, thepublic sector is defined to include the NFPS Tas defined in paragraph 5) and the BOG. IO. Contractual debt service not paid following the signing of respective bilateral agreements with creditors and normalization of debt to other creditors (including OPEC, the IFC, and CDC) will be considered to be in arrears. 11. Nonconcessionalpublic undpublicly guaranteed external borrowing is defined for this purpose as loans with a grant element of less than 35 percent, calculated on the basis of currency-specific discount rates based on OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs). The CIRRs to be applied should reflect IO-year averages for credits with a maturity of more Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - ANNEX1 . than 15 years, and 6-month averages for credits with shorter maturities., The margins added to these average rates are 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15-19 years, 1.15 percent for 20-29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. Where a ClRR is not available for a given currency or time period, a rate based on five-year government bond yields in the currency concerned may be used as proxy. The limit excludes the contracting of short-term import related credits, the use of Fund resources, and refinancing operations. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt is defined to include debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector as defined in paragraph 11. B. Adjustors to Quantitative Targets 12. The limit on the to&d net borrowing requirement of the NFPS will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount that the NFPS scheduled interest payments on external debt falls short of (exceeds) the programmed interest payments. 13. The required increase in the BOG gross and net foreign assets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount that external amortization paid by the nonfinancial public sector falls short of (exceeds) the external amortization payments incorporated in the program. 14. The limit on the net borrowing requirement of the NFPS will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount that project loan disbursement exceeds (falls short ot) the programmed disbursements ofUS$[7.9] million during January-March 1999, and US%[ 15.81 million during January-June 1999. 15. The required increases in the net foreign assets and gross international reserves of the BOG will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount that the cumulative disbursements of nonproject loans exceed (falls short of) the programmed amounts. Similarly, the net domestic borrowing of the NFPS will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of the shortfall (excess) in nonproject loan disbursement, The required NFA and gross reserves wiU not be adjusted downward and domestic borrowing of NFPS upward by the amount that the cumulative disbursements of nonproject loans fall short of the programmed amounts, except in cases where the shortfall was due to factors other than the nonimplementation of the associated policy conditions. 16. The net domestic assets of the BOG will be revised downward (upward) by the Guyana dollar equivalent of any upward (downward) adjustment in the net foreign assets of the BOG. 17. The turgets for the netforeign ussets and gross internllrionul reserves of the BOG will be adjusted taking into account the bilateral agreements with bilateral creditors following the stock-of-debt operation on eligible debt of the BOG, the settlement of External Payments Deposits Scheme, the restructuring of commercial debt in arrears, and the transfer of external liabilities to the central government.
