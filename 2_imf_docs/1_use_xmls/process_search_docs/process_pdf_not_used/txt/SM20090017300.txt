Economic developments and outlook  Turkmenistan has remained relatively unscathed by the financial crisis and the ensuing global recession, owing to its limited exposure to international financial markets and the rising contractual price of its gas exports. Fiscal and external balances have continued to grow, allowing for a sizeable increase in public investment that in turn fuelled non-hydrocarbon growth. Inflation is declining, as international food prices and tariff rates drop and exchange rate restrictions ease. The outlook appears very favorable, with risks emerging only from external shocks that can reduce the price and volume of its gas exports.   Views of the authorities  Following the success of the exchange rate unification and currency redenomination, the authorities intend to continue their gradual move to a more market-oriented economy. They remain committed to keeping inflation low by targeting a stable exchange rate, increasing access to foreign currency and keeping administered prices unchanged this year. To modernize the legal framework, work is ongoing to overhaul the central bank and commercial banks laws, foreign currency regulation, and budget legislation. The authorities will support the country’s economic development by various means, including by boosting infrastructure investment and maintaining policy directed lending to selected sectors.   Staff recommendations  • The peg to the US dollar should be maintained.  It provides a strong nominal anchor and helps build trust in the new currency. In the long-term, a more flexible arrangement should be considered. • Restrictions in the foreign exchange market can be eased further, and more responsibility for monitoring compliance with regulations should be moved to banks. • The current low inflation environment provides a good opportunity to adjust administered prices. • Public investment spending should be consolidated in the central budget, to capture better the magnitude of the fiscal stimulus and monitor its effectiveness.  • Policy directed lending operations should be transferred to the budget, to allow the central bank to implement monetary policy independently. •  Planned financial sector reforms should proceed more decisively, by accelerating the adoption of the IFRS and the set up of  a framework for the issuance of negotiable certificates of deposits.

Highly dependent on its hydrocarbon resources, Turkmenistan has only recently started a gradual transition to a more market-oriented economy. Largely state controlled, the oil and gas sector drives the economy.1 Backed by booming hydrocarbon revenue, the government engaged in wide social reforms covering pensions, education, and health in early 2007. To complement social reforms and raise living standards, economic reforms started in earnest in 2008 with the unification of the exchange rate, trade liberalization measures, and efforts to encourage private sector development.  2.      Turkmenistan has remained relatively shielded from the world financial crisis and the ensuing global recession. This is explained by the country’s limited exposure to international financial markets, a negligible external debt, and strong fiscal and external balances. Moreover, starting in 2009, the upward revised contractual price for gas export to Russia is expected to boost further the country’s fiscal revenues and external reserves.  3.      This benign outlook and comfortable financial position provide a great opportunity to deepen and accelerate economic reforms. Building on last year’s progress, the 2009 Article IV consultation discussions focused on policies to strengthen the foreign exchange market and the monetary framework, develop a more commercially oriented financial sector, and improve public financial management.  Implementation of Fund Policy Advice Since Last Article IV Consultation Make foreign exchange readily accessible for current account transactions to support the exchange rate unification. Implemented Start developing the foreign exchange market by issuing new regulations facilitating access to foreign exchange; reactivating the inter-bank foreign exchange market; and extending the network of exchange bureaus. Implemented Phase-in administered price increases, including by  adjusting prices for the pass-through of the exchange rate unification.  Not implemented.  Expand the  budgetary coverage of government operations. Partly  implemented. The 2009 budget  includes several projects previously undertaken off-budget. Monetary policy should support the exchange rate as a nominal anchor, and central bank  directed credit should be phased out.  Not implemented  Undertake reforms to deepen the financial sector Reforms have started in some areas.                                                  1 In 2004–08, hydrocarbons contributed about 30 percent of GDP, 84 percent of exports, and 56 percent of budget revenue. The country’s large gas reserves are becoming increasingly important for Eurasian energy importers.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  5  II.   BACKGROUND A.   Developments and Outlook in 2008 and 2009  4.      Economic conditions remain favorable, notwithstanding the global economic crisis. Growth reached 10 ½ percent in 2008, fuelled by large public investments in construction and infrastructure and high activity in transportation, communication, and retail. A three-month interruption in gas exports to Iran led to negative hydrocarbon sector growth Inflation peaked at 18.9 percent in July 2008, reflecting price adjustments for petroleum products and transportation, high international food prices, and some impact of the May 2008 unification of the exchange rate. By year-end, inflation moderated to 9 percent, due to declining international food prices, cuts in tariff rates, and improved access to foreign exchange that facilitated access to competitively priced imports.  -327121722200420052006200720082009 proj.Total GDP Hydrocarbon GDPNon hydrocarbon GDPReal  Growth(In percent)Despite some moderation growth will remain robust5.      Growth is projected to decelerate but remain strong in 2009, while inflation is expected to decline to the low single digits. Overall growth is projected at 8 percent. Strong activity in construction, telecommunications, and transportation—mainly linked to the large-scale government rural development and infrastructure projects—should continue to drive non-hydrocarbon growth. If the final impact of a controversial interruption of gas imports by Russia is limited to a loss of two-weeks of gas exports, as anticipated by the authorities, hydrocarbon GDP could grow by about 4 percent. A stable exchange rate, low import prices, and a more liberal trade regime resulted in negative inflation in the first quarter of 2009. With low international food prices and no plans for administered price adjustments, end-year inflation is projected at 4 percent.  -50510152025Mar. 2007Sept. 2007Mar. 2008Sept. 2008Mar. 2009Sept. 2009Proj.Inflation(In percent, 12 month change)After falling significantly, inflation would remain low Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  6  6.      Imports accelerated sharply, but the current account surplus continued to expand, reaching 18 ¾ percent of GDP in 2008. Higher oil and gas prices prompted a 20 percent increase in export receipts in 2008. Meanwhile, imports of goods and services were boosted by rising domestic demand and easier access to foreign exchange, following the May 2008 unification of the exchange rate. FDI inflows, mainly in off-shore oil operations in the Caspian Sea, also increased. International reserves reached US$16.7 billion (22 months of 2009 projected imports). The 2009 current account surplus is expected to climb to 27 percent of GDP, as the average contractual price for gas exports converges to the European level. Booming export receipts would more than offset a further rapid increase in imports. International reserves, projected at US$ 22 ½ billion, would exceed total GDP. 051015202530200420052006200720082009 proj.Reserves in months of importsReserves in US$ Millionallowing for a large accumulation of official reserves020406080100200420052006200720082009 proj.Current account balance (in percent of GDP)Exports of goods and services (in percent of GDP)Imports of goods and services (in percent of GDP)The current account surplus continues to grow7.      The state budget surplus for 2008 overshot its target by a large margin, while the estimated overall fiscal surplus climbed to about one third of GDP.2 A strong revenue performance and the underexecution of investments resulted in a state budget surplus of 11 ¼ percent of GDP, against an objective of 4.6 percent. High oil and gas prices and the valuation effect from the unification of the exchange rate boosted hydrocarbon revenues. Streamlined tax and customs procedures raised revenue collection efficiency and the buoyancy of non-hydrocarbon revenues. Current expenditure was close to the target. However, an overly ambitious investment budget—scaled up sevenfold in the 2008 budget compared with the 2007 outturn—was less than half executed, reflecting limited capacity and bottlenecks in implementation. On the basis of incomplete information, staff estimates the additional  surplus from extrabudgetary operations at about 24 percent of GDP.  01020304050200420052006200720082009 proj.100150200250300350Fiscal surplus (in percent of GDP, LHS) 1/Budgetary surplus (in percent of GDP, LHS)Hydrocarbon revenue index ( 100=2004, RHS)1/ Staff's estimate.Rising hydrocarbon revenues continue to drive the budget and the overall fiscal surpluses.                                                 2 Large valuation effects from the unification of the exchange rate and higher hydrocarbon export prices underpin these developments.

Based on conservative revenue assumptions and optimistic capital spending plans, the budget entails a surplus of 4 percent of GDP. 3 A 10 percent wage and pension increase, and high spending on new social programs will be fully implemented, but the execution of a planned threefold increase in capital expenditures will again confront capacity constraints. The incorporation in the budget of some existing off-budget projects, though, would help achieve a higher rate of execution. Staff thus projects a budget surplus of 11 percent of GDP. The overall fiscal surplus would again be much higher (34 percent of GDP), with extrabudgetary savings mostly reflected in the projected accumulation of assets in the Foreign Exchange Reserves Fund (FERF).  -10010203040506020042005200620072008 est.2009 proj.Capital expenditure (in percent of GDP)Current expenditure (in percent of GDP)Budgetary expenditure (change in percent)Budget spending is rising fast, also reflecting wider coverage of investment spending.9.      Progress with widening the scope and transparency of government operations and setting fiscal policy in the context of a medium-term framework were mixed. The state budget remains an inadequate gauge of the fiscal stance, as a large part of government operations is undertaken off-budget. With assistance from the EU, the ministry of finance has completed the drafting of a budget code that entails a medium-term framework approach, expands the coverage of the budget, and increases its transparency. However, the preparation of needed complementary legal and regulatory documents is still pending.  10.      The prioritization of objectives and some operational aspects of the new Stabilization Fund of Turkmenistan (SFT) remain unclear. Established in October 2008, and administered by the ministry of finance, the SFT is endowed with financial savings from past and future state budget surpluses. SFT’s assets are currently lodged in a special treasury account at the Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT). The fund can be used to: provide credit to public sector entities through domestic banks to help counter spillovers from the global recession; implement priority projects identified by the President; and acquire domestic or external financial assets.                                                       3 The budget assumes a gas export price of US$200 per thousand cubic meters, much higher than the average for 2008 (US$140), but significantly below the actual average price during the first quarter of 2009.

Turkmenistan: Initiating Financial Sector Reforms  The May 2008 exchange rate unification set the stage for starting in earnest the reform of the financial sector. In Turkmenistan, formal financial intermediation is very low and banks, mostly state owned, are the only players. The unified exchange rate enabled the revaluing of assets and liabilities and freed up equity for commercial banks. With increased access to foreign exchange and the ability to open correspondent accounts abroad, banks became more involved in the foreign exchange market and expanded trade financing operations.   The smooth introduction of the redenominated manat in January 2009 has been another successful step. While understandable uncertainties regarding the redenomination process might have caused a decline in manat deposits in late 2008, the decline was reversed in 2009. Although the ratio of deposits to GDP remains very low in comparison to other countries in the region, deposits have been increasing in 2009, particularly those in domestic currency.  Building on these achievements, the authorities are now working on several fronts. First, they are developing the infrastructure including the payment system, by upgrading the software and promoting the use of plastic cards. Second, they are encouraging the creation of new saving instruments that could help develop an interbank credit market. Third, they are strengthening supervision by promoting the move to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and supporting their introduction in two pilot banks. Last, they are overhauling banking laws and regulations.   However, the authorities remain cautious in addressing the issue of government-directed lending to strategic sectors, which continues to weigh down on banks. Two specialized state-owned banks, Daykhanbank and Presidentbank, lend to the agriculture and mortgage sectors, respectively, at 2 percent or less. Banks are also expected to extend short- and long-term loans to small businesses at 5 percent. The CBT has to step in and provide liquidity for these lending operations as the low interest rates make it difficult for banks to attract deposits and still remain profitable.

However, policy directed lending is projected to remain high, limiting the overall efficiency of financial intermediation.5 Reported prudential indicators appear strong, but banks’ accounting standards are weak, casting doubts on their robustness.  13.      Access to foreign exchange to make payments and transfers for current international transactions has remained unrestricted, but the regulatory framework still allows for restrictions. Since the exchange rate unification, the Interbank Currency Exchange (ICE) has operated regularly and the CBT has intervened as needed to maintain the fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. Sufficient provision of foreign exchange to an extensive network of exchange bureaus across the country eliminated the parallel market spread. All banks participating in the ICE are now authorized to open correspondent accounts abroad. However, the operations of the ICE remains very centralized, the surrender requirements for public sector exporters is still in place, and the new foreign exchange regulation still allow for official actions that could result in current exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices. 14.      The level of the exchange rate reflects Turkmenistan’s strong external position, but, under standard methodologies, the assessment remains inconclusive (Box 2). Like other countries highly dependent on hydrocarbon exports, Turkmenistan needs to accumulate large foreign exchange assets to stabilize its income at times of negative external shocks and to prepare for the eventual depletion of its hydrocarbon reserves. Hence, the sizable and persistent current account surpluses and accumulation of foreign assets are consistent with maintaining long-term external stability and fiscal sustainability.                                                   5 Deposits are less than 5 percent of GDP, and banks continue to rely on the CBT standing auctions and auxiliary credit line for their credit activity.

Turkmenistan: External Sustainability and the Assessment of the Exchange Rate  The assessment of Turkmenistan’s exchange rate is subject to significant limitations, including: poor macroeconomic data, ambiguity on the level of the country’s hydrocarbon resources, and a dual exchange rate in operation until mid-2008. The assessment based on the CGER methodology does not lead to the conclusion that the exchange rate of the manat is fundamentally misaligned. Results vary from slight overvaluation to significant undervaluation.  The macroeconomic balance approach shows an overvaluation of about 16.5 percent. In contrast, under the equilibrium real exchange rate, the manat was undervalued Turkmenistan: External Sustainability  (In percent of GDP)-25-15-551525354555652007200820092010201120122013Baseline: Sustainable current account (CA norm)Projected current accountLC: Sustainable current account (CA norm)Sources: Data provided by authorities, and Fund staff estimates and projections.by 62 percent in 2008.  6 xchange equilibrium in 2013; and an undervaluation in 2014.  omy,  , ts the lties in the execution of the public investmentsn the absence of financing constraints.  1For more details see SM/08/202.  The external sustainability (ES) approach is based on the permanent income hypothesis.1 Staff has considered two scenarios: a baseline case with gas reserves of 14 trillion cubic meters (tcm) and an alternative conservative scenario with gas reserves of tcm. The baseline scenario shows a significant undervaluation of the erate. The alternative scenario indicates a significant undervaluation in 2009–12, a quasi Caution is required in interpreting the findings of the different models. The calibration of the models based on CGER may not capture well some key features of the Turkmen econincluding the dominance of the public sector in the economy and the existence of a dual exchange rate for several years. The ES approach seemsmore relevant, but the model is sensitiveto the assumed path of extraction of hydrocarbon resources and of oil and gas prices.

Medium-Term Outlook and Risks (2010–14) 15.      Bright prospects in the hydrocarbon sector underpin a positive outlook. Higher gas export prices, steps to diversify export markets, and the confirmation by an international audit of Turkmenistan’s large natural gas reserves, all point to high export growth and the persistence of strong external and fiscal balances over the medium term. Rising FDIs in oil and gas and efforts to develop the gas export infrastructure—the upgrade of the main pipelines to Russia and Iran, the completion of the pipeline to China, and discussions on new pipelines—add strength to the country’s longer-term economic prospects.  02468101214200920102011201220132014Total real GDP Nonhydrocarbon real GDP growthHydrocarbon real Medium Term Projections: Real GDP GrGDP growthowth 2009-2001416.      Medium-term growth would remain robust and stable, if supported by cautious fiscal policies, open trade, and progress toward a more market-based economy. GDP is projected to grow by 8–9 percent per year. High non-hydrocarbon growth reflects the expected continuation of large public investments and expanding private sector activity.6 A stable exchange rate, would help to keep inflation low. Sizable fiscal and external savings will provide ample room to support the economy, if needed. Still, comprehensive structural reforms will be key for the development of private businesses, economic diversification, and employment creation. -140-120-100-80-60-40-200200920102011201220132014Projected nonhydrocarbon fiscal balance (inpercent of GDP)Fiscal SustainabilitySustainable nonhydrocarbon fiscal balance (low casscenario; in percent of GDP)Sustainable nonhydrocarbon fscenario; in percent of GDP)e iscal balance (Baseline                                                 17.      The new assessment of Turkmenistan’s hydrocarbon reserves confirms that the fiscal stance is sustainable.7 Over 2009–14, the average sustainable non-hydrocarbon deficit is estimated at 106 percent of GDP in the baseline and at 42 percent of GDP in the low case scenario.8  Under current policy, staff projects an average non-hydrocarbon deficit of 20 percent of GDP.   6  The government expects its recent investments in infrastructure to encourage new activity in agri-business and in tourism, including in the recently inaugurated Avaza zone on the Caspian shore.  7 The results of the first stage of the international audit confirmed that the South Yoloten-Osman deposits in the south-east of the country contained between 4 and 14 tcm, by far the largest in Turkmenistan. Subsequent stages of the audit are expected to cover other promising areas.

The outlook is resilient to some oil/gas price volatility, but Turkmenistan’s major dependence on one gas export route is a source of risk. The new link of the contractual price for Turkmen gas exports to the European import market price has boosted export receipts in early 2009, although it exposes Turkmenistan to market price volatility. Staff estimate that if oil prices were to fall $15 below the current projection path and gas prices to $180 per thousand cubic meter (less than half the current European market-based net back price), the fiscal and the external current account balances would on average remain in surplus. However, until the new gas export routes are developed, Turkmenistan’s fiscal and external outlooks remain vulnerable to technical problems in its main gas export pipeline and to contractual disputes with its largest gas importer.   III.   THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS 19.      The authorities confirmed their intention to proceed with economic reforms in line with Turkmenistan’s Program of Renewal and Transformation.9 They emphasized that their prudent policies had shielded the Turkmen economy from the impact of the global financial crisis and continue to deliver high economic growth and financial stability. The large financial resources accumulated in recent years provide a buffer against further deterioration in the external environment. They noted that the unification of the exchange rate—together with the implementation of supporting policies—and the redenomination of the manat were successful and have set the stage for the continuation of reforms. The authorities thanked the Fund for its support with these reforms. A.   Inflation and Macroeconomic Policies 20.      The government’s policies will support a low inflation environment. Recent price moderation was driven by lower import prices and higher competition in import and retail activity, backed by a stable exchange rate, higher access to foreign exchange, the expansion                                                                                                                                                        8 Reserves are estimated at 2.8 billion barrels of oil and 14 tcm in the baseline and at 700 million barrels of oil and 6 tcm of gas in the low case. 9 See Box 3 in SM/08/2002.

With prudent macroeconomic policies and progress to strengthen agriculture and food security, the authorities intend to keep inflation low. The authorities considered staff’s recommendations to adjust administered prices upward to reflect the impact of the exchange rate unification, but decided not to proceed with price adjustments during this year. They noted that the list of goods and services subject to administered prices is limited and reflects the government’s social policy10.  21.      The authorities will maintain the current fixed peg to the U.S. dollar in the short term, but confirmed their interest in more flexibility in the future. They observed that in the recent turbulent times a stable exchange rate and adequate access to foreign exchange have been critical to support the new currency and anchor price expectations. They see the current level of the exchange rate as adequate to maintain domestic and external stability. The CBT reiterated the commitment to ensure liberal access to foreign exchange for current account transactions and announced the ongoing preparation of a comprehensive legal framework to improve the regulation and functioning of the foreign exchange system. Over the medium term, the authorities are interested in exploring more flexible exchange rate options. In this context, they appreciated  staff’s presentation on exchange rate regimes and their policy implications and showed interest in the option of linking the manat to a currency basket that reflects the geographical composition of Turkmenistan’s trade.   Fiscal policy 22.      The authorities remain committed to maintaining a fiscal stance that is consistent with macroeconomic stability and the development needs of Turkmenistan. They stressed that the objectives of the 2008 budget have been achieved, and that the low execution of the investment budget partly reflected savings on imported goods related to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower import prices. For 2009, the first quarter results point to higher revenue and lower costs of goods and services and investment materials. The authorities concurred with the staff that the state budget surplus will likely overshoot its target.  23.      The budget will maintain its focus on the social sphere to advance the social reform program initiated in 2007 and improve the living conditions of the population.11 Moderate increases in wages and pensions will continue. The investment budget will rise fast to accelerate the modernization of the country’s economic and social infrastructure. The authorities noted that several new public projects have been brought on budget—including in road construction, rural development, the Avaza tourism area, and the construction of the                                                  10 See SM/08/203 Table 7. 11 There is little data available on social indicators. However, the authorities have recently agreed with the World Bank on a project to strengthen capacity for collection and analysis of socio-economic statistics, which includes support for conducting a living standards measurement survey.

The budget system reforms are proceeding. The authorities noted that they have strengthened the physical and financial monitoring of project execution and improved inter-agencies coordination. They are currently preparing laws and regulations—including financial reporting standards—to complement the recently completed draft Budget Code (prepared with EU assistance). The code requires that annual budgets be set in a medium-term framework and includes provisions to strengthen budget planning, management and transparency. The new framework will guide the preparation of the 2011 budget. 25.      The SFT became operational in 2009 and the authorities intend to strengthen its stabilization and saving functions. This year, the main objective of the fund is to support growth in the non-hydrocarbon economy, in the face of possible spillovers from the global recession. Projects that could receive SFT’ s support are being evaluated. Financing for approved projects will be channeled through eligible banks, which will bear the credit risk. The authorities acknowledged that the resources accruing to the SFT will grow fast and agreed that to prevent excessive demand pressure in the economy they will need to save part of these funds in foreign assets. They are examining the experience of a few reputable sovereign wealth funds in Europe and in the region to learn how to make the SFT a more efficient instrument for saving and stabilization. Monetary policy 26.      The authorities recognized that with a fixed exchange rate, the space for pursuing other monetary policy objectives is limited. They reiterated their intention to pursue low inflation, but noted that the provision of liquidity for government-directed lending to agriculture, industry, and civil servant housing remains an important policy objective. The CBT is aware of the potential conflict of this lending with the objective of low inflation, and of the inherent risk for its balance sheet, but believes these are manageable. Nonetheless, the authorities will consider options to transfer the responsibility for and the risk of these operations more directly to the budget.  B.   Banking Reform 27.      The CBT is discussing with banks the possibilities of issuing banks’ securities to mobilize savings and develop market–based liquidity management instruments. The option under consideration is the issuance by selected banks of negotiable certificates of deposits (NCDs). NCDs would help increase banks’ liquidity, reducing the need for CBT lending, and could function as instruments for securitized interbank credit. The regulatory and operational aspects related to the new instrument are being discussed and issuance of NCDs could start in 2010.    Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  16  28.      The authorities are modernizing the legal framework of Turkmenistan’s financial system. The CBT stressed that the draft central bank law and the draft law on banks under preparation reflect the authorities’ commitment to modernize the structure and operations of the banking system. The pilot project on the use of IFRS by two banks is being assessed and the authorities expect to introduce IFRS accounting for all banks starting in 2010. The recently adopted AML-CFT law, which benefited from IMF technical assistance, is an important step toward Turkmenistan’s integration in the international financial system.  29.      The authorities support a more commercially-oriented banking system, but for now policy directed lending will still be used. Demand for market-based private credit is increasing and banks are now keener to mobilize savings and provide new services. A group of local private businesses has shown interest for establishing a new bank and the authorities are considering to allow foreign banks some operations in the Avaza tourism zone. In the near future, however, the authorities intend to continue tasking a few state-owned banks with the provision of low-interest-rate policy directed lending.  C.   Data Issues 30.      The authorities intend to strengthen the quality of statistics and welcome the continuation of Fund’s assistance in this area. A new CPI covering the rural areas was developed in collaboration with the Fund’s regional advisor. The new index, which improves the measurement of consumer inflation, should become operational in 2010. The authorities appreciated the Fund’s decision to appoint a new statistical regional advisor and look forward to his cooperation, particularly to raise the quality and reliability of national accounts.   IV.   STAFF APPRAISAL 31.      Turkmenistan has made progress in implementing its program of economic reforms, but maintaining reform momentum is a challenge. Developments have been encouraging, with a strong macroeconomic performance and initiatives to liberalize the economy. A comfortable financial situation provides ample room to deal with external shocks and a favorable environment to advance structural reform. Success will depend critically on setting a clear direction for future reforms, strengthening implementation capacity, and encouraging the emergence of a culture of private entrepreneurship.  32.      Strong prospects in hydrocarbons underpin the positive medium-term outlook, but diversifying away from oil and gas while overcoming a long legacy of centralized economic management is a formidable longer term challenge. It requires comprehensive structural changes to encourage private sector activity and develop a market-oriented financial sector. In some areas, reforms need careful prioritization and sequencing and strong technical capacity. Staff encourages the authorities to seek foreign technical assistance to help advance their reform agenda, including from the Fund in its areas of expertise.    Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  17  33.      Staff recommends a full  pass-through of the impact of the exchange rate unification to administered prices. Prices that better reflect costs would lead to a more efficient allocation of resources. The current low inflation environment is a good setting for undertaking such adjustments, and the comfortable fiscal position provides the resources to protect the real incomes of the most vulnerable. In the medium-term, staff urges the authorities to replace administered prices with means-tested programs that target assistance to those that are in need. 34.      Staff views the current fiscal expansion as reasonable, but encourages more transparency and a comprehensive approach to fiscal policy. The focus of the fiscal expansion on infrastructure and rural development investments is appropriate. However, the government’s objectives are likely to be reached more efficiently and transparently by integrating all fiscal revenue and government spending into the central budget. In this regard, staff welcomes the completion of the draft budget code and urges the authorities to expedite its adoption, a key first step in strengthening public financial management. Stressing the importance of accountability and long-term fiscal sustainability in hydrocarbon revenue management, staff recommends to clarify the scope of operations of the SFT and to strengthen its focus on fiscal stabilization and long-term sustainability. 35.      In the current context of global financial turbulence, staff supports the authorities’ intention to keep the existing peg to the U.S. dollar. With high international reserves and inconclusive evidence on misalignment, keeping a stable exchange rate in the near term will anchor price expectations and help build up trust in the new currency. As structural reforms advance and the monetary policy framework develops, staff recommends to consider a gradual transition to increased exchange rate flexibility.   36.      Staff encourages the authorities to reduce the centralization of the foreign exchange market. By shifting more responsibilities to banks in assessing compliance with the foreign exchange regulations, the ICE would become a more efficient market. The authorities should also consider eliminating the surrender requirement for public sector exporters outside the hydrocarbon sector. 37.      Monetary policy reforms are also key in supporting the new exchange rate. Policy directed lending activity is likely to clash with the CBT monetary policy objectives of low inflation and exchange rate stability. Staff therefore recommends the cessation of these operations. Given the government’s intention to pursue its policy objectives by also providing subsidized lending, staff recommends that these operations be brought under the more direct responsibility of the budget.  38.      The planned overhaul of financial sector legislation is timely. The authorities should be commended for the passage of the AML-CFT law and encouraged to issue the necessary implementing regulations and establish the oversight agency. In view of the significance of the planned revision of financial legislation and to benefit from other  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  18   countries’ experience, staff encourages the CBT to seek expert technical feedback on the draft foreign exchange regulation law, central bank law, and law on banks at an early stage.  39.      Staff welcomes the focus on financial sector reforms and encourages the authorities to act determinedly on initiatives on which consensus has been reached. Staff supports the planned experiment with NCDs and recommends the CBT to establish a simple regulatory and operational framework for their issuance. To ensure more effective regulation and supervision and strengthen confidence in banks, the authorities should introduce expeditiously IFRS accounting and audit obligations. Staff also encourages the authorities to promote competition among banks, including by ending the traditional specialization of state banks and allowing the entrance of new private banks, both domestic and foreign. 40.      Weaknesses in national accounts and in the coverage of fiscal data continue to hamper surveillance. Staff welcomes the authorities’ determined efforts to improve macroeconomic statistics and suggests that they consider the Fund’s GDDS as a framework for statistical development. Staff reiterates its recommendation to improve the public availability of economic and financial data. 41.      Turkmenistan maintains an exchange restriction and multiple currency practice subject to approval by the Fund under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) or 3, as described in the Informational Annex. While welcoming the recent progress, staff does not recommend their approval and urges their elimination as soon as feasible. 42.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard 12-month cycle.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public19 Table 1.

Favorable contractual prices for its gas exports shall boost further the country’s fiscal revenues and external reserves. This positive outlook provides a great opportunity to deepen and accelerate the economic reforms, which were initiated in 2008 with the successful unification of the exchange rate.  Economic performance continued to be strong, in spite of the global economic crisis. Real GDP growth of 10 ½ percent in 2008 was supported by large public investments in construction and infrastructure and high activity in transportation, communication, and retail. Inflation peaked at 18.9 percent in July 2008, due to price adjustments for petroleum products and transportation, high international food prices, and some impact of the May 2008 unification of the exchange rate. However, it moderated to 9 percent by year-end, due to declining international food prices,                                                  1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

The current account surplus continued to expand, reaching 18 ¾ percent of GDP in 2008 on account of a 20 percent increase in export receipts from higher oil and gas prices, and despite an acceleration in imports of goods and services, boosted by rising domestic demand and easier access to foreign exchange. International reserves have increased significantly, to about 22 months of import cover.   The 2008 state budget closed with a surplus of 11 ¼ percent of GDP on account of strong revenue performance and the slow execution of investments. Hydrocarbon revenues were boosted by high oil and gas prices and the impact of the unification of the exchange rate. Improvements in tax and customs administration raised the buoyancy of non-hydrocarbon revenues. Staff estimates that a large positive balance from off-budget operations brought the overall fiscal surplus to about one third of GDP.   There was some progress with public financial management reforms. The authorities have completed the draft budget code with EU assistance and are now working on the preparation of complementary legal and regulatory documents. In October 2008 they created the Stabilization Fund of Turkmenistan where state budget surpluses will be accumulated. The fund’s priorities and functions are still being elaborated.   In late 2008 money demand contracted while the CBT undertook large policy lending operations. To satisfy a spike in foreign exchange demand and sterilize the large liquidity injection from its lending operations, the CBT intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market. The successful introduction of the new manat in January 2009 and a stable exchange rate have raised confidence in the currency and demand for manat money has been growing during the first quarter of 2009.   Access to foreign exchange to make payments and transfers for current international transactions has remained unrestricted. Since last year’s exchange rate unification, the Interbank Currency Exchange (ICE) has operated regularly and the CBT has intervened as needed to maintain the fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. The sufficient provision of foreign exchange to an extensive network of exchange bureaus across the country eliminated the parallel market spread. However, the new foreign exchange regulation still leaves space for official actions that could result in current exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices.  The authorities took initial steps at financial sector reforms. Banks are becoming more active in mobilizing deposits and providing new services, setting the ground for more commercially oriented credit activity.
