Mobilization has created severe economy-wide labor shortages, except in agriculture where a special production campaign complemented very good rains to produce record harvests in 1998 and 1999. Inflation increased to 22.7 percent at end-1998 but is estimated to have declined to 10.8 percent at end-1999, partly reflecting continued good harvests. 0 The fiscal deficit (including grants) expanded sharply from 5.5 percent of GNP in 1997 to 27 percent in 1998 and is likely to have reached 37 percent in 1999. The widening deficit reflects not only increased defense expenditure and relief outlays related to the 250,000 displaced people and about 67,000 Eritreans deported from Ethiopia, but also a very ambitious capital expenditure program to reduce supply constraints. Monetary policy was expansionary as broad money growth accelerated to 32 percent in 1999, compared with 22 percent in 1998, and the external current account (including offkial transfers) turned from a small surplus in 1997 into a deficit of just over 21 percent of GNP in both 1998 and 1999. Gross international reserves declined over the past two years from the equivalent of 6.4 months of imports of goods and services in 1997 to 2.6 months in 1999. Since its independence in 1993, Eritrea has been accumulating external debt, which reached the equivalent of 29 percent of GNP at end-1999. l The discussions focused on the challenges that face Eritrea in responding to the unsustainable, war-induced deterioration in the macroeconomic balances against the background of uncertain peace prospects. The authorities agreed that macroeconomic imbalances could only be brought tilly under control with the restoration of peace, but that a start could be made immediately with adjustment. measures and reforms in key areas, especially the restructuring of expenditure in the context of the new budget. 0 Structural reforms were implemented during 1998-99 to eliminate sectoral limits on interest rates, introduce treasury bills, and enhance the soundness of the banking system. Since last August, the authorities have been preparing to introduce an annual public budget starting in 2000 and a package of far-reaching tax reforms including lowering external tariffs from a maximum rate of 200 percent to 25 percent, while reducing the number of rates from 12 to 3. In December 1999, domestic petroleum product prices were increased by 28-45 percent. 0 The staff commends the authorities for the major efforts to expand agricultural production since 1998 and the more recent initiative to introduce a public budget, a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- bold comprehensive tax reform, and a number of other measures, which together are important first steps toward addressing a difficult macroeconomic situation. l The key staff recommendations include developing a postwar strategy to facilitate a quick transition to a peace economy, including a substantial reduction in defense expenditure when peace is restored. Peace would also permit Eritrea to undertake further liberalization of the exchange system to facilitate acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Article of Agreement. In the meantime, the new budget process should focus on reducing other budgetary expenditure, particularly the wage bill and capital outlays, and on modernizing tax legislation and the regulations. Moreover, the authorities would need to pursue tighter monetary policy; introduce market-based monetary policy instruments; and enhance Eritrea’s external competitiveness, as well as competition in the financial sector. Other supporting structural reforms should aim at promoting private sector activity through expanding the privatization program; removing the remaining price controls; strengthening the investment center; and significantly improving data compilation and dissemination. a The staff supports Eritrea’s various requests for technical assistance from the Fund to strengthen institutional capacity. It urges the authorities to undertake a selective review of mobilization in order to permit some skilled personnel to return to the key economic institutions, where they could also help to improve the effectiveness of the requested technical assistance.

The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions with Eritrea were held in Asmara during December l-l 6, 1999. ’ The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 13, 1998. At that time, Executive Directors expressed concern about the border conflict with Ethiopia and emphasized that an early, peaceful settlement of the dispute was essential to permit the pursuit of economic growth and poverty aileviation policies within a stable economic environment. They urged the authorities to further consolidate the fiscal position and expedite the adoption of a public annual budget and the development of a framework and instruments for the conduct of monetary policy. Directors noted that Eritrea faced serious institutional capacity and economic database limitations that impeded the effective design, conduct, and monitoring of economic and financial polices and urged firm and timely measures to address them. 2. Eritrea continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2, and is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. Summaries of Eritrea’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are provided in Appendices I and II. Outstanding statistical issues include a need to compile national income accounts and significantly improve the existing database, which has deteriorated as a result of the war. Without these improvements, it is difficult to undertake effective policy formulation and surveillance (see Appendix III). Policy assessments contained in this report should be qualified accordingly. 3. Eritrea achieved independence from Ethiopia in 1993 _ Until 1997-when Eritrea introduced its own currency, the nakfa (ERN)-the two countries shared a common currency, the Ethiopian birr, as legal tender, and cross-border movement of goods and labor were for the most part unrestricted. During 1994-97, about 62 percent of Eritrea’s exports were destined to, and 7 percent of imports were from, Ethiopia; bank deposits in Eritrea were equivalent to nearly 10 percent of Ethiopia’s broad money supply. The economic links between the two countries have been severed by the border war that started in May 1998 (Box 1). 4. At the request of the authorities, a staff team visited Eritrea during October- November 1998 to update the macroeconomic framework to, inter alia, reflect the impact of the border conflict; it also participated in a government workshop for donors in Asmara to review a draft of Eritrea’s National Economic Policy Framework and Program (NEPFP) for 1999-2001, Since August 1999, Mr. Woldai Futur, Economic Advisor to the Government, has been in charge of the Ministry of Finance. ’ The Eritrean representatives included Mr. Woldai Futur, Economic Advisor to the Government in charge of the Ministry of Finance; Mr. Tekie Beyene, Governor of the Bank of Eritrea (BoE); Mr. Gabriel Fassil, Director General of the Ministry of Finance; other senior officials; and representatives of the private sector. The stat?? team comprised Mr. Kibuka (head), Ms. Brixiova, Mr. Nakata, Mr. Pitt (EP), and Ms. Montero (assistant), all AFR.

The Border Conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia: Some of its Economic Impact The conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia started in May 1998, as a consequence of a dispute over the common border in the Badme region. The causes of the conflict are complex and include economic issues. Foreign trade in particular has been a point of contention between the two countries, which signed a cooperation agreement to develop common monetary, exchange, and trade policies. Nevertheless, divergences in the implementation of these policies emerged. Following Eritrea’s introduction of the naklh and despite its strongly expressed reservations, Ethiopia required the use of hani currencies and letters of credit for payments in excess of ERN 2,000. This requirement compounded the friction in bilateral relations, which contributed to the outbreak of war. The peace talks led by the Organization for African Unity (OAU) have provided a peace framework (endorsed by the UN, European Union, and the United States) that called for a withdrawal of troops from the disputed area, to be followed by a demarcation of the border. Fighting resumed in February 1999 and continued through June, spreading over several fronts. It is estimated that Eritrea has mobilized 250,000 people for the war effort. While no independent verification is available, the number of casualties on both sides is estimated at 50,000. In addition, an estimated 250,000 Eritreaus and 390,000 Ethiopians have been displaced because of the fighting along the border; through end-1999,67,000 Eritreaus living in Ethiopia had been deported and in the process had lost their property. Eritrea accepted the OAU peace framework in February 1999 and the technical arrangements in September 1999; Ethiopia, however, announced in December 1999 a need to reexamine the technical arraugements of the peace framework, claiming that they did not address the “restoration and respect of sovereignty” (i.e., a return to status quo ante). Ethiopia was Eritrea’s main trading partner between 1993 and 1997. During this period, exports to Ethiopia averaged 62 percent of the total, while imports from Ethiopia averaged 7 percent of the total. With the outbreak of the conflict and the closure of the border, there has been a total disruption of trade between the two countries. E&ma’s total exports shrank to US$28 million in 1998 and are estimated to have declined to US$26 million in 1999. The share of Eritrea’s exports to Ethiopia declined from 64 percent in 1997 to 26.5 percent in 1998, forcing Eritrea to look for alternative export markets. Eritrea increased the share of its exports to Sudan from 17 percent in 1997 to 26 percent in 1998 (mainly agricultu.ral products), to Japan from zero in 1997 to 13 percent in 1998 (mainly processed food, such as sugar confectionery) and to the United Arab Emirates from zero in 1997 to 7 percent in 1998 (mainly manufacturing goods). In addition, Eritrea and Ethiopia had signed a bilateral agreement for use of the Red Sea ports of Assab and Massawa to transship goods to and from Ethiopia. The bulk of Ethiopian imports and exports had transited through Assab (about 90 percent of the port’s operations involved handling of goods transiting to and from Ethiopia), while h4assawa had handled most of the goods for the domestic market and those destined to and from northern Ethiopia. The diversion of Ethiopia’s transit goods since May 1998 resulted in a loss in fiscal revenue and external service receipts, and in increased unemployment. Revenue from port fees and charges declined from an average of about 6 percent of GNP during 1993-97 to 1.7 percent of GNP in 1998 and au estimated 1.6 percent of GNP in 1999. Similarly, external service receipts from port fees and charges fell from an average of USS37 million (5.7 percent of GNP in 1993-97) to about US.%21 million (about 2.6 percent of GNP) iu 1998 and to an estimated USS14 million (about 1.8 percent of GNP) in 1999.

During 1998-99, real GDP growth slowed considerably, mainly as a result of the impact of the border war with Ethiopia. Starting from a relatively strong economic position supported’by major economic adjustment and reforms in 1997, real GDP growth declined from 8 percent in 1997 to about 4 percent in 1998 and to 3 percent in 199g2 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Activity in most sectors slowed, largely because of labor shortages following mobilization for the war effort; the influx of war-related refugees; the closure of the border with Ethiopia; and the latter’s diversion of its transit goods from the port of Assab to Djibouti. Output growth would have been even lower were it not for the bumper crop production in both 1998 and 1999 as a result of exceptionally good rains and the substantial government effort to increase agricultural production, including through integrated farming. Despite the moderating effect of the good harvests on food prices, inflation increased from 10.6 percent at the end of 1997 to 22.7 percent at end-1998, before declining to an estimated 10.8 percent at end-1999. As a result of the maintenance of fixed domestic petroleum product prices since 1997-against the background of sizable increases in world prices and a delayed adjustment in the exchange rate-measured inflation in 1999 was, however, understated.3 6. The financial operations of the government deteriorated considerably during 1998 as the overall fiscal deficit (after grants) surged to about 27 percent of GNP compared with 5.5 percent in 1997 (Table 2 and Figure 2). The widening of the deficit was largely due to sharply higher defense outlays and relief expenditure related to the 250,000 war-displaced people and about 50,000 Eritreans deported from Ethiopia;4 outlays on these two items are estimated to have reached about 24% percent of GNP in 1998, compared with 10% percent in 1997.’ In addition, capital expenditure increased by 6 percentage points of GNP to pay for infrastructure projects while revenue from port fees declined sharply. To contain the growing deficit, the government imposed effective October 1, 1998 an emergency surtax on personal income (effectively doubling the tax rates to a range of 4-76 percent). A corporate income surtax of 15 percent (which raised the corporate tax to 50 percent) took effect on January 1999. To finance the overall deficit, the government made recourse to bank credit; as a result, total outstanding domestic debt rose to ERN 2.8 billion (47 percent of GNP) by end-1998. A substantial part of this debt was securitized through the introduction of government treasury bills in November 1998. However, since the government paid interest of 2% percent on all its 2 Staff estimates of GDP are based on selected sectoral information provided by the authorities. For details of reforms and adjustment through 1997, see M/98/155 (6/25/98). 3 Similarly, the maintenance of unchanged petroleum product prices when world prices declined in 1998 caused measured inflation to be overstated . 4 The reported number of deportees increased to 67,000 by end-1999. 5 In 1997, the government was still discharging obligations related to demobilization.

During 1999, the fiscal deficit (after grants) continued to grow, reaching an estimated 37 percent of GNP. Total revenue is estimated to have declined as a ratio to GNP-despite stronger efforts to raise public contributions and the imposition of the income surtax-because of the impact of mobilization, less robust economic activity, and the full- year impact of the loss of port revenue. Expenditures continued to grow rapidly and are estimated to have reached 68 percent of GNP in 1999. While recurrent expenditures are estimated to have declined somewhat as a percent of GNP, outlays for defense and on wages likely remained high, albeit moderated, at about 23 percent of GNP and 14% percent, respectively. Capital expenditure increased by about 4 percentage points to an estimated 29 percent of GNP in 1999. While part of the increase in capital expenditure reflects the implementation of lumpy projects (a power plant and transmission lines, a dam to supply water to Asmara, an airport, and roads) funded in part from external grants and loans, the government’s domestic counterpart expenditures are projected to have accounted for most of this increase. At the same time, the share of the social sectors in total capital expenditure is estimated to have declined from 11.2 percent in 1998 to about 7.8 percent in 1999. Although part of the deficit was covered by privatization proceeds, it was financed mostly by further recourse to net bank borrowing, thereby raising domestic debt to the equivalent of 67 percent of GNP. The government also borrowed from external sources, including US$16.36 million through sale of U.S. dollar denominated bonds (virtually interest free with three-year maturities), mainly to Eritreans living abroad. Overall public indebtedness is estimated to have increased by 3 1 percentage points to the equivalent of an estimated 96 percent of GNP through end- 1999. 8. Monetary policy was expansionary as broad money growth is estimated to have accelerated from 22 percent in 1998 to 32 percent in 1999, reflecting strong growth in net bank credit to the government (Table 3 and Figure 3). Credit to the private sector, which grew significantly through June 1999, is estimated to have declined during the second half and thus to have decreased marginally in 1999 as a whole. This development reflects the increasingly cautious lending policies of the banks and weakened demand for credit with the realization that the conflict with Ethiopia was likely to drag on much longer than originally envisaged. Despite the partial liberalization of lending rates in 1998, a number of these interest rates remained negative in real terms through end- 1999. The two commercial banks had excess reserves amounting to 20.1 percent of total deposits at end-October 1999, notwithstanding the issue of ERN 342 million in treasury bills to the Commercial Bank of Eritrea (CBE) during the year.6 Nonperforming assets rose from 26.3 percent of total loans to the private sector at end-1997 to 35.3 percent in June 1999. This increase, in turn, seems to be the result of economic dislocation caused by the mobilization for the war effort. Bank provisioning for nonperforming loans also increased from 18.5 percent of doubtful loans in 6 Most of the excess reserves are deposited without remuneration at the Bank of Eritrea.

Moreover, during the year the Bank of Eritrea (BoE) reached an agreement with the two commercial banks on a program to gradually increase their capital adequacy to 8 percent of risk-weighted assets by 2003 from the reported range of 2-3 percent, At the same time, the BoE licensed the two commercial banks and other financial institutions in 1999 in compliance with the Bank of Eritrea Proclamation of 1997.’ 9. The external sector remained under pressure in 1999 after a sharp deterioration in 1998. The current account balance (including official transfers) shifted from a small surplus in 1997 to deficits in excess of 21 percent of GNP a year in 1998 and 1999 (Table 4). This shift reflects the impact of the war, specifically declining exports and service receipts (with the closure of the border), and a significant increase in imports; in addition, private transfers declined after a peak in 1997 when a special campaign was undertaken to support the introduction of the nakfa. The capital account strengthened during 1998 and 1999 with loan disbursements for projects, mainly in the construction and energy sectors. However, gross international reserves declined by US%169 million in 1998 and are estimated to have fallen further to US$122 million in 1999 (the equivalent of 2.6 months of next year’s goods and services, compared with 6.4 months in 1997). 10. In November 1997, Eritrea introduced the nakfa to replace the birr on a one-to-one parity. The two countries have yet to agree on the treatment of the old birr notes collected in Eritrea. The latter maintains a fairly liberal exchange system. Surrender requirements were abolished, and the few limits on foreign exchange allowances (travel, medical, and education) are administered liberally. The nominal exchange rate remained relatively stable during 1998, subsequently, it depreciated by 29 percent to about ERN 9.75 per U.S. dollar by November 1999. Through early 1999, the central bank sold substantial foreign exchange to the government at the prevailing market exchange rate (without purchasing any foreign exchange from the market).* The nakfa appreciated in real effective terms (using the price index for Asmara) by about 5.2 percent in 1998 and by a further 9.1 percent through August 1999 (Figure 4). There are no import licenses or quantitative trade restrictions except for health, security, and environmental reasons. Eritrea did not inherit any external debt at independence, but the external debt rose to an estimated USS225 million (28.6 percent of GNP) at end-1999; most of this debt is concessional, from multilateral and bilateral development institutions and Eritrea has been meeting its debt service obligations on a timely basis. 7 The CBE was established by proclamation in 1993 while the Housing Bank of Eritrea, subsequently the Housing and Commerce Bank of Eritrea, was registered with the Business Licensing Office in 1994. * The market comprised the commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus with access to substantial private sector transfers by Eritreans living abroad.

The discussions focused on the challenges that Eritrea faces in responding to the unsustainable, war-induced deterioration in the macroeconomic balances against the background of uncertain peace prospects. The parallel execution of an ambitious development program (partly related to security), including lumpy infrastructure projects, has exacerbated the emerging serious financial situation. At the same time, as workers were mobilized for the war, labor shortages (particularly of skilled workers) have had a severe adverse impact on nonmilitary sectors. While some of these imbalances (including the scarcity of skilled labor) will be brought fully under control only with the restoration of a lasting peace, immediate strong adjustment measures and reforms remain essential steps toward providing for a macroeconomic environment conducive to sustainable economic growth. 12. The mission updated the medium-term macroeconomic framework (2000-02) as a basis for the policy discussions; however, this framework remains tentative because of the uncertain timing and scope of the peace arrangements and may need to be revised with the onset of lasting peace. The updated macroeconomic framework-with which the authorities were broadly in agreement-envisages average output growth in the range of 4-7 percent; annual inflation rate of 5-9 percent a year through 2002; and a decline in the external current account deficit (including official transfers) from about 21 percent of GNP in 1999 to about 12 percent by 2002. This decline, together with a tirther buildup of external reserves, would be financed largely by donors (see Appendix IV). The adjustment in this scenario is underpinned by a substantial reduction in the fiscal primary deficit as discussed below. The projected narrowing of the overall fiscal deficit, together with the inflows of resources to fill the financing gap, would sharply reduce net government domestic borrowing requirementsag In the absence of peace and major corrective measures, the economy would be headed toward a major crisis. Even a delayed peace and a postponement of adjustment would lead to a very difficult economic outlook as illustrated by the mission’s alternative scenario. 13. Against this background, the mission urged the authorities to undertake a timely, selective review of mobilization, with a view to returning some skilled personnel to their economic ministries and institutions. Such a step would, inter alia, address the government’s weakened capacity to compile timely economic data required to inform an appropriate policy response. Moreover, the mission shared the authorities’ views on the desirability of developing elements of a timely postwar economic strategy that would pave the way for a quicker transition from a war economy. To this end, there is a need to take the following actions: ’ As the decline in donor Cmding is most evident in loan disbursement from the existing pipeline from 2000 onwards, it is likely that a replenishment of the project pipeline would be an important part of budgetary financing. The likely mix of grants and loans remains one of the uncertain factors that could be firmed up in the event of a peace accord.

Deepen and expand structural reforms that focus on (a) strengthening public finances through further improvements in the budget process; (b) strengthening the capacity of the.‘&& of Eritrea to conduct prudent monetary and foreign exchange policies and adequately supervise the financial sector; (c) removing the remaining impediments to private sector activity and market efficiency; and (d) building institutional capacity through recruitment, training, and technical assistance. Revise the NEPFP to include an updated assessment of the impact of the border conflict and the inputs of various development partners. The government could also start the process of elaborating on a poverty reduction strategy. Use the NEPFP to mobilize external financial and technical assistance. Sharply reduce the fiscal deficit, while using part of the savings in defense expenditure to accommodate the cost of demobilization, as well as the resettlement of refugees. Take stronger steps to promote normal regional trade, inter alia, to enhance exports, A. Fiscal Policy The very expansionary fiscal policy reflected in the unprecedented levels of overall expenditure, the overall deficit, and the extent of government net borrowing are at the heart of the recent sharp deterioration in the macroeconomic balances in Eritrea. The authorities concurred with the mission’s view that these trends were unsustainable and that the situation called for an urgent review of policy and, as a first step, an immediate reduction in non emergency (i.e., outside of military and relief operations) expenditure. They noted, however, that prior to the war they had initiated a number of lumpy infiastructural projects to alleviate major supply constraints in key sectors that could not be easily stopped. Although expenditure on these projects, in parallel with the war-related revenue loss and expenditure, were the main factors giving rise to the large increase in the budget deficit, they explained that the completion of these projects would provide a positive impact on growth. The expenditure cuts would be made in other areas; they noted that peace would permit another round of budgetary retrenchment through a substantial cutback in defense-related expenditure. Moreover, a major tax reform, which had benefited from IMF technical assistance, would be launched. These policy measures would be part of a large fiscal adjustment entailing also the introduction of a first-ever public budget, starting with 2000. 15. The mission welcomed the planned strong fiscal adjustment. The first-ever public budget not only provides an opportunity for financial transparency but also a basis for realistic budgetary allocations for defense, as well as for other government services and to highlight the need to mobilize resources. It commended the authorities’ intention to sharply reduce the overall budget deficit-the primary fiscal balance would decline from 35.8 percent of GNP in 1999 to 21.5 percent in 2000 and 9.5 percent by 2002-while channeling (when available) more resources to the social sectors and economic rehabilitation, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- but it noted that, in the absence of peace, revenue measures and expenditure prioritization remained central to containing the overall deficit. The mission urged that the deficit in 2000-02 be contained to a level that could be financed by external grants and concessional loans while permitting a sharp reduction in recourse to domestic fmancing. It strongly discouraged further reliance on short-term U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to finance budgetary deficits because of the significant foreign exchange risk. It supported the requests for Fund technical assistance in the various areas of reforms.” 16. On the revenue side, the impact of the proposed revenue-enhancing tax reform will be to simplify and improve the efficiency of the tax system through reduced distortions (lower customs tariffs) and disincentives (lower income tax rates), while shifting the tax burden to broad-based domestic consumption (Box 2). Moreover, the rationalization of the tax system through a narrower dispersion in income and customs tax rates and a greater reliance o.n excise taxes to target luxury and sumptuary consumption should facilitate tax administration and improve future revenue growth. At the same time, the authorities increased domestic prices on gasoline (35 percent), diesel (28 percent), and kerosene (45 percent) effective December 4 to align them with world prices, while increasing the taxes on these products, effective early 2000, to generate an estimated EIXN 40 million (0.5 percent of GNP) (Figure 5). The authorities will now need to promulgate the new Customs Proclamation (which the sttiunderstands has been approved by the Ministry of Justice) and issue the related guidelines, as well as initiate the drafting of the Income Tax Proclamation and relevant regulations to help modernize the tax legal framework. 17. The key issues on expenditure include the following: l The new budget framework should be used to prioritize recurrent expenditure, with allocations to support refugees, maintain social services, and target poverty reduction. The wage bill needs to be reduced from an estimated 14% percent of GNP in 1999, mainly through limited wage increases and hiring in 2000. l The transparency of budgetary projections should be ensured, as well as the related information about defense expenditure, and outlays on relief operations and the war mobilization exercise. 0 Capital expenditure should be restricted to priority, well-defined projects because of the limited capacity in the capital-budgeting and implementation process, including the monitoring of externally funded projects. In the medium term, the government needs to expand on the work in key ministries to prepare a medium-term expenditure framework in collaboration with the World Bank staff. lo The requests for Fund technical assistance in this area comprise long-term advisors in customs, tax administration, and treasury operations, as well as short-term assistance in drafting a Financial Act in order to facilitate the introduction of the budget for 2000.

Personal income is subject to four separate income taxes, each of which has different brackets and different nmcimwn rates,” while business profits are subject to two separate tax schedules. Also, the sales tax, which is levied on manufacturers, importers, and service providers, has 4 rates, ranging from 3 percent to 12 percent, and a number of exemptions. Customs duties are levied at 12 rates, ranging from 2 percent to 200 percent, though there are many exemptions. Excise rates range from 10 percent to 100 percent on many products but are generally at the lower end, and their role in revenue collection is limited. Against this background, the authorities plan to implement a comprehensive tax reform. Proposed Reforms The comprehensive tax reform, which will be incorporated in the budget for 2000, will reduce the distortions of the current system by lowering customs tariffs and the disincentives of this system by lowering the corporate tax rate while shifting the tax burden to broad-based domestic consumption. Net tax revenue will be increased by 7 l/z percent from the current system. The main features of the reform, which was drafted with the help of the Fund’s technical assistance, are summarized below: l Direct taxes. The corporate tax, which currently has 4 rates plus a special lower rate for reinvested profits, will be restructured into a flat 30 percent single rate, and the special rate on reinvested profits will be abolished. For taxes on personal income, rental income, and unincorporated business income, a new 5-n& structure, with a top marginal rate of 30 percent, will be applied. l Customs tariff. The 12 tarifT rates will be reduced to 3, with the maximum rate lowered to 25 percent Raw materials and capital goods will be subject to a 5 percent rate, a couple of items (powdered milk and tires) subject to a 10 percent rate, and Gnal consumer goods will be subject to the 25 percent rate. For those items currently subject to high customs duties (such as cigarettes, alcohol, electronics, cars, and luxury items), excise rates will be raised significantly to compensate for most of the revenue shortfall. As a result, the weighted-average tariff rate will decline from 17.4 percent to 14.4 percent (based on 1999 revenue base). In addition, a 2 percent duty, which is collected (by the Customs Department on behalf of the central bank) on the value of all those imports not tinanced by letter of credit, will be abolished. l Excise duty. Excise duty rates for most goods will be increased to compensate for the loss of revenue from customs duties and corporate profit tax, while the excise duties on textiles and salt will be removed. With respect to petroleum products, the rates will be 40 percent for gasoline and 25 percent for diesel fuel. l Sales tax. The sales tax structure will be simplified by moving all of the items taxed at the preferential rate to the basic rate (10 percent on services and 12 percent on goods), with exceptions only for construction (5 percent) and raw materials (3 percent). 11 Personal income tax, rental income tax, business income tax, and commercial fanning income tax. In addition, business income taxes are divided into incorporated income tax and unincorpomtcd income tax, which have different rates. Also, an emergency surtax on personal income (effectively more than doubling the tax rates to a high of over 76 percent) was imposed effective on October 1, 1998, and corporations have paid a 15 percent surtax on profits since January 1,1999.

The mission observed that in raising domestic financing, the treasury would need to coordinate with the central bank in initiating reforms that will eventually provide for market-determined treasury bill rates. They would also need to plan on avoiding a substantial increase in total public debt so as not to place a severe debt service burden on the fiscal accounts. The government’s domestic debt stock is very large, especially compared with other counties in the region (Box 3). Even with prudent financial policies, the debt is likely to continue to grow in the medium term.” However, the adoption of prudent fiscal policy, supported by the revenue and expenditure reforms discussed above, will permit a substantial reduction in the overall deficit to both contain the growth of the debt and support a tightening of monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation. In this regard, the mission’s medium-term budget projections incorporate government domestic interest payments based on a higher interest rate (8 percent) beginning in 2000; while this provides for a one-time boost in interest payments (Box 4) and in the overall deficit, the ratios to GNP would in fact decline substantially in the medium term (see Appendix IV, Table 7). The assumption of a higher interest rate (say, 12 percent) would raise government domestic interest payments and the overall deficit as a ratio to GNP annually by 3-5 percentage points of GNP. These projections highlight a profile of public finances that would emerge with near-market cost of borrowing by the government given the substantial size of the stock of public domestic debt. In practice, market treasury bill interest rates will emerge only gradually over a period of time, supported by reforms in the financial sector, but such a development would also be significantly facilitated by a domestic debt-reducing operation to ease the burden on the budget. A sustained track record of fiscal prudence would provide the confidence to move ahead with such an operation to significantly pay off the government’s stock of domestic debt, supported by the implementation of a more comprehensive privatization program and possible assistance from the development partners. B. Social Policies and Safety Nets 19. The authorities stressed that social policies in Eritrea are now dominated by care for the retigees from the border areas and the deportees from Ethiopia. The Eritrea Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC), which handles this task, has worked with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to launch international emergency appeals, for which they raised US$10.7 million and US$18.6 million during 1998 and 1999, respectively. Even with these amounts, the government had to provide supplementary resources, which are reflected in the budget. ERREC will also handle demobilization as it did in the past. The authorities explained that historically Eritrea’s development policies had focused on poverty reduction through extensive rehabilitation programs affecting a substantial part of the population. This emphasis would remain even as they adapted policies to the changing circumstances. The completion of a school-building program in 1997 and war-related delays in implementing the sizable health and institutional capacity-building projects accounted partly for the decline in the share of social capital expenditure. Social sector recurrent expenditure increased as well as spending on the agricultural sector-the latter sector generates income for over 50 percent of the population- and has contributed to the recent increase in production. ‘I Partly because of the need to retire the three-year U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.

In the future, the budget will need to provide for peace-related expenses while giving priority to health and education sectors spending and development efforts through the Eritrea Community Development Fund (ECDF). The latter promotes local community initiative and covers social infrastructure (schools and clinics); soil and water conservation (micro-dams, water supply schemes, and flood control structures); economic rehabilitation (feeder roads); and a saving and credit program for individuals (based on the Grameen Bank approach, with some 6,234 beneficiaries through October 1999) and small businesses. For its entire activities, ECDF disbursed US%22 million as of end-October 1999, (equivalent to 42 percent of the total amount provided by various donors and the government) and, is targeted to reach an estimated 2 million people through mid-200 1.

Domestic Debt and the Financial Sector while the Eritrean govemment started with no domestic debt in 1993, subsequent reconstruction and relief expenditures raised domestic government obligations to 29 percent of GNP by the end of 1996. The fiscal consolidation achieved in 1997 was followed by a new round of large government deficits, triggered by the border conflict with Ethiopia, which erupted in May 1998, and the parallel implementation of an ambitious development program. Consequently, the domestic debt stock surged to an estimated 68 percent of GNP in December 1999. 100 - This rapid domestic debt buildup has adverse consequences for the operation of the banking system and the 75 . conduct of monetary policy.

Total nwmue (in per cmt of GNP) the interest rate on - - - - lntacet payments (in pa cult of total Yevallle) treasury bills is fixed at only 2.5 per cent, the same level that is charged on the rest of the government domestic debt. The role of securities in determining interest rates and regulating liquidity in Eritrea is therefore limited and not based on market mechanisms. Although the introduction of treasury bills has mopped up only part of the excess liquidity in the banking system (see Figure 3), credit to the private sector is being crowded out: in a t?amework of liberalized interest rates (since late 1998), the lending rates have moved to the upper end of the range of 8-12 percent, while credit to the private sector has fallen. The administratively set interest rate on treasury bills-below the estimated 3 percent cost of funds to commercial banks-implies that banks subsidize government borrowing, which places an additional burden on an already fragile banking sector. As a consequence, banks are relying on increasingly larger interest rate spreads and fees, impeding the emergence of a more aggressive credit market based on price competition. Because the rate is set administratively, budgetary interest payments appear to remain manageable despite the rapidly increasing debt burden However, if treasury bill auctions were introduced in order to implement monetary policy more effectively, and if interest rates were to rise to, say, 8 percent from 2000 onward (as assumed in the projections), payments on domestic debt would rise to over 25 per cent of revenue or about 5 percent of GNP by 2002. To mitigate such an adverse development while laying the foundations to establish a money market, it is imperative to contain public borrowing. In addition, smaller public deficits would allow credit to the private sector to grow faster and the sector to play an enhanced role in the economy, as envisaged by the government in its NEPFP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - NEPFP should also take into account donor assistance for Eritrea’s social programs, as well as the views of the civil society through a broad-based consultative process. To improve the social database and the targeting of benefits, the authorities have resumed discussions with Norway to complete a comprehensive household expenditure survey and compile national income accounts, as well as with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to restart the advanced preparations for a population and housing survey as soon as feasible. C. Monetary and Credit Policies 21. The mission urged the authorities to adopt a tighter stance of monetary policy-underpinned by the proposed fiscal adjustment--in order to contain inflation. Thus, the baseline scenario provides for a substantial slowdown in the growth of net credit to the government to facilitate a moderation in the growth of broad money from 32 percent in 1999 to an annual average of 18 percent during the period 2000-2002, in line with the growth of nominal GDP. The mission also stressed the need to develop market-based monetary policy instruments in order to progressively reduce the current reliance on adjustments in reserve requirements. The recent rationalization of the interest rate structure eliminated sector- specific interest rate guidelines, but commercial bank deposit rates remained virtually unchanged at 6 percent (likely in view of excess reserves), while lending rates generally tended to move Up within the prevailing range of 8-12 percent12 Until inflationary pressures subside, interest rates will need to be significantly higher. A market in treasury bills needs to be developed that would yield market-determined interest rates. Introduction of an auction in these instruments would be a first step. An interbank market in treasury bills could tirther refine the instruments available to the BoE to help mop up commercial banks’ excess reserves. While broadly agreeing with this assessment, the authorities cautioned that the transition to market-determined interest rates was likely to be drawn out over several years, citing concerns about the budget implications of higher interest rates. The mission observed that the timing of the r&forms would have to be worked out in greater detail with the expected technical assistance mission, taking into account the impact on the budget (as discussed above) and the availability of donor assistance to mitigate the cost of those reforms. 22. To increase competition in the financial sector and the efficiency of financial intermediation, the authorities foresee licensing new institutions including foreign banks. They also plan to undertake a comprehensive study of the financial sector to assess the options, including the breakup and privatization of the state-owned CBE, so as to reduce its sizable monopolistic power. With a more fblly developed money market, a reduction in the high reserve requirements (currently 20 percent of deposits), together with market returns on l2 Under the Civil Code, courts cannot award more than 12 percent regardless of what may be stipulated in a contract Thus, commercial banks have maintained maximum lending rates at or below 12 percent.

The mission urged steps to improve the legal system and other institutional arrangements, and to assist in developing loan collateral and loan recovery arrangements; it also stressed the need to monitor closely the growing stock of nonperforming loans. Moreover, the central bank needs to continue to strengthen its supervisory role, including by developing prudential and other guidelines for financial institutions and by improving the quality and timeliness of their data reporting. The mission welcomed the authorities’ decision to pursue these matters, including through the BoE’s request for Fund technical assistance to develop market-based monetary instruments and strengthen bank supervision. D. Esternal Sector Policies 24. Further liberalization of the exchange and trade system and implementation of supporting reforms are necessary to provide adequate incentives for export growth, the inflow of private transfers, and‘direct foreign investment. The exchange rate for the nakfa-which is determined as the average of the banks and foreign exchange bureau rates-was relatively stable until early 1999, as international reserves were used to defend it. Subsequent concerns with the level of reserves and the emerging greater competition among licensed dealers has led to greater flexibility in the exchange rate which the mission supported. Moreover, Eritrea’s recent loss of export markets, and the real effective appreciation of the nakfa, suggest the need for a meaningful adjustment of the exchange rate, in conjunction with prudent fiscal and monetary policies, to strengthen the country’s external competitiveness. l3 25. To foster the development of the foreign exchange market, additional banks and foreign exchange bureaus should be licensed to participate in the market. Furthermore, the Bank of Eritrea is revising and simplifying the foreign exchange regulations (which were submitted to, and reviewed by, the Fund in July 1998). When peace is restored, these actions could pave the way for a fit11 liberalization of payments for current transactions, and the acceptance of obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. I4 26. The mission commended the authorities for the proposed reform in the tariff regime aimed at reducing the number of tariff bands from 12 to 3 and the maximum rate l3 Given the uncertain regional conditions and paucity of data, a measure of external competitiveness was not feasible. I4 Existing restrictions would be eliminated if limits on foreign exchange allowances were made indicative and if bona fide requests in excess of those limits were approved expeditiously by the central bank and these changes were announced publicly.

These changes should reduce the weighted average tariff rate from 17 percent to about 14 percent and reduce economic distortions. Further reductions and simplification would need to be based on a detailed study that would also examine the scope for the expansion of government revenue from nontrade taxes. E. Structural and Institutional Reforms 27. With regard to other structural reforms, the authorities pointed to their substantial success in raising agricultural production. This success, which entailed a 38 percent increase in acreage in 1998 and the consolidation of farms, helped to extend the use of improved techniques, including better water management, to reduce dependence on rainfall distribution. These developments, together with the imminent completion of projects to remove substantial supply constraints, will significantly improve the prospects to resume growth when lasting peace is restored. The authorities added that the airport and port projects at Massawa and the prospective World Bank private sector reconstruction credit (about US$29 million, targeted mostly for export oriented production) were likely to provide better export prospects. However, the authorities also saw a need to eliminate other constraints to the development of the private sector and foreign direct investment. To this end, the mission suggested to expand and expedite the privatization program (which currently targets 39 public enterprises-see Table 5)” and dismantle the remaining price controls on imported wheat, flour, bread, and petroleum products. In particular, prices of the latter should be based on an automatic formula to continuously reflect world market conditions. Moreover, in order to stimulate investment and diversify the economic base, more intensive exploration and development of Eritrea’s natural resources (oil, gold, marble, and fishing) would be encouraged by facilitating the issuance of leases, improving the incentive structure (through an updated commercial code, tax legislation, and regulations), and strengthening the Investment Center making it into a one-stop facility. The government should also reexamine aspects of the 1997 Land Proclamation (which vested land ownership in the government), with a view to promoting the securitization and marketing of land leases (which could thus be used as collateral) and facilitate access to credit, especially in the rural areas. 28. Timely and quality economic and financial data remain critical to an appropriate policy response to the recent economic developments. The economic institutions, especially the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Eritrea, and the National Statistical Office, have suffered critical skill shortages owing to mobilization and have been unable to generate the timely data needed for the essential effective sumeillance of the economy. The proposed selective review of the mobilization arrangements to strengthen the economic institutions should also facilitate the improvement of economic data through the establishment of a technical macroeconomic unit made up of officials from the key economic l5 As of September 1999,22 nonutility public enterprises accounted for total production equivalent to about 8 percent of GNP. In addition, there are several important utilities in the public sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - institutions. The relevant officials seconded to this unit would work closely to set up the production of a quarterly report to assess broad economic developments. This unit should receive intensive training and/or technical assistance to enhance its ability to provide a permanent framework for the timely compilation and dissemination of data. The authorities intend to request Fund technical assistance in the form of a diagnostic mission that would review the improvements necessary in macroeconomic statistics. F. Medium-Term Outlook and Prospects16 29. Under the medium-term baseline scenario (2000-02) prepared by the mission, a key assumption is that peace will return before the end of 2000. On this basis, the fiscal primary deficit would be reduced from 35.8 percent of GNP in 1999 to 9.5 percent by 2002. Such an outcome would permit a substantial reduction in government recourse to domestic credit and support tighter monetary policy; thus, broad money growth is projected to decelerate from 32 percent in 1999 to an annual average of about 18 percent during 2000-02. The financing of the projected external current account deficits (including official grants, projected to decline from 2 1 percent of GNP in 1999 to 11 l/2 percent by 2002) and the buildup of official gross reserves (to the equivalent of three months of imports of goods and services through 2002) entail large external flows, inter alia, to extend the development project pipeline; nevertheless, a cumulative financing gap of about US$207 million is projected for 2000-02 (Appendix IV, Table 7). The authorities explained that while they did not rule out the possible use of Fund resources, they were not ready at this stage to consider such a request. They are planning instead to convene a Consultative Group meeting, supported by a well- articulated NEPFP. The World Bank and a number of other donors have indicated a readiness to provide an estimated US$90-100 million in balance of payments support in 2000, as well as new project financing when peace is restored, with additional support likely through the medium term. The mission stressed the importance of refraining from nonconcessional external borrowing, especially in light of the projected sharp rise in the external debt. 30. The alternative scenario illustrates the impact of delayed adjustment (either because the war lingers on or policy action is postponed). Under this scenario, the fiscal balance would remain unsustainably high at about 25 percent of GNP, with domestic interest payments exceeding those in the baseline scenario by about 3 percentage points of GNP by 2002. The external current account (including transfers) would increase to 26 percent of GNP by 2002, and external reserves would fall to about one month of imports of goods and services or lower as a cumulative financing gap of about US!!416 million is projected for 2000-2002. 16Appendix IV contains a more detailed description ofthe projections.

The onset of Eritrea’s border war with Ethiopia in May 1998 coincided with ongoing substantial development expenditures to address supply constraints. The resulting widening in the budget deficits has contributed to a sharp increase in public sector borrowing, a marked expansion in broad money, a deterioration in the external current account, and a sizable loss of international reserves. To their credit, the authorities responded to these developments with unprecedented efforts to substantially increase agricultural production, which, with the benefit of good rains, has been crucial to maintaining economic growth during 1998 and 1999, albeit at lower than historic levels. The rest of the economy, however, has been adversely affected, especially by labor shortages owing to mobilization for the war, and economic data compilation, which was weak prior to the war, has deteriorated. In these difficult circumstances, the authorities have adopted measures to strengthen the banking sector and, since August 1999, have taken commendable first steps to begin dealing with the situation. These include measures to improve budget management and public finances with the first-ever public budget in 2000; a bold comprehensive tax reform, designed with MI? technical assistance; an adjustment in petroleum product prices; and a concerted effort to address institutional capacity constraints with recourse to technical assistance, including from the Fund. 32. Although the large macroeconomic imbalances (including shortages of skilled labor owing to mobilization) will only be fully brought under control with the restoration of lasting peace, the authorities agree that strong, prompt corrective measures and reforms are essential to provide a macroeconomic environment conducive to sustainable economic growth. Moreover, these measures and reforms would need to be complemented by the formulation and subsequent implementation, of a postwar economic strategy that paves the way for a quick transition to a peace economy. In these circumstances, the staff urges the authorities to undertake the following actions: 0 Develop a postwar strategy, including plans for demobilization and settlement of refugees, to facilitate a quick reduction in defense-related expenditures and alleviate labor shortages. Concurrently, the NEPFP should be revised to include an updated assessment of the impact of the war and possible assistance from Eritrea’s development partners. It should also describe in detail specific plans to deepen and expand economic reforms and strengthen regional trade. 0 Use the first-ever public budget to promote financial transparency, to establish expenditure priorities, including realistic budgetary allocations for defense and other government services and highlighting the steps necessary to mobilize new budgetary resources. It will be important to sharply reduce expenditures to contain the government’s overall fiscal deficit to the available amounts of foreign grants and concessional loans, and in particular, to avoid financing of the budget with short-term dollar-denominated bonds because of the significant foreign exchange risk. In any case, they should substantially limit domestic borrowing requirements. It is also important that the treasury coordinate with the central bank to shift to market- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - determined treasury bill rates. Sustained prudent fiscal policy is key t‘o a possible domestic debt-reduction operation which could be supported by donors. l Reinforce the proposed tax reforms through timely action to promulgate the new Customs Proclamation and issue the related guidelines, and initiate the drafting of the Income Tax Proclamation and relevant regulations to help modernize the tax legal framework. l In addition to targeting a sharp reduction in defense expenditure when peace is attained, it would be important to focus expenditure policy on containing the wage hill, mainly by limiting wage increases and hiring. Capital expenditure should also be restricted to well-defined priority projects, inter alia, because of the limited capacity in capital-budgeting process and implementation. The government needs to step-up the pace of work in several ministries to prepare a medium-term expenditure framework in collaboration with the World Bank. l Pursue a tighter stance of monetary policy, which would be underpinned by the envisaged substantial fiscal adjustment. Since monetary policy currently relies mainly on reserve requirements, market-based policy instruments need to be developed. To this end, the staff urges the authorities to revise the Civil Code, inter- alia, to eliminate its effective cap on interest rates and introduce a treasury bill auction, with a view to developing market-determined interest rates, and mopping up commercial banks’ excess reserves. It is important also that the authorities license new institutions, including foreign banks, in order to increase competition; these steps, together with a reduction in reserve requirements, would permit the banks to reduce the large spreads between deposits and lending rates. Measures also need to be taken to improve the financial legal system and other institutional arrangements to assist in developing collateral and loan recovery arrangements. The authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance to strengthen the central bank’s capacity to conduct monetary policy and bank supervision is welcome. 8 Implement the proposed further reform in the external tariff regime. The authorities need also to pursue a more flexible exchange rate policy. In this regard, given Eritrea’s recent loss of export markets and the appreciation in the real effective exchange rate, there is a need to improve the country’s external competitiveness. When peace is restored, finther liberalization of the exchange system to facilitate Eritrea’s acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement should be undertaken. 0 Eliminate the remaining constraints on the development of the private sector and investment by expanding and expediting the privatization program and dismantling the remaining price controls. A timely strengthening of the Investment Center and converting it into a one-stop facility, and a reexamination of aspects of the 1997 Land Proclamation (which vested land ownership in the government), with a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - view to promoting and the securitization and marketing of land leases are strongly recommended. 0 Improve economic data and strengthen institutional capacity. The staffurges the authorities to undertake a selective review of the mobilization arrangements, in order to enable some skilled staff to return to the key economic institutions. This will also permit effective use of the requested technical assistance, which the staff supports. Concerted efforts to compile and provide timely data remain critical to the effective. surveillance of economic activity and implementation of appropriate policies. 33. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Eritrea be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Eritrea introduced a national currency-the nakfa-and the Ethiopian birr, which had served as the provisional legal tender since Eritrea’s independence, ceased to be legal tender as ofNovember 22, 1997. Effective May 1, 1998, the authorities put in place a mechanism to provide for a market determination of the exchange rate, with 2 commercial banks and 15 foreign exchange bureaus participating as dealers in the market. The border conflict with Ethiopia, however, placed pressure on external balances, which caused a modest depreciation of nakfa and the reemergence of a parallel foreign exchange market. VIII. Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation discussions were held during April 13-23, 1998 on the standard 12-month cycle.

At that time, the Executive Board adopted the following decision: 1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 1998 Article XIV consultation with Eritrea in light of the 1998 Article IV consultation with Eritrea conducted under DecisionNo. 5392-(77/63), adopted on April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in W/98/1 55, Eritrea maintains exchange restrictions, in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, comprising limits on travel, medical, and education allowances. The Fund encourages Eritrea to eliminate these restrictions as soon as possible. IX.

It was approved by the Board in March 1993 and made effective in May 1993 in support of the Recovery and Rehabilitation Project for Eritrea (RRPE). In 1994, Eritrea took over the legal obligations of the credit fi-om Ethiopia on becoming a member of the Bank. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) paper on Eritrea was prepared and approved by the Bank Board in February 1996, and a resident mission was opened in Asmara in February 1998. The RRPE was completed with the last disbursement made in April 1997. Current portfolio As of January 13,2000, the Bank’s portfolio in Eritrea includes a Community Development Fund (US$l7.5 million) approved in February 1996, a Road Sector Engineering Credit (US$6.3 million) approved in April 1997, a Ports Rehabilitation Credit (US$30.3 million) approved in November 1997, a Health Project (US$18.3 million) approved in December 1997, and a Credit for Human Resources Development (US%53 .O million) approved in January 1998. In view of the conflict with Ethiopia, the Bank has informed the governments of both countries that new projects will not be presented to the Board until there is progress toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In response to Eritrea’s request for a reconsideration of this stance, the Bank is examining the option of resuming selective project lending. Presently, disbursements from active projects are continuing. Lending Pipeline Preparation of projects has continued, and these include a Private Sector Reconstruction Credit (PSRC) and an Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC), as well as projects for Power Distribution, Integrated Early Childhood Development, Roads, and Malaria/HIV/AIDS, and a. Cultural Heritage learning and innovation loan @IL). A revised CAS, tentatively scheduled for June 2000, will firm up the assistance program in light of recent developments. Nonlending The Bank is also providing significant nonlending assistance through a close policy dialogue with the government and the preparation of various studies, including an export development strategy, which was recently completed. Economic sector work is also under way in both the financial and agriculture sectors. Discussions are also ongoing to commission a poverty- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38- APPENDIX II monitoring system. A Social Sector Workshop is planned in April to discuss Eritrea’s social strategy. Eritrean participants have also been involved in World Bank Institute (WBI) capacity-building activities that focus on health sector reform and financing, education reform, and banking systems development. Eritrea has expressed interest in participating in the Bank’s Global Distance Learning Network. Comprehensive development framework (CDF) Eritrea has been selected as a CDF pilot. Work on the CDF is progressing well, and the government is finalizing its National Economic Policy and Framework Program (NEPFP), which provides a long-term strategy for development through a dynamic, private-sector-led market economy. The NEPFP will provide the Bank and other partners with a blueprint for designing future interventions. The CDF work will also ensure better coordination of work and resources by Eritrea’s development partners. Eritrea plans to hold a development partners’ meeting in March-April 2000. IFC & MIGA Most of the IFC’s efforts in Eritrea have been either delayed or put on hold because of the conflict and the subsequent lack of investor interest. In fiscal year 98, the Corporation invested $0.94 million in the Tesinma Company, a $2 million coach and commercial vehicle assembling plant. Another project under consideration, ATM& a $2.2 million terrazzo and marble tile project, is currently on hold. Nevertheless, the first phase of a technical assistance project to study private sector opportunities in the banking sector has been completed, and a marble and granite study is being conducted. Technical assistance proposals for shrimp farming and the fisheries sector are also being undertaken. The IFC is also proposing a trust &nd to help strengthen the Eritrean Chamber of Commerce. Finally, there are no MIGA-guaranteed projects in Eritrea, although some preliminary discussions have been held on the mining sector.

An official consumer price index (CPI) for Asmara is under preparation, and a national CPI is under consideration. At present, a CPI for Asmara is computed, but it does not capture all price developments since the basket excludes rent, medical and other services, and utilities. There is a considerable need for technical assistance in all areas of real sector statistics. Government finance No GFS data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) or in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). Some progress has been made in the compilation of government finance data during the past two years. A GFS mission visited Asmara in April 1995 and recommended that GFS data be compiled with more detail and complete coverage of extrabudgetary operations and government transactions financed by external assistance. This would ensure a greater degree of consistency among government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The mission also recommended the compilation of data on local government operations. Monetary accounts Provisional monetary statistics are available but are not reported to STA. A multisector statistics mission (1993) recommended the establishment of a unit for the compilation of money and banking data, the introduction of call report forms, and revisions in the classification of accounts. A follow-up money and banking statistics mission was postponed twice because of a shortage of appropriately skilled counterparts at Bank of Eritrea. Balance of payments Work on the compilation of balance of payments statistics began during the multisector statistics mission that visited Eritrea in May 1993, and some progress has been made in compiling balance of payment data. The data remain inadequate. In 1995, and again in 1996, at the Annual Meetings, the Fund proposed to provide technical assistance to improve the balance of payments statistics, but the authorities requested postponement until the necessary skilled staff were in place to take advantage of the technical assistance.

A summary of the macroeconomic framework is provided in Tables 6 and 7. The two scenarios are tentative because of the uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of the peace arrangements and will need to be revised with the progress toward lasting peace. The baseline scenario for 2000-02 assumes substantial adjustment and structural reforms (as discussed with the authorities), which, with the benefit of peace during 2000, would significantly address the macroeconomic imbalances that have emerged during 1998-99. Under this scenario, it is assumed that real GDP will grow by 4 percent in 2000 and recover to 6 percent and 7 percent during 2001 and 2002, respectively. Inflation is projected to decline in stages from 10.8 percent at end-1999 to about 5 percent by end-2002. For 2000 in particular, tax reforms and exchange rate alignment are expected to result in higher inflation (the average inflation is projected to increase from 8.3 in 1999 to 9.4 in 2000). However, with the benefit of the elimination of supply bottlenecks, inflation should subside toward the end of the year to 8 percent. 35. Investment is projected to continue to decline gradually from a peak of about 40 percent of GNP in 1998 as the government cuts back its role; this decline will, however, not be fully offset by the projected increase in private sector investment from 15% percent of GNP in 1999 to 25 percent by 2002. Private sector investment is expected to benefit significantly from demobilization; the completion of major public projects to eliminate substantial supply constraints in the energy, water, and transport sectors; the comprehensive tax reform; and the proposed World Bank Private Sector Reconstruction Credit (about US$29 million, plus US$lO million in Italian co-financing) when peace is restored. It will, nevertheless, be critical that various reforms are implemented, including in the financial sector, to attract direct foreign investment by targeting also the Eritreans in diaspora. 36. A key assumption of this scenario is that the authorities will adopt a comprehensive tax reform but will only gradually phase out the income surtax, and that the introduction of a public comprehensive annual budget starting in 2000 will permit a substantial reprioritization of expenditure allocations. Thus, the fiscal primary deficit would decline from 35.8 percent of GDP in 1999 to about 9.5 percent by 2002 on the basis of an immediate and substantial reduction in central treasury capital expenditure from about 15 percent of GNP in 1999 to a range of 6.5-7 percent during 2000-02. In addition, significant, but more gradual, reductions in expenditure on material and wages would be facilitated by peace. At the same time, the budget would provide for about 1% percent of GNP annually toward demobilization costs and would provide for the government to pay market interest rates (in this exercise, assumed to be about 8 percent, given the prevailing lending interest rates in the range of 8-12 percent) on its domestic debt. On this basis, government domestic interest payments would increase from 1.4 percent of GNP in 1999 to 5.2 percent in 2000 and thereafter decrease as a ratio to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-43 - APPENDIXIV GNP more gradually. ” However, with the projected decline in the overall deficit, net government borrowing from the banks would also decline sharply in 2000. This outcome would support a monetary policy stance aimed at addressing the excess liquidity in the banking system and moderate broad money growth Corn about 32 percent in 1999 to an annual average of about 18 percent during 2000-02, consistent with a buildup of external reserves. 37. The underlying financial policies in the baseline scenario would provide for a more. favorable environment for an improvement in the balance of payments. Exports are projected to recover at an average annual rate of 28 percent, albeit from a very low base, while imports are projected to grow at an annual rate of 3.4 percent during 2000-02, reflecting the restrained government capital expenditure program. However, import composition would shift significantly to reflect faster growth in private sector requirements, as that component will rise from 25.7 percent of total imports in 1999 to 35.7 percent in 2002. The resulting large but moderating trade deficit will be partly covered by the projected growth in net service receipts and private transfers; the latter-mainly from Eritreans in diaspora in the Middle East, Europe, and North America-would grow at an average annual rate of 7.5 percent during 2000-02. The external current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to decline steadily from about 21 percent of GNP in 1999 to about 1 11% percent by 2002. Under this scenario, official transfers are expected to grow only moderately. The surplus on the capital account is projected to drop sharply starting in 2001 with the completion of loan disbursements for some large projects and the war-related delays in agreeing a new project pipeline. The overall balance of payments deficit is projected to grow significantly during the period 2000-02. Thus, the need for external financing would remain during 2000-02, so as to cushion any adverse external shocks, if the targeted buildup in official gross reserves-to the equivalent of three months of goods and services by 2002-is to be achieved. 38. Eritrea would continue to depend on external financing for some years, as evidenced by the projected financing gap of about US$207 million during the period 2000-02. Timely efforts should therefore be made to mobilize additional concessional finance in the medium term, while refraining from contracting nonconcessional external debt. The stock of external debt (disbursed) is projected to rise from about US$225 million at end-1999 (equivalent to 28.6 percent of GNP) to about US$408 million (44.1 percent of GNP) in 2002; the debt- service ratio is projected to increase from 9.3 percent in 1999 to about 58 percent in 2002. This rise in the level of external debt underscores the need for prudent debt management. 39. The mission has also prepared an alternative scenario to illustrate the impact of delayed adjustment (either because the war lingers on or policy action is postponed). Under ” An alternative assumption of a treasury bill rate of 12 percent, would increase government domestic interest payments from 1.4 percent of GNP in 1999 to 8.2 percent in 2000 and 10.0 percent by 2002. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX IV the alternative scenario, the fiscal primary deficit is projected to remain unsustainably high at about 25 percent of GNP by 2002. As a result, domestic interest payments would grow faster by 2002 that under the baseline, exceeding those in the baseline scenario by about 3 percentage points of GNP. The external current account deficit (including transfers) would widen to 26 percent of GNP by 2002, and external reserves would decline to about one month of imports of goods and services or lower as a cumulative financing gap of about US$4 16 million is projected for 2000-2002. 40. Financing the annual gaps projected in the alternative scenario would be a challenge that increases in scope with time. For 2000 in particular, the projected gap of US$70 million would in the first instance require concerted efforts to access donor assistance through increased disbursements and new project funding. Success in this area would also be important to reducing the government’s own contribution through domestic counterpart funds, which in the past has been a major reason for borrowing from the domestic banks. Additional financing would probably be sought through special campaign to increase private transfers from Eritreans living abroad and further sales of dollar-denominated bonds. Access to nonconcessional debt would probably be limited given the lack of experience in this area. It is also likely that Eritrea would incur external arrears.

IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Eritrea On 3/-/2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Eritrea.” Background Eritrea’s macroeconomic situation has been under substantial pressure since May 1998 with the onset of the border war with Ethiopia together and a concurrent, very ambitious capital expenditure program to address significant supply constraints in the economy. Real GDP growth declined steadily from 8 percent in 1997 to 3 percent in 1999 as a result of the war, which closed the border with Ethiopia and one of Eritrea’s two ports, which had served as Ethiopia’s principal port. Mobilization (of an estimated 250,000 in a population estimated at about 3.9 million) has created severe economy-wide labor shortages except in agriculture, where a special campaign and voluntary work complemented very good rains to produce record harvests in ? 998 and 1999. Inflation increased from 8.6 percent at end-1997 to 22 percent at end-1998. Inflation is likely to decline to 10.8 percent at end-l 999, partly because adjustments in the exchange rate and petroleum product prices were delayed to the end of the year and did not have their full impact on prices in 1999. The fiscal deficit (after grants) expanded sharply from 5.5 percent of GNP in 1997 to 27 percent in 1998 and is estimated to have reached 37 percent in 1999. The larger deficit reflects increased defense expenditure and relief outlays related to the conflict (for the 250,000 displaced people and about 67,000 Eritreans deported from Ethiopia), along with a very large capital expenditure program, including a number of “lumpy” infrastructure projects in the energy, water, and transport sectors. The resulting government net borrowing from the banking system contributed to a substantial increase in domestic debt, to the equivalent of 67 percent of GNP, at end- 1999. ‘* Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which foms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

The external current account (including official transfers) declined sharply from a small surplus to a deficit of just over 21 percent of GNP in both 1998 and 1999. Gross international reserves declined by US$169 million in 1998 and are projected to fall further, to the equivalent of 2.6 months of imports of goods and services in 1999, compared with 6.4 months at end-l 997. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 5 percent in 1998, and by a further 9.1 percent by August 1999. Eritrea did not inherit any external debt at independence in 1993 but has since accumulated debt estimated at equivalent to 28.6 percent of GNP at end-l 999; with declining exports (following loss of the Ethiopia market) the debt-service ratio is likely to have reached 9.3 percent at end-1999. Structural reforms were implemented during 1998-99 to eliminate sectoral limits on interest rates and introduce treasury bills but have had a limited impact in facilitating the development of market-based monetary instruments. Some progress was also made in increasing provisioning for the higher incidence of nonperforming loans as a result of the economic dislocations caused by the mobilization for the war, and the central bank has agreed with commercial banks on a program to strengthen their capital adequacy ratios over the next two years. Since August, the authorities have been preparing to introduce an annual public budget, starting with 2000, and have prepared a package of comprehensive tax reforms-with IMF technical assistance-including a lowering in the external tariffs from a maximum rate of 200 percent to 25 percent and a reduction in the number of rates from 12 to 3. Effective December 4, domestic petroleum product prices were increased by 28-45 percent to be in line with world-prices. Executive Board Assessment <Begin Typing Here> Public lnformafion Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
