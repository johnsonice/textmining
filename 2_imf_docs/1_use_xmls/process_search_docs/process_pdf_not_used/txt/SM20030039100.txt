Russell Kincaid December 4,2003 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Sana’a from June 19 to July 6 and October 2 to 14. The staff team consisted of Messrs. Chami (head), Gardner (outgoing mission chief), Ben Ltaifa, Takizawa, and Ms. Farhan (all MCD), Mr. Crowley (MFD), Mr. Medas (FAD), and Mr. Moers (PDR). The mission met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Planning and Development, the Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources, the Minister of Civil Service, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, the Minister of Electricity, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other government officials. The mission also met with the head of the Shoura (consultative) Council, members of the business forum, the head of the Women Economic Empowerment Association (an NGO), representatives of the labor union, and donors. Representatives of the World Bank office in Sana’a participated in some policy meetings. At the conclusion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on July 3 1, 2002, Directors emphasized the need for significant fiscal adjustments and faster progress in the implementation of the structural reform agenda as key to increasing growth, achieving sustainable fiscal and external positions, and reducing poverty. They noted that effective implementation of the poverty reduction strategy will require clearer prioritization and reinforcement of implementation capacity. The last Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement expired in 2001 and the staff-monitored program at end-2002. The authorities renewed their interest in resuming discussions on a program that could be supported by a PRGF arrangement. However, slow progress on some key reforms has so far precluded these discussions from beginning. The main authors of this report are Saade Chami and Nabil Ben Ltaifa, with contributions from Paulo Medas, Luc Moers, and Hajime Takizawa.

The pace of reform has since slowed down and stalled with the rise in regional tensions leading up to the Iraq war, and the legislative elections of April 2003. Real GDP growth slowed to under 4 percent in 2002-03, while inflation surged (to about 12 percent in September 2003tfueled by excessive public spending. Despite strong oil exports, the current account position deteriorated markedly, but still, international reserves remained high at about 15 months of imports at end 2002. The authorities’ policy strategy-Donors’ strong support to Yemen at the last consultative group meeting (2002) may wane if the reform is delayed further. Recognizing that inaction is no longer an option, the government unveiled a reform package that was designed to both address difficult reform measures and mobilize sufficient political support for the package. Key measures include (a) an amendment to the general sales tax (GST) and strengthening of tax and customs administrations; (b) a large reduction in the diesel subsidy towards removing it completely within two years; (c) a reduction in tariffs and taxes on cars and an increase in seasonal protection of some agricultural products; and (d) a possible increase in public sector wages. Stabilization Policies-Short-term policy discussions focused on restoring macroeconomic stability. The 2004 budget targets a 3 percent of GDP reduction in the non-oil primary deficit, while a tightening in monetary policy is needed for 2003-04. The central bank maintained the administratively set benchmark minimum saving deposit rate unchanged so far, but did not exclude raising it if inflation pressures persisted through late 2003. In the context of a flexible exchange rate and the unsuccessful attempts at targeting broad money, discussions were initiated on moving to a new monetary framework where the focus would be more on inflation outcomes (and objectives). Medium- and long-term outlook-The long-term challenges, in the absence of new oil finds, are formidable. Oil production is projected to decline rapidly and resources to be exhausted in about 20 years. Oil revenues are expected to decline by 13 percent of GDP between 2003-08. A substantial fiscal adjustment effort together with large foreign financing will be needed to maintain internal and external balances and support the PRSP objectives. An annual reduction of 1 percent of GDP in the primary non-oil fiscal deficit will be needed over the next 20 years to place the economy on a sound footing. Next steps-The authorities remained interested in a PRGF arrangement. Other forms of collaboration, the government argued, would not instill the same discipline and the needed support to push the reform agenda forward. The last PRGF arrangement expired in 200 1. Staff appraisal-Staff generally supports the authorities’ reform package and considers that a well- designed pro-growth fiscal adjustment is crucial to achieving the growth and poverty reduction objectives in the long term and maintaining macroeconomic balances. Staff welcomes the proposals to reduce fuel subsidies and amend the GST, and, at the same time, understands that for political economy considerations, reducing taxes and tariffs on cars and increasing seasonal agricultural protection, if unavoidable, would be a price to pay to elicit the needed support for the package and enhance its ownership. In view of Yemen’s limited implementation capacity and the expected dwindling of reserves in the medium term, a Fund-supported program would be useful for pushing the reform agenda forward, provided key reforms are undertaken.

After a strong initial start in the mid-1990s, the pace of structural reforms slowed down in the late 1990s and stalled in 2002-03. In the past year, the regional tensions leading up to the Iraq war and the legislative elections of April 2003 have had their toll on the authorities’ reform efforts and left their mark on economic policy and developments in the latter part of 2002 and into 2003. 2. Although the ruling party scored a major political victory in the parliamentary elections (75 percent of the seats), strong political opposition and powerful business interest groups have weighed in heavily on the authorities’ ability to reignite reforms. The narrow margin, by which the ruling party won certain important urban districts appeared to affect, at least initially, the authorities’ ability to take strong actions. Very powerful and politically influential business groups also have resisted reforms that are perceived to harm their interests, especially the introduction of the general sales tax (GST). Although many of these groups, which are well represented in the parliament, belong to the ruling party, so far business interests appear to have taken precedence over political affiliation. 3. More recently, however, the authorities’ attitude toward reform appears to have taken a positive turn. They unveiled a reform package (during the October mission) designed to both tackle difficult and long-standing issues and mobilize broad support to ensure its success. This package includes raising fuel prices substantially and amending the GST law before its implementation. To make these measures more acceptable, tax and tariffs on cars would be reduced, seasonal tariffs on some agricultural products raised, and public sector wages increased in the context of the ongoing civil service reform project. 4. Yemen continues to enjoy the strong support of the international community, but this support may wane if the proposed reform does not take hold. Donors renewed their support of Yemen’s ambitious development strategy laid out in the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) at the Consultative Group meeting of October 2002. However, they have become increasingly wary at the lack of reform progress. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTS 5. Excessive public spending ahead of the parliamentary elections of April 2003 fueled demand pressures and reignited inflation without contributing much to growth. The substantial size of the 2002 supplementary budget (6 percent of GDP) to finance the fuel subsidy, development projects, and over-commitments by line ministries (mainly public works), resulted in massive cash outlays during December 2002 and the subsequent months. This excessive spending continued well into 2003 in the context of another supplementary budget, accounting for 5 percent of GDP, fueling demand pressures (especially for nontradables) and leading to the reemergence of double-digit inflation in 2003 (Table 1).

The stance of fiscal policy measured by the non-oil primary deficit has been slipping since 2000 and has deteriorated further in 2003 (Table 2). The growth in expenditures outpaced that of non-oil revenue, leading to growing primary non-oil cash budget deficits (from 17.1 percent in 2000 to 24.8 percent of GDP in 2003). The supplementary budget for 2003 allowed 60 percent additional spending on fuel subsidy, and the remainder on development expenditures, defense and security, and wages.

Monetary policy has, to some extent, accommodated the fiscal expansion. At end-September, broad money growth was at 21 percent and is expected to remain at about 18 percent by year-end (Table 3). The Central Bank of Yemen’s (CBY) ability to sterilize excess liquidity was restrained by the limited availability of government securities and by its unwillingness to issue certificates of deposit (CDs), given their impact on CBY’s profitability. In the second half of 2003, the CBY resorted to foreign-exchange sales to mop up rial liquidity, after raising in March 2003 the reserve requirement ratio on foreign exchange deposits to absorb foreign-currency liquidity and discourage dollarization. 8. Inflation surged to 12.2 percent in September after it had retreated to 4.5 percent at end-2002. In addition to demand pressures, the small depreciation of the rial during the regional turbulence leading up to the Iraq war also had an impact on inflation, given the rapid and strong pass-through from exchange rate movements to prices. Lnflationary pressures are likely to continue in the remainder of the year with the expected pick up in private consumption during the month of Ramadan. The 12-month inflation rate at year-end is projected to remain in the 12-13 percent range. 9. Real GDP growth in 2002 was slower than projected in the PRSP, so is the expected growth rate in 2003. The worsening of the security situation following the attack on a French tanker in October 2002 dampened trade and transshipment activities in the port Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- of Aden, as well as tourism and foreign investment, while a shortage in rainfall affected agricultural production. Improvement in agriculture and higher oil production in 2003 would not be sufficient to offset the impact of these developments. As a result, non-oil GDP and overall GDP are expected to grow at 4.1 and 3.8 percent-both lower than in 2002 (Table 1). 10. The external current account position deteriorated sharply between 2002 and 2003 despite strong oil exports and lower debt service, while international reserves remained high. As a result of a sustained increase in imports and a worsening of the services account, including higher profit transfers by oil companies, the current account surplus declined from 13.2 percent to 3.9 percent of GDP between 2000 and 2002, and is expected to decline further to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2003 (Table 4). The capital account balance, however, has improved due mainly to increasing oil sector foreign direct investment and net borrowing.’ The central bank’s own gross reserves are expected to reach $4.2 billion, or 15.5 months of imports by year-end. In the first eight months of 2003, the rial depreciated by 3 percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar and by 11.4 percent against the euro. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 1.5 percent in the first eight months of 2003. There are no indications to suggest that Yemen’s competitiveness is being undermined or that the exchange rate is misaligned.

Progress on the structural front has been slow, although this could turn around soon. In addition to the delay in tax reform, reforming the budget process is behind schedule, so is the reform of the civil service. Progress is being made in computerizing procedures in three ports of entry due to the introduction of ASYCUDA (to be extended gradually to other ’ On external debt, following the 2001 Paris Club stock-of-debt reduction, the only two new rescheduling arrangements signed were those with Algeria and Saudi Arabia.

While the CBY is now in a better position to maintain and use its external debt database, using the UNCTAD Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS), little progress has been made in improving reserve management. 12. The implementation of the PRSP has been limited mostly to establishing the administrative framework, and no poverty indicators update is yet available. According to the latest poverty survey, poverty was estimated at 4 1.6 percent and extreme poverty at 18 percent of the population. A full household survey is now planned for 2005 with the assistance of the World Bank. However, efforts are underway to use preliminary indicators and proxies based on annual surveys of important sectors such as education and health, among others, to produce the first progress report in the first quarter of 2004. By looking at comparative social indicators (Table 5), Yemen fares well on some indicators, such as mortality and school enrollment rates, but has comparably higher population growth rates and lower female labor participation rates. 13. The staff-monitored program expired at end-2002 with mixed results. Two of the three quantitative targets for December 2002 were met (Table 6), while four of the nine structural reforms were not observed (Table 7). III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 14. Discussions focused on policies that would support medium-term growth and poverty reduction while securing long-term fiscal and external sustainability. In this context, discussions took up several issues including the need to (a) reduce the non-oil primary fiscal deficit through raising non-oil revenue and curbing expenditures; (b) amend the GST law; (c) eliminate the fuel subsidy; (d) improve public expenditure management; (e) accelerate civil service reform; and (f) adapt the monetary policy framework to improve its effectiveness. A. Outlook 15. While the short-term outlook appears reasonably manageable, the longer-term challenges posed by the expected loss of oil resources are formidable. In the absence of new oil finds, oil production is expected to decline rapidly beginning in 2004 and be exhausted in about 20 years. The overarching challenge then for the authorities is how to manage this limited wealth to both safeguard macroeconomic stability and respond to the tremendous development and poverty reduction needs. 16. A medium-term baseline scenario (Table S), taking into account the expected impact of the announced reform package and the PRSP objectives projects a pick up in growth rates, a slowdown in inflation, and a deteriorating external current account balance. This scenario incorporates two main policy actions: eliminating the fuel subsidy by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- 2005 and adopting the GST in 2004, which would lead to an increase in tax revenue.2 Between 2003 and 2008, oil revenues are expected to decline by 13.3 percent of GDP and crude oil exports by $1.8 billion, with gross reserves declining to about 5 months of imports. In spite of declining oil production, the growth rate would increase gradually from an estimated 3.8 percent in 2003 to 5.5 percent in 2008-a growth pattern slightly below the path targeted under the PRSP strategy-in tandem with an increase in private and public sector investment. Growth will essentially come from agriculture, transportation, and tourism (assuming an improvement in the security situation), and other services. Inflation is expected to remain in the 5-7 percent range over the medium term. With the rapid decline in oil exports, and the increase in external debt service at the expiration of the Paris Club rescheduling grace period, the current account is expected to turn around quickly, from a small surplus in 2003 to a deficit of about 14 percent of GDP in 2008. While the fiscal and external positions worsen considerably under this scenario, the debt to GDP ratio and the import coverage of reserves (more than 7 months by 2008) suggest that this scenario could be sustained in the medium term.

Over the long term, a substantial fiscal adjustment effort and large foreign financing will be needed to support the PRSP objectives and ensure long-term sustainability. In spite of a projected significant reduction in budgetary spending by about 4 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2008, the overall fiscal balance is expected to worsen as oil revenues drop much more rapidly than the increase in non-oil revenue. Given the much- 2 Under current policies, the fiscal deficit would be higher by about 7 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- needed increase in public investment over the medium term, additional foreign financing in the form of foreign direct investment and concessional borrowing will be crucial to alleviate the adverse impact of the decline in domestic saving on growth and poverty reduction objectives outlined in the PRSP. While the high level of foreign reserves accumulated to date will facilitate adjustment in the short and medium term, it is estimated, according to a long- term illustrative scenario developed by the staff, that a sharper reduction in the non-oil fiscal deficit than envisaged in the baseline scenario would be needed. Staff estimates suggest that a reduction in the non-oil fiscal deficit by about 1 percent of GDP a year over the next 20 years will be needed to place the fiscal position on a sound footing (Box 1). 18. Fiscal adjustment over the long term will need to rely mostly on raising tax revenue but also on curbing current expenditures. The challenge in the long run is to double the tax revenue with respect to non-oil GDP, and cut current expenditures by about 7 percent of non-oil GDP to make up for lower oil resources. In particular, indirect taxes could generate about 7-8 percent of non-oil GDP in additional revenue, while direct taxes may generate an additional 2.5 percent of GDP by 2025. The increase in indirect taxes would depend on adopting an efficient GST, imposing an excise tax on petroleum products once subsidies are eliminated, and improving tax and customs administration. At the same time, cutting expenditures would come mainly from eliminating subsidies, reducing defense spending, maintaining the wage bill below 7 percent of GDP, and streamlining other expenditures.3 While these are ambitious targets, they are nonetheless feasible if the reform process moves forward and if there are no major external shocks. 19. Downside risks to the medium- and long-term outlook include a slower pace of reform, lower oil prices, slower growth, and faster depletion of oil resources; on the upside, new oil discoveries and higher oil prices could improve the prospects. The downside risks related to the oil sector could be mitigated by extra fiscal vigilance and by having a far-sighted policy agenda. Favorable shocks should facilitate, but not disrupt, the reform process. B. Fiscal Policy and the 2004 Budget 20. Against the background of difficult medium- and long-term fiscal prospects, discussion of the 2004 budget focused on reducing the non-oil primary deficit to regain control of inflation and to smooth the path toward long-term fiscal sustainability. In this 3 A detailed analysis of these issues is provided in the chapter on “Fiscal Adjustment and Structural Reforms: Medium- and Long-Term Assessment” in the accompanying selected issues paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- Box 1. Alternative Fiscal Adjustment Scenarios and Sustainability Yemen needs to undertake a substantial fiscal adjustment in the long term to maintain fiscal and external sustainability. Several adjustment scenarios could lead to a sustainable outcome, defined by an adequate import coverage of international reserves (about four months) and by a non-explosive public sector debt (defined by a debt/GDP ratio of less than 50 percent). The framework links the non-oil budget deficit, the main policy instrument, to external sustainability using the level of foreign reserves as a proxy.’ Non-oil private investment is assumed to increase initially in line with the acceleration of non-oil GDP growth and grow at a more moderate pace later (to 18 percent of GDP in 2025). With constant non-oil revenue, an immediate adjustment scenario (reducing the non-oil deficit to zero) would maintain spending from oil wealth equal across generations (in real terms). This implies that the ratio of expenditures to GDP in 2003 should drop from 36 percent to only 12 percent. While this is clearly an unrealistic scenario, it illustrates the magnitude of the fiscal adjustment that Yemen has to undertake. A more realistic adjustment scenario-which incorporates the fiscal targets of the PRSP- based on both raising non-oil revenue and reducing expenditures suggests that a reduction in the non-oil deficit on average by slightly more than 1 percentage point of GDP a year will be needed over the next 20 years to maintain a viable fiscal position as oil revenue declines. An accelerated adjustment scenario based on more front-loaded adjustment achieves the same level of debt and reserves in the long run, but it will have a lower debt ratio across the period, and reserves would remain higher until the year 2015 (chart, dotted line). While these simulations do not distinguish between revenue and expenditures, it is clear that the burden would need to fall on revenue given Yemen’s tremendous development needs. In view of these needs, and the incidence of poverty, it is likely that the Yemeni authorities will pursue a slower adjustment path. Public spending-financed in large part by drawing down the country’s oil resources-should be well targeted, efficient, and lead to the accumulation of capital stock, which would in turn augment total factor productivity. While more developed economies could benefit from adjusting their fiscal positions quickly and distributing spending evenly across time to avoid income fluctuations, less-developed economies could also benefit from faster adjustments if the government could improve governance and accountability, and thus the effectiveness of public capital stocks in production over time. Under these conditions, faster adjustment leaves more wealth to be spent in later years when the effectiveness improves. ’ Non-oil budget deficit (BD,, ) is equal to non-oil savings-investment balance (S,, - INo ) minus non-oil current account balance in the absence of domestic oil: BDNo = S,, - INo - CA,. Non-oil budget deficit is linked to the level of foreign reserves through an identity that equates a change in foreign reserves (AR ) to the sum of non-oil current account balance (CA,), oil-export receipts (OIL ), and net non-oil capital inflows (K,): AR=CA,+OIL+K,,.

Staff cautioned, however, against compromising again the role of the budgetary process in setting spending priorities by issuing a supplementary budget in 2004. While using a conservative oil price assumption in budget formulation is useful to fend off political pressure for additional spending, this policy has resulted in the past, and particularly in 2002- 03, in large spending over-commitments and supplementary budgets. Since these budgets are the result of larger financing requirements for fuel subsidy, staff underscored the need for spending discipline and suggested that the 2004 budget include a contingency allocation to be used only for financing the fuel subsidy if the oil price turns out to be higher than budgeted.5 The authorities agreed in principle but had reservations on its feasibility in Yemen, fearing that any contingency allocation will subject the ministry of finance to the same pressures that this contingency is trying to avoid. 22. Staff argued for stronger tax collection efforts while keeping development and poverty-reducing spending at adequate levels. The 2004 budget, while proposing fiscal consolidation, should be more ambitious on raising non-oil revenue. In addition to implementing a broad-based GST (see below), more revenue could be collected if greater efforts are devoted to fighting smuggling, enforcing rules and regulations, and strengthening tax administration. Within the budget envelope, staff pushed for higher development spending, which remained just above 7 percent of GDP in 2002-03, than what is targeted in the draft budget. However, the authorities wanted to limit the overall deficit to less than 4 percent of GDP, given their low oil price assumption, although they would likely increase development outlays in the context of a supplementary budget. 23. The composition of expenditures should serve to enhance the effectiveness of public spending and the delivery of public services. In the past, the practice of rationing expenditures has contributed to macroeconomic stability but, in the absence of clear priorities, it has undermined the effectiveness of public spending. In this context, staff saw room for increased spending on operations and maintenance as well as on goods and services to safeguard public sector investment and enhance the quality of public services. 4 Based on staff projections, which assume a WEO-adjusted price (to take into account the quality of Yemen’s crude oil) of $24.5 a barrel. 5 The fuel subsidy is calculated explicitly in the budget as the difference between the international price and the domestic price. Thus, any increase in oil price will lead to a larger subsidy that needs to be financed.

However, in view of the current security situation, reducing security spending quickly may not only be difficult to achieve but it may have adverse effect on private sector activity and growth. Given Yemen’s participation in a concerted international effort to crack down on extremists within the country, every effort should be made to mobilize donor financial support for these expenditures. 24. The authorities indicated that they would raise diesel and gasoline prices substantially to remove the fuel subsidy within two years. As a first step, they plan to increase the diesel price by 76 percent and the price of gasoline by 30 percent.6 Although the exact timing was not spelled out, it could take place before the end of the year. In view of its financial and economic costs, staff saw a need to remove fuel subsidy sooner, but no later than early 2005, as targeted in the PRSP. The authorities and staff agreed that the subsidy was benefiting mostly smugglers, and therefore this measure should have a negligible impact on the poor (Box 2). A poverty and social impact analysis of removing the fuel subsidy is under discussion with the Department of Foreign International Development (DFID).7 In any case, budgetary allocations to the social development fund in the 2004 budget should be 24 20 16 12 8 4 0 Expenditures (in percent ofCDP) Projections = increased. 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Sources: Yemeni authorities and Fund staffprojections 2008 Civilian wages and salaries Total subsidies Development expenditure 6 The proposal is to raise the consumer diesel price from Yrls 17 to Yrls 30 per liter (with Yrls 3 earmarked to the road fund) and the price of gasoline from Yrls 35 to Yrls 45 per liter. As a result, the prices of diesel and gasoline will stand at about 70 and 110 percent of their international (ex-refinery) prices. 7 An internal research paper prepared by the ministry of planning examined the sectoral and regional impact of higher fuel prices. The paper concluded that indeed the impact on the poor is very small, and further argued that since most of the poor live in rural areas where there is less electricity coverage, they will not be adversely affected by higher electricity tariffs stemming from higher diesel prices.

Costs of Petroleum Product Subsidies l/ The budgetary cost of the petroleum products subsidy, mostly diesel, has oscillated around 4 percent of GDP in 2000-02 and is expected to reach 5 percent of GDP in 2003. Increases in world oil prices are associated with larger economic subsidies. Such procyclical tendency amplifies the effect of oil price volatility on the economy. Drawing on other countries’ experience, generally the costs of subsidies outweigh their benefits. Energy subsidies, in particular, are ill-targeted and lead to large distortions in the allocation of resources. While subsidies are usually justified on equity grounds, energy subsidies are not the best tool for redistributing income since they tend to benefit high income groups the most. These groups-as studies in other countries show-tend to consume the largest share of energy (for example Mexico and Ecuador). This is also true for Yemen. Furthermore, subsidies lead invariably to rent-seeking behavior and corruption; one of its manifestations is smuggling. In Yemen, diesel consumption increased by more than 25 percent in 2002 (while GDP grew at only 4 percent, see chart) pointing, among other indicators, to the extent to which smuggling has increased in response to price differential (diesel price was 40 percent of the international price). Smuggling is reportedly carried out by powerful people and those who have the financial means, thus aggravating the pro-rich bias of subsidies. By encouraging consumption of petroleum products, the subsidy would have a negative effect on the environment. In Yemen, this effect is exacerbated by the substitution effect between the heavily subsidized diesel and other products. Most countries impose a heavy tax on petroleum products to compensate for negative externalities (such as, air pollution and traffic congestion). For Yemen, the adverse impact on the environment and health is greater, given that diesel is widely used in old water pumps (for qat production) leading to larger production and consumption of qat with its adverse impact on health and scarce water resources. rhe considerable fiscal costs of fuel subsidy deny the poor important resources. For example, there is some zvidence that countries that have petroleum subsidies tend to have lower social expenditures (Chart). While Yemen has similar levels of health status compared with low-income countries, the level of education is lower :han its neighbors and other low-income countries, illustrating the importance of using the savings from yemoving subsidies to improve education and health standards. 19” GDP and Diesel consumption , Diesel ,’ . , , . . .’ : .’ : Life expectancy at . birth - _ - - _ Yemen --y -Low income countries ~ I I -M, East & N Africa I l/ This presentation relies on the work developed by Gupta, Clements, Fletcher, and Inchauste (IMF working paper, !002).

To reduce dependence on oil revenue, the authorities appeared ready to submit to the parliament an amended simple and broad-based GST. Proposed amendments, largely in line with FAD recommendations, include (a) limiting exemptions to a few goods to protect the poor; (b) eliminating zero ratings; (c) replacing the existing production and consumption tax (TPCS) by a single 10 percent (GST) rate; and (d) strengthening the penalty regime and modernizing the collection enforcement measures. Discussions with business groups, who have succeeded so far in thwarting this reform, have reached a dead-end and this may have strengthened the authorities’ determination to move forward (Box 3).8 26. To increase the chance of acceptance of the reform package, the authorities plan to reduce taxation and tariffs on cars and raise seasonal protection on some agricultural products. In the staffs view, the proposed reduction in the tariff rate on cars from 25 percent to 5 percent may have little impact on revenue since it would reduce the incentive for smuggling-a pervasive phenomenon in Yemen. It could also facilitate Yemen’s regional trade integration-with the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) and the GCC-and its accession to WTO. However, staff argued against the authorities’ suggestion to eliminate other taxes on cars and recommended that the existing 25 percent consumption tax remain in place until the amended GST law is adopted, at which time it could be replaced by a lower excise tax. In addition, increasing seasonal protection on a few agricultural products goes against the trend of trade liberalization for which Yemen has been praised in the past.’ The authorities responded that these measures are a small price to pay for eliciting sufficient support for the reform package, particularly the reduction in fuel subsidy and the amendment of the GST law-two long-standing important issues.” 27. The authorities also intend to increase public sector wages, but the magnitude of this increase was not clear at the time of the mission. Although the wage bill in the draft 2004 budget is set to increase by about 6 percent, a significant wage increase could be granted in the context of a supplementary budget. The authorities hired a reputable international consultant firm to examine the wage structure as part of the ongoing civil 8 The implementation of GST, originally targeted for January 2004, will likely be delayed until the amended law is adopted, which, in any case, would not happen before mid-2004. ’ The Fund’s overall trade restrictiveness index for Yemen is estimated at two, considerably less than most developing and many developed countries. lo While the reduction in tariffs and taxes on cars is designed to win the support of the influential and affluent groups, raising agricultural tariffs on a few agricultural products would protect farmers during harvest, but would not necessarily hurt the poor urban consumers who cannot afford to consume these products (e.g. grapes, apples) even in the absence of protection.

GST Reform-Concerns of the Business Community and Staff Views As part of its outreach activities, the mission met with representatives of the business community in July to listen to their concerns and help push this important reform forward. By way of background, amendments to the original GST law were introduced during the parliamentary discussions under the influence of these powerful groups. As a result, extensive exemptions and zero rating were introduced, undermining the principles of a simple and broad-based tax. Since then, staff has been recommending amendments to the law before its introduction, fearing that, if implemented as is, it may even lead to lower tax revenue. Basically, business groups pushed for delaying the introduction of the GST under the pretext that Yemen is not in a position to implement this tax in the near future. Specifically, they argued for (a) implementing the GST in phases with full implementation in about 10 years; (b) granting a grace period on the payment of GST for imports; (c) eliminating the payment of GST on imported intermediate goods for exempted final products; (d) granting zero-rating for some sectors; and (e) reducing the GST rate from the 10 percent rate stipulated in the current legislation. The mission engaged the business representatives in a discussion on all these issues, and after consultation with FAD, the following response was provided. Delaying the implementation of the GST is not justifiable and is detrimental to the reform efforts of Yemen. Discussions on the GST have been ongoing for several years, and there are urgent needs from a budgetary point of view to start its implementation as soon as possible. While Yemen may not have the best technical skills to administer this tax, staff believes that the basic infrastructure is in place and more expertise could be gained in time. In addition, the choice of a reasonable threshold would facilitate implementation and compliance. However, delaying the introduction of the GST by a few months could be justified to allow the parliament to adopt the needed amendments to the law-in line with FAD recommendations-and to strengthen the administrative capacity of the large taxpayers office (LTO). It is a common practice for countries to impose GST (or VAT) on imports without a grace period, for fear of complicating the administration of the tax and creating some loopholes. In principle, GST on imports should become immediately available for crediting against GST liabilities arising from domestic sales. While this payment would have an impact on cash flow for a short period, this should not represent a heavy burden. Zero-rating, including exemption of intermediate goods used in the production of GST-exempt final goods are a fundamental threat to the objectives of the GST. First, zero rating if granted, would exacerbate the refund problem, which is essential in making the VAT work. Second, although it is granted for some sectors in a few countries, this is a very serious loophole and a source of tax evasion that would require a strong tax administration to monitor effectively. It will also require detailed bookkeeping and documentation by the corporate sector. The payment of GST on intermediate goods-although not deductible given that the final goods are exempt from GST-is a common practice, and granting exemptions to imports would resu!t in an import bias. The GST paid would be considered an operating expense for income tax purposes. A 10 percent GST rate is relatively low if compared with poorer developing countries in the region (it is 10 percent in Sudan and 14 percent in Mauritania) or elsewhere. The GST rate should be high enough to generate the needed revenue to ease fiscal adjustment over the medium to long term in view of the expected decline in oil revenue. Introducing a GST with a lower than 10 percent rate in the early phase may be insufficient to achieve the desired fiscal adjustment. Only when tax administration is very strong and the tax base is sufficiently broad could a lower rate be considered.

Staff insisted that while improving wages is important to motivate performance and fight widespread corruption, any significant increase should be tied to progress on civil service reform (see below).

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 28. In view of the resurfacing of inflation and the expected continuation of inflationary pressures in the remainder of 2003, the CBY should tighten monetary policy. Given the limited scope for fiscal adjustment in what is left of the year, and the expected boost in private demand during the month of Ramadan, the burden of adjustment would need to fall on monetary policy. To contain the 12-month inflation rate to 12.5 percent by year-end, a slow down in monetary growth to about 18 percent (from 2 1 percent in September) is needed. Staff suggested that the CBY use all the policy instruments at its disposal, including raising the administratively set interest rate on saving deposits (benchmark interest rate), especially at a time when the real rate is approaching zero.’ * 29. The monetary authorities agreed on the need to tighten the monetary stance, but preferred to wait for clearer indications on inflation prospects before raising the interest rate. They reiterated their commitment to keep the real interest rate positive, but were hesitant on moving the floor rate on deposits-the anchor for all other interest rates- for fear of stifling investment and growth. They indicated, however, that they would sell foreign exchange more aggressively, use open-market operations to the extent treasury bills are available, and, as a last resort, issue CDs to mop up excess liquidity.t2 The staff noted that l1 The floor rate on deposits has been at 13 percent for almost three years. With expected inflation of 12.5 percent, the real rate would be 0.5 percent by the end of the year. l2 In the second half of 2003, foreign exchange interventions were used as a monetary policy instrument aimed at withdrawing rial liquidity from the system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - an interest rate adjustment could be more effective in reducing inflation since the role of foreign exchange interventions may be limited. A possible small appreciation of the rial may have little effect on prices due to the likely asymmetric price response to exchange rate movements-with pass-through rapid and strong in the case of depreciation, and slow and weak in the case of an appreciation. And, in a highly dollarized economy like Yemen’s, the very close substitution between foreign currencies and rials would render unsterilized interventions largely ineffective in affecting demand and prices. 30. Staff discussed with the central bank a preliminary monetary program for 2004 that aims at reducing the trend inflation to about 7 percent. Broad money is programmed to grow by 10-l 1 percent, consistent with a projected non-oil GDP growth of 4.7 percent, a slower accumulation of net foreign assets on account of a steep decline in oil exports (by more than $500 million). Given the lower need for budget financing, credit to the private sector would grow at a healthy rate of 27 percent. The overall inflation rate for 2004 is expected to remain in the double-digit range (11-12 percent) reflecting the one-off increase in the price of petroleum products, assumed to take place in early 2004. 31. Staff also raised with the central bank the need to eliminate the benchmark minimum interest rate on deposits, and argued that as long as this benchmark exists, it should be used more actively in the conduct of monetary policy. The authorities continued to resist the liberalization of the benchmark rate, arguing that the lack of competition in the banking sector would lead to a sharp drop in deposit rates, financial disinter-mediation, and increased dollarization. While not agreeing fully with this stand, staff suggested that in the context of the existing framework and until the benchmark rate is liberalized, the CBY should use the benchmark interest rate more frequently as a monetary policy instrument. This is particularly needed in view of the constraints imposed on open market operations by the limited availability of government securities, and the concern of the CBY that excessive issuing of certificates of deposits would have a negative impact on its profitability, which could ultimately affect its financial and policy-setting independence. 32. In discussing the general framework of monetary policy, the monetary authorities reiterated their commitment to a floating exchange rate regime. Intervention policy, they asserted, aims primarily at dampening exchange rate volatility and, to a lesser extent, at supporting the objective of price stability. Staff emphasized the positive role that a flexible exchange rate can play in responding to real exogenous shocks and in pursuing an active and independent monetary policy, but cautioned against resisting persistent pressures, which may be indicative of changes in fundamentals.t3 While the exchange rate does not l3 Yemen is a very open economy with free capital mobility and is subject to real exogenous shocks. Hence, a flexible exchange rate acts as an automatic stabilizer in the face of these shock, and allows the central bank to reduce the risks of speculative attacks caused by political and security factors, which have been frequent in the region. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- appear misaligned at this time, with the expected deterioration of the external current account over the medium and long term, full flexibility of the exchange rate would be crucial to allow the development of more competitive non-oil sectors. The CBY should hold regular and frequent foreign exchange auctions to better assess market conditions, and should play an active role in the market, including by signaling at times its readiness to buy foreign exchange. I4 33. Staff initiated discussions with the CBY on possible changes to the current monetary policy framework, while emphasizing that the primary objective of monetary policy should remain price stability. Revisiting the current framework was triggered by three main factors. First, targeting broad money has not been successful in reaching the inflation objective due mainly to the instability of money demand-a typical phenomenon in a country undergoing some changes in its financial market. Second, monetary policy has been discretionary, reacting to developments as they occur without any forward-looking policy rule. And third, monetary policy is constrained by the limited availability and effectiveness of existing policy instruments. The CBY agreed that its primary role is to maintain price stability but acknowledged that it also pursues other objectives, namely minimizing exchange rate fluctuations, and to a lesser extent encouraging economic growth through lower and stable interest rates. To achieve its objectives, the CBY uses broad money as its intermediate target, and relies almost exclusively on monitoring the level of commercial banks’ reserves at the central bank, as its operating target. However, this approach has not always been successful in reaching the broad money target or the inflation objective. l5 34. Against this background, staff engaged the central bank in a preliminary discussion on the merit of focusing more on inflation outcomes directly in the conduct of monetary policy. The CBY could give more weight to inflation (guided by a broader set of macro indicators that could pre-signal inflationary pressures) than to monetary aggregates. In the context of a flexible exchange rate, and in view of the difficulties of targeting broad money, there may be a case for pursuing an inflation objective, which would then replace broad money as the nominal anchor. Recognizing that Yemen is not in a position to adopt a full-fledged inflation targeting, moving in time to a “watered down” version of this approach could be considered. In this case, and if monetary policy continues to pursue interest rate stability and a smoother exchange rate, the short-term interest rate and an exchange rate path I4 However, because oil revenues accrue mainly to the government and are channeled through the central bank, the central bank will remain a net seller of foreign exchange to the private sector. l5 The CBY has established, based on historical trends and its own experience, a certain threshold of commercial banks’ excess reserves. Whenever these exceed the threshold, the CBY intervenes either by selling treasury bills, if available, or by issuing CDs to banks.

Despite potential implementation difficulties, this would nonetheless be an improvement over the existing monetary policy framework, which lacks clarity and is completely discretionary. The authorities were in general agreement with the staff, and agreed to continue this discussion during future visits. D. Financial Sector Assessment Update 35. The conclusion of the 2001 Financial Sector Stability Assessment Report that the financial system was not contributing enough to economic growth remains true today. While banking supervision and banking soundness have generally improved in recent years, the limit on credit concentration ratio is respected only by few banks, and financing possibilities for small- and medium-sized enterprises remain limited. Staff encouraged the CBY to (a) provide comprehensive information about borrowers to banks by broadening the CBY’s credit information registry, which presently includes data only on loans of 500,000 riyals or more; (b) further strengthen the capacity of the court system to enforce regulations; and (c) adopt a more rigorous monitoring and enforcement approach to prudential regulations, including enforcing limits on credit concentration and foreign exchange open positions. 16 36. Staff welcomed the recent adoption of the new anti-money laundering law (AML), but noted that some amendments are needed to bring it in line with international standards. In particular, the law should be amended to improve the provisions dealing with the freezing or seizing of funds as well as monitoring transactions. The scope of the law should also be expanded to cover the combating of terrorism, a required element of an anti-money laundering framework. IV. EXTERNALSECTORISSUESANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY 37. Staff stressed the importance of maintaining Yemen’s external debt sustainable, although present indicators do not suggest otherwise. External debt stands now at about 45 percent of GDP, equivalent to 90 and 97 percent of exports and fiscal revenues respectively, substantially below HIPC thresholds. At end-September 2003, its net present value was estimated at $3.6 billion (32.2 percent of GDP). The estimated debt service in 2003 is about 4 percent of exports (4.3 percent of fiscal revenues), and is expected to increase somewhat with the decline in oil exports starting 2004 and with the increase in amortization payments, as the 7-year grace period of the 1996 Paris Club agreement regarding export credit repayments expires. To make up for the loss of oil revenue and finance the substantial I6 See “Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Report for Yemen-A Follow Up” in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - development needs laid out in the PRSP, additional borrowing will be needed. Staff recommended that new borrowing should be contracted only on very concessional terms, preferably in the form of grants, to ensure continued sustainability. 38. Under the medium-term baseline scenario and different stress tests and shocks to key macroeconomic variables, the external debt remains sustainable. These shocks, introduced in 2004 and 2005, indicate that the debt burden will remain manageable (Table 9). Under most stress tests, the debt ratio would still be lower in 2008 than in 2003. It would only increase in 2008 in the case of a negative exports shock, and a combined adverse shock from interest rates, growth, and current account (to 70.2 percent from 45.1 percent of GDP in 2003).17 39. Yemen is preparing for WTO accession while signing preferential trade arrangements with countries in the region. The authorities are currently working to respond to the questions raised by the WTO on Yemen’s Memorandum on Foreign Trade Regime (MFTR), submitted in October 2002. Yemen joined the GAFTA in 2002, under which Yemen will start lowering its tariffs beginning in 2005 for full elimination by 2010. Yemen is also working to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Staff alerted the authorities to the costs and distortions arising from multiple trade arrangements and the risk that such agreements may not be WTO consistent. V. STRUCTURALREFORMSANDSTATISTICALISSUES A. Public Expenditure Management 40. Staff stressed that improving public expenditure management, particularly the budget process, is crucial to enhancing the transparency of public finances. Efforts should be made to adopt a more transparent budget process based on a medium-term budget framework and a top down approach to budget allocations, with greater flexibility for spending agencies during budget preparation. In addition, to prevent future overspending by line ministries, the staff proposed a pre-registration of all high-value contracts. The adoption of functional classification of expenditures will help improve targeting and tracking of social and poverty-reducing expenditures. The authorities responded that progress was being made in all these areas, and that the computerized accounting and financial information system being developed with the assistance of the World Bank should strengthen their efforts, although the system will not be operational for 3-5 years. l7 The combined effect of the three shocks is larger than the sum of their individual impact because of the interplay between these shocks, which by feeding into each other, have a larger negative impact on debt sustainability. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - 41. The proliferation of extra budgetary funds (EBFs) and special accounts continues to undermine fiscal transparency and accountability. The authorities acknowledged that some of these funds have evolved into pockets of corruption, and their proliferation together with the special accounts could compromise the budget control system and generate inconsistencies in the government accounts. Staff recommended a reduction in the number of EBFs with a view to include the relevant Funds-particularly those dealing with social safety nets such as the social development fund and the social welfare fund-in a consolidated budget. Following a recent survey of all the EBFs, the authorities indicated that this process could be completed by 2005. 42. Staff underscored the importance of improving the functioning of the large taxpayer office (LTO), especially ahead of the implementation of the GST. The functional structure of the LTO has been adopted, and the computerization of the LTO should be expedited. l8 Discussions also touched on amending the authorities’ proposals on self- assessment and on using modem auditing techniques based on risk assessment. 43. The weak institutional capacity at the local level may slow the process of fiscal decentralization. The ministry of finance is concerned about the capacity of local agencies to properly prepare and execute their budgets in accordance with their prerogatives as provided by the local authorities’ law. A proposal to create a sub national unit to support local authorities was awaiting the cabinet’s approval. B. Civil Service And Pension Fund Reform 44. Despite setbacks in 2002-03, the authorities remain committed to civil service reform and to achieving a sustainable wage policy. They plan to (a) begin issuing biometric cards to public sector employees-to be extended at a later stage to defense and security personnel;rg (b) reform the civil service fund (CSF) bylaws-which are now with the parliament-to eliminate its revolving door aspect, which could allow persons transferred to l8 Staff, in collaboration with participating agencies and the authorities, explored the possibility of re-allocating some of the money provided by the Technical Cooperation Action Plan 2000-2004 (TCAP) to finance part of the new computer system. The TCAP, which coordinates technical assistance provided and financed by the Fund, the United Kingdom’s DFID, and the UNDP, aims at supporting the reform effort in Yemen. lg This extension was not part of the original plan. However, the minister of civil service argued, and rightly so, that in the context of Yemen, it would be self defeating for civil service reform to exclude the military given the ease with which persons can move between the two.

Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment, but noted that the plan to hire more workers in 2004 than originally envisaged does not bode well for this reform and urged to contain new hiring until retrenchment takes place. 45. The proposed amendments to the public pension fund go largely in the right direction, but the actuarial viability of the public pension fund remains unclear. While a proposed increase in the contribution rate of 4 percent (equally shared) is welcome, the reduction in the early retirement age by five years is a setback. Staff recommended that pension benefits be based on a longer earning period than the last month of service as currently provided under the law.21 The overall viability of the fund remains difficult to assess given the absence of data on dependent beneficiaries. C. Other Structural Measures 46. Improving the environment for private sector investment requires, above all, improving governance and the rule of law. Staff welcomed the recent establishment of a supreme anti-corruption committee, although its mandate needs to be clarified. Staff recommended that anti-corruption programs be put in place to improve the environment for private sector investment. In this context, the ministry of labor’s efforts to amend the labor code with a view to eliminating the inherent bias against foreign workers and modifying some clauses regarding workers’ protection should increase labor-market flexibility and streamline its bureaucratic procedures. 47. Improving social safety nets’ targeting, and consolidating their operations are essential to enhance their efficiency. While the operation of the Social Fund for Development (SFD) appears to be effective and well targeted, the weak targeting of the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) remains an issue despite some improvements. Staff agreed with the approach adopted by the SWF to gradually expand its coverage to an additional 200,000 new households on the basis of stricter identification criteria. 2o The Civil Service Fund (CSF) was created in 2002 as part of the civil service reform package. It is funded by the budget and donors to finance retrenchment, relocation, training, and pensions. 21 An actuarial model procured through technical assistance from the Fund in 2001 enabled the authorities to explore alternative benefit and contribution plans that would restore the viability of the system.

The quality and timeliness of data should be improved and the technical assistance provided under the TCAP should be used more efficiently. Staff emphasized the importance of enhancing the quality of fiscal data, which suffer from delays and some inconsistencies, and of strengthening the external sector data following the January 2003 BOP technical assistance mission. Following the recent reallocation of the remaining funds in the TCAP, the authorities should take full advantage of this program before it comes to its term. VI. RELATIONS WITH THE FUND 49. The authorities remained interested in a Fund-supported program that could be supported by a PRGF arrangement. In their view, having other forms of collaboration with the Fund, whether another staff-monitored program or intensive surveillance, would not have as much of an impact on the country’s reform efforts and would not instill the same discipline usually associated with Fund-supported programs, even when ownership is very strong. 50. Staff responded that, while it was premature to talk about a Fund-supported program, implementing the announced package of reform measures could pave the way to initiating discussions on such a program. In addition, the authorities need to demonstrate a strong political commitment to move beyond what is in this package to address other important issues under a potential program, including public expenditure management, civil service reform, financial sector reform, and governance. While the financing needs of Yemen are small at this time, international reserves are projected to decline sharply starting in 2005 and to continue their fall as oil production declines. VII. STAFF APPRAISAL 51. Yemen embarked in the mid-1990s on a strong economic adjustment program that established macroeconomic stability and set the stage for a second tier of reforms needed to boost economic growth and reduce poverty. However, the pace of reform slowed in the late 1990s and faltered in the past year due in part to the regional tensions and the parliamentary elections of April 2003. Now that elections are over and the regional tension has somewhat subsided, it is crucial to reinvigorate the reform process to maintain the hard-won macroeconomic stability and reach the growth and poverty reduction objectives laid out in the PRSP. 52. Strong and front-loaded measures are especially needed in view of the daunting long-term challenges imposed by the anticipated rapid decline in oil resources. Increasing further dependency on finite oil revenue is unsettling for growth, poverty reduction, and macroeconomic stability. While possible new oil discoveries could improve these prospects, it is necessary, even then, not to backtrack and to carry out the intended reform. A long-term strategic policy vision should overtake short-term considerations if a disruptive and disorderly adjustment in the future is to be avoided.

Staff welcomes the authorities’ reform package, which, if adopted, would represent only a first step toward long-term sustainability. The proposed adjustment measures underlying the authorities’ policy strategy-notably cutting subsidies and reforming the GST-should begin to address two difficult and long-standing problem areas. While the merit of some of the proposed measures is debatable-namely reducing tax and tariffs on cars and increasing seasonal tariff protection of seasonal agriculture products-the authorities consider, and staff understands, that for political economy considerations, this is a small price to pay for mobilizing broad support for their reform package. 54. A well-designed pro-growth fiscal adjustment should be at the forefront of the reform strategy. To cap expenditures to levels commensurate with the projected non-oil revenue in the long term, the non-oil primary deficit should be reduced by about 1 percent of GDP per year. In this regard, the 2004 budget is reassuring as it targets a cut in the non-oil primary deficit by 3 percent of GDP-a good start on an adjustment path toward long-term fiscal sustainability. The past approach of relying on across-the-board expenditure cuts has affected negatively development spending and the efficiency of public investment. It is therefore important to focus on cuts in subsidies and other less important current expenditures. 55. Given the large development needs of Yemen, fiscal adjustment will need to rely strongly on raising non-oil revenue. The authorities intend to submit to the parliament amendments to the GST law designed to preserve its integrity as a fair and broad-based tax that is capable of generating additional revenue. While it is quite possible that the proposed law could be blocked again by powerful business groups in the parliament, it is hoped, this time, that the political resolve will triumph over vested interests. Beyond eliminating subsidies, the authorities are urged to reduce defense spending, contain the wage bill, and streamline other categories of current expenditures. 56. The authorities’ decision to raise diesel and gasoline prices substantially toward removing the subsidy within two years is commendable, but the staff is of the view that it should be removed sooner. This subsidy has become a major source of corruption and has led to significant distortion in resource allocation-including its adverse impact on water resources and the environment. Staff recommends its elimination by early 2005, at the latest, as targeted in the PRSP. 57. Any significant increase in public sector wages should be linked to progress in the reform of the civil service, to which the authorities remain highly committed despite significant delays. Staff is keenly aware of the complexities of this undertaking as well as the need to raise public sector wages to combat widespread corruption and inefliciency. Overhauling the wage structure should come only after shedding excess labor, starting with ghost worker and double dippers. Failing to do this risks making the situation worse by increasing the wage bill and reducing the incentive to push this reform forward.

Accelerating public expenditure management and improving governance are essential to the success of the reform strategy. To enhance the transparency of public finances, it is important to refrain from issuing supplementary budgets, reduce the number of extra budgetary funds, and improve the budgetary process. Fighting corruption and enforcing the rule of the law will also be of great importance for private sector investment and growth. 59. For the short term, monetary policy should be tightened to counter the inflationary pressures that resurfaced in 2003, and further efforts should be made to improve the state of the financial sector. Staff is of the view that a tight monetary policy requires adjusting the benchmark interest rate on deposits, which would send clearer signals to the market and hence be more effective than other monetary instruments in reducing inflation to its targeted level. Staff recommends that the administratively set interest rate on deposits be liberalized to give more weight to market forces in setting interest rates. In the meantime and as long as the benchmark rate exists, it should be used more actively in the conduct of monetary policy. Addressing the financial sector issues raised by the 2001 FSAP, especially the need to improve prudential regulation and respect credit concentration limits, should help encourage competition between banks and enhance their role in financing economic activities. 60. In a context of a flexible exchange rate, monetary policy could focus more on an inflation objective than on monetary aggregates. The staff supports the authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate, which can act as an automatic stabilizer in the case of real shocks, and as a shock absorber of speculative attacks precipitated by frequent political and security tensions in a troubled region. In this environment, and given the weakness in the present monetary policy framework of targeting broad money through banks’ excess reserves, staff sees merit in pursuing a clear inflation objective in the conduct of monetary policy. 61. For Yemen to overcome its formidable longer-term challenges, international support is highly needed. While Fund’s support can take different forms, given Yemen’s limited implementation and technical capacity, a Fund-supported program would be most useful in smoothing the transition toward fiscal and external sustainability beyond oil, provided that it is preceded by strong policy actions and a clear commitment to reform. Staff also believes that strong domestic efforts alone may not be sufficient to achieve the growth and poverty objectives set in the PRSP without the financial and technical assistance of the international community. 62. Yemen’s statistics are adequate for the purpose of surveillance. However, improvements are needed particularly in the balance of payments and public finances to enhance the quality of external sector and fiscal policy analysis. 63. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) was subject to the transitional procedures with respect to the EFF arrangement which expired on October 28,200l. The assessment, which was completed on May 23, 2001, concluded that the CBY’s external audit mechanism was not fully adequate, and recommendations to address the shortcomings were reported in EBS/01/172. A review of information necessary to conduct a full safeguards assessment of the CBY has been initiated, with a view to completing the assessment prior to approval of a new PRGF arrangement. VIII. Exchange Arrangements: The currency of Yemen is the Yemeni Rial. Yemen maintains an independently floating exchange rate system. Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. IX. Article IV Consultation: The latest Article IV consultation was concluded on October 15,2003. Yemen is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. X.

PARTNERSHIP IN YEMEN’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 1. Relations between the World Bank and the government of Yemen are close and cover a wide range of sectors and crosscutting themes. During the past year, Bank staff have worked closely with the government as it prepared a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Bank support included poverty analysis, assessment of growth prospects, advice on generic PRSP content issues, and support for the process of public consultations and on several specific sectors. The government has invited the Bank’s assistance in almost all areas covered by the PRSP. Coordination among donors has become more regular and has elaborated into subgroups dealing with specific sectors (civil service, water, education, etc.). Collaboration with, and support for, civil society organizations has also deepened, both directly (e.g., NGO capacity building grants) and indirectly (e.g., credits for projects employing NGOs). II. BANK GROUP STRATEGY 2. In parallel with the production of the PRSP and in support of its objectives, the Bank completed a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was endorsed by the Board on September 5, 2002. The four main objectives of the CAS are (a) better public sector governance; (b) an attractive environment for private investment; (c) building and protecting human capital; and (d) ensuring environmental stability, particularly in the critical area of water. The CAS envisages $410 million of new lending commitments in 11 credits during FY03-05. These include three credits for improving central and local government services, three for education (especially for girls) and training, three for water, one for rural roads, and one for the innovative and successful Social Fund for Development. 3. The CAS shifts to higher emphasis towards analytical and advisory assistance, recognizing that policies and knowledge constrain development in Yemen no less than infrastructure does. It features sustained non-lending support to improve public expenditure management, public procurement, public services delivery, monitoring and evaluation, the investment climate, and policies in water, power, and tourism. It adds shorter-term support for specific private sector development areas (financial sector, land registration, infrastructure for mineral exports, agricultural and maricultural exports, and coastal aquifers development), human resource development (gender, population, secondary education, adult literacy, vocational training, and children at risk), and crosscutting issues (poverty, development policy, and environment). III. STATUS OF THE PORTFOLIO 4. As of October 3 1, 2003, the International Development Association (IDA) had approved 128 projects for Yemen for a total of $2,173.2 million of which $1,558.8 million have been disbursed. The current portfolio includes 18 projects with total commitments of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - APPENDIX II $679.8 million, of which 503.4 million are undisbursed. About 22 percent (by value) of the portfolio is dedicated to the water sector, 18 percent to education, 4 percent to health sector, 4 percent to public sector management, 7 percent to transportation, 10 percent to urban development, 12 percent to agriculture, 8 percent to electricity/power/energy, and 15 to social protection. 5. Overall performance of the current portfolio is satisfactory. Through intensive supervision efforts, the share of projects at risk (currently at 16.7%) is expected to decrease during this fiscal year (FY04). The implementation capacity of the government and its uneven programming of public expenditures remain constraints on project execution and sustainability of development impact. 6. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has three active investments in grain processing, ceramic tile manufacturing, and bottled water totaling $15.4 million, of which about US$l 1 million has been disbursed. Problems with the investment environment limit IFC activities in Yemen and (as in the case of the grain processing project) impede implementation and profitability. Nevertheless, IFC continues to seek out assistance opportunities in both technical advice (e.g., privatization of state-owned enterprises) and investments (e.g., leasing). IV. BANK-FUND COLLABORATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS 7. Bank and Fund staffs consult regularly and coordinate their positions and activities. A major activity over the past year was assistance to the Yemeni experts who produced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and subsequently collaboration on a Joint Staff Assessment of it. In addition, the staffs have worked closely together on civil service reform and government financial management, and in particular, budgeting and public expenditure modernization. Collaboration on these issues is expected to intensify. Bank and Fund staffs have also collaborated on financial sector development issues, with the aim of restoring financial stability (by now largely achieved) and removing constraints on economic development.

The Republic of Yemen has participated in the General Data Dissemination System since April 26, 2001. While some progress has been made, significant work remains to be done before major improvements can be seen. The most reliable and timely data are those on the monetary sector produced by the central bank, which provide the foundation for the estimation of the other macroeconomic data. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) disseminates data on total official reserve assets with a lag of one week and is in the process of compiling the Reserve Template with data on reserve and foreign currency liquidity. The authorities should aim to disseminate the Reserve Template with a monthly periodicity with no more than a one-month lag. To strengthen monetary statistics further, the multisector mission in August 2000 recommended that (a) repurchase agreements should be treated as collateralized loans; (b) all nonstandard loans should be reclassified in claims on the relevant sector; (c) counterparty for several monetary accounts need to be more accurately identified; and (d) a number of monetary accounts should be disaggregated so as to present position on a single financial instrument. Accordingly, since June 2003 the authorities have been submitting further disaggregated data to STA on the basis of which the monetary statistics were revised. The October 2003 issue of Mernational Financial Statistics incorporates final revisions. Although important progress have been achieved in terms of coverage, classification, and compilation methods of national accounts in accordance with the System ofNational Accounts 1993, significant work remains to be done for further improvements of data quality and compilation methods. With the technical assistance provided by STA on real sector statistics in the last two years, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) has completed compilation of national accounts for the years 1999-2001, including the current and capital accounts by institutional sector, the goods and services account and the integrated economic accounts for the total economy, and supply and use tables (SUT). Database preparation for compiling preliminary 2002 accounts is ongoing. Unlike previous estimates, most of the production and expenditure estimates are now based on direct methods that mainly use the results of recently conducted surveys. Looking ahead, quarterly establishment sample surveys are planned to provide short-term indicators for moving to annual benchmark series. Additional work is still needed to ensure the accuracy and the speed of collecting and processing survey results, to conduct new surveys in areas uncovered, to better identify the informal sector and the unorganized units and to update survey samples to improve coverage. With regards to price statistics, some improvements have been made in the CPI compilation. However, other price indices have not been developed due to the limited human and financial resources. With the assistance of the real sector mission by STA, the CSO has constructed a CPI that is consistent with international standards. The weights were derived from the 1998 Households Budget Survey. The CPI has a broad geographic coverage and a sufficient Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX III number of consumption items, although some deficiencies remain in data collection practices. The real sector mission recommended further improving the sources of data in general, expanding the price statistics to cover different areas, and enhancing training and internal coordination within the CSO. In the fiscal accounts, data reliability is uncertain, and timeliness is weak, particularly for detailed revenue and expenditure items. There are also discrepancies between reported budget data and below-the-line financing data obtained from the monetary statistics. Since the beginning of 2000, fiscal data have been prepared according to GFS economic classification, and monthly reports are available, albeit irregularly, on the subchapter level. Further progress, particularly in providing expenditure data based on GFS functional classification on a chapter and subchapter level, should be achieved with the installation of the interim World Bank financed Accounting and Financial Management Information System (AFMIS), which is being implemented as part of FAD technical assistance in public expenditure management. The budget advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Asif Bajwa, is assisting the authorities with this task. The latest data reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are forward estimates for 1999. The CBY compiles and disseminates balance of payments statistics, including, recently, the international investment position statistics, broadly following the Balance ofPayments Manual, fifth edition. However, the tasks are performed on a rather ad hoc basis, mostly relying on survey-based questionnaires whose response rates are generally poor. The quality of the questionnaires themselves is also weak due to the limited expertise and experience. Inadequacies in financial, staff, and computer resources dedicated to balance of payments compilation further hamper the quality of data. The CBY publishes quarterly external debt statistics within one quarter of the reference period for the banking sector, general government, and monetary authority. A STA mission on balance of payment statistics in January 2003 found that little progress had been made in implementing the action plans recommended by the IMF’s resident advisor on balance of payments statistics (1998-2000). The coverage of the oil industry transactions remains weak. Surveys on direct investment and selected services, which were started with the technical assistance advisor’s assistance, were either discontinued or not followed up. Weak coordination between the CBY and other government agencies (such as the Customs Authority, the CSO, the Ministry of Planning, and the Ministry of Oil and Mining Resources) were also responsible for the slow progress. The STA mission recommended a new work program to be carried out over a period of 22 months. The plan calls for, among others, better coordination between the CBY and other government agencies for more timely and effective data collection and compilation, improved staffing and training, and reinstituting discontinued surveys. Only a few of these recommendations have been implemented by the CBY so far, but additional staff resources have been committed for compiling the balance of payments very recently.
