Real GDP growth has averaged 3% percent a year since the mid-1990s, somewhat above the annual population growth rate but insufficient to improve living standards. Higher growth has been hindered by stagnant investment, a shortage of skilled labor, and inefficient public enterprises. Unemployment has remained high, particularly among the young and unskilled. 0 The fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate sharply from 1% percent of GDP in 2000/01 to 5% percent of GDP in 2001/02 (April-March), reflecting higher current expenditure and a large transfer to Air Namibia. As a result, the ratio of government debt to GDP is expected to reach close to 25 percent-the limit publicly announced by the government as a prudent benchmark for budget planning and management. Budgetary pressures are likely to intensify in the coming years in view of an expected decline in tariff revenue and pressing social and economic needs. l Achieving fiscal sustainability will require expenditure restraint, including a significant reduction of the wage bill and financial support to public enterprises, and a further improvement in revenue collection. A reorientation of spending toward social and economic services is also needed, in part to address the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The authorities intend to limit the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2002/03 and government debt to no more than 25 percent of GDP over the medium term. l Boosting Namibia’s growth potential will require higher investment and better utilization of resources. In light of the inefficient public enterprises and persistent high unemployment, efforts will need to be geared toward strengthening public enterprise performance, including through privatization, streamlining labor market regulations, and encouraging faster private sector growth. a The peg of the Namibia dollar to the South African rand has served Namibia well in securing broad financial stability. To sustain the present exchange rate regime, the authorities will need to pursue a sound fiscal policy and structural reforms, which are necessary to maintain competitiveness while achieving higher growth. It would be desirable to gradually increase the level of official reserves over the medium term. l Namibia has made good progress in meeting the General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS) requirements and has expressed interest in participating in the Report on Observation of Standards and Code (ROSC) data module. Namibia’s core statistical data are generally adequate, but serious weaknesses remain. Further efforts are required to improve data quality and the reporting frequency of key economic and financial statistics.

The 200 1 Article IV consultation discussions with Namibia were held in Windhoek during November 6-20,200 1.’ The staff team held discussions with the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Namibia, and other senior officials, as well as with representatives from the private sector, that focused on (i) economic and financial developments in 2000 and 2001; (ii) the economy’s short-term prospects in light of the slowdown in global growth; and (iii) the medium-term challenge of achieving fiscal sustainability and raising the economy’s growth potential. 2. In concluding the 2000 Article IV consultation with Namibia on October 13,2000, Executive Directors stressed the need to raise economic growth by fostering the development of the private sector through an easing of the heavy tax burden, the privatization of state- owned enterprises, and increase in wage flexibility. Additionally, Directors emphasized that a sustainable fiscal strategy must address the issue of personnel expenditure and urged improvements in the efficiency of the public sector through a streamlined civil service, greater operational efficiency, and strengthened expenditure control. These measures would facilitate a desirable redirection of budgetary outlays to health and education, particularly in view of the HIV/AIDS crisis and the need to enhance the skills of the labor force. 3. Namibia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. It has never made use of Fund resources. Summaries of Namibia’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are provided in Appendices I and II, respectively. Appendix III reports on statistical issues and Appendix IV on social and demographic indicators. A draft public information notice is provided in Appendix V. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTSANDSHORT-TERMOUTLOOK 4. Namibia’s annual per capita income (US$2,000) is among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, but its income distribution is highly skewed, and about half of the population lives on less than US$2 a day.2 Since the mid-1990s, real GDP growth has averaged 3% percent a year, broadly in line with the growth rates in the region (Table 1) and somewhat above the annual population growth rate of about 2% percent. Faster growth has been hindered by ’ The staff team comprised Mr. Lin (Head, TRE), Mr. Akatu (AFR), Mr. Mfunwa (AFR), Ms. Kandil (TRE), and Ms. Cone11 (Assistant, AFR). Mr. Reitmaier (AFR) participated in the discussions during the second week of the mission. 2 The World Bank ranks Namibia among the countries having the highest Gini coefficients (0.7). A 1993 national household income and expenditure survey, the latest available, showed that, although 10 percent of households had average annual income per head of N$30,000, the average per head for all other households was N$1,500, of which one-third had an annual income of less than N$500 per head.

Partly as a result, unemployment remains high and concentrated among the young and unskilled. Table 1.

This arrangement has served Namibia well, contributing to broad financial stability (Figures 1 and 2). Figure 1. Consumer Price Inflation, 1996-2000 Figure 2.

Namibia has consistently maintained a current account surplus in recent years, as persistent trade deficits have been more than offset by income receipts from overseas investments and transfers of SACU revenue (Figure 3). Mining (mostly diamonds) and fishery exports account for about three- fourths of total export earnings and, as a result, export growth has been vulnerable to fluctuations in world commodity prices and changes in the value of the rand. South Africa is Namibia’s dominant trading partner, accounting for more than 80 percent of Namibia’s imports and one-third of its exports.4 r Figure 3.

Economic performance in 2000 was broadly in fine with recent trends. Real GDP rose by 3 ?4 percent, the budget deficit fell to 1% percent of GDP, reflecting buoyant diamond receipts and underspending on capital outlays, and the external current Table 3. Namibia: Selected Economic Indicators, 19962001 account recorded a surplus of 5 percent of GDP (Table 3). The 12- month rate of inflation increased from 8 percent in 1999 to 10% percent in 2000, owing in part to an increase in domestic fuel prices (of 12 percent).

Developments in 2001 point to somewhat weaker growth and lower inflation. Real GDP is likely to have increased by less than 3 percent for the year as a whole, reflecting lower agricultural growth and a possible decline in fishing output. Moreover, downside risks increased as the world growth weakened, aggravated by the September 11 events in the United States. Partly reflecting lower oil prices, the 12-month rate of inflation fell to 8% percent at end-December. 10. For the first time since independence in 1990, the 2001/02 budget was presented in the context of a rolling three-year expenditure framework. The medium-term approach to budget preparation was intended to strengthen fiscal management, especially expenditure 4 Other major export markets are Europe, Japan, and the United States.

The main guiding principle for the budget was to limit the ratio of government debt to GDP to no more than 25 percent. The original 2001/02 budget envisaged a deficit of about 3% percent of GDP, and the budgets for 2002/03 and 2003/04 (cast in 2000/01 constant price terms) targeted deficits of 3 percent of GDP. 11. Preliminary information available suggests that the budget deficit in 2001/02 will rise significantly to about 5% percent of GDP (Table 4). Notwithstanding continued high diamond receipts and reportedly strong value-added tax (VAT) collections, the ratio of revenue to GDP is expected to fall from the 2000/01 outturn (although it will still be higher than the original 2001/02 budget), as SACU revenue declined relative to GDP. Expenditure is expected to increase sharply on account of a larger wage bill than budgeted, a substantial amount of equity lending to Air Namibia, and onetime allowances for military personnel withdrawn from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A supplementary budget was approved in October, providing for additional allocations of N$674 million (2% percent of Table 4.

As in the past, the fiscal deficit in 2001/02 is expected to be financed mostly by treasury bills and bonds, and, as a result, the ratio of government debt to GDP is expected to reach 24% percent.5 12. Given the peg to the rand, the scope for independent monetary policy in Namibia is limited. In line with developments in South Africa, monetary conditions eased over the course of 2001, and the central bank rate was reduced three times by a total of 200 basis points (from 11% percent at end-December 2000 to 9% percent at end-October 200 1). Broad money grew by about Table 5. Namibia: Monetary and Credit Developments, 199fS2001 (Percentage contribution to 12-month rate of broad money growth) 8% percent in the 12 months to November, largely attributable to a strong expansion of consumer loans (Table 5). Between Broad money growth September and December, the Net foreign assets Net domestic assets Namibia dollar, following the Ofwhich: private sector South African rand, depreciated by about 30 percent against the U.S. dollar.

The external current account is estimated to have registered a surplus of 4% percent of GDP in 2001, as an increase in diamond and fish exports is expected to have largely offset the decline in SACU receipts. Reflecting continued large portfolio investments in South Africa, mainly by pension funds and life insurance companies, official reserves are expected to have declined somewhat in U.S. dollar terms (equivalent of about 1% months of imports). 14. Namibia’s near-term outlook appears encouraging. Indications are that any short- term impact of the global slowdown may be limited and likely to be felt only in the first half of 2002. Barring any further deterioration in the external environment, real GDP growth in Namibia in 2002 could rebound to about 3 percent. The prospects for stronger growth beyond 2002 reflect the expansion of offshore mining activity, the operation of a new zinc mine expected in 2003, and foreign direct investment inflows associated with the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act. Namibia also has strong tourism potential, which has yet to be fully developed. However, the external current account is projected to record a smaller surplus in the near term than in recent years, as the expansion in exports of mining, fishery, and nontraditional products is likely to be offset by lower SACU receipts (Box 1). 5 The Bank of Namibia is prohibited from providing credit to the central government, and, therefore, the main sources of financing for the budget are treasury securities and, to a lesser extent, concessional foreign borrowing.

Namibia: Restructuring of the SACU A new SACU agreement, replacing the one in place since 1969, was initialed by Ministers on October 9,200l and is expected to go to parliament for ratification in 2002. The new agreement contains two major revisions: first, the policy on common external tariffs will be set by all SACU member countries rather than solely by South Africa; and second, the revenue-sharing formula will incorporate an explicit “development component” for the benefit of smaller SACU members. With respect to the first revision-concerning SACU policy setting-the SACU Council of Ministers will approve customs tariffs and other trade-related issues on the basis of recommendations from the Customs Union Commission and SACU Tariff Board (a new and independent institution containing experts from the member states). A new secretariat will be established to handle the day-to-day administration of SACU. With respect to the second revision-revenue sharing-the new formula retains most of the allocation mechanisms of the old formula while narrowing the floor to individual countries’ receipts. To offset the potential impact on member countries of the expected decline in the size of the revenue pool, a development component will be introduced into the formula, allocating a constant share of total excise tax receipts between the members. The key elements of the new formula are as follows: l Customs revenue sharing. Customs revenue will be allocated in line with the relative size of each member country’s imports in total SACU imports. . Excise sharing. The excise pool (excise duties remaining after provision is made for the new development component) will be distributed in proportion to each member’s GDP, which serves as a proxy for consumption of excisable goods. . Development component. A fixed share (initially set at 15 percent) of total excise revenue will be set aside to finance a new development component. Each member will receive an allocation dependent on its per capita GDP relative to the rest of SACU. In practice, each country will receive approximately 20 percent of the total, implying substantial redistribution from South Africa to the smaller members. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 15. Discussions focused on the medium-term challenges of(i) achieving fiscal sustainability; and (ii) raising the economy’s growth potential to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty. The task of reducing fiscal imbalances-and imposing expenditure restraint-has become more urgent in light of the weakening in government finances in 2001/02. A. Fiscal Policy 16. The mission welcomed the medium-term orientation of budgetary management adopted in the context of the 2001/02 budget and supported the guiding principle of limiting government debt to no more than 25 percent of GDP. However, it expressed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lo- concern over budgetary developments in 200 l/02, especially the sharp increase in personnel expenditure and financial support to public enterprises (mostly to Air Namibia), which raised questions about the composition of expenditure and the direction of fiscal policy. 17. The authorities acknowledged that the fiscal difficulties facing the government were attributable to the large size of the civil service and the policy of providing financial support to public enterprises, including in the form of loan guarantees. From 1996/97 to 2001/02, total approved , government positions (including funded and unfunded) increased by 22 percent, and, in 2001/02 alone, a Table 6. Personnel Expenditure, 1996/97-2001/02 (In percent of GDP) net increase of 4 percent was Est. approved.’ As a result, personnel 1996/97 1997/98 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 2001/02 expenditure remained high, accounting for about 45 percent of total expenditure and 16% percent of GDP over the past five the years, highest level among the SACU Namibia Botswana Lesotho SouthAfrica Swaziland 17.2 16.4 16.4 16.9 16.3 16.5 8.2 8.6 10.2 10.0 9.5 9.1 14.3 15.1 16.5 -- - --^ -- - IL.4 II./ 1U.B IL.4 IV.8 11.11 14.6 14.5 14.2 12.1 12.0 11.7 10.6 10.3 10.1 4-1 4.m .A” 4-1 <An ..D countries (Table 6) . 18. Compounding the budgetary pressures have been a number of loss-making public enterprises, chief among which are Air Namibia and TransNamib. Financial support to these enterprises, in the form of budgetary transfers, direct loans, equity lending, and guarantees, has increased substantially in recent years. In 2001/02, total budgetary transfers and equity lending are expected to amount to N$6 18 million (2% percent of GDP). Moreover, outstanding government guarantees to public enterprises are estimated to have reached N$3.1 billion (1 13/ percent of GDP) in 2001/02, posing a threat to fiscal viability.7 19. In light of these developments, the authorities recognized that, unless appropriate policy measures were put in place soon, budget performance would further deteriorate in the years ahead. In a baseline scenario with no adjustment measures, the fiscal deficit in 2002/03 would likely remain at about 5 percent of GDP and would rise 6 At the beginning of 2001/02, cumulative vacant positions totaled 10,983, 12 percent of all approved government positions. Of the available vacancies, 4,603 were funded in the budget of 2001/02 but unfilled, while 6,380 positions were approved but unfunded. 7 Of this amount, about three-fourths has been extended to external creditors and the rest to domestic lenders. Among external guarantees, more than one-half has been extended to the African Development Bank, European Investment Bank, and bilateral official credit agencies, with the remainder extended to a private creditor in connection with the purchase of an airplane by Air Namibia in 1999.

The prospect of the rapid accumulation of government debt could undermine financial stability, with adverse consequences for growth and poverty reduction. Table 7.

Achieving fiscal sustainability over the medium term would require a strategy aimed at (i) curtailing the size of the wage bill; (ii) strengthening expenditure control; (iii) reducing financial support to public enterprises; and (iv) boosting revenue. These measures would need to be accompanied by efforts to redirect spending toward social services and economic infrastructure. The authorities emphasized, in particular, the need to restrain current expenditure and improve revenue. 8 The projections are based on an assumed average annual real GDP growth rate of around 3 % percent, continued strong diamond and VAT collections, and no immediate measures to curb government expenditure, particularly the wage bill.

The authorities indicated that efforts would be made to curtail personnel expenditure in 2002/03 and over the medium term. While the scope to reduce spending in the 2001/02 budget year was limited, the Ministry of Finance had already impressed on line ministries and government agencies the need to postpone the filling of vacant positions. Moreover, the authorities recognized that achieving a sustainable wage bill over the medium term would require a reduction of the civil service through greater scrutiny of new civil service positions and the adoption of an early retirement program (expected in 2002/03). The mission urged the authorities to consider implementing the recommendations of the Wages and Salaries Commission in its 1997 report, which call for a 2 percent reduction in personnel expenditure per year over a five-year period and elimination of all unfunded vacancies. These recommendations have not lost validity, and their implementation would go a long way toward achieving a sustainable wage bill over the medium term. The mission also encouraged the authorities to undertake a review of the wage structure of the civil service with an aim to achieve a sustainable wage bill without jeopardizing an eflicient, motivated, and professional civil service. The authorities noted that, while the size of the civil service was indeed unsustainable, a gradual reduction would be desirable in light of the prevailing high unemployment. 22. Successful fiscal consolidation would also require the further strengthening of budget management and expenditure control. The authorities explained that some measures had been put in place to strengthen cash-flow planning by the Cash-Flow Committee and the performance of government agencies through the establishment of the Performance Effectiveness Management Program in the Office of the Prime Minister. While supporting these measures, the mission recommended that consideration be given to streamlining responsibilities in expenditure management among government agencies and that greater authority be given to the Ministry of Finance to enforce line ministries’ spending limits. Moreover, it urged the authorities to exercise greater restraint in approving additional allocations through midyear supplementary budgets, even in the face of stronger-than- budgeted revenue outturn. 23. In light of the experience with Air Namibia, the authorities have taken steps to strengthen the performance of public enterprises and curtail financial support by the government. These include the establishment of a new Cabinet Committee to assess the problems facing public enterprises; a new unit in the Ministry of Finance to strengthen debt management and monitor public enterprise performance; the restructuring of Air Namibia; and collaboration with International Finance Corporation (IFC) staff on a study to identify public enterprises for divestiture and privatization. The authorities also agreed that any new financial support to public enterprises, including government guarantees, would be strictly limited. The mission underscored, in particular, the substantial fiscal implications of guarantees to public enterprises and urged that any new guarantees be extended only on an exceptional basis. 24. In addition to expenditure restraint, the authorities stressed the importance of further improving tax and nontax revenues. However, in view of an already heavy non- SACU tax burden, the scope for revenue mobilization through new measures appears to be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- limited. Thus, they indicated that efforts would focus on strengthening VAT compliance, improving the efficiency of the tax system, and broadening the tax base. In this context, l The mission commended the authorities for the successful implementation of the VAT, and agreed that intensified staff training and field inspection should help improve compliance. However, it cautioned against reducing at this stage the 30 percent rate applying to luxury goods to the standard rate of 15 percent without adopting offsetting revenue measures. l The mission supported the plan to conduct a comprehensive tax review aimed at strengthening the efficiency of the tax system and administration. The review should extend to all incentives and concessions accommodated by the tax system and the dividend policy for public enterprises. l The authorities stated that they also intended to introduce other measures to improve tax collection, including a proposal to introduce a withholding tax on investment income and to collect income tax directly from pension funds instead of pensioners. 25. The authorities agreed that urgent efforts would also be required to redirect budgetary resources to health, education, and other social needs, as well as basic economic services. As Table 8 indicates, the rapid increase in expenditure on general government services in recent years has crowded out necessary spending on social needs and economic infrastructure (Table 8). Increases in expenditure in these areas would be crucial to achieving higher growth and reducing poverty over the medium term. Table 8.

In sum, the authorities expressed their intention to limit the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2002/03. As illustrated in Table 9, this would imply that, in line with revenue projections, total expenditure in 2002/03 would need to decline by about 4 percentage points of GDP from 2001/02. The authorities considered this to be difficult but achievable, as the revised 200 l/O2 estimates included nonrecurrent expenditure of about N$l billion (3% percent of GDP).’ Excluding these nonrecurrent expenditures, the ratio of expenditure to GDP in 2002/03 would decline by about % of 1 percent from 2001/02. While no concrete budget proposal was available regarding the composition of expenditure for 2002/03, the authorities noted that the implied reduction in the wage bill under the scenario was possible, and could be achieved in part by the elimination of nonrecurrent expenditure in 200 l/O2 and cancellation of some vacant positions.

Over the medium term, the authorities reiterated their determination to keep government debt within 25 percent of GDP. Against this background, the staff proposed a medium-term scenario that contained the adjustment necessary to achieve the authorities’ objective. The scenario is based on the assumptions that real output growth will strengthen ’ These were related to the transfer to Air Namibia, allowances for military personnel withdrawn from the DRC, and other exceptional current outlays. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- over the medium term, reflecting the expansion of offshore diamond recoveries and an increase in other mining operations and manufacturing activities, which, in turn, will be boosted in part by foreign direct investment inflows; the impact of HIV/AIDS on growth, meanwhile, is likely to be felt in a longer run. On revenue, SACU receipts are assumed to remain unchanged at the 2001/02 level in nominal terms, but will decline as a percent of GDP; this decline will be partially offset by a strengthening of other revenues. Expenditure is projected to fall steadily relative to GDP, supported by a reduction in the wage bill (to the current level in other SACU countries by 2006/07),10 transfers to public enterprises,” and interest payments. These reductions are necessary to permit an increase in capital expenditure and social spending and to achieve the objective of limiting government debt to no more that 25 percent of GDP. The authorities considered the staffs illustrative medium-term adjustment scenario plausible and agreed broadly with the scope of adjustment required to achieve fiscal sustainability. B. Financial and External Sector Policies 28. The mission concurred with the authorities’ view that the peg to the South African rand had served Namibia well. However, it underscored the importance of achieving fiscal sustainability to ensure that confidence in the peg was maintained. In this context, the mission also discussed the appropriate level of official reserves. The authorities pointed out that, while Namibia had historically maintained a relatively low level of reserves (an average of 1% months of imports since the mid-1990s), this low level did not affect confidence in the peg because of the country’s stable political and economic systems and very close economic and financial links with South Africa. They agreed, however, that a gradual increase in the level of reserves would be desirable over the medium term. 29. The Namibia dollar, following the South African rand, has experienced a sizable depreciation against the U.S. dollar in recent months. It is expected that the depreciation should have minimal trade effects as over 80 percent of Namibia’s imports are from South Africa, while its share of exports to South Africa is considerably smaller. Indeed, a weaker Namibia dollar, if sustained in real terms, should boost exports and tourism, with beneficial effects on output and employment. The depreciation should also generally have a positive impact on the budget, reflecting mainly higher diamond taxes and royalty fees. On the other hand, the effect of the depreciation on prices and wages could be significant, depending on the authorities’ policy response. i” A reduction of the wage bill from 14% percent of GDP in 2002/03 to 12% percent of GDP in 2006/07 would imply that personnel expenditure would grow by an annual average of 6% percent in nominal terms, in line with the assumed rate of inflation. l1 Assuming that transfers to public enterprises will be significantly reduced, while resources for social needs and poverty reduction will be safeguarded.

The risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio has averaged 13 percent in recent years, the ratio of nonperforming assets to outstanding loans for most banks is low (about 2 percent, except for one small bank), and the banking sector as a whole is profitable.12 Banking supervision has improved and will be further strengthened through intensified on-site inspection, while the newly established independent regulatory body, the Namibian Financial Institution Supervision Agency, should help strengthen supervision of nonbank financial institutions.13 31. The mission shared the authorities’ view that, given Namibia’s heavy dependence on diamond and fish exports, efforts were required to diversify exports into other areas; it also agreed that this could be achieved in part by taking advantage of the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act, which promised access to the U.S. market.i4 Over the medium term, the structural reforms outlined in the next subsection are crucial to expanding the export base, encouraging investment inflows, boosting productivity, and strengthening Namibia’s external competitiveness. 32. Namibia maintains a relatively open trade and exchange system and has experienced no market access barriers in its major export markets. The authorities explained that, in addition to the SACU’s relatively low common external tariff (CET), Namibia’s imports and exports were not subject to nontariff barriers. l5 Namibia rates as “moderate” in the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index. The authorities expressed their support for opening a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. 33. The authorities reiterated their intention to move forward with the establishment of an offshore financial center. The mission considered the potential benefits of such a center to be limited, against the considerable costs and risks involved, I2 Three of the five commercial banks in Namibia are subsidiaries of banks in South Africa. l3 Commercial banks are supervised by the Bank of Namibia, and it is envisaged that all commercial banks will be subject to on-site inspection at least once a year. Nonbank financial institutions in Namibia are supervised by the independent Namibian Financial Institution Supervision Agency. l4 An agreement has recently been signed with a foreign investor involving an investment of about US$lOO million to produce textile and garments in Namibia for exports. The first shipment of exports is expected in mid-2002. The project is expected to generate about 1,800 jobs when production reaches its full capacity. l5 In 2000, the SACU’s CET averaged 13 percent, and about 98 percent of products were bound under the World Trade Organization rules. Effective January 1, 2000, the CET on 86 percent of imports from Europe was reduced and will be eliminated over the next decade. In addition, agreement on free trade within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has been reached.

It questioned whether Namibia had the labor force and supervisory capability needed to make such a center a success. The authorities expressed interest in a Fund technical assistance mission to assess the plan for the proposed financial center. C. Structural Issues and Private Sector Development 34. The authorities recognized the challenge they faced in bolstering growth, increasing employment, and reducing poverty. The government’s medium-term strategy rightly aims at encouraging the growth of the private sector as the main engine of development. A substantial improvement in economic growth will be achieved only through higher investment and better utilization of resources. In this regard, the mission’s discussion focused on reform of public enterprises, labor market issues, private sector development, and the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 35. Public enterprise reform. The role of public enterprises in economic activity is significant and growing, and a comprehensive review of this role and follow-up reforms are urgently required (Box 2). An efficient public sector is critical to ensuring the productive use of resources and providing conditions for rapid private sector growth. To this end, the following actions were discussed: l The mission welcomed the newly established Cabinet Committee on Public Enterprise Reform, which is charged with reviewing public enterprise performance, assessing problems faced by the sector, and providing recommendations for improvement and reform. The review should also provide a thorough assessment of the role of public enterprises in the economy. To the extent that services must be provided by public enterprises, additional efforts should be made to ensure that they operate on a commercial basis. l The authorities have considered privatization of public enterprises on a number of occasions in the past. The mission encouraged the committee to give urgent consideration to divestiture and privatization, especially in areas that can be more efficiently served by the private sector. l In view of the lack of basic information on public enterprises, steps are planned to strengthen the system of information gathering and monitoring of public enterprise performance, including through the establishment of a new division in the Ministry of Finance. These efforts should contribute to more effective assessments of the problems facing these enterprises and lead to the timely formulation of appropriate policy measures.

Namibia: Public Enterprises The role of public enterprises in economic activity in Namibia is significant and growing. Despite efforts to improve the performance of these enterprises, financial conditions in some key enterprises have deteriorated in recent years, contributing to budgetary pressures. Thus far, the government’s strategy has focused on the commercialization of public enterprises, with little progress made on privatization. The size of public enterprises has expanded rapidly since independence. In 1990, Namibia had eight public enterprises engaged in power, transportation, petroleum, housing, agricultural credit, and development finance. Over the next ten years, seventeen more enterprises were created, mainly from units within the civil service, as part of the effort to reduce the large bureaucracy and enhance operational efficiency in public services. In 1998, an estimated 17 percent of GDP was produced by partially or fully state-owned enterprises. The assessment of the performance of public enterprises has been complicated by a lack of basic information. An earlier government study indicates that the performance of a majority of these enterprises “has not been up to expectation.” While some of the enterprises are believed to be financially strong, several others (notably Air Namibia and TransNamib) have encountered financial difficulties and relied increasingly on budgetary support: . Air Namibia faces substantial financial difficulties at present, owing to government intervention in business decisions (including financing) and poor planning and management by the airline itself. In 2001/02, an equity transfer amounting to N$346 million (1% percent of GDP) was provided to enable the airline to meet operating expenses and debt-service obligations falling due. It is estimated that Air Namibia requires a monthly income of about N$43 million-N$l5 million to cover debt-service payments and N$28 million for operating costs--to break even. With its current monthly revenue of only N$20 million, the operating deficit of N$23 million a month (or about 1 percent of GDP per year) has been so far covered by budgetary transfers. . Information on TransNamib’s financial position is very limited. In 2001/02, net lending from the budget is estimated at N$43 million (0.2 percent of GDP). It has been reported that TransNamib has even failed to remit employee income tax to the treasury for the past two years. l As regards Air Namibia, restoring its financial viability will likely require further recapitalization beyond the financial support already provided by the government and renewed efforts to generate income in a sustainable manner. A new management team has recently been put in place with the aim of strengthening the airline’s performance, and efforts are being made to establish a strategic partnership with another airline by early 2002. However, it remains unclear whether these measures are sufficient to restore the company’s long-term financial viability. The mission urged the authorities to consider other options, including privatization, if such viability cannot be attained. l Efforts are also required to enhance the performance and financial positions of other loss-making public enterprises, notably TransNamib, so as to minimize the needed budgetary support and improve the productive use of resources.

Namibia’s labor market is characterized by high unemployment, particularly among the young and unskilled (Box 3). Adequate training and some relaxation of labor regulations are essential to encourage private sector activity and increase employment. An assessment of labor market issues is complicated by limited data on employment and wage developments. In 2000, the Ministry of Labor conducted a national labor force survey, but the findings have not yet been made public. A number of measures have recently been taken to improve labor market functioning, including a new draft bill (accompanied by detailed procedures and guidelines) intended to streamline labor dispute settlement procedures. Various efforts have also been made to enhance formal and vocational training. A human resources plan has been drafted, emphasizing the importance of skills training as a means to promote job creation. Looking forward, the mission recommended that the regulations on hiring and termination of employment be made more flexible to encourage domestic and foreign direct investment. Box 3. Namibia: Labor Market Issues Namibia’s labor market is characterized by persistent high unemployment, especially among the unskilled, and excess demand for skilled labor. A key factor contributing to high unemployment is the shortage of skills. Policies in the past have aimed to enhance both formal and vocational training, and efforts in the coming years will be geared toward establishing more flexible regulations and providing further training to spur job creation. The data on labor market indicators are limited, preventing timely assessments of the labor market conditions and an appropriate policy response. The following are the major labor market issues: . Unemployment has risen steadily in recent years, from 20 percent of the active labor force in 1990 to 35 percent in 1997, and is estimated to have remained at about the same rate since then. Unemployment is particularly high among the young and unskilled: for the age group of 15-19 years, the unemployment rate is 61 percent, and for those between 20-24 years of age, the rate is 54 percent. Agriculture remains the largest employer, providing one-third of total employment, while the government sector provides one-fifth of employment. . The level of education is generally low in the labor force. It is estimated that 13 percent of the population has no formal education, 44 percent has a full or partial primary education, 42 percent has secondary education, and less than 1 percent has a postsecondary education. The level of education varies widely between rural and urban areas and among different regions. . Despite high unemployment, wages in Namibia are perceived to be high. While relevant data are unavailable, the general perception of the private sector is that the wage structure in Namibia is incompatible with the low level of productivity of unskilled workers. In addition to wage inflexibility, difficult labor relations and rigid regulations on the hiring and termination of employment weigh negatively on employment. Current regulations require employers to replace foreign employees with Namibian workers within three years after the start of business. . The shortage of skilled labor underscores the importance of strengthening education and training. To this end, a draft plan has been prepared, outlining the need for developing human resources. In addition, consideration is being given to mobilizing necessary resources through an “education levy” to cover the cost of education. Better coordination is also envisaged between employers and training providers to better match needs and skills. These efforts will be accompanied by a new labor bill aimed at improving labor relations. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - 37. Private sector initiatives. The mission shared the government’s aspiration of achieving higher growth and raising employment through economic diversification and by encouraging private sector development. To this end, a number of initiatives have been undertaken, including a Special Industrialization Program, the establishment of an export- processing zone, trade and investment promotion programs, and arrangements to support small and medium-sized enterprises (Box 4). The mission supported the authorities’ efforts in these areas and underscored, in particular, the importance of attracting foreign direct investment inflows in labor-intensive activities in the context of the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act. At the same time, the mission urged that these programs-some of which were supported by donors-be well targeted and transparent in funding and operations, and advised that the effectiveness of these efforts be kept under review to ensure that the resources provided were used as intended. Box 4. Namibia: Initiatives to Encourage Private Sector Development Namibia’s medium-term economic strategy is centered on the rapid growth of the private sector. In particular, private investment is targeted to increase from the current 15% percent of GDP to 20 percent by 2006, with the share of private investment in total investment rising from 65 percent to 90 percent over that period. To this end, a number of initiatives have been implemented to reduce the constraints on private sector development: . The Special Industrialization Program, introduced during the first National Development Plan, is designed to spur private investment in the industrial sector by providing start-up capital and infrastructure support. Budgetary allocations of N$400 million have been provisioned to finance the program through 2006. Thus far, financial support has been provided to several projects specializing in textiles, garments, electronics, plastics, and furniture products. . The Trade and Investment Development Program, funded by the European Union, focuses on human resources development, institutional capacity building, business advisory services, and improved access to financing via a credit guarantee scheme. In addition, technical assistance from Germany, the United’Kingdom, and the United States is available to assist small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in strengthening production and management. A program funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development is also in place to support SMEs in the areas of capacity building and export promotion. . The Credit Guarantee Scheme, cosponsored by the European Union, Germany, and the Namibian government, provides loan guarantees for the benefit of SMEs. The scheme has available resources of N$50 million, administered by a trustee consisting of the Namibian government and five commercial banks. Guarantees provided by the scheme to a single company are up to 80 percent of the amount of loans extended by commercial banks, but the total must not exceed N$l85,000. . The export processing zone, established in 1996, provides various tax incentives to companies manufacturing products for export. Thus far, the zone has attracted 23 companies, with a total investment of N$2.4 billion, and employs about 2,000 workers.

The authorities recognized the broad and serious social and economic implications of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which had become the principal public health problem and the main cause of death since 1996. A United Nations report indicated that about 20 percent of the population between the ages of 15 and 49 in Namibia were infected by HIV, compared with an adult population average prevalence rate of about 9 percent for sub-Saharan Africa.16 In 1999, AIDS claimed over 1 percent of the population, with the number of orphans growing rapidly and life expectancy at birth substantially shortened. HIV/AIDS also threatens public finances, the availability of labor force, and future growth. l7 The authorities have taken some steps to reduce the incidence of this disease,‘* and they plan to make further efforts to enhance public awareness of the problem through education and to improve access to services for those infected. The mission encouraged the authorities to more actively seek financial and technical support from international agencies and donors to meet this challenge. 39. Land reform remains an important aspect of socioeconomic development in Namibia, partly because of the legacy of skewed land distribution inherited from the preindependence period. During the second half of the 199Os, the government’s policy was to acquire and reallocate land in accordance with the “willingness to sell and willingness to buy” principle. On this basis, land acquisitions totaled 357,747 hectares during this period, well exceeding the target of 150,000 hectares. It is envisaged that the same voluntary principle will be applied to land reform in the coming years. D. Statistical Issues 40. Namibia’s core statistical data are generally adequate, but significant weaknesses remain. The mission welcomed the efforts to continue to improve basic economic statistics, including the efforts to compile and publish quarterly national accounts l6 See UNAIDS, “Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic: 2000.” i7 A detailed description of the impact of HIV/AIDS was provided in last year’s staff report (SM/OO/218, 9/28/00). Also see “Namibia: Selected Development Impact of HIV/AIDS,” World Bank, Report No. 22046-NAM, April 10,200l. ‘* Including the adoption of the National AIDS Control Program in 1990, followed by a Short-Term Plan (1992-95), the first Medium-Term Plan (1995-98), and the second Medium-Term Plan (1999-2004). The objectives of these plans are to (i) reduce the number of HIV infection in both adults and children through education and preventive efforts; (ii) ensure that those living with HIV and their families have access to affordable services; and (iii) mobilize support, including from the international community, to address the socieconomic impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Nevertheless, the authorities indicated that, based on the available data, the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women in the highest-risk age groups of 15-24 years had remained stable since 1998.

Further improvement is needed, however, in data quality and reporting frequency in all major statistical areas, including labor market indicators. The authorities have expressed interest in further Fund technical assistance to improve core statistics, in particular, in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments. 41. The authorities have made good progress in meeting the GDDS requirements, and a national coordinator was recently appointed. The data on official reserves are reported on a monthly basis and released in a timely manner, and efforts have also been made to present reserves data in line with the template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity. The authorities have also agreed to participate in a ROSC exercise with STA during January 15-30,2002. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 42. The central policy challenge facing Namibia is to raise the economy’s growth potential while preserving fiscal prudence. Economic activity has expanded moderately in recent years but not by enough to improve living standards. Higher growth is essential to reduce unemployment and poverty. 43. In 2000 and 2001, economic performance remained broadly in line with recent trends, but the budgetary outcome is expected to weaken significantly in 2001/02, reflecting higher current expenditure and substantial support for Air Namibia. As a consequence, government debt will likely rise to close to 25 percent of GDP at end-200 l/02-the limit publicly announced by the government as a prudent benchmark for budgetary planning and management. 44. The large civil service and inefficient public enterprises weigh heavily on the budget. Fiscal sustainability will require a strategy to restrain expenditure by limiting the size of the wage bill and improving public enterprise performance, strengthen expenditure control, and boost revenue. These measures should be supported by efforts to redirect spending toward social and economic needs. l In the case of personnel expenditure, immediate steps are needed to freeze vacant positions in the current fiscal year, with greater scrutiny applied to new civil service positions in the 2002/03 budget and beyond. Moreover, the timely adoption of the proposed early retirement program and firm implementation of the Wages and Salaries Commission’s recommendations on the wage bill reduction should go a long way toward achieving a sustainable wage bill. A review of the wage structure, including policy on benefits, also seems timely and desirable. The aim of these efforts should be to gradually reduce the burden of the wage bill on the budget so as to help achieve fiscal sustainability over the medium term.

In addition to the efforts to improve cash-flow planning and the performance of government agencies, greater authority for the Ministry of Finance should help enforce the accountability of line ministries in avoiding overspending. Equally important, restraint needs to be exercised in approving additional allocations through midyear supplementary budgets. l The recent experience with Air Namibia highlights the urgency of curtailing the government’s financial support to public enterprises. Efforts are particularly required to limit loan guarantees, as they can have substantial fiscal implications for the government and can create moral hazard by weakening incentives for prudent behavior by borrowers. The authorities are also urged to recognize such guarantees as contingent liabilities of the government and to disclose relevant information in budget documents. This cautious and transparent approach to guarantees should be applied to both external and domestic debt. l Revenue performance must be strengthened through better compliance over the medium term. The planned tax review is timely, and efforts to further improve VAT compliance and broaden the tax base are welcome. However, any decision to reduce the high VAT rate should take into account the adverse revenue consequences and the need for offsetting tax measures. 45. In sum, the staff supports the authorities’ intention to limit the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2002/03 and government debt to 25 percent of GDP over the medium term. Achieving these objectives would entail substantial efforts in the areas described above, particularly a significant reduction in the wage bill and the budgetary support to public enterprises. 46. Boosting Namibia’s growth potential will require higher investment and better utilization of resources. In light of the significant role of public enterprises and the persistent high unemployment, efforts must focus on reforms of public enterprises and the labor market. In particular, the authorities are urged to formulate a time-bound plan on privatization of public enterprises in the context of the forthcoming Cabinet Committee on Public Enterprise Reform review and the IFC study. In view of the daunting difficulties faced by Air Namibia, the authorities are encouraged to consider privatization if the airline’s long- term financial viability cannot be achieved in the public sector. On labor market reform, the staff suggests that the regulations on the hiring and termination of employment be made more flexible to encourage private sector development. 47. The peg of its currency to the South African rand has served Namibia well in securing broad financial stability. The recent depreciation of the Namibia dollar against the U.S. dollar should have minimal effects on trade, while its impact on prices and wages could be significant, depending on the authorities’ policy response. In view of the close economic and financial relationships between Namibia and South Africa, and given South Africa’s commitment to inflation control, the staff considers the present regime to remain appropriate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - and supports the authorities’ intention to retain this arrangement. To ensure the sustainability of the present exchange rate regime, the authorities will need to pursue sound fiscal policy and structural reforms, as outlined above. Over the medium term, it would be desirable to increase the level of official reserves, so as to strengthen Namibia’s ability to respond to any potential shock to the economy. 48. The staff considers the potential benefits of the proposed offshore financial center to be limited, while the costs and risks could be considerable. Moreover, the requirement of closer supervision in conjunction with other countries and international agencies poses a significant challenge. In the staffs view, the establishment of the offshore financial center should not proceed without a careful assessment of the expected benefits and costs, as well as Namibia’s institutional capacity for supervising such a center. 49. Namibia’s core statistical data are generally adequate, but serious weaknesses remain. Further improvement is needed in data quality and reporting frequency in key areas, including labor market indicators, where the paucity of data constrains effective economic analysis and policy formulation. The authorities’ plan to participate in the GDDS and the ROSC data module will provide an opportunity to identify statistical needs and follow-up technical assistance. 50. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Namibia be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Namibia joined the World Bank, the IFC, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1990. Current World Bank involvement in Namibia focuses on providing technical assistance to support the government’s efforts to reduce poverty, build local capacity, and enhance management of water resources. There are no IBRD loans to Namibia. With a GDP per capita of $1,8 19 (1998), Namibia is not eligible for International Development Association (IDA) assistance. The World Bank Group’s involvement is provided mainly through economic and sector work, capacity-building activities funded through a series of small Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants, and technical assistance. The main economic and sector studies completed include the following: l Poverty Strategy (1998); l Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (1999); l Emerging Pension System: Evaluation, Challenges and Options (2000); l Development Impact of HIV/AIDS (200 1). 2. In FY2002, the World Bank Group will provide support for macroeconomic modeling, and launch a multiyear study to examine sources of sustainable growth and employment in Namibia. Support for the preparation of an extensive water sector review will be provided. The World Bank will also support government’s request for an IDF grant to establish a public expenditure tracking system (PETS) and continue supervision of IDF- funded activities for (i) a national capacity assessment; (ii) support for management of marine environment resources; and (iii) public service training. 3. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) of the IFC is involved in improving Namibia’s investment infrastructure. IFC has a loan investment in a fishery project (Pescanova) and an equity investment in Namibia’s first indigenous life insurance company (Namibia Life); it also approved, in 1999, a loan of US$ 1.4 million to help finance a US$6.5 million 120-room Best Western hotel in northern Namibia. Early in 1999, the IFC also worked with the Namibian Agronomic Board in raising trust funds that helped fund a feasibility study of a cotton-ginning industry. Namibia joined MIGA in 1990, but there has been no guarantees to date. MIGA has, however, launched the AFRI-IPA support program, headquartered in Namibia, to provide technical assistance for African countries.

Namibia’s core statistical data are generally adequate, but significant weaknesses remain. While the data on exchange rate, international reserves, broad and reserve money, and interest rates are available on a monthly basis with reasonable promptness, the key national accounts (including wage and employment), fiscal, and balance of payments data are mostly available on an annual basis only. Efforts have been made recently to compile and report quarterly data on the national accounts and balance of payments, but they are subject to frequent and significant revisions. In addition, there are substantial intersectoral inconsistencies, particularly with national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Real sector 2. The real sector data are compiled and reported by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), which are generally available on an annual basis. However, preliminary quarterly GDP estimates have recently been compiled and released in the Bank of Namibia’s (BON) Quarterly Bulletin. In 2000, the sources and methods of GDP compilation were revised, and the base year for national accounts data was changed from 1990 to 1995. Analysis and monitoring of the real economy have been adversely affected by the frequent and significant revisions of the national accounts estimates and the unavailability of actual quarterly GDP data. 3. An assessment of labor market developments is complicated by the lack of data on employment and wages, which are not systematically collected and reported by the CBS or other agencies. The latest available information indicates that unemployment of the active labor force was 35 percent in 1997. In 2000, the Ministry of Labor conducted a national labor force survey, but the findings have not yet been made public. 4. The CBS compiles and publishes a monthly consumer price index (CPI) since January 1993, representing Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia. The index is disseminated with a lag of one month. It is expected that a nationwide index, using the 1993/94 household expenditure survey to derive the weights, will be introduced in mid-2002. Namibia does not produce indices of producer or wholesale prices. 5. The authorities do not report any real sector to STA. Data published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) are taken from publications available from the CBS and BON. Government finance 6. Comprehensive and detailed data on central government finances are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on an annual basis. In addition, the MOF publishes an annual budget report to coincide with the presentation of the budget. Reporting to STA had been interrupted for several years but was resumed in the 2001 Government Financial Statistics (GFS) Yearbook.

First, efforts are needed to compile and publish quarterly fiscal data to facilitate more timely assessments of fiscal operations. Second, data on public enterprises (including operations and finances) are not available, which impedes assessments of public enterprise performance. Third, the structure of the fiscal accounts is different from the standard GFS presentation, including the appropriate treatment of contingent liabilities (such as government guarantees to local governments and public enterprises). Finally, expenditure reporting needs to be strengthened by making information on actual cash expenditure of line ministries available more speedily. Monetary accounts 8. Following the introduction of an IFS page in 1994, reporting of monetary data has been timely and comprehensive. Balance of payments 9. Namibia reports full balance of payments data on an annual frequency. The methodology underlying the Namibian balance of payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual and is well documented. While the quarterly current account data are compiled and published in the Quarterly Bulletin, and are often subject to major revisions, data on capital and financial accounts are available only annually. In addition, there are concerns about the variability of survey coverage, inadequate checking of data, and intersectoral inconsistencies.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Namibia On [February 11, 20021, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Namibia.’ Background Economic activity in Namibia has expanded moderately in recent years. Since the mid- 199Os, real GDP growth has averaged 3% percent a year, broadly in line with the growth rates in the region, and slightly above the annual population growth rate of about 3 percent. Unemployment has remained high, at about 35 percent of the labor force, and the recent economic growth has been insufficient to achieve gains in per capita income and reduce poverty. Economic performance in 2000 was broadly in line with recent trends. Real GDP rose by 3% percent, the budget deficit fell to 1% percent of GDP, reflecting buoyant diamond receipts and underspending on capital outlays, and the external current account recorded a surplus of 5 percent of GDP. The 12-month rate of inflation increased from 8 percent in 1999 to 10% percent in 2000, owing in part to an increase in domestic fuel prices (of 12 percent). Developments in 2001 point to somewhat weaker growth and lower inflation. Reflecting lower agricultural growth and a possible decline in fishing output, real GDP is expected to increase by less than 3 percent. The 12-month rate of inflation fell to 8% percent at end-December, ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [February 11, 20021 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

For the first time since independence in 1990, the 2001102 budget was presented in the context of a rolling three-year expenditure framework. The medium-term approach to budget preparation was intended to strengthen fiscal management, especially expenditure control. The main guiding principle for the budget was to limit the ratio of government debt to GDP to no more than 25 percent. The original 2001/02 budget envisaged a deficit of about 3% percent of GDP, and the budgets for 2002/03 and 2003/04 (cast in 2000/01 constant price terms) targeted deficits of 3 percent of GDP. Preliminary information available suggests that the budget deficit in 2001/02 is likely to increase to 5% percent of GDP. Notwithstanding continued buoyant diamond receipts, the ratio of revenue to GDP is expected to fail from the 2000101 outturn (although still higher than the original 2001/02 budget), as tariff revenue from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) declined relative to GDP. Expenditure is expected to increase sharply on account of a larger wage bill than budgeted, a substantial transfer to Air Namibia, and onetime allowances for military personnel withdrawn from overseas. As a result, government debt is expected to reach 24’% percent of GDP in 2001/02. Given the peg of the Namibia dollar to the South African rand, the scope for independent monetary policy in Namibia is limited. In line with developments in South Africa, monetary conditions eased over the course of 2001 and the central bank rate was reduced from 1 II% percent at end-December 2000 to 9% percent at end-October 2001. Broad money grew by about 8’% percent in the 12 months to November, largely attributable to a strong expansion of consumer loans. Between September and December, the Namibia dollar, following the rand, depreciated by about 30 percent against the U.S. dollar. Namibia’s near-term outlook appears encouraging. Indications are that any short-term impact of the global slowdown may be limited and likely to be felt in the first half of 2002. Barring any further deterioration in the external environment, real GDP growth in 2002 could rebound to about 3 percent. The prospects for stronger growth beyond 2002 reflect the expansion of offshore mining activity, the operation of a new zinc mine expected in 2003, and foreign direct investment inflows associated with the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act. Namibia also has strong tourism potential, that has yet to be fully developed. However, the external current account is projected to record a smaller surplus than in recent years, as the expansion in exports of mining, fishery, and nontraditional products is likely to be offset by lower SACU receipts.
