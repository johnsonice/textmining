During 2000-O 1, the fiscal and external current account balances recorded surpluses averaging about 9 percent and 17 percent of GDP respectively, thus allowing for a sizable accumulation of reserves to about US$13 billion at end-2001. Inflation declined and was negative, while real GDP grew on average by about 3 percent. The dual exchange rate system was unified by end-2001 through a one-step devaluation of the official exchange rate. Simultaneously, a number of measures were implemented to ease trade and exchange restrictions and support public enterprises. Prospects for the medium term With the expected lower level of oil prices over 2002-07, Libya’s medium-term outlook, while not raising any sustainability concern, appears less favorable than in 2000-O 1. Under the April 2002 World Economic Outlook (WEO)-based oil export price assumptions and the expected coming on-stream of additional gas output in 2004, the external current account is projected to remain comfortably in surplus. However, without corrective measures, the fiscal stance is projected to weaken over the medium term and real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth to stabilize at about 2.5-3.0 percent per year. Such a growth rate would not be sufficient to provide employment - opportunities for the new entrants to the labor force which are projected to grow by about 3.3 percent annually. Views of the authorities The authorities agreed with the staff that if Libya is to absorb its growing labor force, it will need to widen and deepen its reform agenda in order to foster private sector development and achieve higher nonhydrocarbon growth rates. They emphasized, however, that given Libya’s priority to preserve its overall social system, economic reform will be gradual and limited in scope. The authorities were interested in receiving technical assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the areas of statistics, financial programming, tax administration, and customs reforms to implement their reform agenda. Staff appraisal The recent unification of the dual exchange rate system and the supporting measures implemented represent an important step towards reforming the economy. The present macroeconomic environment provides an opportune moment to build on these measures by broadening the pace of reforms to boost private and foreign investment, foster productivity growth, and ultimately generate higher levels of employment. A set of measures aimed at liberalizing domestic prices, eliminating trade and exchange restrictions, and establishing an agenda to reform public enterprises could be implemented at an early stage. Deeper structural measures, including public bank restructuring, public enterprise reform, and civil service reform that require significant technical preparation could be implemented over the medium term. Also, greater efforts to address statistical deficiencies and improve the timeliness and quality of data for surveillance between consultations are required.

A mission visited Tripoli and Sirte during January 16-February 2,2002, to conduct the 2002 Article IV consultation discussions.’ The discussions focused on the management of the newly unified exchange rate regime and the supporting measures adopted, the removal of the remaining distortions and rigidities in the economy, the strengthening of public finances management, and the enhancing of coordination between fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies. The mission also discussed the authorities’ medium-term plan aimed at accelerating economic growth and improving resource allocation. The authorities were receptive to the staffs policy advice but emphasized that reform will be gradual and limited in scope in order to preserve Libya’s overall social system. They were interested in receiving technical assistance from the IMF in the areas of statistics, financial programming, tax administration, and customs reforms. 2. In concluding the last consultation on March 12,2001, Executive Directors noted that despite considerable improvement in economic conditions due to higher oil prices and suspension of UN sanctions, the Libyan economy remains highly regulated, state-controlled and dependent on oil. Directors welcomed the authorities’ medium-term program to liberalize the economy, reduce reliance on oil revenue, and encourage private sector development. They also welcomed the progress in easing exchange restrictions, as well as the plan to unify the exchange rate by end-200 1. They emphasized that a prudent fiscal policy would be key to macroeconomic stability. On data issues, Directors noted that persistent weaknesses remained, particularly in the fiscal area, and that fundamental steps were needed to improve the statistical system. Directors welcomed the authorities’ agreement to move the Article IV consultations to a 12-month cycle. 3. Libya continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV and the mission conducted the related consultation discussions.* Libya also maintains exchange restrictions that are subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 (see Appendix I, section VIII). ‘The mission consisted of Messrs. Elhage (head), Abdallah, Mahyoub, Okogu, Ms. Sab (all MED), and Mr. Megarbane (PDR). Mr. Jbili (MED) joined the policy discussions. The mission met with central bank Governor Menesi and Vice Governor Ekdara and other senior officials. 2Libya’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. The status of economic and financial data is covered in Appendix III, and recent changes to the exchange and trade regimes can be found in Appendix IV. The medium-term framework is described in Appendix V, and the main recommendations on monetary policy and banking supervision made by the August 2001 technical assistance mission from MAE are listed in Appendix VI.

The Libyan economy depends heavily on the oil sector, and remains largely state controlled and regulated.3 Oil earnings constituted over 60 percent of budgetary revenue and about 95 percent of exports from 1996-200 1. Nonhydrocarbon and private sector economic activities continue to be hindered by extensive government controls on prices, external trade, foreign exchange transactions, and labor market practices, as well as by occasional policy reversals. Also, environmental factors, such as the scarcity of arable land and water resources, impose limits on agricultural development. With the view to increase water resources to agriculture, the authorities launched in 1983 the Great Man-Made River (GMR) project, which aims at transporting water through a network of pipelines from the aquifers in the south of the country to the costal area where the population and agriculture are concentrated. 5. Domestically, all goods and services are subject to official price controls. Profit margin ceilings are imposed on all prices charged by importers, wholesalers, and retailers. 01 the monetary side, all interest rates are administratively set, and a substantial share of credit allocated by the banking system is directed by the government to achieve social goals, particularly in relation to housing and agriculture. Limitations are also imposed on the share of foreign workers that enterprises can hire and on the availability of certain categories of jobs for foreign workers. 6. The suspension of the UN sanctions against Libya in April 1999 has sparked renewed interest in the hydrocarbon sector and helped attract foreign direct investment. However, separate U.S. sanctions imposed by Executive orders in 1986 and the statute in 1996, ban most bilateral trade, freeze Libyan assets, and extend these sanctions to third party companies investing more than a threshold amount in Libya.4 B. Developments in 2000-01 7. Economic conditions have improved considerably following the strong rebound in oil prices from the second half of 1999 (Table 2, Figure 1) and the suspension of UN sanctions. Real GDP grew by 4.4 percent in 2000 and by about 1 percent in 2001 .5 Inflation was negative, with an actual deflation of 3 percent in 2000 and 8.5 percent in 2001 resulting 3Libya’s social indicators are favorable by regional standards (Table 1). 4The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) was renewed by the U.S. Congress in August 2001, when it was hu-ther tightened by lowering the threshold of investments by third party companies subject to the sanction from US$40 million to US$20 million. ‘The drop in economic growth in 200 1 reflected mainly a 4 percent decline in oil production and a deceleration in the growth rate of the nonhydrocarbon sectors to 2.5 percent from 5 percent in 2000, mainly due to the uncertainty surrounding exchange rate unification. Import and investment decisions were also delayed due to the impact of a continuously appreciating special exchange rate on inventory values.

However, to the extent that public enterprises’ prices were not adjusted to reflect higher costs and that public sector wages have been frozen since 1981,6 there is some measure of repressed inflation. The external current account surplus soared to about 20 percent of GDP in 2000 before settling at 14 percent in 200 1, and official reserves reached about US$l3 billion (17.0 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services) by end-200 1 (Table 3, Figure 2). 8. The fiscal position remained strong with sustained high oil prices in 2000 and early 2001. In 2000-O 1, hydrocarbon revenue increased to about 29 percent of GDP from 24 percent in 1999, and nonhydrocarbon revenue dropped by 8 percent of GDP from an exceptionally high level of around 24 percent in 1999, mainly on account of lower revenue from the sale of foreign exchange at the special rate (Table 4, Figure 3). 9. On the expenditure side, capital outlays moved pro-cyclically with budgeted oil prices to 11.4 percent of GDP in 2000 from 8.3 percent of GDP in 1999. This reflected mainly the implementation of the 70/30 fiscal rule which mandates that 70 percent of budgetary hydrocarbon revenues net of debt service payments and the allocation for the National Oil Company’s (NOC’s) operations be earmarked to development expenditure.7 While the 2000 budget was built on a conservative price assumption of US$lS per barrel, the 2001 budget adopted an oil price of US$20 per barrel, thereby leading to a further increase of 1.2 percent of GDP in development expenditure above the 2000 level despite the drop in oil prices and production in 200 1. Current expenditure, which had dropped by 4 percent of GDP in 2000 on account of civil service retrenchment, increased in 2001 by about 4 percent of GDP reflecting mainly an increase in extra budgetary expenditures’ and the resumption of civil service hiring. The overall budget surplus continued to shrink relative to GDP from 12.3 percent in 1999 to 10.6 percent in 2000 and to 6.4 percent in 2001 (or 3.0 percent of GDP excluding the Oil Reserve Fund (ORF) revenue).’ 6The last general salary increase took place in 1980. Since then, only wage drift took place. 7The 70/30 rule has been in existence for several decades but was not effectively implemented until 1999. ‘The increase reflected mainly expenditures on the purchase of cars (1 .O percent of GDP), transfers to the Social Security Fund to increase benefits to low income families (0.5 percent GDP), and transfers (about 0.5 percent of GDP) to the training institute. ‘The ORF is a government account managed by the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) which accumulates oil revenue in excess of the level determined by the budgetary oil price (US$lS per barrel in 2002). Its assets are part of the official reserves of the CBL and are invested abroad. Withdrawals from the ORF mostly for current expenditures, take place on a discretionary basis at the request of the General People’s Committee. The ORF is not integrated into the budget and its operations are not transparent. At end-November 200 1, its total assets amounted to US$8.9 billion.

The policy of fiscal decentralization, which started in 1998, continued in 2000-01 with a further devolution of fiscal responsibilities to the 31 regional governments. This has resulted in increased pressure on expenditures. Devolution has also weakened the attempts at civil service reform, since 96,000 workers were (about 10 percent of public employment) hired in 200 1 by local governments at a cost of LD 190 million (1.1 percent of GDP) to strengthen the administrative capabilities of the regional governments, while the central government has been simultaneously providing financial incentives to encourage early departure of civil servants. 11. The monetary stance was tight in 2000 but became much looser in 2001, with broad money expanding by 11.8 percent in 2001 following a contraction of 1.3 percent in 2000 (Table 5, Figure 4). The contraction in 2000 reflected mainly the improved fiscal position, which resulted in a sharp decline of net banks’ claims on the government, and the direct intervention of the CBL to absorb excess liquidity through the sale of foreign exchange at the depreciated special exchange rate. The significant increase in broad money in 2001 mainly reflected the increase in credit to public enterprises resulting from their provisioning with foreign currency to cover their outstanding foreign liabilities in the last two weeks of 2001. 12. The policy of unification of the dual exchange rates, which started in 1999, was successfully completed on January 1,2002. Taking advantage of the favorable external environment, the CBL has been successful at narrowing the gap between the official and special exchange rates during 2000-O 1 and ultimately unifying them through a one-step devaluation of the official exchange rate from SDR 1.2240 per LD 1 to SDR 0.608 per LD I on January 1,2002 (see Box 1, Figure 5). 13. Following the suspension of UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has put in place a strategy to open its oil and gas sectors to investment from international oil companies (IOCs). Libya plans to raise its oil production capacity to 2 Mb/d by 2005 (from the present level of about 1.6 Mb/d) although the pace of expansion would depend on global oil demand growth and OPEC quota developments. There are also plans to expand gas production and gathering facilities, and exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Italy are expected to begin in 2004. The petrochemical industry, which relies on natural gas as input, is also slated for expansion. 14. Libya has taken steps towards regularizing its situation with external creditors in 200041. As a result, European export credit agencies are progressively resuming coverage of the Libyan market, starting with Italy’s export agency. 15. Governance issues within the National Oil Company and other public sector companies were high on the agenda of the September 2001 meeting of the General People’s Congress (GPC), Libya’s parliament. The GPC was very critical of NOC’s perceived failure to develop oil exploration and production as well as its poor management of reserves invested abroad. The GPC also took note of the high degree of discretionary spending from the reserves accumulated in the ORF and the rising implementation costs of public investment projects. Judiciary and administrative actions were made against several senior officials. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- Figure 4.

The Unification of the Exchange Rate The exchange rate system before 1999 In 1986, the Libyan dinar was pegged to the SDR at the rate of LD 1 = SDR 2.60. The rate was devalued several times during the 1990s to reach the level of LD 1 = SDR 1.577 by early-1999. At the same time, the parallel market that existed since 1988 deepened, especially after the introduction of an export retention scheme under which all receipts from nontraditional exports were allowed to be fully retained to finance a wide range of imports. The ratio between the offtcial and parallel exchange rates remained during the 1990s at above 500 percent and peaked at about 900 percent by mid- 1998 (Figure 5). The transitional phase to unification 1999-2001 On February 14, 1999 the CBL introduced a dual exchange rate regime by establishing a “special” rate at LDl = US$O.36, close to the prevailing parallel market rate, to be used for transactions related to personal imports, travel, medical treatment abroad, and pilgrimage. Transactions at the official rate were secured through an annual foreign exchange budget and implemented through instructions by the CBL to commercial banks regarding the provision of the necessary foreign exchange facilities. However, some commodity imports also took place through the parallel market in the so-called “border trade” and were de facto tolerated. Since 1999, the exchange rate policy aimed at gradually narrowing the spread between the official and special rates through a stepwise depreciation of the official rate and appreciation of the special rate, while simultaneously shifting an increasing share of transactions to the special exchange rate, including imports of raw materials, equipment, spare parts for most of the private sector and certain public enterprises. Until end-2001, the convergence has been mainly driven by an appreciation of the special rate. However, the last step to exchange rate unification was achieved on January 1,2002 by depreciating the official rate by 50 percent (expressed in SDR per LD), while broadly maintaining the prevailing level of the special exchange rate. Overall, the transitional phase to unification has resulted since early 1999 in an appreciation of the special rate of about 110 percent (li-om LD 1 = US$O.36 to LD 1 = US$O.77) and a depreciation of the official rate of about 60 percent from (LD 1 = SDR 1.577 to LD 1 = SDR 0.608) (Figure 5). The unified exchange rate system The dual exchange rate system was unified on January I,2002 at the fixed rate of LD 1 = SDR 0.608 and the rationing of foreign exchange through the foreign exchange budget was eliminated. A tax of 15 percent is levied on the purchase of foreign exchange for the purpose of financing the GMR Project. l/ An equivalent subsidy of 15 percent is paid for the sale of foreign exchange. The following are exempted from this tax: (i) all transactions in foreign currency in the budget, including oil revenues, (ii) all public enterprises, and (iii) the transferable share of the income of nonresidents on the payroll of the state. Accordingly, while the public sector operates at the unified rate of LD 1 = SDR 0.608 (or about LD 1 = US$O.77), the private sector transacts at an effective rate of LD 1 = SDR 0.5287 (or about LD 1 = US$O.67). In addition, a fee of LD 0.05 per US$l .O is applied on cash transactions to encourage the use of non-cash operations such as letters of credit or bank transfers. l/ This tax existed previously but was built in the exchange rate level. The tax was made explicit with the unification. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- C. Economic Outlook for 2002 16. Economic prospects for 2002 appear less favorable, but the overall situation will remain stable.” Real GDP is projected to contract by 0.5 percent, reflecting the continued decline in oil production (7.7 percent) and the sluggish growth in the nonhydrocarbon sectors (2.5 percent). Despite the significant devaluation of the official exchange rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is projected to increase by only about 6 percent.” On the demand side, imports are expected to pick up in 2002 as the pre-unification pent-up demand materializes. 17. Owing to the more favorable oil price outlook, a fiscal surplus of about 5 percent of GDP is projected for 2002.12 Total expenditures are projected to increase by about 60 percent, or by 13 percent excluding the effect of the 50 percent devaluation of the official exchange rate. In particular, discretionary expenditures by the OW are projected to continue to grow rapidly in 2002, and subsidization of essential goods is projected to increase by LD 650 million (2.7 percent of GDP).13 On the revenue side, the projected windfall gain from the devaluation, LD 4,798 million (20 percent of GDP), will be partly offset by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)-mandated production cutbacks. l4 Total revenue is projected to increase by about 50 percent, or drop by 11 percent after excluding the effect of the devaluation. The fiscal surplus (including the ORF) is projected to decline by less than 2 percent of GDP, to about 4.8 percent of GDP. 18. On the monetary side, broad money is projected to decline by about 2 percent.15 This outcome reflects the projected sharp drop in net bank claims on the government resulting “Indicators of external vulnerability are shown in Table 6. “The devaluation of the official rate will not affect the price of subsidized items and basic services (which represent 20 percent of the CPI basket) since the additional cost will be fi.dly absorbed by the budget. However, it will have a limited impact on a number of consumer goods (4 percent of the basket) that were previously imported at the official rate as well as on the prices of locally produced goods (12 percent of the basket) that relied on the official rate for their inputs. Prices for the remaining components of the CPI basket which include regulated utilities and rent, will remain largely unchanged. %nce the consultation discussions in the field, oil prices have increased significantly, leading to an upward revision of the WE0 projections from US$20 to US$23 per barrel in 2002. Staff projections have been adjusted accordingly. 13The increase reflects the absence of pass through to domestic prices following the devaluation of the official exchange rate entailed by unification. At this stage, the authorities do not intend to increase the prices of essential goods. 14Staff estimates that about US$470 million in oil revenue is projected to be lost as a result of lower oil prices and production cuts. 15The sharp increase in other items (net) reflects the impact of revaluation of net foreign assets resulting corn the devaluation of the official exchange rate.

Domestic credit to non-government sectors is projected to increase by 3.6 percent, reflecting mainly lending to public enterprises. III. POLICY ISSUES AND DISCUSSIONS 19. With the unification of the dual exchange rate system on January 1,2002, and the abolition of foreign exchange rationing, Libya has taken a major step in reforming its economy with the aim of achieving nonhydrocarbon GDP growth rates in the range of 5-6 percent in order to generate employment opportunities for the rapidly growing domestic labor force. In addition, the authorities intend to eliminate major restrictions on trade, reform public enterprises, and allow the private sector to play a bigger role in the economy. However, there are no concrete plans to dismantle the system of implicit subsidies and directed credit to targeted sectors, ease labor market restrictions, or significantly reduce the role of the public sector in the economy. 20. Libya’s medium-term outlook (Appendix V, Table 7, and Figure 6) does not raise any immediate sustainability concern. The staff, however, stressed that under the current policy stance, real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth would stabilize at about 2.5-3.0 percent per year. Such a growth rate would not be sufficient to provide employment opportunities for the new entrants to the labor force, which is estimated to grow by around 3.3 percent annually. In this regard, the staff underscored the need to deepen and broaden the reform agenda within a comprehensive macro-framework. In particular, it argued for establishing an economic environment that can foster private sector investment and greater efficiency by eliminating the remaining structural rigidities in prices, trade and exchange rate, restructuring public enterprises, reducing subsidies, and improving overall macroeconomic management. In the staffs view, the above reforms should be cast in a comprehensive macro- framework taking into account the medium-term sustainability of fiscal policy in the presence of volatile oil revenue. 21. The staff also indicated that the current favorable environment-the comfortable external reserves position, low inflation, current account surplus, and the revenue windfall accruing from unification-provides a window of opportunity for the authorities to implement wide ranging reforms within the framework of a comprehensive and well sequenced medium-term program. This program would include, at an early stage, a package of measures aimed at: (i) reducing subsidies; (ii) establishing a link between domestic and world prices at the new unified rate and addressing explicitly in the budget the impact of price adjustment on vulnerable groups, public enterprises, and public banks; (iii) implementing tariff reform; and (iv) establishing an agenda to reform public enterprises. In a second stage, structural reforms that require longer technical preparations, including: (i) restructuring of public enterprises; (ii) reforming the system of subsidies and transfers; (iii) civil service reform; (iv) tax and customs administrations reforms; and (v) public banks restructuring, would need to be implemented.

The staff commended the authorities for unifying the exchange rates as planned and for adopting accompanying reforms and supporting measures. These included the elimination of foreign exchange rationing through the foreign exchange budget,16 and the adoption of full pass-through of exchange rate changes to domestic prices of public enterprises with the exception of subsidized goods17 and government services (such as utilities). The authorities are also in the process of eliminating import licensing requirements and removing a significant number of items from the import banned list, which would be replaced by tariffs. At the beginning of 2002, the prices of domestic petroleum products were raised, but remain well below international prices.18 23. The authorities adopted a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of the devaluation of the official rate on public enterprises. In particular, public enterprises were allowed to provision themselves with foreign exchange ahead of the exchange rate unification to cover their outstanding letters of credit, other foreign liabilities, and their projected imports during 2002. In addition, public enterprises were exempted from income and production taxes, customs duties and the GMR exchange tax, and budgetary allocations were provided to absorb the price increases of imports for enterprises involved in new projects listed under the development budget, and to cover the additional cost of subsidization of essential goods. Also, in order to offset the effect of the devaluation on private sector imports, custom rates were reduced across-the-board by an average of about 50 percent for most goods”. However, limits were imposed on the cash purchases of foreign exchange by individuals and the import deposit requirements on the opening of letters of credit for public enterprises were increased to the level of the private sector.20 24. The staff welcomed the reforms which accompanied unification and stressed the need to sustain the unified rate and avoid the re-emergence of a parallel market rate. %nder the foreign exchange budget, access to foreign exchange required CBL approval. With its elimination, access to foreign exchange for current transactions is now unrestricted as long as an import license had been secured. “Nine categories of goods are imported by the National Supply Corporations (NASCO) and explicitly subsidized in the budget. These goods accounted for 14 percent of total imports in 2000. “The price of premium gasoline was increased by LD 0.01 per liter (7 percent), to about US$O.38 per gallon. “At the time of the mission, the new tariff structure was not available in full. 2oAt the beginning of 2002, a ceiling of US$5,000 per transaction was imposed on the purchase of foreign currency in cash and of US$lO,OOO on the purchase of foreign currency in travelers checks. Such purchases can be made without justification of the underlying transactions. Also, the advance import deposit required to open a letter of credit has been raised for public enterprises from 25 percent to 50 percent of import value, in line with the level prevailing for private firms. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- This would require that the remaining restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange for current account transactions be lifted, and the remaining exchange and trade restrictions eliminated. The staff noted the provisioning for all outstanding foreign exchange liabilities of public enterprises. It stressed, however, that some public enterprises would still face losses resulting from a sharp increase in the cost of their imports as well as from competition from cheaper imports. As a result, those enterprises may impose an additional burden on the budget or the balance sheets of public banks, which are already saddled with sizable nonperforming loans.21 The staff recommended that these costs be carefully monitored and explicitly budgeted for to avoid a spillover on the banks’ balance sheets. The authorities agreed with the staff and pointed out that they have established sectoral committees to assess the viability of commercial public enterprises, such as those operating in textiles, electronics, and food industries. The committees will give recommendations as to the need for restructuring, liquidation, or privatization. Regarding the latter, the authorities’ key strategy is to shift the ownership of enterprises to their employees or introduce domestic or foreign partners through joint ventures. Beyond those intentions, no concrete steps have been taken so far. The staff stressed that support to public enterprises should be made explicit in the budget with a clear timeframe for its removal to ensure transparency and a level playing field with the private sector. In this respect, the exemption from the GMR exchange tax, which was granted to public enterprises, should be replaced by a budget subsidy and eventually eliminated. 25. On the issue of the unified exchange rate-level, the authorities expressed confidence that the unified rate was appropriate, as evidenced by the absence of a parallel market or tensions in the foreign exchange market. Moreover, the CBL has sufficient international reserves to meet the demand for foreign exchange. The staff underlined the difftculty of assessing the appropriateness of the new rate, given the remaining rigidities in the economy and the prevailing data problems. It urged the authorities to show flexibility and to stand ready to promptly adjust the rate as warranted by overall developments. 26. Concerning exchange rate management, the authorities indicated their preference for a fixed but adjustable peg to the SDR, which in their view is appropriate to Libya’s circumstances and its limited administrative capacity. The staff pointed out that, in the medium term, given Libya’s heavy dependence on the hydrocarbon sector and its vulnerability to external shocks, the authorities should aim at moving to a flexible exchange rate system. However, in the short-term, given the lack of effective monetary policy, the existence of trade and exchange restrictions, and the fact that the CBL is the major seller of foreign exchange in the market, a fixed exchange system is appropriate provided that it is supported by well-coordinated demand management policies to keep inflation under control. Also, the authorities should show sufficient flexibility to adjust the nominal rate (in both directions) as needed to absorb exogenous shocks, and to avoid a sustained real appreciation 2’Due to data limitations, the staff was not in a position to estimate the expected total losses of public enterprises resulting G-om unification.

As the remaining trade and exchange restrictions are phased out, structural reforms implemented, and indirect monetary policy instruments developed, a move towards a more flexible exchange rate arrangement can be contemplated. The authorities agreed with staffs views and indicated that their aim was to focus on the reforms needed to allow them to adopt a flexible exchange rate system over the medium-term. B. Fiscal Policy and Public Finance Reform 27. The 2002 budget adopted a relatively expansionary stance. Notwithstanding the recent strengthening of oil prices, the rapid expansion in expenditure under the 2002 budget raises concern about the fiscal sustainability over the medium term. The staff stressed the need for a prudent fiscal policy that would help contain domestic demand growth, anchor expectations, and strengthen the post-unification exchange rate policy framework. The staff also argued that the room for fiscal maneuver provided by the projected increase in fiscal revenue in dinar terms resulting from unification could be usefully utilized in meeting the cost of restructuring public enterprises, eliminating implicit subsidies, and reforming the civil service. 28. Staff called for a review of the 70/30 rule, which, by linking capital outlays to budgetary oil revenues, induces procyclical expenditure policies, and promotes inefficiency in development expenditure. In the 2002 budget, attempts at circumventing constraints on current expenditure growth imposed by the 70/30 rule have resulted in a much less transparent budgetary process22 and encouraged the growth of discretionary extra budgetary expenditure, mainly from the ORF. Also, given the significant projected increase in capital outlays in 2002, the staff expressed concern about the possible adverse impact on the quality of projects. The authorities pointed out that the 70/30 rule was established to limit current expenditures and its modification would require a political decision. 29. The ongoing fiscal decentralization is adding pressure on expenditure. The staff emphasized that, while fiscal decentralization could improve services in the regions and better tailor expenditures to local needs, safeguards were required to maintain fiscal discipline and macroeconomic management. In particular, limitations as to the level and composition of the regions’ expenditures and their ability to raise taxes and fees would need to be established. The authorities indicated that, in order not to undermine effective macroeconomic management, allocation to individual regions, including for the administrative and development budgets, were currently set at the national level. The staff called for improved coordination between the central and regional governments, particularly in areas such as health care and education. 30. To diversify revenue away from oil, the mission recommended that an overall reform of tax and customs tariffs be implemented and fees be adjusted. In particular, the 22As an example, in 2002, LD 800 million of current expenditure were included in the development budget. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- numerous and discretionary tax and custom tariffs exemptions should be lifted, marginal personal and corporate income tax rates reduced, domestic prices of petroleum products raised gradually to their export equivalent prices, and distortions in the price of water from the GMR corrected. Consideration should also be given to upgrading the tax administration and broadening the tax base. The authorities agreed with the mission on the need to reform the tax system, and pointed out that they were currently revising the tax laws with the objective of streamlining the system, broadening the tax base, and strengthening collection. In this connection, they intend to request technical assistance from the IMF in the areas of tax administration and customs reforms. 31. The authorities also agreed that fiscal policy should be formulated in a medium- term framework taking into account the exhaustible nature of hydrocarbon resources. Such an approach would limit consumption from oil revenue to the equivalent of Libya’s permanent income based on existing oil reserves and an estimate of their rate of depletion. In practice, this would lead to an accumulation of savings for future generations, and a smoothing out of expenditure in the face of volatile oil prices. However, as it currently operates, the ORF does not fulfill either objective.23 The staff underscored the need to review the operations of the ORF and put in place clear and transparent rules regarding accumulation into and withdrawal from the fund, so that it can effectively function as a stabilization fund. C. Deregulation and Privatization 32. The authorities agreed with the staff that the dominant role of the government needs to be reduced to foster growth and create employment opportunities. While large- scale privatization operations are not envisaged and the public sector is expected to continue to play an important role, the authorities intend to promote the ownership of enterprises by their employees and encourage joint ventures between the public and the private sectors. In this regard, in the context of the medium-term plan covering the period 2003-07, the authorities intend to open up a wide-range of activities in manufacturing and services to private sector investment through joint ventures. 33. The staff welcomed the above intentions and encouraged the authorities to develop a comprehensive plan to reform public enterprises, including the removal of constraints on their operations in employment, wages, and pricing policies.24 230RF reserves declined by US$200 million during a period of high oil prices (end-2000 to November 2001). 24The private sector enjoys greater flexibility than the public sector in wage setting, management and employment decisions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - D. Monetary Policy 34. The authorities agreed that the monetary policy framework needs to be strengthened to bolster financial stability and support the unified exchange rate system. At present, the monetary outcome is determined by the flow of oil income, government expenditures and a widespread system of directed credit and controls, Available policy instruments have not been used to conduct monetary policy.25 The staff called for stepped up efforts to remove direct credit controls, allow flexibility in interest rate setting, and create market based instruments, such as CBL certificates or treasury bills, to enhance the conduct of monetary policy. 35. In an initial effort to address these problems, the CBL has set up a Monetary Policy Committee, which has prepared a report to serve as basis for discussion of the formulation and implementation of a market-based monetary policy. The staff welcomed this initial step, and urged the authorities to consider implementing at an early stage the recommendations of the 2001 MAE technical assistance mission (Appendix VI). E. Financial Sector Development and Soundness 36. The authorities agreed with the mission that the Libyan banking system needs to be modernized and banks given greater autonomy, which would enhance competition and efficiency. Two new private commercial banks were established in 200 1, and two more applications for banking licenses are currently being considered. The network of small regional banks has also expanded by two. In addition, preparations for the privatization of one public bank are well under way and consideration is being given to privatizing other publicly owned commercial banks. Despite these positive developments, the banking system remains largely in the hands of the public sector, and the government continues to play a key role in the operation of banks through the appointment of the board and management of the five largest commercial banks. 37. Bank supervision and prudential requirements remain weak. In 2001, banks’ nonperforming loans stood at about 29 percent of total loans. The present compliance level by the CBL with core principles of banking supervision is inadequate. The CBL does not have a regular system of comprehensive on-site inspection of banks, and needs to enforce uniform accounting and reporting standards based on international best practices and an off- site monitoring. The authorities agreed with the staff on the urgent need to reform the banking sector and improve banking supervision and indicated that they were giving serious consideration to the recommendations of the MAE technical assistance mission (Appendix VI). In particular, they have stepped up efforts to monitor and improve bank loan 25Reserve requirements ratios have remained fixed since 1966; the liquidity ratio has not been changed for years; interest rates on deposits and loans have remained unchanged since 1994; and the rediscount facility of the CBL has not been used since the 1960s.

The mission underscored the need to take into account the potential budgetary costs of strengthening banks’ balance sheets. F. Trade Regime 38. The authorities are planning to liberalize the trade system.26 They are preparing to eliminate import licensing, reduce the number of imports that are prohibited, and have already implemented an across-the-board tariff reduction.27 However, no timetable for a comprehensive trade liberalization has been established yet. 39. The staff welcomed the authorities’ intentions to reform the trade system and advised them that trade reform works best when appropriately sequenced with macroeconomic and structural reforms in the context of a clearly formulated medium-term framework. In this regard, the staff proposed a two-stage approach to reforming the trade system. In a first stage, the remaining quantitative restrictions would be eliminated, starting with import licenses, and replaced by temporary additional tariffs. Any support to local producers would take place through direct budget transfers or customs duties with an explicit timeframe for their removal. The excise tax on local goods would be unified with the consumption tax on imports to avoid discriminating against imports. In a second stage, exemptions, which have surged with exchange rate unification,28 would be largely eliminated and the granting of new ones should be limited. Finally, tariff reform would aim at simplifying and increasing the transparency of the system, lowering maximum tariff rates and reducing average statutory tariffs. The staff also suggested Fund technical assistance to help design and implement a comprehensive tariff reform. 40. The staff welcomed Libya’s application to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the authorities’ objective of establishing free-trade arrangements with Arab countries. In relation to the latter objective, the staff encouraged the authorities to include a program for multilateral liberalization, so that regionalism can serve as a mechanism to lock in liberalization measures, avoid the adverse effects of trade diversion, and facilitate progress toward nondiscriminatory multilateral liberalization and acceptance of obligations under the WTO. 26Trade restrictions are reported in Appendix IV. 271mport tariffs range between zero and 400 percent. However, as a share of total import items, 3 1 percent are exempted from custom duties, 37 percent are subject to tariff rates between 5-10 percent, and only 0.9 percent are subject to tariff rates above 50 percent. The mission was not in a position to calculate the new average tariff rate due to the unavailability of the full tariff schedule. In 200 1, the average tariff rate was 20 percent. 28Exemptions introduced in the wake of exchange rate unifications are listed in paragraph 24.

The authorities are taking steps to settle both domestic29 and external debt arrears with official and private creditors.30 The staff urged the authorities to accelerate the regularization of their relations with all creditors, to help bolster foreign investment, lower the high insurance premiums currently required from prospective investors, overcome the reluctance on the part of foreign export guarantee agencies to extend credit to exporters, and foster confidence. The authorities agreed with the staff, but pointed out that most arrears were related to issues under contention that were in the process of being resolved on a bilateral basis. H. Data Issues 42. The staff commended the authorities for their efforts in revising extensively the historical data series in the monetary and real sectors in order to improve their quality and usefulness and for identifying and addressing inconsistencies between balance of payments and monetary data. However, important shortcomings (Appendix III) in the quality, coverage, and consistency of data need to be addressed. Further efforts are urgently needed, in particular on the fiscal side to reclassify budgetary data in line with the analytical presentation of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual. The areas that need attention would be the following: (i) identify and include regional budgets, the ORF operations and all extra budgetary accounts in a consolidated fiscal presentation that would provide a more accurate picture of government operations; (ii) identify and address substantial discrepancies between the fiscal and monetary statistics;31 and (iii) improve reporting to the Fund in-between Article IV consultations. Also, with the aim of improving the statistical framework and data quality and timeliness, the authorities were encouraged to consider participating in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The authorities expressed a keen interest in receiving Fund technical assistance and informed the staff that they intended to formally request such an assistance in the coming months. 2gReliable data on domestic and external arrears are not available. Most of these arrears resulted from the abandoning or freezing of projects by contractors in the wake of the UN sanctions in 1992. 30According to official estimates, external debt to official creditors is about US$3.2 billion (11 .O percent of GDP in 2001), nearly all medium- and long-term debt to the Russian Federation. BIS-IMF-OECD-IBRD data, place Libya’s external debt at US$224 million in September 200 1, of which US$154 million was short term. Staff estimates Libya’s total external debt at around US$5.4 billion at end-200 1. 31The discrepancy between the overall fiscal position and financing data as a share of GDP amounted to 5.9 percent and 2.9 percent in 2000, and 2001, respectively.

The staff briefed the authorities on the latest developments related to the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative and discussed the role that Libya could play in it as a non-Paris Club official bilateral creditor. While the authorities were in full agreement with the objectives of the HIPC initiative, they have not yet made a decision regarding their contribution. The authorities are considering making their pledge to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-HIPC Trust effective. 44. The authorities have expressed satisfaction with the shorter periodic@ of consultations, and wish to maintain the current 12-month cycle. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 45. Since the suspension of UN sanctions in 1999, the overall macroeconomic situation in Libya has improved, supported by high oil export prices and, until end-2001, by prudent fiscal policies. However, growth and employment creation remained modest, reflecting the adverse impact of administrative controls, restrictions, and subsidies which continue to distort resource allocation, and hinder efficiency and competitiveness. 46. The major issue facing the authorities is how to increase the rate of economic growth, diversify the economy and create job opportunities for the rapidly growing labor force. In this regard, the staff commends the authorities for unifying the exchange rates as planned, for the supporting measures implemented, and for addressing prior to unification the crucial issue of foreign liabilities of public enterprises. These measures represent an important step toward reforming the economy and a good base on which to build future reforms. The staff encourages the authorities to widen and deepen the reform agenda to achieve higher growth rates of nonhydrocarbon GDP. 47. In the short run, the reform agenda should aim at further liberalizing domestic prices, eliminating remaining trade and exchange restrictions, and addressing explicitly in the budget the impact of price adjustment on vulnerable groups. In a second stage, far-reaching structural reforms that require significant technical preparation, including public enterprise restructuring, reform of the subsidies and transfers system, civil service reform, tax and customs administrations reforms, and the restructuring of public banks would all need to be implemented. 48. The unification of the exchange rates was a major step forward and needs to be supported by prompt elimination of the remaining exchange restrictions on current account transactions to avoid a re-emergence of a parallel exchange market. Equally important is the need to liberalize trade to enhance growth and broaden the foreign exchange market. While the authorities have expressed preference for a fixed exchange rate regime, exchange rate management should be flexible enough to allow for adjustments as needed to absorb shocks and avoid a sustained real appreciation that would be harmful to competitiveness. Over the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - medium term, as the CBL gains credibility in exchange rate and monetary policy management, the authorities should consider moving to a more flexible arrangement. 49. The staff urges the authorities to eliminate at an early stage the remaining non- tariff barriers on imports, starting with import licenses, and to replace them with temporary tariffs. Any support to local producers should take place through direct budget transfers or customs duties with an explicit timeframe for their removal. The excise tax on local goods should be unified with the consumption tax on imports to avoid discriminating against imports. 50. Fiscal policy will remain key to strengthening macroeconomic and financial stability. In the staffs view, a prudent fiscal policy would help contain domestic demand growth, anchor expectations, and build credibility. To this effect, the authorities would need to review the implementation of the 70/30 budget rule by devising a more flexible, transparent, and accountable process, that would smooth out expenditures and enhance efficiency. The authorities would also need to review the operations of the OW and put in place clear and transparent rules regarding its operations, as well as safeguards on the level and composition of the regions’ expenditures and their ability to raise taxes and fees. Moreover, stricter control over all extra-budgetary funds, should be put in place, through their inclusion in the budget. 51. The authorities need to accelerate the preparation of a comprehensive program to restructure public enterprises and give them greater management autonomy, including decisions on product pricing and salaries so that they can adapt to the new cost structure and increase productivity and competitiveness. The authorities should also consider disengaging the public sector from activities where the private sector can deliver goods and services in a more efficient manner and at competitive prices. 52. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to strengthen the monetary policy framework to bolster financial stability and support the unified exchange rate system. In particular, the creation of a framework for analysis of monetary developments at the CBL is an important prerequisite. Instruments for liquidity management, such as CBL certificates or treasury bills, would need to be developed soon. Also, the weak bank supervision system needs to be addressed promptly, along the lines of the recommendations of the MAE Technical Assistance mission of August 200 1. 53. Recent efforts to clear external arrears and regularize relations with creditors are welcome. Staff urges the authorities to take advantage of Libya’s improved financial position to regularize remaining external arrears. 54. Noticeable progress has been made in data compilation and reporting to the Fund, but fundamental steps to improve the statistical system are needed. Serious weaknesses in the statistical system remain, including in particular the large discrepancies between the fiscal deficit and financing. Also, the various extra-budgetary operations, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - fiscal decentralization make it very difficult to present a comprehensive fiscal situation in Libya. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to bring about major improvements in these areas, and encourages the authorities to participate in the Fund’s GDDS. Expeditious efforts in other areas are also needed, including in real sector data, external debt, balance of payments, and monetary statistics. 55. Libya continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Libya also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. In the absence of specific measures to eliminate the restrictions and multiple currency practices in a timely manner, the staff does not recommend that the Executive Board grant approval for the retention of the exchange practices under Article VIII.

From February 14, 1999 to December 3 1,2001, a dual exchange rate system was in place, with an “official” exchange rate pegged to the SDR, and a “special” exchange rate pegged to the U.S. dollar. Most exchange transactions, including oil exports and most public sector imports, took place at the official exchange rate. During that period, the authorities have gradually appreciated the special exchange rate while simultaneously depreciating the official exchange rate, before unifying the two rates through a 50 percent devaluation of the official exchange rate on January 1,2002. VIII. Exchange System Libya continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, including restrictions on invisible payments related to the transfer of remittances. Also, Libya maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) in the form of(i) the advance import deposit requirement and (ii) the 15 percent tax on purchases of foreign exchange by private enterprises. In addition, Libya maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3 in the form of(i) the advance import deposit requirement, (ii) the 15 percent tax on purchases of foreign exchange by private enterprises, and (iii) the 15 percent subsidy paid by the Libyan government on sales of foreign exchange by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - APPENDIX I private enterprises to the government. During the Article XIV discussions, held in the context of consultations under Article IV in January 2002, the staff urged the authorities to lift the remaining exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices, with a view to moving toward acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement. The authorities stated that almost all restrictions have been eliminated in the context of the exchange rate unification on January 1,2002. IX. Article IV Consultation Libya is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions were held during November 2000.

Libya has been a member of the World Bank Group since 1958, joining the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1958, International Development Association (IDA) in August 1961, and Multilateral International Guaranty Agency (MIGA) in April 1993. There have been no World Bank Group loan made to Libya to date as the development of the country’s petroleum assets from 1960 placed Libya quickly among capital-surplus oil-producing countries and provided resources to build extensive infrastructure and provide social services. The last World Bank economic report on Libya was prepared in 1959. 2. At the September 1999 Annual Meetings, Libya indicated interest in obtaining training and technical assistance (TA) from the Bank. Bank regional staff then accompanied the Bank Group Executive Director responsible for Libya to the country in early. April 2000 to make initial contacts and discuss the modalities of likely collaboration. At the Spring 2000 Meetings, Libyan Government representatives requested a Bank mission to identify training and TA requirements in national accounts, social and economic database management, customs modernization, small and medium enterprise development, and electronic bank payments system. To that end, a Bank mission visited Libya from June 17 to 27,200O and produced a detailedtechnical assistance identification report, which was shared with the Libyan authorities both in English and Arabic. 3. Following the June 2000 mission, the Central Bank of Libya expressed interest in pursuing TA from the World Bank to prepare a detailed implementation arrangements relating to the acquisition of a suitable set of modern Electronic Bank Payments System. A World Bank mission is scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2002. Besides the specific mission relating to Electronic Bank Payments System, the World Bank and the Libyan authorities are considering signing a Framework Agreement that will provide the basis for a program of Reimbursable Technical Assistance in various areas. 4. Earlier in 2001, the Bank prepared a report on Regional Capital Markets at the request of the Libyan authorities. The report was presented by the Libyan authorities at a Pan-African conference held in Tripoli. In 2000, the Libyan authorities invited the Bank Group (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) to the “International Conference on Development and Investments in Libya,” held in Tripoli. ‘Prepared by the World Bank staff.

Libya’s database suffers from shortcomings that seriously affect the capacity of staff to conduct effective surveillance. Among these are, (1) weaknesses in the conceptual and compilation procedures underpinning the collection of statistics in the various sectors; (2) deficiencies in both data quality, coverage, periodicity and timeliness; (3) lack of consistency of data across sectors; and (4) the lack of inter-agency cooperation, the proliferation of agencies with unclear and often overlapping responsibilities, and the continuous reshuffling of responsibilities among agencies. 2. The authorities have recently made progress in addressing some of the issues, particularly in monetary data and, to some extent, real sector data. The mission was provided in the field with revised historical data series in the monetary and real sectors, as well as a reconciliation of balance of payments data and data on change in net foreign assets in the monetary survey. The new monetary series benefit from improved classification and substantially lower shares of unclassified assets and liabilities to totals. As for real sector data, oil GDP , manufacturing, financing and subsidies were revised from 1986 onwards to address valuation and methodological issues. 3. Notwithstanding the above progress, major impediments to effective surveillance remain: (1) the lack of a data reporting system to the Fund in order to update MED’s operational database between missions; (2) the lack of a coherent methodological framework for the compilation of government finance data; and (3) substantial inconsistencies between sectors, in particular, between (i) data on budget execution and financing data from the CBL, (ii) hydrocarbon data as reported by the NOC and in the national accounts and the balance of payments; and (iii) in the treatment of Fund accounts within the CBL’s balance sheet. 4. A February 1998 multisector STA mission examined the conceptual and compilation procedures for national accounts, price indices and foreign trade, money and banking, and government finance, and developed recommendations for improvement in these systems that would enhance the quality of the data, and prepared a short term action plan to be implemented by the authorities. A review of the implementation status of mission’s recommendations shows that, while some of the recommendations were implemented, predominantly in money and banking statistics, and to a limited extent in price statistics, little progress was achieved in other areas. 5. The following sections outline the current status of data compilation and reporting by sector and assess progress achieved against individual recommendations included in STA’s action plan. 6. In the area of national accounts statistics, some progress has been achieved with the compilation of GDP estimates by economic activity and expenditure through 2000. While the data are compiled consistently with the 1968 System of National Accounts (I 968 SNA), the production of these data continues to be hampered by high staff turnover and by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4l- APPENDIX III significant delays in the receipt of basic information from various sources, particularly from other government agencies. These data also are based on outdated surveys and only partially cover the informal sector in Libya. Annual estimates up to 1999 have been reported in 2001 to STA for publication in IFS. 7. In the area of prices, some progress has been achieved with the resumption, after a nine-year hiatus, of the compilation of the consumer price index (CPI) using, to derive weights, the results of the 1992-93 household budget survey, as recommended by the 1998 STA mission. The new CPI has a 1999 base year and covered initially the first two quarters of 2000. This index is not reported to the Fund. Also, the authorities have not implemented two remaining STA recommendations: (1) compilation of a producer price index to use as deflator for national accounts aggregates; and (2) development of a consistent work program on price statistics with specific priorities and deadlines for the completion of the various tasks. 8. In money and banking statistics, while the timeliness and quality of monetary data reported to the IFS has improved, more efforts are needed. The CBL implemented most of the recommendations of the February 1998 STA mission pertaining to its accounts. These are: (i) the review of the analytical presentation of accounts to separately identify nonresident accounts according to the residency rather than nationality criterion; (ii) collection of data from the newly created banks, and accounts for the various institutions (DMBs, other banking institutions, off-shore banks and nonbank financial institutions) and the separate identification of government’s Social Security Fund; and (iii) the designing of new call report forms. However, weaknesses still persist with respect to, the proper coverage, sectorization of accounts, classification of financial instruments and valuation, the persistently high level of unclassified liabilities, the treatment of Fund accounts in the balance sheet of the CBL, and on account of the delay in consolidating the balance sheets of the regional banks within the monetary survey. 9. Regarding fiscal data, none of the recommendations of the 1998 STA mission has been implemented. No fiscal data have been reported to the Fund between missions. Further, the authorities have not implemented the recommendation of the 1998 STA mission on establishing a system to update and report MED’s tables on a regular basis. The Libyan fiscal information system remains fragmented and inconsistent with international standards, as it has been designed for administrative reporting under the government finance law rather than for purposes of providing timely statistical information for economic planning and analysis. 10. As to Balance of Payments data, the authorities resumed reporting to STA in 2000 of annual data following the presentation of the fourth edition of the BOP Manual (BPM4). However, the reported data suffer from deficiencies, mainly on account of (1) unclear methodology; (2) outdated surveys as sources for primary data; (3) lack of component detail; and (4) lack of comprehensive coverage for trade data.

Statistical Infrastructure Establish a ministerial coordination committee to enhance February 1999 Not implemented the data sharing among different government agencies B. National Accounts, Price Indices, and Foreign Trade National Accounts . Complete the estimates of GDP by economic September 1999 Partially implemented activity and expenditure through 1996; fill in missing estimates for previous years, so that a complete time series can be constructed for the period 1980-96 at current and constant prices. . Further improve these estimates by maximizing September 1999 Not implemented use of administrative sources (for example, customs and balance of payments data, government accounts, and income tax records) and results of existing surveys. . Start developing short-term economic indicators, June 1999 Not implemented including price indicators, and wage indicators. In this process, give priority to the timeliness of the indicators over the degree of detail. . Emphasize the transfer of knowledge and skills in June 1999 Not implemented national accounts compilation to Libyan nationals through intensive training in the UNDP program (Development, Planning and Training Project) to ensure that they take over full responsibilities in the supervision and production of these statistics. . Examine means by which a closer relationship March 1999 Not implemented could be established between the Census and Statistics Directorate (CSD) and the General Directorate of Economic Planning (GDEP), in Tripoli and Sirte, respectively. Their location in two different places prevents close contact between them and could lead to duplication of work.

Urgently resume the compilation of the consumer price index, using weights derived from the results of the 1992-93 household budget survey. Pending the development of a comprehensive index that will take some months, an interim index could be compiled, using weights at the groups’ level and prices for a simplified basket of 40 to 60 items. Prices should be collected in both private shops and department stores located in the six major cities of the country. . Establish a producer price index covering agriculture, fishing, manufacturing, telecommunications, and electricity, gas, and water supply, to facilitate the deflation of national accounts aggregates. . Develop a consistent work program on price statistics with specific priorities and deadlines for the completion of the various tasks to prevent this area from being swamped by other large statistical undertakings, such as the 1995 population census. C. Money and Banking Statistics . Implement the recommended changes in the classification of the accounts of the CBL, particularly those relating to international reserves, other foreign assets and liabilities, central government credit and deposits, and unclassified assets and liabilities. To the extent possible, revise historical data. . Show separately the revaluation accounts for foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities for both the Central Bank and DMBs under the capital accounts. . Separately identify all nonresident accounts in the analytical presentation of accounts of the CBL and classify these as foreign assets and liabilities according to the residency criterion. In addition, separate the accounts of the deposit money banks, other banking institutions, and nonbank financial institutions in the accounts of the CBL.

Implement, in consultation with STA, the proposed changes in the DMBs’ call report forms and instructions that apply the balance of payments residency criterion, a proper sectorization of accounts, and an appropriate classification of financial instruments. Complete, in collaboration with STA, the design and review of the DMBs’ new call report forms and the accompanying instructions. Start testing the implementation of the new call report forms. Strengthen the Statistics Unit in charge of the consolidation of DMBs’ balance sheet by allocating suffkient computer equipment and by deploying an additional staff member to permit better verification of the data reported by banks, and harmonize the databases of the RSD and Accounts and Investment Division under a computerized system. Include data on the Social Security Fund’s accounts in the financing of the government in the CBL’s records, and intensify efforts to identify the causes of the remaining discrepancies. Expand the coverage of banks to collect and compile monthly data on Other Banking Institutions-offshore banks and the specialized institutions such as the Agricultural Bank, the Development Bank, and the Savings and Real Estate Bank-and report their accounts to STA.

The staffs illustrative medium-term policy scenario is based on WEO’s oil prices, a relatively conservative budgetary oil price of US$l6 per barrel,’ a continuation of the current gradual and cautious pace of reforms of the price and subsidy system, including no pass- through to domestic prices of essential items, relative restraint on extrabudgetary and capital* expenditures and mounting pressures on current expenditures.3 While the expected lower level of oil prices over 2003-07 compared to the 2000-01 average does not raise any immediate sustainability concern, particularly for the external sector, where the external current account is expected to remain comfortably in surplus, the outlook appears less favorable for the budget. Without corrective measures, the fiscal stance is projected to weaken gradually over the medium-term to about a deficit of about 2 percent of GDP in 2007. Moreover, the deficit excluding revenue from the ORF increases to reach over 10 percent of GDP in 2005. While the continuation of price controls and subsidies secures a low inflation rate of around 2 percent over the period, it deters private sector activity, and nongovernment investment remains flat at around 1.4 percent of GDP. As a result, real GDP growth, which increases by less than 1 percentage point over the period, is too gradual to enable the economy to absorb new entrants to the labor force, which is estimated to grow by around 3.3 percent annually. In staffs opinion, higher growth rates could be attained, if a comprehensive reform package, including the lifting of the remaining structural rigidities in prices, trade-and exchange systems; and the comprehensive reform of public enterprises, were implemented. ‘At the time of the mission oil prices were around US$19 per barrel. The budgetary oil price will not affect oil revenue, but rather its distribution between the ORF and the budget. *Although the authorities have indicated that they project a full implementation of budgetary capital expenditure allocations, staff assumes a more realistic coeffkient of implementation of projects in the development budget of the order of 83 percent, and a conservative budgetary oil price which limits the scope of budgeted capital outlays in accordance with the 70130 rule. 3Pressures stem mainly from the growth of transfers to the regions and public enterprises, including NASCO, as well as fi-om wages and salaries, with a very slow pace of civil service reform, and calls for salary increases (the GPC called in December 200 1 for an increase in salaries of civil servants of 50 percent starting November 2002).

This would require strengthening the Research Department, among other things. l It is essential that several things happen for monetary reform to take place: (i) all directed credit schemes must be phased out; (ii) banks need to be given autonomy to make market-based investment decisions; and (iii) interest rate subsidies must be replaced by explicit budgetary transfers targeting the priority sectors. l Controls on interest rates should be gradually removed as an essential prerequisite for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
