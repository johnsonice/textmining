Abed and G. Russell Kincaid July 16,2002 l Article IV consultation discussions were held in Sana’a from April 1 to 9. The Executive Board discussion was delayed to allow the authorities to complete the PRSP. The staff team consisted of Messrs. Gardner (head), Williams and Grigorian (all MED), Mr. Peiris (PDR), and Ms. Zakharova (FAD). The mission met with the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the minister of finance, the minister of planning and development, the minister of civil service and pensions, the minister of commerce and industry, the minister of agriculture, the governor of the central bank, government officials, and the chamber of commerce and industry. The mission also visited Seiyun, where it attended a PRSP workshop and met with members of the newly-elected local council. . At the conclusion of the 2000 Article IV consultation on February 28, 2001, Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in macroeconomic balances resulting from the recovery of oil prices and the authorities’ efforts at containing expenditure growth. Directors called for continued expenditure restraint to make room for poverty-related spending and were concerned over rising wage and defense outlays. Directors were disappointed at the slow pace of structural reforms since 1999 and stressed the need for progress in civil service reform, fuel price adjustments, and tax reform, with particular attention to the introduction of a simple and broad-based general sales tax. They also underscored the importance of strengthening governance and the rule of law as necessary conditions for private sector development. Directors supported a tightening of monetary growth in 200 1 to support disinflation and noted the improvements made in banking supervision. They advised the authorities to allow the exchange rate to be fully market determined. l Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. . Yemen participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program in October-November 2000. The ensuing Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was discussed by the Executive Board jointly with the 2000 Article IV Consultation.

Oil output (l/3 of GDP) was flat in 2001, and non-oil GDP growth slowed to 4 percent owing to weaknesses in agriculture, manufacturing, and electricity. Inflation flared up due to increases in diesel and electricity prices and lower agricultural production, but is set to return to single digits in 2002. In line with program objectives, official gross foreign reserves rose by US$O.7 billion in 2001 to US$3.6 billion (15 months of imports), and have continued to increase in 2002. The 2001 budget surplus (2.8 percent of GDP) was lower than programmed owing to lower-than-expected oil revenues and expenditure overruns in defense and fuel subsidies. Ln 200 1, broad money growth (18.7 percent) decelerated relative to 2000, but it still exceeded the program target. Macroeconomic objectives and policies for 2002. Based on projected non-oil growth of 5 percent in 2002, continued strength in oil prices, and declining inflation, the short-term outlook is stable. Widespread poverty, inadequate per capita growth, and projected steady decline of oil revenue starting in 2003 are core challenges for the medium term, as recognized in the PRSP. The budget is projected to move into deficit in 2002 (0.6 percent of GDP) due to lower oil revenue and an unchanged non-oil deficit. With large increases in wage and defense spending, expenditure restraint relies on containing development spending. Structural reforms targeted for 2002 include improving payroll control, beginning retrenchment of excess civil servants, developing a civil service restructuring plan, and strengthening tax and customs administrations. Parliament passed a General Sales Tax (GST) law in November 200 1, which however does not meet the conditions of a simple and broad-based tax. A tightening of monetary conditions is programmed to sustain disinflation. Staff appraisal. Fiscal and monetary policies remain appropriately restrained to preserve macroeconomic stability in the short run, but no progress is being made to reduce the non-oil budget deficit towards long-run sustainability, and expenditure composition has deteriorated. Targeted measures in civil service reform and customs and tax administration are welcome, and decentralization now underway should help improve expenditure quality. But fundamental revenue and expenditure measures are required to put the non-oil deficit on an adjustment path and to reallocate budgetary resources to pro-poor and pro-growth spending. Reforms should include (i) effective tax reform and amendment of the GST; (ii) phasing-out of fuel subsidies (3l% percent of GDP); (iii) expenditure management reform; (iv) pension reform; and (v) civil service reform. Continued flexibility in exchange rate management will facilitate adjustment. Achievement of the ambitious growth objectives of the PRSP will depend on improvements in governance and removal of structural impediments to private sector activity. Policies for 2002 should help consolidate past gains and make advances in some critical structural areas and will be monitored through a staff-monitored program. A successor PRGF arrangement will need to be based on more ambitious policies including fundamental tax and expenditure reforms and the adoption of a stronger budget for 2003.

On October 24,2001, the Executive Board completed the last reviews under the PRGF/EFF arrangements that expired on October 28,200l. Performance under the program was mixed. The program succeeded in consolidating macroeconomic stability by containing public expenditure pressures created by the oil windfall and by improving monetary discipline. In conjunction with a recovery of oil prices, the strengthening of financial policies led to the accumulation of US$2.4 billion in foreign reserves. However, private sector investment failed to take off, and real GDP growth remained below program objectives, reflecting the slow pace of structural reform. Little progress was achieved in tax, civil service, pension, budget and judicial reform, as well as in privatization. More advances were made in price and trade liberalization, bank supervision, and, to a lesser extent, fuel subsidy reduction. 2. The authorities have completed the PRSP for the period 2003-05 and have requested that their 2002 program be monitored through a SMP with a view to a successor PRGF arrangement in 2003. The policies to be monitored are described in the attached LO1 and MEFP. A successor PRGF arrangement would need to be based on durable fiscal adjustment and a strong commitment to structural reform, particularly in the tax and expenditure areas where reform has been lagging. II. BACKGROUND 3. While working to strengthen democratic institutions through decentralization, the government has taken measures to reinforce the rule of law and the authority of the central government in more remote parts of the country. Parliamentary elections are planned for April 2003, to be followed by presidential election in 2004. Relations with neighboring countries have strengthened, and Yemen has been invited to join some of the technical committees of the Gulf Cooperation Council. 4. In 2001, growth slowed down, while inflation rose following increases in the prices of diesel and electricity and tightening supply conditions in agriculture. Real gross national disposable income (real gross national income adjusted for terms of trade gains or losses) rose by only 1.9 percent in 2001, owing to lower non-oil GDP growth, flat oil production, and falling oil prices (Figure 1). The slowdown in non-oil GDP growth (to 4 percent) relative to 2000 (4.7 percent) reflects weaker-than-expected performance in the agriculture, manufacturing, and electricity sectors. Tourism suffered from the aftermath of the 9/l 1 attacks, but the sector’s contribution to GDP remains marginal. The 12-month CPI inflation rate reached 22 percent by December 200 1 and 9 percent for the core CPI (excluding qat and food) (Figure 2). The flare-up of qat and food prices during the year reflects inadequate rainfall and the impact of higher diesel prices on production costs.’ The impact of ‘The production of qat depends heavily on diesel-powered water pumps.

By May 2002, the 12-month CPI inflation rate was down to 18 percent and stable at 9 percent when excluding food and qat. 5. Gross foreign reserves of the central bank rose by US$747 million in 2001 to US$3.6 billion (15 months of imports), and the exchange rate remained relatively stable. Rising imports and falling oil export revenues caused the current account surplus to narrow relative to 2000. Over the first five months of 2002, gross reserves rose by US$98 million. The rial depreciated by 4.1 percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar during 2001 and by about 1% percent through the first six months of 2002. With higher inflation, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 19.7 percent over the 12 months ending December 2001 (6.3 percent excluding food and qat prices), leading to a cumulative appreciation of just over 30 percent since 1999 (22 percent excluding food and qat prices) (Figure 3). 6. The budget outturn for 2001 was weaker than programmed, owing to the fall in oil prices in the second half of the year and expenditure overruns in defense and fuel subsidies. The budget surplus came to 2.8 percent of GDP compared with a revised program target of 4.0 percent. The difference arises from lower oil revenues (about % percent of GDP) and from expenditure overruns (about % percent of GDP). Defense spending was pushed up by a 25 percent increase in salaries of military personnel, upgrading of equipment, higher diesel prices, and the cost of new security measures. Fuel subsidies exceeded program projections by a wide margin, reflecting increased smuggling of diesel in anticipation of the July price increase. Preliminary fiscal data for the first quarter of 2002 point to an (annualized) budget surplus of 4 percent of GDP, which is expected to be reversed with the rise in expenditures in the latter part of the year. 7. Broad money growth decelerated markedly relative to 2000 but, at 18.7 percent, it still exceeded the central bank target of 13 percent. Dollarization deepened somewhat. Monetary growth slowed rapidly through November 200 1, but soared anew in December 2001 due to seasonal factors but also increased government spending financed by a reduction in government deposits at the central bank (Figure 4). The central bank began mopping up the excess liquidity in early 2002, but broad money growth has remained high (19.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May 2002) reflecting a rise in the money multiplier. The share of foreign currency deposits in total deposits rose from 5 1 percent at end-2000 to 53 percent at end-200 1. Continued uncertainty about the stability of the exchange rate (possibly compounded by the inflationary spike in the summer) may explain why dollarization increased despite a widening interest differential in favor of the rial. III. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES 8. With non-oil GDP growth expected to rise to 5 percent, relatively strong oil prices, and a projected decline in inflation, the short-term outlook appears relatively stable.

Staff reviewed policy intentions for 2002 in light of these requirements with a view to preparing the ground for effective implementation of the PRSP starting in 2003. A. Medium-Term Challenges 9. With 42 percent of the population living below the poverty line in 1998, poverty reduction is a key economic and social objective for the medium term.2 Because earlier surveys are not comparable, no reliable information is available on how poverty rates have evolved over time. The 1998 household survey indicated that about 3 million people, out of a population of 17 million, may have been significantly undernourished. Poverty is concentrated in rural areas, where almost half of the population is classified as poor, compared to less than one-third in urban areas. Starting in 1996, the government began setting up social safety net programs to accompany the gradual dismantling of food and fuel subsidies. These programs include the Social Welfare Fund (SWF), which provides cash assistance to poor households, the Social Fund for Development (SFD), which supports community development projects, including microcredits, and the Public Works Program. The SWF covers about 500,000 families but has suffered from poor targeting. To improve its efficiency, the authorities have undertaken a verification of beneficiaries and expect to gradually increase coverage to 600,000 families, and to increase disbursements from under US$60 million to US$75-80 million annually. The SFD has been quite successful at the local level, but its coverage remains limited. In 2001, its disbursements amounted to US$67 million. As reported in the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), the PRSP provides a solid framework for reorienting policies towards poverty alleviation, although the strategy will need to be reinforced and expanded in some areas to enhance the changes of success. 10. The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is dominated by the projected decline in government oil revenues linked to the gradual exhaustion of existing oil reserves. Production from proven reserves is projected to decline starting in 2003. Prospects for new oil discoveries in fields recently opened to exploration appear to be good, but any new discovery would probably not come on line before 2004-05.3 A long-run adjustment scenario, which builds on the macroeconomic framework of the PRSP, is presented in Figure 5 and described in Box 1. 11. Substantial adjustment in the non-oil fiscal balance will be required over the medium term to maintain viable fiscal and external positions as oil revenues decline. As shown in the illustrative scenario, barring major new oil discoveries, the non-oil fiscal deficit *The 1998 household survey is the last available comprehensive survey. ‘Fourteen foreign companies are undertaking exploration in 24 oil blocks in the border area with Saudi Arabia and offshore. Four fields have already yielded commercially viable amounts of oil, but these results need to be reassessed by ongoing surveys.

Republic of Yemen: Medium-Term Scenarios For the period 2002-05, the scenario replicates the macroeconomic framework of the PRSP. It is then driven by projections of exogenous variables for 200620. In addressing the issue of external sustainability, the adjustment scenario makes use of current account identity: CA, = S, -I, - BD, , where CA, is the current account in the absence of domestic oil (i.e., including imputed oil imports); S, is private non-oil savings; I, is private non-oil investment; and WV0 is the non-oil budget balance. After an initial rapid acceleration, output growth is projected to decline gradually from a peak of 7 percent in 2005 to 5.7 percent in 2020. This decline is assumed to coincide with a decline in population growth and the return to more sustainable growth rate after an initial rapid catch-up. In order to build the scenario on conservative assumptions, the private saving rate is projected to decline initially and to rise gradually only after 2003 in line with rising private investment. To sustain the high growth pattern, private investment is assumed to grow as a share of non-oil GDP to 2 1 percent in 2005, then gradually to 23 percent in 2020. The productivity of capital (measured by the ICOR) improves gradually through the period. The non-oil budget deficit is the key exogenous variable. In order to avoid disruptive adjustment costs, the adjustment scenario targets a smooth reduction in the (non-oil) deficit as a percent of non- oil GDP. The pace of adjustment for the period after 2005 is set so as to maintain external viability throughout (in terms of import coverage of foreign reserves) and to reach a sustainable fiscal position once oil revenues are virtually exhausted. The implied adjustment comes to about 1 percent of GDP per year. Since oil company current and capital transactions cancel out,’ the change in foreign reserves is derived as AR = CA, + OIL, + K , where OIL, is government oil revenues and K is net (non-oil) capital inflows. As described above, the current account is determined by the fiscal position and the private saving-investment balance. Projected oil revenues depend on the level of oil production,* international oil prices, and the government share of oil production. Finally, net (non-oil) capital inflows are exogenously determined and assumed to be increasing only slightly in percent of non-oil GDP. Despite steady fiscal adjustment, the overall budget deficit (BD = BD, + OIL,) remains roughly unchanged at about 4 percent of GDP until 2007, reflecting the rapid decline in oil revenues in the early years. ‘This is explained by the fact that oil export earnings are remitted as profits and cost recovery, and gross FDI inflows are offset by imports related to oil companies’ current and capital spending. ‘This, in turn, is based on (i) current production plans grossed up by 10 percent in 2005 to account for likely oil discoveries and (ii) a projected rate of decline of production of 4 percent after 2005 until exhaustion of proven reserves (2.8 billion barrels at present).

Adjustment will also need to be front-loaded in order to ensure a smooth transition to external and fiscal viability. Accordingly, the fiscal targets of the PRSP imply a reduction of the non-oil deficit averaging 1% percent of GDP per year from 2003 to 2005. Notwithstanding this adjustment, the overall budget deficit is expected to widen, but the authorities underscored that they would not allow it to exceed 4 percent of GDP. The adjustment is achieved by curbing expenditure (about 2% percent of GDP cumulative decline) and raising non-oil revenues through tax reform and anti-smuggling measures (about 2 percent of GDP cumulative increase). Staff emphasized that the projected increase in non- oil revenues would depend on effective tax reform, including amendments to the General Sales Tax (GST) Law (discussed below). In order to create room for poverty-related spending, the authorities indicated that most of the expenditure adjustment would have to come from the elimination of fuel subsidies and a decline in military spending as a percent of GDP. Pending a more detailed civil service reform plan, an increase in the wage bill is assumed in order to cover the cost of civil service reform and to meet possible pressures for new hiring by local governments (mostly in education and health). Development spending is also projected to increase. The government debt ratio is projected to remain roughly unchanged at about 60 percent of GDP over the next decade. 12. In the scenario, foreign reserves accumulated to date are used to achieve a smoother and less disruptive adjustment than would otherwise be necessary, but the country will face, nonetheless, a protracted balance of payments problem. Foreign reserves are projected to decline starting in 2003 to a trough of about US$l.6 billion around 2013, and would remain above three months of imports throughout the period. The debt service ratio is projected to rise from about 6 percent of export of goods and services in 200 1 to 10 percent in 2007, and is likely to increase further as oil revenues decline. In order to prevent a faster depletion of foreign reserves, balance of payments and budgetary support will be required, as reflected in the external financing gap of the balance of payments projections. Such financing should be concessional in view of Yemen’s relative low per capita income and the need to keep its debt situation manageable. 13. One risk to the scenario lies in the potential failure of growth to pick up as projected by the authorities, which would make fiscal adjustment more difficult to sustain. Staff views the acceleration of growth targeted in the PRSP to be on the optimistic side-non-oil real GDP growth is projected to rise from a recent average of 5 percent to 7 percent by 2005. This improvement is nonetheless achievable if accompanied by (i) a faster pace of structural reforms, with particular emphasis on privatization, competition policy, governance, and judicial and civil service reform; and (ii) the preservation of external competitiveness through flexible management of the exchange rate. If non-oil real GDP growth were to remain unchanged at 5 percent, the fiscal deficit would widen by about % percentage point of GDP by 2005, and expenditure growth would have to be trimmed to maintain fiscal sustainability. At the same time, pressures for a more expansionary fiscal stance would likely emerge, putting the adjustment strategy at risk. Lower growth would have Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- less of an impact on the balance of payments to the extent that private investment, and by implication the current account deficit, would also be lower. 14. Another risk lies in the volatility of oil prices. Presently, for every dollar decline in the price of oil, the fiscal balance worsens by 0.7 percent of GDP, and external reserves decline by about US$60 million. These effects dampen over time, as the weight of the oil sector in the economy declines. The adjustment scenario is resilient to a temporary drop in oil prices relative to the baseline, which could be accommodated through some loss in foreign reserves. A more permanent decline in oil prices, however, would require additional adjustment. Figure 5 illustrates the impact of a permanent drop of oil prices to US$15 per barrel (for Yemeni crude) starting in 2003. At unchanged policies, the budget deficit would widen to 8 percent of GDP in 2003, and the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to just under 80 percent of GDP by 2010. As a result of the shortfall in government oil export revenues, foreign exchange reserves would be depleted by 2013. 15. On the upside, new oil discoveries and the exploitation of Yemen’s gas reserves could improve the fiscal and external balances. Yemen sits on over 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Attempts to secure an export market for Yemeni gas have so far been unsuccessful, in part because of the high cost of building the required infrastructure for exporting gas. However, the government is working with the World Bank to exploit gas for domestic electricity production. The potential benefits would be large in terms of new hydrocarbon revenues for the government and lower electricity generation costs. B. Public Finances in 2002 16. The overall fiscal balance is projected to move into a small deficit in 2002 (0.6 percent of GDP), reflecting lower oil revenues and an unchanged non-oil balance. The projection is based on an average international oil price of US$23 per barrel, broadly in line with the average price in the first six months of 2002, and an unchanged tax-to-non-oil- GDP ratio. The budget approved by parliament had targeted significant expenditure adjustment. The authorities indicated, however, that additional budgetary allocations would be needed in 2002 to meet recent wage concessions to teachers and new military obligations. In all, new nonmilitary discretionary spending is set to grow by only 1.6 percent in nominal terms in 2002, corresponding to a decline of 1.7 percent of GDP relative to 2001 .4 However, this adjustment will be offset by higher military spending and the carryover of expenditures from the 200 1 budget. 17. The mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment to contain overall expenditure, despite the pressures arising from teachers’ wages and defense, but 4Nonmilitary discretionary spending is defined as total expenditure less (i) defense spending; (ii) interest; (iii) changes in fuel subsidies due to changes in international oil prices; (iv) expenditure carried over from the 2001 budget; and (v) subsidies to public enterprises, which were previously off-budget.

It considered that the 2002 fiscal program would help preserve stability and set the stage for a stronger budget in 2003. In the absence of a new round of generalized wage increases, and with the winding down of some military expenditures, the mission saw scope for considerable fiscal adjustment in 2003 and the adoption of a more pro- poor and pro-growth budget. 18. The purchase of MIG aircraft and avionics and new security operations are the main factors behind the projected increase in defense spending in 2002 (by 1 percent of GDP relative to 2001). The 2002 budget makes an allowance of US$lSO million for MIGs, out of a total contract of over US$400 million to be filled over three years. Initially, much of the cost of the MIGs was to be offset by cuts in other defense spending, but additional budget allocations became necessary to finance the internal security operations now underway. The authorities explained that new aircraft were needed to replace ageing equipment in the face of domestic security concerns. Military spending was expected to decline markedly over the medium term due to the winding down of MIG purchases and the planned retrenchment of military and security personnel. 19. The wage bill will be boosted by court-ordered retroactive wage increases for teachers (about 40 percent of civil servants). The original budget had not allowed for any new wage increase in 2002, but teachers won a 20 percent raise to match that received by other civil servants in 2000. The increase in the wage bill also reflects the full year effect of the generalized 15 percent wage increase granted in August 200 1. The mission highlighted the importance of making rapid progress on civil service reform to create room for targeted (rather than generalized and costly) salary increases in the future. 20. In the face of rising military and wage expenditures, the authorities decided to ration development spending to contain the fiscal deficit. Excluding border demarcation, development spending is programmed to remain roughly unchanged in nominal terms in 2002. The tight objective is to be realized by limiting capital transfers to local authorities and rationing disbursements for ongoing projects carried out by the central government. In the first half of 2002, delays in the planning and execution of new projects that have been delegated to local authorities should mitigate pressures for additional budgetary allocations. The authorities underscored, however, that pressures for larger transfers would inevitably increase in line with the expectations created by decentralization, particularly if oil prices remain high. 21. Lower international oil prices and the domestic diesel price increase of 2001 will contribute to reduced fuel price subsidies in 2002, but at 3% percent of GDP, they remain a heavy burden on the budget.5 The domestic price of diesel stands at just over ‘Fuel subsidies are projected to decline by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2002, largely on account of the full year impact of the diesel price increase of August 200 1.

The mission urged the authorities to take a further, even if modest, step to close this gap in 2002. The authorities remarked that the cabinet had agreed in principle to raise diesel prices, but that the window of opportunity for taking such a measure this year had been narrowed by the prospect of legislative elections in April 2003. A strengthening of the social safety net would be necessary to mitigate the impact on the poor. 22. The mission commended the authorities for bringing on budget the quasi-fiscal losses of the Public Electricity Company (PEC) through an explicit subsidy (0.4 percent of GDP in 2002). These losses had been hidden until now in PEC’s unpaid fuel bill, which was eventually deducted from the government’s oil revenues. The move to a more transparent treatment of the subsidy was linked to the implementation of a restructuring plan for PEC supported by the World Bank (Box 2).

C. Fiscal Reform Measures 23. In view of the magnitude of the fiscal adjustment required over the medium term and the need to provide sufficient resources for social and development spending (including maintenance which has been typically sacrificed in the past), the mission underscored the importance of moving ahead with fundamental expenditure and revenue reforms, with a focus on tax and customs reform, civil service reform, and improved expenditure management. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- Box 2. Yemen: Public Electricity Company The Public Electricity Company (PEC) is the state-owned utility in charge of generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power in Yemen. PEC’s losses amount to US$40 million annually. Outdated technology, inefficient use of fuel, large technical losses, and high overhead expenses contribute to PEC’s financial weakness. In addition, the company had a large outstanding stock of (overdue) accounts receivable, primarily owed by the state water utility, which has recently been brought under control. Electricity tariffs in Yemen are about mid-range by regional standards (lower than in Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, but higher than in Algeria, Egypt, Syria and Iran). Despite a 30 percent increase in tariffs in July 2001, the average tariff (YRls 12.3/kWh) remains below the cost recovery level (YRls 15.4/kWh). Further adjustment in tariffs should, however, be accompanied by adjustments in diesel prices to prevent companies from switching to own diesel-powered generation.’ Technical losses and operational inefficiencies also impact financial viability of the PEC. At present, from a total of 36 percent of electricity lost, transmission and distribution account for 18-20 percent, while theft accounts for 16-I 8 percent. So while tariff adjustments can help close some of the gap between the average tariff and cost recovery, the residual will need to be eliminated by reducing operational inefficiencies. The weak financial state of PEC has resulted in inadequate maintenance and insufficient investment to maintain and expand existing supply infrastructure. Currently, total demand is estimated at about 700 MW compared to supply of about 500 MW during the peak period. The difference, unserved demand, is expected to grow rapidly to about 650 MW by 2006, if no steps are taken to increase supply through better maintenance of existing supply facilities and construction of new capacities. Consistent with the World Bank’s recommendations, the government’s proposed energy sector strategy focuses on (i) short-term efficiency improvements to attain financial viability and (ii) capacity expansion. The first objective is to be achieved through both tariff and non-tariff measures, such as better maintenance and reduction of illegal use aimed at lowering technical losses to acceptable levels (around 20 percent given PEC’s characteristics).2 The second objective will be addressed through construction of three new power stations. In addition to these measures, the medium-term operational restructuring of PEC should include functional separation of PEC into generation, transmission, and distribution companies and introduction of limited retail competition. A possible long-term solution to reducing electricity generating costs and eliminating shortages would be to switch to low-cost gas-based electricity generation. Yemen’s estimated gas reserves amount to at least 12 trillion cubic feet, which are sufficient to meet the country’s electricity needs for at least a century. In addition to its importance as an environmentally clean source of energy, gas will provide a cheap substitute for oil in electricity generation. At its extraction and transmission cost, the oil-equivalent price of gas would be around US$l.%barrel. However, investment of some US$l.3 billion is needed over the next ten years to develop gas-powered generation. Even if the projects were to start now, the first facility would not come online until 2006. Private sector participation is seen as critical in meeting the investment requirements. ‘At the current price of diesel of YRls 17/liter, the cost of privately generated electricity amounts to US$O.13- O.lS/kWh compared to US$O.O9-0.1 l/kWh charged by PEC to industrial and commercial users. Any increase in the electricity tariffs beyond $O.l3/kWh is likely to trigger a move towards private generation of electricity by industrial consumers. 2The proposed tariff-related measures include automatic indexation of tariffs to the marginal cost of fuel faced by the PEC.

The mission expressed strong reservations about the GST law that was passed by parliament in November 2001. Extensive exemptions and zero rating undermined the principles of a simple and broad-based value-added tax. According to staff, in its present form, the GST is unlikely to generate additional revenues and could in fact lead to revenue losses-while some services presently untaxed will be covered, more goods will be exempted than under the present system. Moreover, extensive zero rating and emphasis on rapid reimbursement of tax credits will place strains on a relatively weak tax administration and possibly increase (rather than reduce) the scope for negotiations over tax liabilities. To avoid implementation problems that could derail the reform program, staff recommended deferring introduction of the law until it could be amended. The authorities recognized these weaknesses in the law but considered that compromises had been necessary to forestall the parliament’s threat to declare the law unislamic. In their view, incremental progress could be made, after implementation, through later amendments. 25. It was agreed that a broad review of the indirect tax system was needed before pushing for amendments to the GST. The mission noted that concerns about smuggling (and its impact on the tax base) and lack of transparency in the tax administration had contributed to derail passage of a clean GST. These concerns needed to be addressed in the context of a broad review of the indirect tax system to take place in the next few months with technical assistance from the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD). The FAD technical assistance mission would help map out an action plan for tax reform (including amending the GST) in a more integrated fashion. 26. Progress has been made to modernize the tax authority, but improvements are still needed along the lines of previous technical assistance recommendations. Following the establishment of the Large Taxpayer Unite (LTU), progress was made in 2001 in transferring large taxpayer files to the LTU and in assigning tax identification numbers to taxpayers. However, the mission found that organizational arrangements and management practices still need strengthening, including the reorganization of the LTU along functional lines (i.e., by activity rather than by type of tax), and establishment of a taxpayer services unit. The authorities assured staff that both objectives would be met this year. 27. The mission underscored the potential for increased revenue collection from enforcement of the customs regime. With imports amounting to over 30 percent of GDP and an average tariff rate of 12.6 percent, customs revenues could be nearly double the 2 percent of GDP collected at present. The mission welcomed the progress made in modernizing the customs administration, especially the effective implementation of the first phase of the ASYCUDA ( computerization of customs offices) project at the Sana’a airport and the publication of all relevant regulations on the website. In 2002, the authorities plan to implement the first phase of the ASYCUDA system at two other entry points, thus covering over half of total customs revenues. They will also begin to develop a limited valuation database, which is one of the targets under the next phase of ASYCUDA. The authorities Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - acknowledged, however, that implementation of ASYCUDA would produce only limited revenue benefits without a more direct action against smuggling and corruption in the policing of the border. Civil service reform and wage policy 28. There is a general consensus that civil service reform is key to successful structural reforms more generally and to a sustainable wage policy over the medium term. A compressed wage schedule and a loose recruitment policy have led, over recent years, to a dysfunctional civil service, characterized by overstaffing, poor pay, and a spreading of corruption. Until these problems are addressed, pressures for generalized wage increases and more hiring will remain strong, as witnessed by the increase in the wage bill (1.5 percentage points of GDP) in the last two years. The mission underscored the need for strong political leadership to overcome vested interests against reform. 29. The authorities have declared 2002 “the year of civil service reform” and plan to take measures along three axes: (i) improving payroll control; (ii) facilitating the retrenchment of civil servants; and (iii) developing a civil service restructuring plan.6 Measures in the first group include the census of civil servants and the establishment of a computerized database of civil servants, both completed in 2001. Building on these actions, the 2002 program targets the issuing of biometric cards to civil servants, which will facilitate the removal of ghost workers and double dippers from the payroll. The authorities also stated their commitment to limit recruitment to 9,700 in 2002, as provided for in the budget, and to retire all remaining (15,478) over-age civil servants from the payroll. In the second area of reform, the authorities plan to transfer 11,000 civil servants to the Civil Service Fund (CSF) by end-2002. Those transferred to the CSF will be covered for two years by the fund and will either be trained for alternative employment or moved to the pension fund. In the third area, six ministries and agencies are expected to formulate restructuring plans by year-end. In 2002, customs will be added and will provide a restructuring plan by end-2002. The government also plans to prepare a salary reform plan. However, implementation will need to be linked to the overall restructuring of the civil service. Pension reform 30. Finalization of the reformed pension law is awaiting completion of the data base on dependent beneficiaries. The public pension system, although presently in surplus, is actuarially unviable. The actuarial model procured through technical assistance from the Fund in August 2001 enabled the authorities to explore alternative benefit and contribution plans that would restore the viability of the system. However, because of lack of data, the 6The World Bank is taking the lead in civil service reform. The Fund will monitor progress in this area because it is critical for fiscal sustainability, as wages and salaries account for more than one quarter of current expenditure.

Since pension rights are extended to surviving spouses, children, and orphaned nieces and nephews for prolonged periods of time, the associated pension liability can be large. The mission recommended that viability be restored mostly by adjustments to benefits rather than employer (the state) contributions. The authorities stressed the difficulty of reducing benefits in view of the social safety net character of the pension system. In the staffs view, the social safety net features should be better targeted to the most vulnerable groups using alternative programs and supplemented as necessary by additional budgetary appropriations. Fiscal decentralization 31. To avoid a loss of fiscal control, fiscal decentralization is being managed closely by the central government, but in time local governments will need to acquire greater fiscal independence. About 20 percent of general government spending is to be transferred to the subnational level in 2002 (Box 3). In view of the capacity limitations of local governments (in terms of budget preparation, execution, and monitoring), the ministry of finance has retained tight control over the financial execution of local budgets. While such an arrangement should ensure that expenditures are maintained within budget, in time local governments are likely to demand greater independence. In this context, the mission noted that it may prove desirable to amend the local authorities’ law to clarify the division of fiscal responsibilities and to create a more solid revenue base for local governments than the present system of open-ended transfers from the central government. The weak expenditure management capacity at the subnational level will also need to be addressed. Expenditure management 32. Budget preparation, execution, and reporting systems will need to be modernized to enable effective execution of the poverty reduction strategy and stricter adherence to budget targets. Budget negotiations based on a line-item approach are presently disengaged from macroeconomic developments and do not always ensure that agreed expenditure priorities are translated into adequate budget appropriations. Based on the recommendations of FAD technical assistance, the mission encouraged the authorities to adopt a more transparent budget process, based on a medium-term budget framework and a top-down approach to budget allocations. At the implementation level, the line-by-line control over expenditures and blunt rationing of cash releases has been instrumental in maintaining fiscal discipline, but has also undermined the effectiveness of spending by unduly constraining high priority programs. The mission noted that, as the authorities prepare to implement a poverty reduction strategy, the execution process could be streamlined to allow line ministries greater independence in managing their budgets. A detailed functional breakdown of expenditure will be needed to enable effective targeting and tracking of pro- poor spending during the budget execution process. A comprehensive computerized accounting and financial information system being developed with the assistance of the World Bank will provide such information, but the system will not be operational for several Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Box 3. Republic of Yemen: Fiscal Decentralization Under the local authorities’ law, responsibility for health, education, and development projects is to be transferred to subnational authorities, comprised of 21 governorates and some 300 districts. In the 2002 budget, this spending accounts for about 20 percent of total expenditure. Subnational governments are not permitted to borrow. The central government is responsible for financing recurrent costs, while development spending is to be covered by the local authorities’ own resources and central government transfers. Presently, revenue sources assigned to the local authorities to fund their development projects amount to only 3 percent of national revenues and include the alms tax (zakhat), the tax on real estate earnings, the tax on qat consumption, and a wide range of fees and charges. Consequently, most of subnational government budgets are financed from central government transfers. While the potential benefits of decentralization are considerable, including an improvement in the quality and cost effectiveness of public services, further structural changes may be necessary to improve the existing arrangements. For example, revenue assignments may need to be adjusted to provide local authorities with a broader, more elastic funding base. Expenditure responsibilities of the local authorities may also need to be better defined to eliminate potential areas of overlap. The system of transfers may need to be adjusted to reduce the open-ended commitment falling on the central government and provide subnational governments with an incentive to plan and execute their finances responsibly. There may also be a need for an independently adjudicated equalization arrangement that would protect the poorest regions. Finally, the institutional capacity of the local governments, particularly in the financial management areas, will need to be strengthened so that they can take greater responsibility for their own affairs. The existing law may also require some amendments to correct present uncertainties. For example, Article 123 states that the governorates are entitled to “50 percent of the actual increase in revenues above the amounts estimated in the annual budget, provided the increase is not the result of new taxes or fees.” But it is unclear whether the term “annual budget” refers to the subnational budgets, or to the total general government budget. If the latter interpretation was applied, the subnational governments could share automatically in any windfall revenues arising from an unexpected increase in oil prices, which could significantly complicate national fiscal policy management.

The authorities agreed that an interim expenditure tracking system should be put in place with the assistance of FAD.7 D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and Financial Sector Reform 33. The monetary authorities restated their commitment to a floating exchange rate and to an intervention policy limited to countering disorderly market conditions. Because oil revenue inflows are channeled through the central bank, while most foreign exchange outflows go through the foreign exchange market, the central bank engages in net foreign exchange sales to cover these outflows. These sales take place through auctions in the market-US$480 million in 2001 and US$150 million through the first three months of 2002. Notwithstanding these sales, gross foreign exchange reserves have tended to increase in recent years, rising by more than implied by the authorities’ monetary program. The authorities underscored that, in choosing the timing and size of their auctions, they were not guided by any exchange rate objective, but they were rather concerned with avoiding temporary shortages of foreign exchange in the market.8 Given the degree of dollarization and openness of the economy, temporary foreign exchange shortages could easily unravel into more sustained instability and inflation. Staff supported the central bank’s stance, but cautioned that, by dampening volatility, the authorities might also be suppressing more sustained pressures on the exchange rate, which could reflect a needed adjustment. 34. The authorities and the private sector were not concerned by the loss of competitiveness implied by the 30 percent real appreciation observed since 1999. In part, this reflected doubts about the reliability of CPI data, particularly as concerns qat and agricultural prices. Still, even excluding such prices, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated by 22 percent since 1999. Real appreciation has its origins in domestic demand pressures linked to rising public spending coupled with an inadequate domestic supply response. It is difficult to gauge how much external competitiveness has been hurt9 The non- oil export base (4 percent of exports) has expanded by 8 percent a year in U.S. dollar terms since 1997, compared to a developing country average of 5% percent, but it is very narrowly concentrated on a few primary goods (mainly coffee and fish). The absence of a broader export base may be in itself an indicator of weak competitiveness, although it is probably 7Although the Interim Information System (IIS) proposed by FAD will not provide the same level of detail as the Accounting and Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) funded by the World Bank, it will go up the third-item level of functional classification for selected PRSP programs. As such, it can be a valuable tool for monitoring delivery of public services and a first step to performance budgeting. 8Consistent with this objective, foreign exchange auctions are based on pre-announced quantities and no set price. ‘Under the Integrated Framework for Technical Assistance for Trade Development in Least Developed Countries, a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study to be completed in 2002 will attempt to provide a detailed assessment of competitiveness. Preparation of DTIS is being coordinated by the World Bank.

Indeed, the private sector considered structural factors to be the more binding constraints. Staff underscored, nonetheless, that real exchange rate depreciation might be necessary to stimulate growth, and should be facilitated through flexible management of the exchange rate and productivity-enhancing structural reforms. 35. The authorities considered that broad money targets should continue to act as the nominal anchor. In line with the objective of bringing (12-month) inflation down to single digits by year-end, the authorities plan to lower broad money growth to 16 percent by year-end. On the basis of projected inflation, the monetary objective would leave room for a reduction in velocity consistent with recent trends. As noted in the 2001 FSSA, a high degree of market segmentation hinders liquidity management. In this regard, the mission welcomed the introduction and effective use of central bank certificates of deposit to manage liquidity in 200 1, but noted that the seasonal monetary expansion in December 200 1 had only in part been reversed in 2002. Because of the rise in the money multiplier, monetary growth remained high in May and would need to be monitored closely. A tightening of the reserve money growth target might be required if a large deviation of the money multiplier from its projected path is confirmed. 36. According to the authorities, at 13 percent, the benchmark deposit rate remained supportive of the monetary and inflation objective, but staff noted that further increases in dollarization or inadequate reduction in inflation would warrant an increase in interest rates. Based on projected inflation, real interest rates (4-6 percent) would appear to be adequate to sustain disinflation. Moreover, the interest differential relative to U.S. interest rates has widened relative to 2001, which should counter the trend increase in dollarization. 37. Enhanced supervision and prudential controls have strengthened the quality of the loan portfolio of banks, but problems of related and insider lending persist, and access to credit remains limited. Implementation of prudential regulations to comply with the 1998 Banking Law has led to a marked improvement in prudential indicators, although the degree of provisioning fell relative to 2000 owing to the poor performance of one bank. Credit development remains limited, and lack of confidence in the judicial system was cited by banks as the main constraint to lending. Accordingly, banking sector problems do not pose serious macroeconomic risks. The core of nonperforming loans is linked to related and insider lending, which remain pervasive in Yemen, where family ties dominate business relationships. The central bank explained that it had not imposed the required penalties against insider lending, opting instead to rely on moral suasion. The mission recognized the difficulties of changing an established credit culture, but questioned whether the chosen approach would work without a credible threat of sanctions. In the same vein, the amendment to the Banking Law intended to strengthen the central bank’s ability to enforce prudential regulations is still held up in parliament over limits on related lending.

The authorities have recently taken steps in the area of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT). In their response to the Fund’s AMWCFT questionnaire, the authorities provided staff with a draft AML Law, which will soon be submitted to parliament. The draft law would establish a committee for the combating of money laundering, to be chaired by the central bank. In the CFT area, the central bank has already issued a circular to banks and money-changing establishments operating in Yemen, instructing them to freeze the assets of individuals and organizations that have been linked to terrorism. The circular also requires that banks and money changers adopt more stringent “know-your-customer” rules. The draft law is a positive step toward the establishment of an AML framework, although the proposed legislation could be reinforced in some areas to conform with international standards, in particular in regard to the definition of money laundering and predicate offences and the reporting requirements of financial institutions. E. Other Structural Policies 39. The authorities recognized the pivotal role of the private sector in achieving a high and sustained rate of economic growth and the ensuing need for structural reforms. According to a recent enterprise survey conducted by the World Bank, private sector development still faces enormous constraints in the form of(i) corruption and inefficient provision of government services; (ii) uncompetitive practices; and (iii) uncertain access to electricity, land and judicial remedies. Small firms reported fewer difficulties, suggesting that these constraints become more binding as companies grow and enter the formal economy. These results are consistent with the observation that the majority of firms are small and operate in isolated regional markets. Larger enterprises have responded to these problems by increasing self-sufficiency through conglomeration and by building up in-house capacity in critical inputs, which explains in part the practice of related and insider lending. 40. The mission stressed the importance of strengthening governance and the rule of law and welcomed recent measures taken against corruption and to promote judicial reform. Corruption and lack of confidence in the judicial process are widely recognized by civil society, the private sector, and government officials, as a major impediment to private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - sector activity. The mission agreed that, by restoring competitive public sector wages, civil service reform would reduce incentives for corruption, but also stressed the importance of more direct actions to restore the confidence of economic agents. Recent positive steps in this direction have included a change in the management of the state accounting and auditing board, the disciplining and dismissal of judges for misconduct, and measures taken with the support of the World Bank to build judicial capacity, such as training of judges. 41. The mission underscored the importance of market liberalization and privatization for the growth strategy. The mobile telecommunications market was liberalized in 2001, but market entry remains an issue in other sectors, most notably the trucking sector, which is dominated by a cartel. Following a period of stasis, privatization has slowly resumed. The privatization of the National Bank of Yemen, which was to be a test case for broader privatization, has been put on hold over valuation issues-its net worth appeared to have been overstated by the external investment consultant. More recently, the government has been revising the shortlist of small- and medium-sized enterprises to be offered for privatization, and the authorities indicated that they were compiling shortlists of bidders for the sale of four smaller enterprises.” The authorities have also begun liquidating companies that have been idle for an extended period. No progress has been reported on the larger enterprises slated for privatization, such as the Aden refinery and cement companies. 42. Yemen’s trade regime retains its status as one of the most liberal in the region, with a trade restrictiveness index of 2 on the IMF’s scale of 1 to 10. There were no changes in the tariff schedule in 2001 and a few seasonal restrictions on fruits and vegetables remain. A reform of the customs law is under preparation. The authorities have applied for WTO membership and expect negotiations to begin later in 2002. F. External Financing and Reserve Management 43. The authorities will seek concessional budgetary and balance of payments assistance in support of the PRSP; debt relief already provided and under negotiation should help keep the external debt burden at a sustainable level over the medium term. Transition to a sustainable non-oil economy will require a drawdown of foreign reserves and new concessional external financing. The medium-term balance of payments projections thus include a financing gap of US$379 million for 2002 (of which US$302 million is debt relief expected from non-Paris Club creditors) and US$l40 million in each of the years 2003 through 2005. In order to fill this financing gap, the authorities seek increased concessional assistance and have requested the World Bank to organize a Consultative Group meeting in October 2002. To consolidate recent gains in external debt sustainability, the authorities will continue to limit recourse to nonconcessional borrowing. Nonconcessional borrowing was nil “Aden silos, Hodeida silos, Shukra tuna canning factory, and management of Nashtun port.

Rescheduling of overdue obligations to Kuwait, U.A.E., China, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Iraq are under negotiation. 44. External debt and foreign reserve management are being upgraded. The UNCTAD external debt management software is operational at the central bank, and technical assistance is being provided to build expertise in its use and to extend its access to the ministry of finance and the ministry of planning and development. Technical assistance is also being provided to strengthen the management of foreign reserves, which are held in relatively low-yielding short-term deposits. The objective is to build the capacity of the central bank to delegate management of part of the reserves to reputable external managers and to monitor performance against established prudent benchmarks. G. Staff-Monitored Program and Successor PRGF 45. A SMP was viewed as useful to establish a track record of sound performance towards implementation of the PRSP and a successor PRGF arrangement in 2003. The SMP will track performance against the fiscal and monetary objectives discussed above, as well as the authorities’ commitments in the areas of civil service reform, expenditure management, and tax administration. In the absence of adequate progress on tax reform, expenditure reform, and fiscal adjustment, the objectives of the SMP are to preserve macroeconomic stability over the short term and make progress in some critical structural areas. A successor PRGF arrangement would need to be based on considerably more ambitious policies aimed at ensuring medium-term fiscal and external sustainability and freeing resources for poverty-related spending. Accordingly, staff indicated that the tax reform to be mapped out with technical assistance from FAD later this year would form a key foundation for a successor PRGF arrangement, as would the adoption of an appropriate budget for 2003 and a clear commitment on expenditure reform and the phasing-out of fuel subsidies. “Nonetheless, the program makes an allowance for US$40 million in nonconcessional borrowing in 2002 to accommodate possible needs in the energy sector. 12The bilateral agreements have not yet been signed. The authorities have requested extensions beyond the December 3 1, 2001 deadline, in order to conclude negotiations.

Improvements are being made in the quality and frequency of statistical information, but remaining data gaps continue to hinder economic policy management. Fiscal statistics and, with the technical assistance from the Fund, price and national accounts statistics are being strengthened. Serious limitations remain in the areas of trade and balance of payments statistics, and fiscal decentralization has caused delays in the reporting of fiscal data. A balance of payments statistics mission from the IMF is planned for late 2002. Technical assistance has helped improve coordination among agencies. The authorities have prepared a broad-based program for statistical development, and Yemen has participated in the General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS) since April 2001, when its metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. 47. Considerable technical assistance in support of the reform effort is being provided under the Technical Cooperation Action Plan (TCAP) approved in 2000 and extended through 2004. The TCAP coordinates technical assistance provided and financed by the Fund, the United Kingdom’s Department of Foreign International Development (DFID), and the UNDP. The program includes technical assistance and backstopping of resident and peripatetic advisors by the Fund, as well as training and computerization provided directly by DFID, through a consulting company. The TCAP has been instrumental in building capacity in the areas of tax and customs administration (ASYCUDA), external debt management, reserve management, banking supervision, national accounts and price statistics, and actuarial analysis for pension reform. In a review of TCAP performance conducted in March 2002, the authorities stressed the importance of training to complement Fund technical assistance. The TCAP partners urged the authorities to take on a more active role in the coordination of technical assistance. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 48. The authorities have successfully restored and maintained macroeconomic stability and are now rightly turning their attention to the growth and poverty challenges highlighted in the PRSP. An acceleration of structural reforms on a broad front is needed to meet these challenges, particularly in view of the projected decline of oil revenues from the current peak. 49. Fiscal policy in 2002 remains appropriately restrained to preserve macroeconomic stability, but the expenditure composition has regrettably deteriorated with the accommodation of higher wage and defense spending and the squeeze of the development budget. Although the authorities’ fiscal program for 2002 does not reduce the non-oil deficit, the overall fiscal and balance of payments positions remain satisfactory in the short run, even in the event of lower oil prices. From a medium-term perspective, a reduction in the non-oil deficit in 2002 would have been desirable so as to make progress in the medium-term adjustment strategy. The prospective squeeze on the development and maintenance budgets in 2002 is viewed with concern by the staff who would have preferred Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - higher spending in these areas financed by increased revenue effort and lower current and nonproductive spending. 50. The gradual depletion of oil reserves, widespread poverty, and limited growth of private sector activity present formidable challenges over the medium term. Significant fiscal adjustment will be needed to maintain internal and external stability as oil revenues decline. While medium-term macroeconomic prospects may be significantly improved by new oil discoveries, it would be imprudent, in the staffs view, to base economic policies on as yet undiscovered oil resources. In order to reach the growth and poverty reduction objectives of the PRSP, the economy’s supply response must be enhanced through accelerated structural reforms, strengthened governance, and reoriented government spending priorities. The authorities’ recognition of a broad, deep-seated governance problem is encouraging. 51. Fundamental revenue and expenditure measures are required to set the non-oil deficit on a clear adjustment path towards long-term sustainability and to reallocate budgetary resources to pursue the poverty reduction and growth objectives of the PRSP. On the revenue side, a solid tax base must be developed. In its present form, the GST is too narrow and complex to raise additional tax revenues. Staff stands ready to work with the authorities to map out and implement a more effective and broader reform of the tax system, including an amended GST. On the expenditure side, a consensus exists within the government that fuel subsidies need to be phased out. The authorities are encouraged to take another early step in this direction before electoral considerations come into play. An improvement in the expenditure structure is needed more generally. The significant reduction in nonproductive spending targeted in the PRSP medium-term expenditure framework is most welcome. 52. Institutional reforms-civil service reform, decentralization, and budget management reform-are vital to achieve fiscal sustainability and improve government efficiency. Positive steps have been taken in laying the groundwork for civil service reform and in setting up decentralized fiscal authorities. The political priority attached to both of these reforms is encouraging. Continued strong leadership will be needed to guide these reforms so that they will produce a leaner and more efficient government, rather than a more expanded one. Thus, desired salary reform has to go hand-in-hand with a streamlining of the civil service, and local governments should eventually be given a revenue base of their own to replace the present system of open-ended transfers. The authorities are urged to modernize budget preparation, execution, and monitoring systems, in order to improve transparency, strengthen the medium-term orientation of policies and link budget allocations more closely to government priorities. Without a clear medium-term orientation, budgetary adjustment will inevitably fall on development spending, as it has in 2002, thus undermining the authorities’ growth objective. 53. The authorities’ choice of a flexible exchange rate regime will facilitate macroeconomic adjustment. Some foreign exchange intervention is implicit in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - authorities’ monetary program. By satisfying shortages of foreign exchange, foreign exchange auctions avoid unnecessary exchange rate volatility, which is potentially disruptive in an open and heavily dollarized economy such as Yemen’s However, sustained market pressures should not be resisted, since they might reflect a needed adjustment in the exchange rate. Indeed, the trend appreciation in the real effective exchange rate should be viewed with concern. 54. Following the burst of liquidity growth at the end of 2001, the monetary authority’s commitment to reasserting control over monetary growth is welcome so as to ensure that the inflation flare-up of 2001 is not validated. The price increases of summer 2001 do not appear to have created lasting inflationary pressures. Exchange rate stability has undoubtedly contributed to the economy’s nominal stability, but credit also goes to the central bank’s generally effective liquidity management, enhanced by the introduction of central bank certificates of deposits in early 200 1. With a view to anchoring inflationary expectations at a low level and preventing further dollarization, the authorities should promptly raise interest rates in response to inflationary pressures or renewed dollarization. 55. Development of a dynamic non-oil economy rests not only on maintaining macroeconomic stability, but will also require improvements in governance and deeper structural reforms. Recent steps taken towards judicial and civil service reform, which are crucial to strengthening private sector confidence, are encouraging. With a view to creating a more competitive economic environment, the authorities are urged to accelerate the pace of privatization and to eliminate remaining market access restrictions, notably in the trucking sector. 56. A lack luster growth response and a slow pace of fiscal reforms constitute the main risks to medium-term sustainability. If real growth does not pick up as projected, fiscal adjustment will need to be strengthened, but such adjustment will also be harder to sustain. Early progress on fiscal structural reforms (civil service, the tax system, and pensions) that will increase public savings, is therefore crucial to shield fiscal sustainability against this risk, particularly given the long lead time required to put these reforms in place. In the absence of adequate progress on these structural fronts, there is a serious risk that fiscal adjustment will become disorderly, thus damaging to growth and poverty reduction efforts, and ultimately unsuccessful. 57. Adherence to a medium-term policy orientation is equally important in the event of new oil discoveries or higher oil prices. To ensure that medium-term adjustment targets are achieved, any additional resources should be used to raise public saving and productive spending and should not be seen as an opportunity to delay reforms. Rather, the authorities should use these additional resources to finance and facilitate a more ambitious reform agenda. 58. In all, the authorities’ policies for 2002 will help consolidate past gains and set the stage for more fundamental reforms in 2003. Staff monitoring of the authorities’ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- program can help the authorities build a positive track record towards a successor PRGF. An improved expenditure structure, continued progress in civil service reform, the development and implementation of a tax reform strategy, and a resumption of diesel price adjustments should all be core policy objectives in 2003. 59.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) was subject to the transitional procedures with respect to the EFF arrangement which expired on October 28,200l. The transitional procedures require a review of only the CBY’s external audit mechanism. This assessment determines whether the CBY publishes annual financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with internationally accepted standards. The external audit assessment, which was completed on May 23, 2001, concluded that CBY’s external audit mechanism in place at the time of the assessment was not fully adequate in certain respects. Accordingly, recommendations were made to the authorities, as reported in EBS/O1/172. A full safeguard assessment of the CBY will be initiated prior to a new PRGF arrangement envisaged for 2003. VIII. Exchange Arrangements: The currency of Yemen is the Yemeni Rial. Yemen maintains an independently floating exchange rate system. Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. IX. Article IV Consultation: The latest Article IV consultation was concluded on February 28,200l. Yemen is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. X.

Due to recognized shortcomings in most data, a broad effort is in place to improve data compilation with technical assistance from the Fund and other donors. The Republic of Yemen has participated in the General Data Dissemination System since April 26, 2001. Nonetheless, improvements are not likely to be seen for at least another year or more. The most consistently reliable and generally timely data are those on the monetary sector produced by the central bank, which provide the foundation for the estimation of the other macroeconomic data. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) disseminates data on total official reserve assets with a lag of one week and is in the process of compiling the Reserve Template with data on reserve and foreign currency liquidity. The authorities should aim to disseminate the Reserve Template with a monthly periodicity with no more than a one-month lag. To strengthen monetary statistics further, the multisector mission in August 2000 recommended that (1) repurchase agreements should be treated as collateralized loans; (2) all nonstandard loans should be reclassified in claims on the relevant sector; (3) counterparty for several monetary accounts need to be more accurately identified; and (4) a number of monetary accounts should be disaggregated so as to present position on a single financial instrument. 2. National accounts data, produced on an annual basis both by economic activity and expenditure category, remain unreliable because of poor data quality, limited coverage, and inadequate statistical methodology. However, with the help from STA, the authorities have constructed a more comprehensive consumer price index. Yet, some deficiencies remain as data collection methods are still being optimized. A peripatetic advisor from STA is currently working with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to improve the compilation of the national accounts and develop data coordination among the CSO, the central bank, and the ministry of finance. 3. In the fiscal accounts, data reliability is uncertain, and timeliness is weak, particularly for detailed revenue and expenditure items. There are also discrepancies between reported budget data and the below-the-line financing data obtained from the monetary statistics. Since the beginning of 2000, fiscal data has been prepared according to GFS economic classification, and monthly reports are available, albeit irregularly, on the subchapter level. Further progress, particularly in providing expenditure data based on GFS functional classification on a chapter and subchapter level should be achieved with the installation of the interim information system based on recommendation of FAD technical assistance in public expenditure management. The authorities have not reported data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) in 2000 and 2001. The latest data are forward estimates for 1999 published in the 1999 GFSY. Yemen does not provide GFS data for publication in IFS. 4. The compiling institution for balance of payments statistics is the CBY, which carries out the gathering of data from various sources, the implementation of the proper methodology, the dissemination of balance of payments data, and more recently the international investment position statement in the framework of the balance of payments Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX I ANNEX II manual, fifth edition. As there is yet no legislation conferring to the CBY the authority to compile official balance of payments statistics, the tasks are performed on a part-time and ad hoc basis, mostly relying on survey-based questionnaires whose response rate appears quite low. The quality of the questionnaires themselves may also be weak due to the limited expertise and experience in developing such material. The poor quality of the balance of payments statistics also appears to be related to inadequacies in staffing and expertise, documented sources and methods, and financial and physical resources dedicated to balance of payments compilation. The CBY publishes quarterly external debt statistics within one quarter of the reference period for the banking sector, general government, and monetary authority as prescribed by the SDDS specifications for external debt. 5. A long-term resident advisor for balance of payments statistics was assigned in Sana’a from February 1998 till February 2000 as part of an IMFAJNDP technical assistance program. In his report, the resident advisor highlighted the inherent weaknesses and shortcomings in the Yemeni balance of payments compilation system and suggested an action plan for the improvement of the data. The authorities have already started implementing the recommendations; as a result, the balance of payments division was able to utilize data received from various sources for compiling balance of payments and international investment position statements for the years 1997 through 1999. The preparation of quarterly statements is also being currently undertaken by the CBY. The identilied problems are the weak coverage of the oil industry transactions and the deficient reporting of other private capital flows. While official capital flows are deemed correctly reported, the transactions of foreign exchange accounts of resident commercial banks and workers’ remittances are still inadequately covered. There is also the difficulty of obtaining timely and disaggregated trade data, especially on a quarterly or monthly basis. Technical assistance in balance of payments will resume in 2002. A follow-up mission in balance of payments is scheduled to visit Sana’a during the period September 30-October 11,2002.

As of April 30,2002, the International Development Association (IDA) had approved 124 projects to Yemen for a total of US$1,834 million (net of cancellations) of which about US$l,427 million have been disbursed. Of the 124 projects, 105 have been closed, leaving the current portfolio with 19 projects. Cumulative IDA commitments for ongoing operations stand at US$637.9 million (net of cancellations), of which US$394 million remain undisbursed. Sectoral composition of the current portfolio is as follows: 43.1 percent by value is for Human Resources/Social Sector operations (education, health/nutrition, and social protection); 15.5 percent for Energy/Water (electricity/power, and water supply); 8.5 percent for Agriculture; 12.9 percent for Transportation; 5.1 percent for Public Sector Management; and 14.9 for Urban Development. 2. Overall, portfolio performance has been satisfactory in terms of implementation and in meeting project development objectives. It has deteriorated somewhat over this period, however, reflecting recurrent problems with procurement, accounting, and special account replenishment, as well as political problems in adhering to important project covenant in two projects. The disbursement ratio fell from 28 percent in FYOO to 23 percent in FYOl, and to about 15 percent annualized in FY02, reflecting a temporary slowdown in disbursements of best-performing credits. A country portfolio performance review (CPPR) in May 2002 addressed issues affecting the implementation of projects in the portfolio. 3. IDA’s commitments to Yemen in FY02 are expected to reach a record level of $207.7 million, in four credits. 4. As of March 3 1,2002, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) had two active investments totaling US$14.85 million. The two investments include one agriculture operation (grain processing-ACSM) and one ceramic/porcelain (Radfan) project; another small investment in bottled water will be committed soon. IFC could support the privatization of state-owned enterprises in a number of key sectors such as cement, banking, telecommunications, or refineries. IFC may also consider an investment in a leasing operation and has provided draft leasing legislation to the government to facilitate this. 5. The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), presented to IDA’s Board in May 1999 and covering the period FYOO-FY02, is addressing four major objectives: (a) improved public sector management (including budgeting, expenditure, revenue, and civil service reforms); (b) active and diversified productive private investment (including privatization, Aden Free Port development, and legal and judicial development); (c) water sustainability (including municipal and irrigation improvements, and basin management); and (d) an early stream of social benefits directly addressing poverty (including improvements in basic education, health, rural access, and community development).

The government is currently preparing its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and in parallel the Bank is preparing a new CAS for FY03-FY05. Reflecting the IDA-l 3 emphasis on improved governance performance, the base case lending allocation for Yemen during this period, $360 million, is 25 percent below the comparable figure in the last CAS. Accordingly, the new CAS places highest emphasis on improving governance. 6. IDA is also engaged in an active program of analytical and advisory assistance. This included strategy reports on higher education, urban management, and budget and expenditure reviews in FYO 1. Nonlending support in FY02 includes work on decentralization, rural/local development strategy, financial sector development, poverty analysis, and analysis of sources and prospects for growth. 7. During the next CAS period, there will be a major shift towards analytical and advisory assistance. IDA will fund work on, among other things, public expenditure management, public services delivery, the investment climate, trade reform, land registration, monitoring and evaluation capacity building, the financial sector, water sector reform, fisheries management, gender mainstreaming, secondary education, vocational training, and rural energy.

Building on the achievements realized under the EFF/PRGF program that was completed in October 2001, our plans for 2002 are to consolidate the gains made in terms of macroeconomic stability and to sustain the reform effort in key areas. On the fiscal front, our 2002 program aims at containing public expenditure growth so as to preserve fiscal sustainability over the medium term when oil revenues are expected to decline. On the monetary front, we have set a monetary growth target that is consistent with the achievement of single digit inflation by year-end. As concerns structural issues, we plan to maintain the momentum of reform, with particular emphasis on civil service reform and tax reform. In order to prepare for implementation of the PRSP, we are also committed to establishing a system to better plan and track poverty-related spending starting in 2003. Improved planning and monitoring systems will also be helpful in the transfer of budgetary responsibilities to the local authorities. 2. We believe that the policies targeted for 2002 will prepare the ground for implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy now under preparation. As such, our 2002 program should be seen a precursor to a successor PRGF arrangement which, we hope, would come into effect in 2003. In order to build a track record of sound performance towards a successor PRGF arrangement, we wish to request that the staff of the IMF monitor performance under our 2002 program, which is described in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). 3. The Government and Central Bank of Yemen believe that the policies outlined in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the program objectives. The main risk to the program objectives arises from the expenditure pressures that have built up as a result of higher oil prices, particularly for the financing of development projects. We stand ready, nonetheless, to take additional measures, as necessary, to meet the program objectives, and we will discuss with IMF staff any changes in the program objectives that may occur in the course of the year.

Ahmed Abdul Rahman Al-Samawi Governor Central Bank of Yemen Annexes (5) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - ATTACHMENT ANNEX I Republic of Yemen Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies July 16,2002 1. The main budgetary and financial objectives for 2002 are to consolidate the gains made in terms of macroeconomic stability, protect these gains against the risks of volatile oil prices, and maintain policies that are fiscally and externally sustainable over the medium term. At the same time, the government intends to pursue actively its structural reform program with the objective of mobilizing additional non-oil revenues over the medium term, rationalizing and improving the quality of spending, as well as strengthening the economic and financial management of the country. The pursuit of these objectives is consistent with the objectives of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. 2. The government believes civil service reform to be a core element of the reform process. Without it, little progress can be expected in the quality of public government services and private sector development. Thus, a number of specific measures in the civil service area are targeted for 2002. The 2002 program will also target actions in the areas of tax and customs reform, and expenditure management. Public finances 3. Fiscal policy is guided by the objective of maintaining expenditure restraint in 2002, so as to place public finances on a sustainable medium-term path consistent with the projected decline in oil revenues starting in 2003. Based on current proven reserves and making some allowance for the coming on line of new oil fields starting in 2004, government oil revenues are expected to decline from US$2.4 billion in 2001 to US$1.6 billion by 2005. Unless steps are taken to mobilize alternative sources of revenues and rationalize spending, the resulting deficits will threaten macroeconomic stability. In the absence of such measures it will also be difficult for the government to find the resources to finance its poverty reduction strategy. 4. In line with the above objectives, the 2002 fiscal program targets the containment of overall expenditures at YRls 574 billion, or 35.9 percent of GDP. This target reflects the 2002 budget approved by parliament in February as well as some expenditure carryover from last year (on account of border demarcation and electricity repairs), but also makes allowances for additional spending that is expected in the following areas: defense, due to the cost of the anti-terrorism campaign; education, due to court-ordered increases in the salaries of teachers; transfers to the Public Electricity Company to support its restructuring; diesel fuel subsidies, owing to the higher price of oil relative to the budget assumption; and development spending, due to the need to cover the cost of ongoing projects which, following a clarification of the local authorities law, will fall on the central government. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I Government has also agreed to proceed with the implementation of the road tax on fuel and will do so at the earliest opportunity. 5. On the revenue side, we are targeting a stabilization of non-oil revenues in relation to GDP. To the extent that the recent rise in oil prices will be sustained, oil revenues should exceed budgeted amounts by a significant margin. On the basis of an average oil price assumption of just under US$22 per barrel for Yemeni crude in 2002, the overall budget would register a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2002. Civil service and pension reform 6. The real value of government wages and salaries in Yemen remains grossly inadequate, particularly at the higher grades of the civil service, and the quality of the civil service has suffered as a result. At the same time, at over 8 percent of GDP in 2002, the government wage bill continues to weigh heavily on the budget. Overemployment and inadequate control over the civil service payroll have over time contributed to these problems. The government is committed to addressing these shortcomings through a comprehensive civil service reform program which aims to create a leaner, better paid and more effective civil service. 7. Progress has already been made in this direction with the completion of a census of the civil service, the establishment of a computerized data base of civil servants, the launching of restructuring plans in 6 pilot ministries and agencies, and the establishment of the Civil Service Fund. In the course of 2002, the Government has set for itself a number of additional targets, including: a Completing the transfer of at least 11,000 civil servants into the Civil Service Fund by end-2002, l Retiring all remaining (15,478) overage civil servants by end-2002, l Issuing biometric cards to at least 200,000 civil servants by end-2002, with the objective of identifying double dippers and ghost workers and removing them from the payroll by end-2002, l Adding the customs administration to the list of pilot agencies for civil service reform, and 0 Containing gross recruitment by the ministry of civil service at 9,700 in 2002, as agreed in the budget. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I Expenditure management 8. Effective budgeting and expenditure monitoring systems are essential to improving the quality of public spending and to the transfer of budgetary responsibilities to the local authorities. Advances have been made in the area of budget preparation and execution under the SEFM project. However, with the preparation of a poverty reduction strategy, a strengthening of these practices is needed to effectively translate government priorities into budgetary objectives and to monitor outputs. 9. To that end, the following actions will be targeted in 2002: a Establishment of an explicit linkage between the civil service data base and the budgeted wage bill for the 2003 budget and a Establishment of a system to plan and track poverty-related spending, starting with the 2003 budget. Tax and customs reform 10. In order to modernize the tax system and improve revenue collection over the medium term, a number of important initiatives will be undertaken in 2002. The General Sales Tax (GST) that was signed into law in January 2002 will become operational by September 2002. Successful implementation of the GST requires effective administration. With this goal in mind, we will complete, by end-June 2002, a reorganization of the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) along the lines of a function-based organization. In accordance with the presidential decree establishing the LTU, we will also create a taxpayer service division within the LTU to coincide with the beginning of the implementation of the GST in September 2002. 11. Meanwhile, with the assistance of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department, we will conduct a broad review of the indirect tax system with a view to developing a more integrated approach to tax reform that takes more explicitly into consideration the tax losses caused by widespread smuggling. The results of this review will help map out a reform program for indirect taxation, which will include the strengthening of the GST law. 12. With imports exceeding 30 percent of GDP, an efficient customs administration is central to successful revenue collection. Considerable progress has been made in modernizing the customs administration, as witnessed by the implementation of the first phase of the ASYCUDA project at the Sana’a airport. In 2002, we plan to fully introduce the ASYCUDA system in Hodeida and Haradh, as well as to begin its introduction in Aden. We will also begin to develop a valuation data base for a sample of 20 goods. Monetary and exchange rate policy 13. We believe that broad money targeting continues to be the most appropriate nominal anchor for Yemen. Consistently with our objective of reducing inflation to single digits by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I end-2002, we have targeted broad money growth of 16 percent for this year. This target corresponds to a reserve money growth target of 13.7 percent, taking into account the trend increase in the money multiplier. Given the additional increase in government deposits at the central bank, the reserve money target is to be backed by an increase in central bank net international reserves of US$394 million in 2002. 14. We will continue to manage the exchange rate flexibly. We will allow the exchange rate to float freely, but will intervene in the foreign exchange market when temporary pressures develop. Program monitoring 15. The program to be monitored by the staff of the IMF is based on quarterly structural and quantitative targets. The structural targets are listed in Annex II and the quantitative targets in Annexes III and IV. The targets and the conditions under which they will be adjusted in the course of the program are defined and explained in Annex V.

This memorandum provides the definitions of the quantitative targets for the Staff Monitored Program. It also sets out the data-reporting requirements for monitoring the program. I. QUANTITATIVE TARGETS (ANNEXES II AND III OF THE MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES (MEFP)) A. Reserve Money 2. Reserve money is defined as the sum of the currency in circulation (outside commercial banks), commercial banks’ domestic cash in vaults, and commercial banks’ required and excess deposits with the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY). It excludes deposits held in the CBY by the government, pension funds, and public enterprises, as well as counterpart funds. It includes commercial banks’ required and excess reserves on foreign currency deposits valued at the program exchange rate. B. Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank of Yemen and Total Domestic Financing of the Budget 3. Net domestic assets of the CBY are defined as reserve money minus net international reserves, as defined below. Total domestic financing of the budget is defined as the sum of net claims of the CBY on the central government and net holdings of government paper by commercial banks and nonbanks. Net claims of the CBY are defined as central bank advances and credits to the central government plus government paper held by the central bank minus the central government’s deposits at the central bank. They exclude the counterpart of claims of the Yemen Bank of Reconstruction and Development (YBRD) on the CBY. 4. The ceilings on the net domestic assets of the CBY and the total domestic financing of the budget will be adjusted upwards (downwards) by the full cumulative amount of any shortfall (excess) in net external financing of the budget. 5. The ceilings on the net domestic assets of the CBY and total domestic financing of the budget will be adjusted upwards (downwards) by the full amount of any shortfall (excess) in cumulative government crude oil export receipts vis-a-vis the programmed level. The program exchange rate will apply to the calculations. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX V Reporting requirement. The monthly balance sheets of the CBY and the outstanding stock of government paper will be transmitted to the Middle Eastern Department of the IMF on a monthly basis with a lag of one month. C. Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of Yemen 6. Net international reserves of the CBY are defined for this purpose, consistent with the definition of the SDDS template, as external assets readily available to, and controlled by, the CBY, net of external liabilities of the CBY. Pledged and otherwise encumbered assets, including but not limited to reserve assets used as collateral (or guarantees for third party external liabilities) are to be excluded. The latter includes commercial banks’ foreign currency deposits with the CBY that are required reserves as well as those deposits in excess of required reserves. For program-monitoring purposes, net international reserves of the CBY as of the test dates are measured as the change in millions of U.S. dollars from the beginning of the calendar year. 7. The floors of the net international reserves of the CBY will be adjusted downwards (upwards) by the full cumulative amount of any shortfall (excess) in net external financing of the budget. 8. The floors of the net international reserves of the CBY will be adjusted downwards (upwards) by the full amount of any shortfall (excess) in cumulative government crude oil export receipts vis-a-vis the programmed level. The program exchange rate will apply to the calculations. Reporting requirement. Data on net international reserves, encumbered reserves, and foreign liabilities of the CBY will be transmitted on a weekly basis within five working days of the end of each week (Thursdays). D. External Financing of the Budget 9. The data on external financing of the budget for the test periods (cumulative end of quarter) are applied as adjusters to the ceilings on net domestic asset and total domestic financing of the budget and to the floor on net international reserves. External financing of the budget consists of cash disbursements of loans, less cash amortization payments, and cash interest payments. Due to the unreliability in the reporting of grants, foreign grants are excluded from the definition of external financing. External financing transactions will be valued at the program exchange rate. Reporting requirement. Details of all new external borrowing, including government guarantees indicating terms of loans and creditors, disbursements from existing loans, amortization and interest payments, rescheduled interest and amortization, and interest and amortization arrears (if any), will be provided on a monthly basis with a lag of one month.

The programmed quarterly crude oil export revenue of government shown in Annex III of the MEFP for the test period (cumulative change at the end of the quarter) are compared to the actual government oil revenue reported by the CBY in order to determine the excess or shortfall in cumulative government crude oil receipts. The data on government crude oil revenue will be converted to rials at the program exchange rate. Data requirement. Monthly data on crude oil export revenue (valued in U.S. dollars) received by the government will be transmitted on a monthly basis with a lag of one month. F. Net Disbursement of Short-Term Debt 11. This category includes debt with an initial maturity of one year or less, excluding normal import-related credits and leases. Debt is defined as set forth in point number 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with respect to foreign debt. Reporting requirement. Data on all new borrowing and guarantees (including terms and creditors) by the central government, local governments, and CBY will be transmitted, with detailed description, on a monthly basis with a lag of one month. G. Nonconcessional External Public Sector or Publicly-Guaranteed Debt 12. A ceiling is set on debt with an initial maturity of over one year. The ceiling excludes concessional loans with a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more calculated using currency-specific discount rates based on commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) plus a margin depending on the maturity of the loan. The ceiling also excludes restructuring and refinancing loans undertaken in multilateral restructuring of official bilateral debt; and use of AMF and IMF resources. It includes commitments contracted or guaranteed for which the terms have not been specified. H. External Payment Arrears 13. The nonaccumulation of new external payment arrears will be applied on a continuous basis. This category includes financial leases and other instruments giving rise to external liabilities, contingent or otherwise. In determining the level of concessionality of these obligations, the definition of concessional borrowing will apply.
