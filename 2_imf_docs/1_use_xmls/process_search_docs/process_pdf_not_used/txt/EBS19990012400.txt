INTR~DU~I~N 1. The government and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation have requested a 17 month stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 3,300 million, or 55.5 percent of quota. This request is in support of a program for the remainder of 1999 and 2000. The program is described in the Statement on Economic Policies (Attachment to Annex I). Discussions on this program were conducted in conjunction with the discussions on the 1999 Article IV consultation.’ 2. When completing the last Article IV consultation on May 16, 1997, most Executive Directors noted the important strides made in fighting inflation and maintaining exchange rate stability. However, they expressed concern about the deterioration in the fiscal situation and the disappointing implementation of structural reform. The general consensus was that tighter fiscal policy and accelerated reforms were needed to preserve the stabilization gains and pave the way for sustained economic growth. 3. The last formal meeting of the Executive Board to discuss Russia took place on July 20, 1998, when the Board augmented Russia’s extended arrangement and approved a purchase under the CCFF. The program underlying the arrangement veered seriously off track soon after that meeting. An intense dialog between the authorities and the staff during the remainder of 1998 and the beginning of 1999 did not produce agreement on policies needed to resurrect the program, and the authorities notified the Fund of the cancellation of the extended arrangement on March 26, 1999. Preliminary understandings on a new program for the remainder of 1999 and 2000 were reached with the government of Prime Minister Primakov in April 1999, shortly before its replacement by that of Prime Minister Stepashin. Soon after assuming ofice, this new government confirmed its commitment to the program discussed with the previous government. 4. The staffs of the World Bank and the Fund have continued their close collaboration on Russia. The World Bank is expected to release a second tranche under its Third Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL3) by late September, as well as additional tranches under its social protection and its coal sector adjustment loans. Relations between Russia and the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. ‘Staff members on one or more missions during the period January-June 1999 included Messrs. Marquez-Ruarte and Belanger (head of mission in January and April-June, respectively), Thomsen, Schiff, Barnard, Panth, Roaf, Sun (all EU2), Chalk, McDonald (FAD), and Mazarei (PDR). Messrs. Gilman, Kammer, and Anderson of the Fund Moscow Office also participated in the discussions. Mr. Mozhin, Executive Director for Russia, and his alternate, Mr. Lushin, and assistant, Mr. Paiei, attended some of the meetings. There were also several meetings involving the Managing Director and the First Deputy Managing Director during this period.

Russia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, but maintains restrictions that are subject to Fund approval as described below. Il. BACKGROUND 6. Having produced notable stabilization gains since 1995, the exchange rate based stabilization strategy was abandoned in August 1998. While the timing of this undoubtedly owed much to the souring of the external environment as a result of Asia’s economic crisis, the root case was the fact that failure to tackle underlying fiscal problems had made the stabilization achieved under the fixed exchange rate policy inherently unstable (Figure I).* Initially, from mid-1997 to April 1998, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) was relatively successtirl at defending the fixed exchange rate policy through a significant tightening of credit. However, the situation became increasingly untenable when significant political turmoil in Russia-starting with the President’s dismissal of the government of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and prolonged by a stalemate over the formation of a new cabinet-cast increasing doubt on the political resolve to come to grips with Russia’s fiscal problems. From mid-July, when the Duma refused to pass key fiscal measures, the situation deteriorated rapidly, leading to a unilateral restructuring of ruble-denominated treasury bills and bonds on August 17, 1998 and the floating of the ruble in early September. A large devaluation in real effective terms, loss of access to international capital markets, and a virtual collapse of the banking system ensued. Moreover, large external arrears began to accumulate. Since then, limited progress has been made in bank restructuring and other structural reforms have been mostly at a standstill. Industrial output has, however, recovered to a level above that of one year ago and a tenuous financial stability has been restored. A. Macroeconomic Developments Through August 1998 7. The fixed exchange rate policy came under increasing pressure when the outbreak of the economic crisis in Asia caused a sharp decline in the already weakening terms of trade. (The policy considerations underlying the exchange rate policy are summarized in Box 1.) The cumulative drop in the terms of trade amounted to almost 30 percent from end- 1996 to mid-1998, or about $25 billion in annual costs to the balance of payments (Figure 2). The current account balance swung from a surplus of $4.7 billion in the year through mid-1997 to a deficit of $11.6 billion in the year through mid-1998, implying a turnaround of 4 percent of GDP. ‘The policy of allowing the ruble to depreciate gradually within a preannounced corridor, which was maintained from 1995 to August 1998, had all the attributes of a fixed exchange rate policy in so far as the constraint on monetary policy was concerned.

Policy Considerations Underlying the Fixed Exchange Rate Policy Russia maintained an effectively fired exchange rate policy from 1995 to August 1998. Although the ruble was allowed to depreciate gradually within a preannounced corridor, this policy had all the attributes of a fixed exchange rate policy in so far as the constraint on monetmy policy was concerned. Russia succeeded in stabilizing inflation under the fixed exchange rate policy. The exchange rate was used to bear down on inflation by maintaining the rate of ruble depreciation well below the rate of inflation. Inflation fell 6om a monthly average of 7.3 percent in 1995 to 0.5 percent in the l2-month period tbrougb July 1998. The decline in inflation led to a rapid remonetization of the economy, reflected in a substantial decline in velocity. While the viability of the fued exchange rate policy was uncertain because of the uusustainably high fiscal deficits, it was a crucial feature of developments under this policy that the rapid remonetization meant that inflationary pressures emanating from the fiscal sector were steadily declining: the general govermncnt deficit fell from the equivalent of more than 100 percent of beginning period ruble broad money in 1995, to 86 percent in 1996,69 percent in 1997, and 66 percent at an annualized rate in the first half of 1998. While this decline reflected primarily tbc reduction in velocity, and not a reduction in the deficit, the tenuous stabilization achieved under the fixed exchange rate policy was becoming gradually more robust in so far as the authorities’ undertakings to tackle the deficit remained credible. It was when political humoil in the Spring of 1998 undermined this confidence that the fixed exchange rate policy unraveled rapidly. The fixed exchange rate policy was associated with considerable ruble appreciation in real terms. By mid-1998, the real effective appreciation had amounted to 33 percent relative to the average level for 1995. Exports began to stagnate, with a tendency to decline by early 1998, and imports were increasing steadily. However, it was expected that the authorities’ commitment to advance structural reforms would eventually give sufticient impetus to exports and growth to overcome the impact of the real appreciation. This view had been encouraged by the fact that Russia saw a return to positive growth rates in 1997 for the first tie since the beginning of the transition process. The strategy of focusing on bringing down inflation in the context of the fixed exchange rate policy, while putting in place the fiscal and structural policies needed to underpin this strategy, was facilitated by the positive sentiments prevailing in international capital markets towards emerging market economics up to the onset of the economic crisis ir) Asia. The progressive liberalization of the GKO market from early 1996 had allowed Russia to maximize its benefits from the positive market sentiments. However, Russia was only able to place mostly short-term papers in the market, making the balance of payments highly vulnerable to a deterioration of market sentiments.

The impact on the balance of payments of reduced capital market access was equally severe as investors retreated from emerging markets in the wake of the economic crisis in Asia (Figure 3). Having raised $17 biion through Eurobond placements and net sales of GKOs and OFZs to nonresidents in the year through mid-1997, Russia saw such intlows fall to $9.4 billion in the year through mid-1998 Moreover, interest rates on these instruments increased. 9. The magnitude of the external shock overshadowed the limited progress in reducing the large fiical deficit. The primary balance of the federal government improved by only 1 percent of GDP during the year through mid-1998, compared to the loss of external inflows of $26 billion or 6.2 percent of GDP from the deterioration in the current account and lower net intlows through placements of Eurobonds and net sales of GKOs and OF& 10. The insufficient fiscal adjustment partly reflected the fact that fiscal policy had become severely circumscribed by a failure to address entrenched problems, with a longstanding political unwillingness to sanction large tax delinquents having become a particularly serious obstacle to fiscal adjustment when the external environment began to deteriorate. Partly due to this unwillingness, statutory obligations had become mostly irrelevant to large taxpayers, who negotiated their payments essentially independently of such obligations. Tax collection problems had also been exacerbated by the repeated recourse to a policy of offsetting tax arrears against expenditures, which had encouraged politically influential enterprises to accumulate arrears as a means of forcing government demand for their goods and services, often at inflated implicit prices. The political unwillingness to support effective tax enforcement also frustrated fiscal adjustment in the run-up to the August 1998 crisis. When the Emergency Tax Commission began to initiate bankruptcy procedures and seize assets of tax delinquents at the end of 1997, it was overruled at the highest political levels; and when the tax service sought to seize Gazprom assets for nonpayment of taxes in mid-1998, the Duma intervened. Revenues fell short of the targets set at the beginning of each year by an average of 2% percent of GDP between 1995 and 1998. The problems in tax administration, and the reasons for the limited effectiveness of technical assistance in overcoming these problems, are detailed in Box 2. 11. The revenue shortfalls necessitated sharp offsetting expenditure cuts relative to planned levels. In the absence of comprehensive expenditure reduction plans, however, this generally involved arbitrary sequestration and across-the-board reductions, and due to weak expenditure control, generated large expenditure arrears by end-year. The fact that expenditures were already highly compressed when the external environment began to deteriorate further reduced the room for maneuver to undertake offsetting fiscal adjustment. 12. Monetary policy, geared towards maintaining the fixed exchange rate policy, came under considerable pressure as a result of the weakening balance of payments (Figures 4 and 5).

Revenue Colkctkn Probkms and Fund Technkal Assktamx In addition to tbe problem of weak political resole to enforce tax complkna as discuaaed in the main body of the text, there .re a number of critical technkal kaues in tax administration that need to be urgently addressed. . The Tax Code fails to provide suflicient authority and flexibility for tax officials to effectively administer the tax laws, including the authority to perform tax audits and inspections, while ensuring that taxpayers’ rights areprotected. . With respect to huge taxpayer compliance. &&cation is needed regarding the tasks to be performed at each level of the large taxpaya ContIol operation, funding for these activities. reporting and payment procedures, and the legal states of the proposed control measmea. . In the area of excise tax coUection. particularly io the alcohol industry, a multi-ageocy strategy for strengthening iodustry oversight and maximkin g revenllcs is needed. New legal and admioistrative tools in tbis area should be used to prevent orgaoized crime 6om b emming entrenched in the regulated alcohol industry. Since the mid-19908, FAD haa carried out eight technical assistance missions in tar and cuntoms administration, and pnwlded two long-term tar administration advkon to the State Tax Service (STS), now the Mlnktry of Taxation. The focus of FAD’s technical assistance has been on: improving debt recovay activities; modemking tax audit opcratioos; establishing specialid units to monitor and control large taxpayers; strengthening con~ols ovex alcohol excise taxation; and improving the STS’s organizational structure and staffing. FAD has also provided recommendations to improve the collection of pension taxes The most recent FAD mission, in August 1998, proposed critical measures to increase federal revenue collections. The two long-term tax administration advisors were stationed in Moscow during tbe periods 1993-97 and 1997-99. Tbe Russian authorities have also received sobstaotial k&oical assistawe from other multilateral and bilateral donors. Despite this technical nssistnace,implementntios of reforms has been slow. FAD recommendations in many of tbe am.8 indicated above have only partially been carried out by Ministry of Taxatton or Pension Fund management. The effectiveness of technical assistance has been limlted bccnuse ofz weak govemmeot support for the tnx administration’s collection enforcement efforts, the tkqmentation of tax administration across too many agencies, the high turnover rate of tax administration management, continued rccaursc to tax offsets, complex and contradictory tax legislation, increased sophistication of tax evasion schemes, overreliance on the banking system to enforce tax collections, low salaries of tax officials, and endemic cormption among taxpayers and tax collectors. In addition, there have been diflkultks lo coordinating the substantial technlc~l assistance that hns been provided by several donor agencies to the Ministry of Taxation. Some technical assistance provided bilaterally has been considered by the Russians to be not well-targeted The limited capacity to absorb technical assistance has also tinther complicated the coordination problem Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - Figure 4.

Whereas the Treasury Bill yield had fallen from about 40 percent at the beginning of 1997 to 15-20 percent by mid-1997 on the strength of acquisitions by nonresidents, it increased to almost 50 percent in November 1997 and again in February 1998, and was well above 100 percent in the run-up to the August crisis. However, capital outflows continued and the CBR supported the ruble through net sales of foreign exchange during most of the period up to August 1998. Gross foreign reserves were halved from mid-1997 to August 1998, falling to $12.5 biion. Russia implemented a unilateral restt-ucturing of ruble- denominated treasury bills on August 17 and the fixed exchange rate policy was abandoned shortly thereafter. Developments in the run-up to the August crisis are detailed in Box 3. B. Macroeconomic Developments Since August 1998 13. The floating of the ruble set off a sharp real depreciation of the currency, a rapid rise in prices, a deep import compression, sod, with a delay, some recovery in output. By end-l 998, the ruble had depreciated by 45 percent in real effective terms compared to mid-year and imports had been cut in half Imports were still only about 60 percent of the level of one year earlier in April 1999. Following an initial decline in output, which partly reflected a loss of trade financing and a temporary disruption of the payment system in the wake of the August events, there has, however, been a sustained recovery. Industrial output in April-May 1999 exceeded the level of one year earlier by almost 4 percent. This recovery appears to have been led primarily by import substitution, with only very recent evidence of some pickup in exports. One reason for the subdued response of exports to the devaluation is the fact that the oil and gas sector, which accounts for 40 percent of exports, remains constrained by extraction and transportation limitations. Available data suggest that the import compression has been broadly based, with a particularly large reduction in imports of consumer goods. Real wages have fallen by 42 percent since mid-1998, and wages in dollar terms by 69 percent. 14. Having receded signiIicantly from the very high levels reached in September of nearly 40 percent, inflation began to increase again, reaching a monthly rate of 11% percent by December 1998.3 Since then, it has fallen steadily, to a monthly rate of 2.2 percent in May 1999. Foreign exchange market pressures have also eased substantially since the beginning of 1999 (Figure 6). These developments reflect the fact that monetary and, subsequently, fiscal policies were relaxed in the aftermath of the August crisis, but have been tightened since early 1999. ‘Inflation surged to a monthly rate of 38 percent in September 1998 as a result of the sharp ruble depreciation. The ruble appreciated somewhat from mid-September to end-October and inflationary pressures subsided sharply in October.

The August 1998 Crisis PoUtical tmmoil in Russia itttensilied fmmtcial market pnssures from mid-May, 1998. Average GKO yields increased to about lW percent at end-May, from under 30 percent at the start of the month, and the ruble catw under swerc pressure. The CBR initially responded by tightening domestic credit while stepping up sales of foreign exchange: it temporarily raised its inter& rates, from 30 percent to 150 pcrccnt, and doubled its sale of foreign exchange in tbs market to about SO.8 billion per month. As the summer progressed, however, this strategy became increasingly untenable as investors cont~nucd to withdraw fmm the treasury bill market and the hemorrhaging of international reserves continued By mid-July, the CBR had sold $6.3 billion (24 percent of base money) in the market since the intcnsiticalicm of pressures in mid-May. At the same time, the high interest rates necessary to defend the ruble had crippled domestic commercial banks, which had invcstsd heavily in GKOs, and dmmatic.ally incnased the debt serv~cc costs of the government. The arm ouncemeat in n&l-July ofn ttew modified program supported by the Fund temponrily eased prmsurrs, enabling a kwwing of interest rates and a halt in sales of foreign exchange. GKOs with a market value of S4.4 billion wcrc swapped into long-term Eurobonds through a voluntary scheme. The Fund-supported progtnm was focussed on addressing the fiscal problems. In light of the objectives to shore up confidence in the fixed exchange rate policy, the progmm was supported by additional assistance from the Fund of SDR 8.5 billion in the context of an augmentation of the extended “rrangcmcntand a. purchase under the CCFF. The program was short-lived, however, as cootldenu weakened anew following the Dums’s refusal to accept key tiial RICPIYI(I in the Gavernmnt’s pmgrnm The failure by state-owned Sbcrbank to roll over its maturing GKOs further undermined market confidence GKO yields rose again, to almost 300 percent. Finding prices unacceptable. the Ministry of Finance cancckd new auctions. As bills conhnucd to mature, the govcmmcnt’s cash-flow problems became acute At the same time, liquidity in the banking sector d&cd up and interbank transactions virtually stopped. Morcovcr, as the CBR pmvidcd large credits to the govcmmcnt to meet obligations on maturing GKOs and extended support to commercial banks. mone.tary policy was in effect fuclin8, the run on rcscrvcs, prcvcnting the unsterilizcd sale of foreign exchange from leading to a tightening of monetary conditions. The CBR sold $3.8 billion in the foreign exchange market during July27-August 14. Agalnrt tbh backdrop, the suthotities announced a series of measures on August 17. They included: (i) a widening of the exchange rstc band from 5.3-7.1 rubles per dollar to 6.0-9.5 and the climmation of the narmw daily band; (ii) a de facto default on treasury bills maturing bcforc end-1999 lls the government suspended payments on such bills and dcclarcd its intention to canvcrt them into longer-term papa, with the terms to bc announced subscqucntly, and (iii) a 90-day standstill in the servicing of private external debt. At the same time, secondary market trading of GKOs-OF& WBS suspcndcd and the authorities announced their intention to intmducc initiatives to implcmcnt capital controls (Box 4). The market nwtion to the new ~CPOUPCI w*s extremely unfavorable, due partly to uncertainty about the details of the debt wnvenion schcmc. The ruble deprcciatcd sharply despite continued large-scale intcrvcntions by the CBR. On Ssptembcr 2, the CBR abolished the exchange rate band altogether and Ict the ruble float. The devaluation of the ruble and the de facto default on treasury bills caused the collapse of a large number of banks that had invested he&y in GKOs and entered into faward foreign exchange contracts with foreign banks active in the GKO market. The domestic payment system was temporarily impaired. access to international capital markets was scvcmd, and trade financing sevcrcly disrupted. The negotiations on the nshwturtng of hwsury hi were protracted. The restructuring of nonresident investors’ holdings of treasury bills was decoupled from the issue of their foreign currency forward claims an Russian banks, which is to be scttlcd in bilateral negotiations between creditors and debtors. As to treasury bills, the stream of payments falling due on the original instruments wcrc, for most resident and nonresident investors, discounted to August 19, at an annual rate of 50 pcrcsnt.

First, despite a sharp decline in tax collections, the cash deficit of the central government fell to 3.2 percent of quarterly GDP in the third quarter of 1998, from 5.7 percent in the second quarter. This reflected some reduction in expenditures on a commitment basis and a surge in noninterest arrears equivalent to 3.2 percent of quarterly GDP. Second, fiscal policy became highly expansionary in the fourth quarter of 1998 when the cash deficit rose to 5.4 percent of quarterly GDP, mainly because the government sharply reduced arrears, in particular on wages. With revenues still compressed, and no access to domestic or foreign capital markets, the arrears clearance was financed primarily by recourse to borrowing from the CBR as well as with funds from the sale of Gazprom shares. Third, the fiscal situation has improved notably since the beginning of 1999. The federal cash deficit fell to 4.7 percent of quarterly GDP in the first quarter as revenues recovered significantly, to a level relative to GDP close to that of the tirst quarter of 1998. This recovery, which has been sustained in April-June, has reflected the good output performance, the impact of the ruble depreciation and the higher energy prices on the tax base in the energy sector, and a determined effort to improve tax collections.

While the overall deficit of the federal government fell for the year as a whole-from 7.1 percent of GDP in 1997 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 1998-there was a small rise in the overall deficit of the enlarged government in 1999, primarily due to a large increase in the arrears of the Pension Fund.4 For the first quarter of 1999, the deficit of the enlarged ‘Except in 1997, when regional and local governments temporarily gained access to foreign capital markets, the deficit on the enlarged government has been mostly determined by the deficit of the federal government as other levels of government have had limited recourse to (continued...)

This surplus reflects primarily the fact that nonindexation of entitlements has caused a surplus in the Pension Fund, allowing a reduction in pension arrears. Preliminary data indicates that arrears by other levels of government were virtually unchanged from end-December 1998 through end-March 1999. 17. Faced with the widespread collapse of banks and disruptions to the payments system, the CBR provided large credits to ailing banks following the August crisis, in addition to lowering reserve requirements. Credits were given to insolvent banks without these banks being placed under administration or subject to other regulatory constraints. Under these circumstances, the liquidity support provided to banks in effect fueled the run on foreign reserves immediately after the devaluation of the ruble. Since then, the CBR has not extended large-scale credits to ailing banks, although support of selected banks continued. However, monetary policy came under renewed pressure towards the end of 1998 when the government resorted to CBR credits for arrears clearance and when the CBR undertook large unsterilized foreign exchange purchases to partly offset the impact on foreign reserves of debt service payments on Russian-era debt. 18. Monetary policy has been relatively tight since early 1999. CBR financing of the government has had little monetary impact as such credits have been largely limited to foreign exchange credit to service Russian-era debt. Moreover, the CBR stopped purchasing from the foreign exchange market during the first quarter of 1999, allowing gross reserves to fall commensurately with the servicing ofRussian-era debt. Indeed, base money fell by over 2 percent during the quarter. On the strength of this tightening, the CBR subsequently made significant net purchases of foreign exchange from the market during the second quarter, largely offsetting the impact on foreign reserves of continued debt service payments on behalf of the government. Net credit to banks also decreased substantially during this period-NDA of the CBR increased by only 0.8 percent of base money in April-May-mainly due to a build-up in commercial banks’ free reserves at the CBR. This increase, which has partially neutralized the impact on base money of the CBR’s purchases of foreign exchange, reflects a tlight to security by banks (banks’ purchases of foreign exchange on their own accounts is restricted). 19. The restoration of relative financial stability since the August crisis, along with a recovery in international capital markets generally, has resulted in a sharp recent improvement in Russian financial asset prices, albeit from a very depressed base. Although they remain some 75 percent below their 1997 peaks, equity prices on the Russian Trading System exchange have gained more than 80 percent in U.S. dollar terms since the beginning of April and more than 180 percent since the beginning of 1998, outperforming all other emerging equity markets. Secondary market prices of Russian government debt have also increased substantially in recent months. ‘(...continued) deficit financing other than through accumulation of arrears Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- Table 2.

The overall balance of payments position has become gradually stronger since last August. The halving of imports, the recent recovery in energy prices, and the suspension of interest payments on Soviet-era debt have caused the external current account to swing from a deficit of $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 1998 to a surplus of $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 1999, on a cash basis. Moreover, the tightening of monetary policy has been reflected in a significant reduction in net capital outflows from the nongovernment sector since the beginning of 1999. It is uncertain to what extent the exchange market restrictions imposed since last August also contributed to the strong showing of the balance of payments. The main restrictions are listed in Box 4.

Exchange Reatrlctions Subject to Approval Under Article VIII The Russian authorities presently impose II number of exchange measures that are subject to approval under Article VIII. Many of these were imposed in August 1998 in order to stem capital flight and stab&z the exchange r&e. Russia’s resbictions under Article VIII are as follows: . Suspension of conversion operations through nonresidents’ S-accounts. (These are special accounts wed for GKO/OFZ-related transactions.) Before balances arising thorn such transactions can be repatriated, I%& have to be transferred to a noninterest bearing transit account. As a result the repatriation of interest earnings and other current proceeds from GKO/OFZ inveshnents would be made with possibly a long delay and at unfavorable terms. . Use of P more depreciated exchange rate for repatriation of S-account balancea. Nonresidents who participated in the GKO-OFZ novation will be allowed to repatriate part of the proceeds by purchasing foreign currency in special auctions arranged by the CBR. The CBR is making available $50 million in each auction. The exchange rate applied in these sales could be depreciated by up to 20 percent from the prevailing market rate, dus constituting a multiple amency practice The first two such auctions were based on an exchange rate that was depreciated by 10 percent. . Repatriation restrictions on ruble balances of nonresidents not patiicipating in the GKOlOFZ novation. . Restrictions on nonresidents’ T-accounts. (These are nonresident bank accounts used for trade and some bond-related transactions.) Existing restrictions limit the ability of nonresidents ta effect moderate amounts of amortization Tom the proceeds of bond transactions. . Restrictions on certain advance payments to Latvian residents. In addition, several other measures, subject to approval under Article VIII, were introduced but subsequently eliminated. These included: (I) a go-day moratorium (until November 14. 1998). that restricted some forms of private debt service, including repayment of principal on loans with a term longer than 180 days received from nonresidents and payments on forward foreign exchange contracts; (2) the segmentation of the foreign exchange market into restricted and open sessions; (3) a deposit requirement on advance import payments; and (4) prohibition on the convertibility of balances maintained in the ruble accounts of nonresident banks.

In retrospect, while the relative measures of financial stability achieved in recent months is highly tenuous, Russia avoided hyperinflation, contrary to what had been feared by some in the wake of the August crisis. Two features of economic policies stand out in this regard. First, when large CBR credits to the government indeed caused rapidly rising inflation towards the end of 1998, the CBR prevented an even sharper rise in inflation by allowing a substantial loss in foreign reserves. Second, and most importantly, the government limited cash expenditures to available revenues during most of the period since last August. This policy was facilitated by an unexpectedly strong output response to the depreciation of the ruble and by the recovery in energy prices, which facilitated the notable increase in revenues. C. Recent Developments in Structural Reforms 22. Limited progress has been made in restructuring insolvent banks. Diagnostic work on 18 large Moscow-based banks has been mostly completed and a bank restructuring agency (ARCO) has been set up, but the legislative changes needed to strengthen the ability of the authorities to write down the capital of banks and to empower and regulate ARC0 have not been undertaken. Moreover, until recently, licences had been withdrawn from only two major banks and the banking system remained characterized by the continued existence of a large number of insolvent major banks, This situation fostered widespread asset stripping, exposed the CBR to pressures for ad hoc support of politically well connected banks, and stifled the recovery of the interbank market. On the other hand, the necessary minimal tinctioning of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- payments system has been restored fohowing the virtual collapse in the wake of the August crisis. Moreover, deposits have been transferred from a number of insolvent banks to Sberbank, which now holds 87 percent of total household deposits, and deposits remaining with ailing banks are relatively low, limiting the scope for a run on such banks. 23. Barter and nonpayment have proliferated in recent years, becoming a major reason for macroeconomic instability and stifling the emergence of a private sector by enabling ailing enterprises to circumvent hard budget constraints (Figure 7). These problems have been subject to considerable analysis recently (see Box 5 on the Vial Economy). While conclusions d&r, a common theme is that the failure to cut energy supplies to delinquent customers has enabled an exceptionally large number of value-subtracting enterprises to survive; these enterprises have in effect been maintained through the provision of quasi-fiscal subsidies by the energy sector, and such subsidies have, in turn, been partly passed on to the budget through nonpayment of taxes. Little progress has been made in addressing the underlying problems since the August crisis until recently: the policy of cutting tax delinquent oil companies’ access to the oil pipeline had not been firmly enforced, and policies had regressed in some areas. Most notably, the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against enterprises with tax arrears has been suspended through a government directive; the government has ordered oil deliveries to delinquent customers; and a government resolution of July 1998 implementing VAT on an accruals instead of on a cash basis has been struck down by the Constitutional Court. The government has also continued to contribute to nonpayments problems by running expenditure arrears and resorting to offset arrangements. A positive step has been the simplification of procedures for the termination of energy supply to nonpaying customers; however, major utilities have not yet adopted more forceful disconnection policies in cases of arrears. Despite the lack of progress in tackling the underlying problems, there has been some reduction in barter in recent months, possibly because the large ruble depreciation has benefited sectors where the incidence of barter is less than in the economy at large. 24. As to other structural reforms, the revitalisation of the reform program launched before the crisis was not sustained, and there has beeu a standstill in most areas since then. With regard to infrastructure monopolies, there has been some reduction in the cross- subsidies of households by enterprises and an improvement in cost-recovery levels for housing and communal services. However, new distortions have been introduced due to the failure to increase tariffs in line with inflation. The independence of the regulatory agencies for transport, telecommunications and energy has been reduced by their incorporation in a new Ministry of Anti-Monopoly Policy. Privatisation has also slowed since the crisis, with the notable exception of the sale of Gazprom shares, and there has been little progress in other areas relating to private sector development. Overall, while there was a reversal in some areas, there has not been a return-as was once feared-to large-scale state intervention and subsidies despite calls by some senior members of government for such a change in policies, In effect, differences of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Figure 7.

The Virtual Economy’ In the last seveml years, the pervasive culture of nonpayment has been increasingly recognized as one of the dcfig characteristics of the Russian economy, and the phenomenon has been subject to analysis both by academics and policy-makers. “Nonpayments” here refers to all forms of nonmonetay settlement, includiig promissory notes (vekrels), tax offsets, and barter, as well as recourse to arrears. The economic costs of abandoning money arc significant. They include: high transactions costs, difficulties in tax collection, distortions in govemment expenditure, obstacles to industrial restructuring, lack of transparency regarding enterprise fmances, and widespread opportunities for crime and comrption. Indeed, the lack of fmancial discipline associated with nonpayments is one of the key microeconomic failings that lay behind the inability to achieve fiscal sustainability and ultimately derailed the macroeconomic stabilization effort A few statistics serve to illustrate the extent of the problem: Enterprise anxars have accumulated at a rate of IO- I5 percent of GDP a year for the past five years. Nearly halfof employees reported having wage ~l~cars of at least two months at the end of 1996, since when the incidence of wage arrears has grown. The share of barter in industrial turnover rose from below IO percent in 1992 to over 50 percent in mid-1 998. Cash receipts of the gas and electricity companies accounted for only 15 percent of the value of domestic sales at end- 1998. The roots of the nonmonetary economy can be (raced back to the Soviet era; both to the distortions (among them underpriced energy) that sustained the industrial stmcture, and to behavioral practices that developed under central planning. But the reasons for the growth of nonpayments during the transition period are far from fully understood. Perhaps the best-known exposition is provided by Gaddy and Ickes (I 998),’ which describes the evolution of a “virtual economy” in which D value-adding sector of the economy (natural resources) subsidizes a value-subtracting sector (industry) by means of barter trade at artificial prices, and in which recorded prices and output are largely illusory This analysis points to the importance of limiting implicit and explicit energy subsidies to industry as a means for addressing the nonpayments problem. A number of other explanations for the spread of nonpayments have been offered. Several of these stress the role of government, at both the central and subnational level, in facilitating nonpayments, in particular through their inability to collect taxes in cash and their willingness to engage in offsets of tax liabilities against budgetary arrears. The policy approach followed in recent gov-ent programs has been to attempt to impose hard budget constraints throughout the economy. First, this has meant trying to bring discipline into the government’s own interactions with the rest of the economy. by ensuring that government spending commitments are met in cash, and by enforcing tax compliance. Second, it has meant trying to enforce hard budget constraints in the enterprise sector, by improving corporate governance stmch~~cs, strengthening bankruptcy processes, and using the government’s influence in the energy sector to address the crucial role played by that sector in sustaining the virtual economy. In both these endeavors, however, implementation has been inadequate, partly reflecting a lack of political will to see through consistently the required policies against opposition from powetil vested interest groups. “For further details, see Annex II of the accompanying report on Recent Economic Developments ” Gaddy, Clifford and Bany W.

III. REPORTONTHEDISCUSSIONS A. Basic Strategy and Objectives 25. While considering the deterioration in the terms of trade and in conditions in international capital markets to have been the immediate causes of the iinancial crisis that erupted in mid-1998, the authorities were aware that the root cause lay in the generally disappointing record of policy implementation in recent years, in particular in the lack of fiscal adjustment and the failure to advance structural reforms. They also recognised that the adoption of a more flexible exchange rate policy had in no way reduced the importance of taking strong fiscal actions, as the measure of financial stability achieved in recent months is tenuous and ultimately unsustainable without actions to address the underlying fiscal imbalance. Similarly, notwithstanding the output recovery spurred by the depreciation of the ruble, the authorities were aware of the importance of structural reforms in ensuring a lasting recovery. Such reforms would need to entail comprehensive measures to restructure insolvent banks, impose hard budget constraints on enterprises, and foster a dynamic private sector. They realized that macroeconomic stability could not be sustained without structural reforms, and vice versa, and that the fiscal and structural problems were highly inter-related and had to be tackled in tandem. In view of these considerations, the main focus of economic policies for the remainder of 1999 and 2000 would be on fiscal adjustment and the acceleration of structural reforms. 26. The fiscal program would target a primary surplus at the level of the federal government of 2 percent of GDP in 1999, an increase of 3% percentage points of GDP compared to 1998, while the remainder of the public sector would he in balance. There was agreement that this relatively ambitious fiscal adjustment was required in light of the severe external shocks to the economy and of the basic objectives for 1999 of achieving a finther gradual reduction in inflation and some increase in gross reserves from the low levels at end-March. There was also agreement, however, that the planned fiscal adjustment was insufficient to ensure that Russia would graduate from needing exceptional balance of payment support within 2-3 years. Nevertheless, the authorities felt that a more ambitious pace of adjustment would not be feasible, considering the fact that output is still relatively depressed and that fiscal policy remains severely circumscribed on both the revenue and expenditure sides. 27. While recognizing that the fixed exchange rate policy had served Russia well in fostering price stability, the authorities realized that the weakened conlidence in policies, the loss of access to international capital markets, and the low level of reserves required a flexible exchange rate policy at this time. The macroeconomic program for 1999 takes into Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - account the authorities’ intention to seek a rescheduling of nearly all obligations on Soviet-era debt falling due in 1999-2000 as well as the provision of additional exceptional balance of payments support from the Fund, the World Bank, and Japan. It assumes that all Russian-era debt will continue to be serviced as scheduled. 28. The authorities were aware that their commitment to undertake significant fiscal adjustment and structural reform would be assessed against the disappointing record of policy implementation in these areas in recent years. Reminding the mission that the abolition of the fixed exchange rate policy had been met with considerable fears, in Russia and abroad, of a return to highly inflationary policies, the authorities emphasized that such fears had proven unfounded; this reflected broad-based support in Russia for focusing policies on inflation control. They also argued that concerns of a return to interventionist policies and backtracking on key reforms had proven equally unfounded. The authorities maintained that these developments, and the fact that key measures would be implemented upfront, should provide sufficient assurances that the proposed program would be implemented as planned. 29. On the strength of the policies detailed below, the program targets a rate of inflation of 50 percent in 1999 (December-December), entailing an average monthly rate of 3 percent during the last three quarters of 1999. Net international reserves of the monetary authorities are targeted to increase by $2.2 billion in 1999, with an increase in gross reserves of $1.7 billion during the last three quarters of the year, to $11.3 billion by end-year. Real GDP is assumed to decline by 2 percent in 1999 (Table 4). The nominal framework for 2000 will be discussed at the time of the first program review. B. Fiscal Policy 30. The target of a federal government primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP will require fiscal measures yielding 3.3 percent of GDP relative to the baseline scenario for 1999.’ The 1999 budget approved by Parliament was based on the assumption that this adjustment could be achieved primarily through a tinther compression of expenditures. Noting that the compression would entail reductions in a broad range of expenditure categories, including wages and pensions, by 30-40 percent in real terms, the staff questioned the sustainability of such reductions in light of the already heavy reliance on expenditure restraint in recent years. While the staff did not preclude the possibility of some expenditure cuts, it urged the authorities to adopt a package of fiscal measures that better balanced revenue and expenditure measures, Accordingly, to enable the government to accommodate expected pressure during 1999 for expenditure over and above the allocations in the approved budget, the agreed fiscal program includes additional revenue measures yielding 1.8 percent of GDP relative to the baseline scenario for 1999, reducing the need for expenditure measures to 1.5 percent of GDP. For a detailed description of the fiscal measures and the expected yields, see Table 6. ‘Baseline scenario refers to the projection for 1999 on the assumption of unchanged policies.

They have introduced new taxes and raised some tax rates in order to capture windfall gains from the large ruble depreciation and increase taxation of consumption, while taking a wide range of measures to improve tax compliance. The tax measures include, most importantly, an export tax on oil and a limited number of other commodities, as well as a new wealth tax on luxury automobiles, automatic indexation of specific excises, and an increase in the VAT rate from 10 to 20 percent for several commodities.6 The measures to improve tax compliance are expected to yield notable payoffs even in the short run, but most will only gradually become t?dly effective. These measures include: a stop to the practice of allowing tax offsets, with a removal from the Budget Code of those articles permitting such offsets; the termination of access to the oil pipeline by tax delinquent oil companies; an agreement with Gazprom, whose actual tax payments are well below statutory obligations, to significantly increase such payments in 1999 and meet statutory obligations in full in 2000; substantial amendments to the tax code; strengthening of procedures for asset seizures and initiation of bankruptcy in the case of tax arrears; organizational changes in tax collection agencies; and numerous measures to improve customs collections. (For details see paragraphs 17-21 of the SEP.) 32. The programmed increase in total revenues in 1999 understates the effort on the revenue side because the termination of tax offsets implies an even larger rise in cash revenues, which are set to increase by 2.6 percentage points of GDP, or by about one-third, in 1999. There was agreement that this increase is ambitious in light of the pervasiveness of barter and noncash transactions in the economy, and the persistence of noncompliance problems, but the authorities emphasized that cash collections so far in 1999 were firlly in line with the target for the year as a whole.’ This partly reflects the large depreciation of the ruble, which has significantly increased the tax base in the export sector, where the prevalence of barter and noncash transactions is lower than in the economy at large. The authorities stressed, however, that the increase in revenue collections was also the result of a more determined effort by the Ministry of Taxation to enforce tax compliance. Staff agreed that recent tax collections showed that the ambitious target for the year as a whole was feasible, provided that the effort to improve collections was sustained. Emphasizing that the interruption of pipeline access for tax delinquent oil enterprises is a particularly powerful and easy-to- administer tool, staff stressed that forceful implementation of this measure would be a test of the political resolve to continue to back effective enforcement of compliance. Moreover, while 6Revenue gains are also expected from a rise in the share of VAT collection accruing to the federal government from 75 to 85 percent. The regional budgets for 1999 take into account this reallocation. ‘Preliminary data suggest that cash revenues for January-June 1999 were slightly above the indicative program target. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - noting that the authorities have invariably yielded to pressures for tax offsets in the past, in particular toward the end of year, staff urged the authorities to stand firm.* 33. The authorities believed that the tax compliance problems partly reflect excessively high tax rates, and explained that an early reduction in tax rates was a priority. They were particularly concerned about high income and VAT rates. Profit tax rates had been reduced already, and the Duma had also approved a law reducing the basic VAT tax rates from 20 to 15 percent, although the coming-into-effect of this law had been delayed through a presidential veto due to the difficult fiscal situation at present. StafT agreed that the reduction in the VAT and other tax rates, in particular on labor income, over the medium term was an important objective. The staff disagreed, however, that such reductions would not entail a significant revenue loss in the short run under current circumstances. It warned that a reduction in rates alone would have no impact on collections from the large number of companies that negotiate their tax payments with no regard to statutory obligations, while it would risk causing reduced collections from other, politically less influential companies. The staff emphasized that such a revenue loss would be inconsistent with the overriding fiscal objective of securing a sizeable reduction in the deficit in the coming years, and it urged the authorities to delay cutting tax rates until the measures to improve tax collections had proven effective. Expenditures 34. The authorities agreed with the staff that the programmed reduction in real noninterest expenditure-which already was less severe than contemplated in the budget-was ambitious, in particular considering the fact that the revenue shortfalls had forced sizable ad hoc expenditure cuts in recent years. The authorities stressed, however, that the compression in 1999 bad mostly taken place already, reflecting the fact that increases in wages and pensions had not kept pace with the rise in the price level following the August crisis. Though it was not clear when pressures would force an increase in wages, the additional breathing room provided by the higher revenues relative to the budget provided scope for some increase in real wages during the last two quarters of 1999. 3s. The authorities stressed that significant progress had been made before the eruption of the crisis last August in moving away from reliance on ad hoc expenditure measures, and they explained that the implementation of the 1999 budget would he built on these gains. They would resume the comprehensive expenditure reduction plan launched in 1998, involving additional significant cuts in public sector employment (SEP, paragraph 24). They would also improve budget formulation and implementation in the context of a public expenditure review. They explained that the strengthening of the Treasury had improved *The Minister of Taxation was changed in May 1999. In discussions with staff, the new minister has reaffirmed the basic thrust of assessments and commitments made by his predecessor.

While agreeing that progress had been made in rationalizing and controlling expenditures, staff expressed concerns about delays in implementing a number of planned improvements, and about continued reports of large government arrears, in particular, to the energy sector, and questioned the realism of budgetary allocations for energy consumption. The authorities expressed confidence that spending units would remain within budgetary limits, and stressed that they were committed to not incurring further arrears during 1999. Staff expressed concern about the large stock of expenditure arrears and emphasized the importance of improved reporting. They also undertook to include in the 2000 budget an appropriations that would enable to government to make market-related interest payments in 2000 on CBR credits extended after July 1, 1999. 36. Looking beyond the immediate fut.ure, a review of expenditure assignments and revenue sharing among the federal, regional, and Local governments is a priority. The authorities explained that the system of tax-sharing needed to be simplified, to eliminate the incentive for local tax collectors to focus on taxes with the largest nonfederal share, among other objectives. Intergovernmental transfers would also need to be reformed, to account more firlly for expenditure needs of regions as well as their ability to raise revenues. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 37. CBR onicials explained that monetary policy would be geared towards inflation control and conducted within the framework of a flexible exchange rate policy. They would intervene in the foreign exchange market to achieve the targeted increase in foreign reserves and smooth exchange rate fluctuations, but would not resist fundamental changes in the balance of payments. Under the current balance of payments outlook, the foreign reserve target is expected to be consistent with the exchange rate moving broadly in line with inflation during the remainder of 1999. There was agreement that the relatively strong balance of payments position suggested that the ruble was no longer over-valued in real terms and indeed was likely to appreciate gradually over the medium term. 38. The day-to-day conduct of monetary policy would primarily be guided by developments in reserve money. In determining the path for reserve money, it had been assumed that there would be some further increase in velocity during the coming months, reflecting political uncertainties, the continued insolvency of a large number of banks, and the possibility that the restructuring of banks would be associated with some withdrawal of deposits hitherto frozen. In light of the large uncertainties about money demand in the current circumstances, foreign exchange market developments would provide early indications of unexpected changes in monetary conditions. Monetary policy would also take bearings from such developments. Thus, the CBR intends to lower reserve money below the projected path in the event that foreign exchange market pressures are larger than expected, and vice versa. The CBR would also take into account liquidity conditions in the interbank market in conducting Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - day-to-day monetary policy. The quarterly program reviews and monthly discussions with the staff would provide an early opportunity to ensure the consistency between these operational guidelines for monetary policy and the need to allow the exchange rate to respond to fimdamental balance of payments shifts. 39. As to the instruments of monetary policy, CBR officials explained that reserve money management had been severely hampered by the government’s unilateral restructuring of the GKOs-OFZs, which had been the exclusive vehicle for open-market operations. The CBR had started to use its own bills to conduct such operations, but their legality had been contested by the Federal Securities Commission, forcing the CBR to use deposit-taking from commercial banks as the main instrument for reserve money management. The latter instrument was, however, inflexible as it could not be traded among banks. CBR officials, therefore, welcomed the government’s decision to propose legislative changes that would enable the CBR to resume issuing bills. There was agreement that the rapid build-up of commercial banks’ free reserves at the CBR remains a potentially destabilizing factor; the CBR will stand ready to use the deposit facility and CBR bills to mop up this excess liquidity if there is evidence that inflationary pressures are building. Changes in legal reserve requirements had also been used as an instrument for reserve money management, but CBR officials agreed with the staffthat such requirements should be set primarily in light of prudential considerations, and that an increase in banks’ unremunerated reserves could Mher weaken the financial situation of the banking system as a whole. 40. The CBR has been under considerable pressure to make an early reduction in interest rates a primary objective of monetary policy, and to support politically influential sectors through a resumption of directed credit operations. CBR officials agreed with the mission that the focussing of monetary policy toward such objectives would be incompatible with inflation control, and that a sustained reduction in interest rates can only be achieved by steadfastly focussing on reducing inflation. They emphasized that the CBR will not provide directed credits, including rediscounting commercial papers, but will only use market- based instruments. The officials also explained that the pressures on the CBR were taking place against a background of considerable support within the Duma for a sharp curtailment of the CBR’s independence. 41. CBR officials expressed concern that interest rates on CBR credits to the government were significantly below market rates. Since the CBR was absorbing liquidity from banks through market-based instruments, these below-market rates were becoming a serious source of losses to the CBR. While acknowledging this problem, government officials explained that there was no support in the Duma at present for budgetary allocations to make market-related interest payments to the CBR. Government officials undertook a commitment, however, to include such allocations in the budget for 2000 for loans contracted after July I, 1999. Noting that the CBR held a large share of the GKOs-OFZs, and that it had provided relatively large credits to ailing banks since last August, the mission expressed concern that, if assets were marked to market, the CBR would be found to have become seriously decapitalized. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - mission warned against a further masking of the fiscal cost of bank restructuring through the extension of CBR credits to ailing banks. It emphasized that the budget would eventually bear the cost of such operations, in the form of lower transfers of CBR profits or possibly through a need for the government to recapitalize the CBR. CBR officials undertook not to extend any new commitments for rehabilitation loans or other long-term credits to ailing banks. 42. The mission welcomed the CBR management’s decision to direct a firll investigation into the accusations that the CBR’s past use of an offshore investment company to manage foreign reserves had led to misappropriation of funds, as well as into accusations of the misuse of the purchase from the Fund last July. CBR officials explained that the results of the investigations would be provided to the Fund. The mission emphasixed that the deep-rooted concerns, in Russia and abroad, about governance problems in the banking system, including the accusation of large-scale asset stripping from ailing banks, made it particularly important that the CBR’s operations be conducted in an open and transparent manner.9 The program includes several elements to enhance transparency, notably of monetary and fiscal policy (Box 6). D. Balance of Payments and External Debt Strategy 43. Staff projections suggest that the external current account surplus will widen to almost 7 percent of GDP in 1999 from a surplus of less than 1 percent in 1998, reflecting the impact of the sharp real depreciation of the ruble and the contraction of domestic demand. Partly due to an assumption that would accelerate imports to replenish depleted stocks, the projections allow for some reduction in the seasonally adjusted current account surplus during 1999 from the high level prevailing at the beginning of the year. Taking into account the loss of access to international capital markets, government debt service payments due in 1999 of about $17 billion, the need to clear $10.9 billion of external arrears outstanding at the beginning of the year, and the targeted increase in gross reserves, there is an estimated external Bnancing gap of about $22 billion in 1999. 44. With virtually no access to international capital markets, the authorities have requested from creditors a rescheduling of debt service payments due in 1999-2000 on Soviet-era debt (i.e., obligations incurred before January 1,1992), but reiterated their ‘Additional details on the investigation of the CBR’s relationship with its subsidiaries and on the handling of the July 1998 purchase will be provided in a supplement to be issued before the Executive Board meeting to discuss the request for a stand-by arrangement, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 31 - Box 6. Improving Transparency The economic program for which Russia is seeking the Fund’s support contains a number of measures to enhance transparency. Commitments made to the Fund in this regard include the following:’ I. Improving the transparency of the CBR’s own operations and of the relations between the authorities and commercial banks. In this area, the authorities are: Conducting an investigation into the relations behveen the CBR and FIMACO, and a comprehensive audit of the CBR, including information on the fmancial relations between the CBR and commercial banks owned by the CBR. Increasing the independence of commercial banks. Measures include B financial assessment and preparation of a business strategy for Sberbank: legislation to provide for appropriate governance stroctores and the application of proper rules to bank shareholders and management when applying for bank licenses; and a tightening of the criteria for bank licensing. Implementing the bank restructuring strategy in a transparent manner. This includes ensuring that ARCO’s sales of assets are conducted transparently, and liquidiating or restructuring insolvent banks is based on objective criteria. Improving commercial bank reporting. Enhancing fiscal transparency. Important actions include: Eliminating the use of tax offsets, payments in kind, and ad hoc negotiated tax payments. Extending Trcasuy control over the federal government, and strengthening Treasury control over spending commitments. Clearly defining expenditure responsibilities between federal and regional levels. Providing for the execution of fmancial management reviews of the Pension Fund, Social Insurance Fund, Medical Insurance Fund, and Road Fund. Conducting a public expenditure review during 1999 covering at least the health and education sectors. Limiting the discretion ofpublic offGals. Important actions include: Eliminate duplicate customs inspection activities, unify the foreign exchange market, and lift exchange restrictions. Simplify the tax system, by reducing the number of tax and customs preferences, and cutting substantially import tariff exemptions in 1999 and 2000 Improving the transparency of infrastructure monopolies. These companies are to announce cash collection targets and to achieve improved cash collection rates, and Gazprom, RAO UES, the Railways, and Transnefi are to be required to prepare and publish quarterly iinancial accounts consistent with international auditing standards. ’ ln addition, the authorities have made a number of transparency-enhancing commitments in the context of the program supported by the World Bank’s SAL3, in 8reas such P.S accounting and auditing standards, public procurement procedures, foreign direct investment. monopoly regulation, and public debt monitoring.

This gap could be closed by the proposed support from the Fund and expected balance of payment support from the World Bank ($1. I billion) and Japan ($0.7 billion) in 1999. According to preliminary staff projections, similar assumptions about exceptional balance of payments support in the form of rescheduling and new money would also suffice to cover the financing gap projected for 2000. 45. The authorities recognize that a normalization of relations with creditors would be key to an early restoration of Russia’s access to international capital markets. They are determined to seek an orderly restructuring of external debt on the basis of cooperative relations with creditors and in accordance with the principle of comparable treatment of various creditor groups. Informal consultations have already begun with creditors represented in the Paris and London clubs. In this regard, the decision by the authorities to pay $225 million in interest payments due in May 1999 on the Soviet-era series of the so-called MinFin bonds (MinFin III, IV, and V) had posed burden sharing concerns among some official creditors. The authorities explained that payment of interest on these obligations represented an exception to the policy of seeking a rescheduling of all payments due on Soviet-era debt. The authorities had been concerned that failure to make the interest payment would cause litigation and cross- acceleration of all other MinFin bonds, including Russian-era bonds. They stressed that it was not in Russia’s interest to seek a rescheduling of MinFin bonds, considering that these bonds carried a coupon interest rate of only 3 percent, well below the rate that could be expected on a restructured bond. They also emphasized that holders of these bonds had already had to accept a very large reduction in the net present value of their claims.” The authorities finally argued that they treat the MinFin bonds, though held in part by nonresidents, as a form of domestic debt since it had been initially issued to residents and under Russian law. In light of these considerations, the authorities believed that the interest payments made on MinFin III-IV were consistent with the objective of comparable treatment of external creditors. 46. As to nonsovereign debt, a large number of Russian banks had been unable to honor their obligations, including forward obligations with foreign banks that had invested in the GKO-OFZ market. Discussions with the foreign banks on these obligations had been de-coupled from the negotiations on the restructuring of the GKOs-OFZs, leaving the foreign banks to pursue their claims through bilateral discussions with the debtors or through the courts. A similar approach was being taken with regard to nonbank corporate external debt. The authorities recognized that, unless bankruptcy procedures were open and transparent and conducted in a timely manner, the strategy of leaving discussions on “The distinction drawn between Soviet-era and Russian-era debt is based on the effective Paris Club cutoff date of January 1, 1992. “Series I-V of MinFin bonds were issued to holders of foreign currency deposits at the Soviet-era Vneshekonombank in compensation for the loss of their deposits. Series VI and VII were issued in 1996 to raise new money. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33- nonsovereign debt to bilateral negotiations between debtors and creditors could become an obstacle to an early normalization of creditor relations. E. Exchange and Trade Systems 47. CBR officials explained that the absence of effective exchange controls had been a major reason for the large capital outflows fi-om Russia, and that the CBR had reluctantly taken recourse to various restrictions as a way of stemming such outflows in the wake of the crisis last August. On June 29, the CBR lifted the restrictions segmenting the organixed interbank foreign exchange market into two separate trading sessions, and all bona fide transactions are now settled in a unified market. It has also lifted the injunction against the transfer of balances in foreign banks’ correspondent accounts with Russian banks. However, the restrictions pertaining to repatriation of funds relating to investments in GKOs-OFZs will be maintained until the end of the program period. As to the deposit requirement for advanced payments of imports, CBR officials explained that it had been eased already so as not to burden clearly valid import transactions, However, evidence that substantial capital flight was taking place through fake import contracts required that restrictions be maintained until foreign exchange controls had been sufficiently strengthened. The authorities intend to abolish the deposit requirement by end-September 1999. By then, they expect to have put in place, with technical assistance from the Fund, legislative and institutional changes that would strengthen procedures for preventing illicit capital movements. 48. The authorities remain committed to trade liberalixation. The 3 percent import surcharge imposed in July 1998 has been abolished, and import tariffs on some essential imports have been cut. During 1999-2000, the authorities intend to lower a large number of ad valorem tariff rates, reduce specific duties on a number of tariff lines, and substantially reduce exemptions from import tariffs (SEP, paragraph 40). As to the reintroduction of export taxes, the authorities emphasized that this had been necessitated by fiscal considerations, and they underscored their commitment to an early phasing out of these taxes. Fiscal considerations had also led them to impose restrictions on alcohol imports. The exemption of some domestic cars from the tax on luxury cars-and the resulting discriminatory treatment of import-had been the result of compromises in the Duma to get the necessary revenue legislation adopted. The authorities indicated that they would seek to ease both restrictions over time. Finally, they explained that the quantity and price inspections for exports imposed under Government Resolution 155 were intended to limit capital flight, and they assured the staff that these inspections would be administered in a manner that would not be injurious to exports. 49. The authorities explained that Russia would push forward with its negotiations on accession to the WTO. A proposal on import tariffs has been forwarded to WTO partners, and a proposal pertaining to services is under preparation. The authorities are also considering measures to tinther liberalize the regime for foreign direct investment.

The latest in a series of proclamations on an eventual Russia-Belarus Union came in December 1998 when the Presidents of Russia and Belarus signed an Agreement on Forming Equal Conditions for Economic Agents. The Protocol to this agreement provided for an ambitious unification agenda in 1999 in a number of areas including the creation of a single currency, the setting of refinance rates and reserve requirements, bank supervision, taxation, price formation, the creation of a uniform customs space, regulation of securities markets, bankruptcy legislation, labor legislation, law enforcement, and industrial policy. Implementation to date has lagged well behind the schedule established in the Protocol, however, and the prospects of an acceleration in the near tinure are uncertain. F. Structural Reforms 51. The authorities recognixed that progress in structural reforms had been disappointing in recent years, There had been different views within the government about the reform strategy in the wake of the August crisis, with a number of senior officials calling for large-scale state subsidies and reversal of key reform-oriented policies. Although such calls had generally not been translated into policies, the result was a stalemate, with neither decisive forward nor backward movement. There was now, however, a stronger government resolve to resume market-oriented reforms. 52. While bank restructuring had become a matter of urgency since the collapse of many banks following the August crisis, the focus of the reform program was otherwise in line with the plan for reinvigorating structural reforms that had been developed prior to the crisis. Accordingly, the main focus of the reform program fell into four broad categories: (i) financial sector reforms, including bank restructuring; (ii) development of the private sector, industrial restructuring, and liberalization of foreign direct investment and international trade; (iii) enhancement of fiscal management; and (iv) improvements in the competitiveness, transparency and accountability of infrastructure monopolies. Two subsets of issues-bank restructuring and measures within each of these categories to address the problems of nonpayments-were the primary focus of discussions between the authorities and the staff because these issues were particularly important for the sustainability of macroeconomic stabilization. (The main measures in bank restructuring are summarized in Box 7 and planned steps in other areas are described in Box 8.) The discussions on structural reform were closely coordinated with those between the authorities and the World Bank on SAL3. 53. The existing legal framework had hampered comprehensive bank restructuring, and the authorities were in the process of making significant changes to it, in line with the recommendations of a joint Fund-World Bank technical assistance team. Most importantly, the Duma was expected to adopt shortly a new Bank Restructuring Law. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - Box 7. The Bank Restructuring Strategy The August 1998 crisis precipitated the virtual collapse of the Russian banking system. Well before the crisis, however, there was widespread recognition that the system was beset by serious weakncsscs. In particular, there were too many banks (while at the 8amc time the system was dominated by Sbcrbank, the former monopoly savings bank in the Soviet era), bank reporting and bank supervision were inadequate, thcrc was ao excessive concentration of bank assets in shon- term government sccuritics, and in many casts then was a mismatch behwcn foreign BSSC~S and liabilities. While some progress in bank restructuring had been made before August 1998, with the crisis it took on a new urgency, and the authoritics bclatcdly began to accelcratc the process. The bank restructuring strategy is aimed at rehabilitating a core group of banks identified by transparent objective criteria while liquidating a large number of nonviable banks, in order to prodocc a healthy and competitive banking system. The scope for supporting ailing banks is scvcrcly constrained by the vay limited availability of fiscal rcsourccs. Key steps to be laken in 1999 include: The creation and capitaliition of the indcpcndent bank restructuring agency ARCO. (ARC0 license issued January 1999, capitalization effected March 1999) Adoption of a stand-alone Bank Restructuring Law which gives sole responsibility for restructuring banks to ARCO, allows for the transfer of banks to ARC0 only by CBR dim&c issued on the basis of specific criteria, provides for an equitable and transparent mechanism for shareholder writedowns, and empowers ARC0 to undo transactions made with intent to defraud depositors and creditors of insolvent banks. (Done, June 1999) Amcndmcnts to the Bank Bankruptcy Law to require that a bank’s tcmporaty administrator remain in place until the bank’s restructuring is complete, ensure that ARC0 bc appointed receiver for the banks it controls, and incorporate a capital insolvency definition as grounds for bankruptcy. (Not taken up by the Duma before the summer rcccss; to tn rcsubmittcd in Scptcmbcr 1999). Adoption ofnormative acts necessary to provide limited guarantees on household deposits in commcraal banks subject to liquidation.(Duc July 1999. Pending) Decisive action by the CBR to curtail the activities of ailing banks, including through the identification as nonviable of a group of banks among the IS subject to the 1998-99 finaocisl rcvicw, the revocation of the liccnscs of thcsc banks, and the initiation of liquidation proceedings against them. (Liccnscs rwokcd, June 1999. Liquidation to be initiated July 1999) The CBR is also to revoke without delay the licenses ofany banks determined by ARC0 as to be liquidated. (No dctcrminatioos yet made by ARCO) A shill on the part of the CBR limiting liquidity support to s&cot banks or those implementing ARCO- approved restructuring plans, and only through regular facilities and with full collateralization. (Done.) Obtaining an external ass~ssmcnt of the financial condition of Sberbank, which holds more than 85 percent of all household deposits, and an analytical report on its operations, which will rccanmcnd actions to esulblish a level playing field for Sbcrbank and its competitors. (Terms of refercncc for due diligence audit arc near completion, work to bc completed October 1999; work on analytical report to begin by end-October 1999) To date, 18 large banks. accounting for about 65 percent ofthc banking system excluding Sbcrbank, have been subjected to financial reviews according to international standards. The reviews indicated that the negative capital of these banks is about Rub 2 IO billion, or some 5 pcrccnt of GDP, The estimated cost of restructuring viable banks from this group is about Rub 64 billion, of which some would bc borne by sharcholdcrs and creditors. The estimated budgetary cost of bank restructuring in 1999, over and above the Rub 10 billion to capitalim ARCO, is Rub 5 billion. Aims of the bank restructuring strategy for 2000 and beyond include developing a business strategy for Sberbank that will promo& a compctitivc banking system, upgrading banks’ accouoting practices to international standards; briiging bank supcrwsion rcquircmcnts into line with Basic core principles, identifying and correcting managcmcnt and internal control deficiencies, and putting in place a pcrmancnt system of limited deposit insurance.

ARCO, the bank restructuring agency, was fully operational and had been entrusted with restructuring some regional banks. CBR officials indicated, however, that while much remained to be done to address the problems of large, insolvent Moscow banks, they were moving ahead with withdrawing the licenses of six such banks. 54. CBR officials took note ofthe staffs concern that the CBR had not been suf3iciently vigilant in placing insolvent banks under administration, and that this had facilitated asset stripping, among other problems. As a result, the six banks slated for closure might be little more than empty shells by now. Staff welcomed, nevertheless, the decision to close these banks, but emphasized that the key test of the CBR’s resolve would be its willingness to forcefully use the new legislative framework to advance bank restructuring, promptly referring insolvent banks to ARC0 for restructuring and closing those that could not be saved. While acknowledging that bank restructuring was a politically sensitive task and that more explicit support from the government would broaden political support, staff expressed disappointment that lack of action in this area was increasingly reflecting unwillingness of the CBR to shoulder its responsibility and take initiative. Without leadership the initiative would flounder. 55. Measures to harden budget constraints and address the widespread problem of nonpayment had been given priority.” Such measures included actions to overcome institutional and legislative problems, such as inadequate bankruptcy procedures, poor accounting practices and weak corporate governance; improve cash collections by infrastructure monopolies; prevent the government from incurring arrears; and strengthen tax compliance (SEP, paragraphs 50-54). The authorities recognized that state directives suspending bankruptcy procedures and forcing oil deliveries to delinquent customers had been ill-advised, and these directives would be revoked. 56. While acknowledging that calls by senior government offtcials, in the aftermath of the August crisis, for large-scale subsidies had generally not been translated into action, staff expressed concern that such calls had weakened public confidence in the government’s resolve to ensure a hardening of budget constraints. It emphasized that enterprises and banks, mindful of the weak record of policy implementation in this area, were likely to test the authorities’ resolve, and that success would depend on a determined and sustained implementation of policies. 51. Staff expressed concern that utility tariffs were not being adjusted in line with inflation because they were being seen as a means oFcontaining inflationary pressures. The authorities emphasized their commitment to abide by cost-based pricing for the infrastructure monopolies. They also assured St&that recently proposed measures to strengthen price controls, in r2A comprehensive analysis of the problems underlying the widespread incidents of barter and nonpayment is included in the report to be issued on Recent Economic Developments.

They emphasized that the government remained fully committed to a liberal pricing regime and that it had no intention of reintroducing state control of prices. The authorities also explained that the federal regulatory agencies responsible for transport, telecommunications and energy had been incorporated into the new h4inistry for Anti-Monopoly Policy and Support for Entrepreneurship in order to strengthen the enforcement powers of these agencies. The authorities believed that the agencies had previously been too much under the influence of vested interests in the sectors which they were regulating. However, recognizing that the incorporation into the new ministry risked causing an increased politicisation of decision making, the authorities would consult with experts familiar with international practice on rule-based regulatory decision making. 58. The authorities underscored their commitment to continue privatization in the context of already-existing mechanisms. Case-by-case procedures will continue to be used for large enterprises, and the Russian Federal Property Fund will continue to bring to the point of sale the remaining state shares of small- and medium-size enterprises. It is the intention to offer all of these shares for sale before end-September 2000, with half of them to be offered by end- March, 2000. The authorities were concerned, however, that market conditions in the near term would not be conducive to rapid sales, and stressed that actual divestiture would depend on the scope for securing reasonable prices. G. Medium-Term Outlook and Capacity to Repay the Fund 59. The baseline medium-term scenario indicates that Russia will face external financing gaps well beyond the program period, suggesting that exceptional balance of payments financing will be required for several years (Table 11). A primary reason for this is the heavy overall external debt burden. Total scheduled external debt service is projected to average 28 percent of exports of goods and services over the period 1999-2005, before easing to an average of about 14 percent over the following ten years. 60. The baseline scenario assumes that policies of macroeconomic adjustment- especially in the liscal area-will be steadfastly implemented. The scenario incorporates a decisive increase in government revenues as a percentage of GDP and the achievement of substantial primary budget surpluses through 2005. Even with the projected steady increase in the ratio of revenue to GDP over the next five years, scheduled federal government external debt service will amount to almost 60 percent of revenues in the period 2001-05, before falling below 30 percent over the outer years. In addition, the baseline scenario assumes that monetary policy will be geared towards gradually lowering inflation to the levels prevailing in partner countries, and that the authorities will pursue a flexible exchange rate policy. 61. The baseline scenario also rests on the assumption of sustained structural reform, including the rapid rehabilitation of the banking system. This in turn is the foundation for the assumption that, after the recent collapse in investment, gross investment would rise both in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - real terms and as a percentage of GDP, slowly in 2000-01 and then more rapidly. In addition, sustained structural reforms would be expected to increase the effectiveness of capital. This increase in investment, which would underpin a resumption and acceleration of real GDP growth, would be reflected in a contraction of the current account surplus from the very high levels seen this year, to almost balance by 2005 and moderate deficits thereafter. At the same time, however, gradual restoration of access to international financial markets by Russian borrowers would be associated with a sustained swing in net nongovernment capital flows so that the overall balance of payments would move into surplus by 2002. This would enable gross international reserves to increase to the equivalent of more than three months of imports. Reflecting a partial correction to the large real depreciation that took place last year, the ruble is projected to appreciate slowly but steadily in real effective terms, although it is assumed to remain below the average level for 1998 throughout the medium term. The projections also incorporate relatively rapid growth of nontraditional export volumes, reducing Russia’s vulnerability to commodity price downturns, while the terms of trade are assumed to be little changed over the medium term. 62. The baseline scenario is subject to an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty. On the downside, there are substantial political risks bearing on the prospects of policy implementation; the increase in growth and the restoration of market access depicted in the baseline scenario assume sustained and broad-based acceleration of reforms to a degree that stands in stark contrast to the policy record in these areas in recent years. Also, the difficult fiscal situation entails a risk that-even given good policy implementation-the projected steady improvement in net private capital flows will falter or be delayed, as private agents fear that the debt burden may require that tax rates be increased to permit the federal government to service its debt. On the upside, if reforms were to take hold, growth in exports, output, foreign direct investment and other autonomous private capital inflows could turn out to be well above what is assumed in the baseline scenario, as could the speed with which the economy remonetizes. In addition, several factors suggest a potential for high volatility, on both the downside and the upside. In particular, the government’s large external debt burden and the large share of primary commodities in exports make the medium-term outlook very sensitive to assumptions about the real exchange rate and the terms of trade. For instance, government external debt-service payments relative to revenues would be lower by 5% percentage points by 2005 if the ruble were 10 percent more appreciated in real terms than assumed in the baseline scenario. Furthermore, if energy prices were 10 percent higher than those assumed under the program, related export earnings would be about $3 billion higher. 63. The authorities have prepared a number of medium-term scenarios under different assumptions about foreign financing. They draw the conclusion that the external debt situation is likely to be viable only given a substantial element of debt reduction. The main underlying difference between these scenarios and the staffs baseline scenario is that the authorities are much more pessimistic about the growth potential of output and exports and, implicitly, about the reversal of capital flight and the growth of investment. Staff believes that, given satisfactory policy implementation, the assumptions underlying the baseline scenario are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - not unduly optimistic. Moreover, while the external financing gaps under the baseline scenario extend well beyond the program period, they are declining and within what could be covered through traditional sources of exceptional balance of payments support, including flow rescheduling. Thus, while the projections are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and the need for exceptional financing other than traditional flow rescheduling and new loans from bilateral and multilateral official sources can therefore not be t%lly ruled out, staff believes that such a need cannot be clearly established at this juncture. 64. The difftcult situation shown in the baseline medium-term scenario, and the attendant uncertainties, show that the magnitude of the risks to the Fund emphasixed when the Executive Board last considered this issue has not changed substantially since then. It was noted at that time that the fragility of market access and the uncertainty about the timing of an economic recovery meant that only determined program implementation could safeguard the resources that the Fund had committed to Russia.” This assessment remains, on balance, broadly appropriate. On the one hand, since then, the Fund-supported program has derailed, there has been a complete loss of market access and the authorities have been slow to come to grips with underlying problems. As a result, indicators of Russia’s debt service to the Fund have deteriorated. Outstanding obligations to the Fund accounted for 12.4 percent of official external debt at end- 1998, and debt service to the Fund in 1999 represents nearly a quarter of total official external debt service and about 5% percent of exports. On the other hand, the easing of the offtcial debt service burden in the past year, owing to the restructuring of the federal government’s domestic debt and the prospect of new debt relief from official bilateral and commercial creditors, should result in an improved debt-servicing capacity. It may also be noted that, despite the difficult circumstances, Russia has maintained its unblemished payment record to the Fund and other multilateral institutions. Moreover, whereas a substantial increase in Russia’s outstanding use of Fund resources was foreseen at the time of the Board meeting last July, the Fund’s exposure is now projected to decline throughout the period of the arrangement. Provided that the authorities embark on comprehensive reforms along the lines described in the Statement on Economic Policies, the balance of payments situation should be manageable, enabling Russia to continue to service its obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. IV. PRIOR ACTIONS, ACCESS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND PROGRAM REVIEWS 65. The program contains a large number of prior actions, see Table 14. This reflects partly the relatively poor record of policy implementation under past programs, but also the need to strengthen the sustainability of the program through upfront measures in the areas of fiscal policy, bank restructuring, and financial discipline. Reversals of backtracking since last August are also prior actions. Several of the prior actions involved legislation approved by the Duma. ” See EBS/98/120, Supplement 1, pp. 18-19 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4l- 66. The proposed access to Fund resources amounts to SDR 3.3 billion (55.5 percent of quota). The access will be made available in seven equal installments of SDR 471.43 million (Table 15). It is Russia’s intention to request purchases under the arrangement in SDRs and to voluntarily hold them in its SDR account for the sole purpose of meeting obligations to the Fund as they fall due. The first purchase would be made available upon Board approval of the proposed program; remaining purchases will be made available upon observance of quarterly performance criteria and the completion of quarterly program reviews (Table 1 of Annex I, and Annex II). There will be monthly program reviews with the staff 67. Performance criteria are set out in Table 2 of the Memorandum of Economic Policies. To promote prudent and transparent foreign reserve management, foreign reserves held at financial institutions abroad that are wholly or partly owned by the CBR or by Russian nationals or held at subsidiaries of such institutions, have been excluded from the definition of foreign reserves for program purposes. The authorities will continue to report to the stalTon the amount of such excluded assets. Similarly, adjustments have been made to the definition of performance criteria to include under NDA of the CBR credits to domestic borrowers from CBR subsidiaries, funded by or at the direction of the CBR. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 68. The breakdown of the fured exchange rate policy last summer and the economic crisis that ensued were first and foremost due to the failure of the Russian authorities to come to grips with longstanding fiscal problems and to steadfastly implement structural reforms. The persistent high fiscal deficits and the attendant rapid rise in the government’s indebtedness would soon have become unsustainable even if the economic crisis in Asia had not suddenly soured the external environment. The urgency of tackling the fiscal problems has by no means been reduced by the floating of the exchange rate last August; bringing down the deficit remains indispensable to macroeconomic stability in Russia. The lesson of recent years is also that such stability will prove unsustainable without structural reforms. In this regard, the recent output recovery in the wake of the large depreciation of the ruble will undoubtedly fade unless the authorities abandon the hesitant and piecemeal approach that has characterized reform policies to date. The need for Russia to embark on a determined and broad-based acceleration of such policies is as urgent as ever. 69. Against this backdrop, the staffwelcomes the ambitious targets for fiscal policy and structural reform in the government’s new program. While ambitious, the envisaged fiscal adjustment is indispensable to ensure an orderly adjustment to the sharp reduction in external inflows that has resulted from the loss of access to international capital markets. Similarly, while the measures to restructure the banking system and to reinvigorate other parts of the structural reform program might also be far-reaching in scope, the virtual collapse of the banking system has left the government with no other choice, and the reduced availability of foreign savings has heightened the need for a strengthening of domestic resource mobilization and allocation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - Overall, the staffbelieves that the proposed policies and basic objectives are appropriate under current circumstances. 70. It cannot be overlooked, however, that the record of policy implementation under previous Fund-supported programs has generally been disappointing and that many of the key policy measures under the new program have been agreed to but not implemented under past programs. Staffs concerns that the program risks not being implemented as agreed is further increased by the mounting adjustment fatigue and disillusion with reforms in Russia. The continued political turmoil has only heightened these concerns. While the current stance of fiscal and monetary policies and the adoption of prior actions are evidence of support for sound policies, the success of the program hinges on a degree of sustained commitment to such policies that goes much beyond what the authorities have been able to muster in recent years. 71. There is a particular need for stronger and more sustained political support for measures to increase government revenues. The authorities must be mindful that the tax compliance problems are to a large extent rooted in the failure to enforce tax payments by politically intluential enterprises and that the programmed revenue increase will not be achieved without a much more determined effort to enforce statutory tax obligations. Full implementation of the policy of cutting oil pipeline access of tax delinquent oil companies will be a crucial test of the political resolve to enforce tax compliance, as will enforcement of the agreement with Gazprom requiring it to pay a considerably higher share of its statutory obligations. Staff believes that the significant recovery in tax collections since the beginning of the year partly reflects a stronger political willingness to back effective taxation. The success of the program hinges crucially on a continuation of this effort. 72. It is equally important that the authorities avoid renewed recourse to tax offsets. By regularly resorting to this practice towards the end of fiscal years, the authorities have undermined tax compliance as companies have repeatedly built up arrears in expectation of being able to benefit from future offset operations. As expectations of a continuation of this practice are likely to be entrenched, the authorities should expect that it would take some time before a policy of not accepting offsets is reflected in higher revenues. Combined with an increased willingness to initiate bankruptcy procedures and seize assets in the case of tax delinquency, such a policy should, however, eventually lead to a significant improvement in collections. In the meantime, the government should not contemplate further cuts in tax rates. 73. The authorities have made some progress in prioritizing expenditures and controlling commitments by line ministries, although the sharp revenue loss following the crisis of last August overwhelmed their capacity to undertake offsetting expenditure cuts without emergence of arrears. The authorities should now focus on further clarifying spending priorities in the context of the planned comprehensive expenditure review. Looking tinther into the future, there is a need to review the distribution of expenditure obligations and tax revenues between the federal and other levels of government. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-43 - 74. Monetary policy remains burdened by conthcting objectives. The provision of low- interest rate credits to the government and pressure for credits to banks weaken control over reserve money growth and risk jeopardizing the focus of monetary policy on containing inflation. The government must pay a market-determined interest rate on CBR credits, and the CBR should not provide credits to ailing banks not subject to ARCO-supervised restructuring programs. Mounting demands for directed, low-interest CBR credits to politically inlIuential sectors could also jeopardize the focus on inflation control, as could calls for making an early reduction in interest rates a priority of monetary policy. The CBR and the government must resist such pressures, 75. The increase in intlation since last August has caused a marked reduction in money demand, and the CBR’s room for maneuver could be further curtailed in the coming months if the recent political turmoil and the attendant uncertainty about the direction of economic policies lead to a further weakening of such demand. In light of these uncertainties, it is particularly important for the CBR to monitor closely developments in the foreign exchange market, standing ready to tighten monetary policy if pressures in this market are building. The authorities should not, however, resist exchange rate pressures that reflect hmdamental changes in the balance of payments as the staff believes that Russia is best served by a flexible exchange rate policy under the current circumstances. 76. The misreporting of data under previous arrangements is extremely regrettable as it points to a timdamental lack of cooperation on the part of the authorities. Accusations that the CBR has mismanaged foreign reserves, including monies received from the Fund, are also a matter of serious concern. Stafftakes note of the assurances by the CBR’s senior management and the conclusions of outside auditors that there has been no other incidence of misreporting to the Fund. It also notes the assurances that no misappropriation of monies took place either in the handling of the July 1998 tranche under the extended arrangement or through the use of an offshore investment company for foreign reserve management. 77. The authorities must introduce without delay safeguards against misreporting and take measures to alleviate concerns about mismanagement of foreign reserves. The CBR should adhere to prudent and generally accepted standards and procedures for foreign reserve management, ending the practice of holding reserves with its foreign subsidiaries. The staff also believes that the CBR should withdraw from activities that could give rise to conflict of interest, including ownership of commercial banks. It is important that the CBR-to the fullest extent possible-conducts all its operations in an open and transparent manner. This should require, as a first step, full public disclosure of the results of the investigations into the accusations of mismanagement of reserves and into misreporting of reserves. StafT urges the CBR to adopt the SDDS reporting requirements for foreign reserves. 78. While recognizing that the CBR must be held accountable and should consult with Parliamentary oversight committees in accordance with generally accepted procedures, the staff is concerned about initiatives in the Duma to significantly curtail CBR independence. The government must firmly resist such a move, which would represent an extremely serious Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-44- setback to the efforts to put in place the basic policy making institutions of a well functioning market economy. 79. Progress in bank restructuring has been disappointing. Since the collapse of a large number of banks in the aftermath of last August’s crisis, the CBR has made little use of the authority granted to it within the existing legal framework to place ailing banks under administration. This has let? these banks under the control of existing managers and owners, who are widely considered to have engaged in large-scale stripping of remaining assets. This has not only damaged the confidence, in Russia and abroad, in the banking system and the CBR, but has also increased the cost of bank restructuring that eventually will have to be borne by the budget or by depositors. 80. The intention to give new impetus to the bank restructuring program is, therefore, much welcomed. The new bank restructuring law approved by the Duma will strengthen the position of the newly-established ARCO. Moreover, the decision to withdraw licences and initiate bankruptcy procedures for six large Moscow-based banks is an important signal of a renewed resolve to tackle problems, notwithstanding the fact that some of these banks might have become little more than empty shells due to asset stripping. Building on these steps, the authorities must proceed to forcefully advance the restructuring process, enforcing sound regulatory policies, withdrawing licences of ailing banks, referring to ARC0 banks to be restructured, and initiating bankruptcy procedures against those insolvent banks that are not selected for restructuring. In this regard, notwithstanding the recent bank closures, staff is concerned that claims by ailing banks that they are in protracted discussions with foreign creditors on voluntary restructuring remain a way of delaying timely CBR intervention. Staff also believes that the authorities must be much more determined in seeking a reversal, to the fullest extent possible within the law, of the asset stripping that has taken place. At the very least, the authorities should carefully consider whether the owners and managers of banks whose assets have been stripped are tit and proper owners and managers of other banks. Finally, to engender broad political resolve behind bank restructuring, all official agents-the government, the CBR, and ARCO-must be willing to shoulder their share of responsibility to move the process forward in an expeditious manner. 81. The authorities are to be commended for not returning to interventionist policies and large-scale support for ailing, nonbank enterprises, despite numerous calls for such policies from senior officials--including in government policy statements-since last August. There has, on the other hand, been little progress in Luther liberalization of the economy and in restructuring ailing enterprises, and there has been some reversal of past progress in these and other areas, in particular enforcement of bankruptcy procedures, regulation of infrastructure monopolies, and trade policy. It is a matter of urgency that all restrictions on the initiation of bankruptcy procedures be lifted. Moreover, while the authorities must give new impetus to a broad range of reforms, staff believes that it is particularly important that they give priority to addressing the pervasive problem of barter and nonpayment.

An early restoration of access to international capital markets is crucial if Russia is to avoid undue balance of payments constraints in the coming years. An important first step must be orderly and cooperative rescheduling agreements with the Paris and London Clubs, taking into account the principle of comparable treatment of creditors. Staff supports the decision to leave negotiations on nonsovereign debt to bilateral discussions between creditors and debtors, but this strategy could hamper a normalization of creditor relations if recourse to legal means, including bankruptcy procedures, is not perceived to be timely and fair. 83. The authorities have requested rescheduling of most debt service payments due in 1999 and 2000 on Soviet-era debt. Staff projections suggest that such a rescheduling, in combination with exceptional balance of payment support from the Fund, the World Bank, and Japan, would be sufficient to ensure overall balance of payment equilibrium in 1999 and, on current projections, in 2000. StaE also takes note of the fact that, on the strength of an appropriately tight monetary policy, the CBR has managed to protect its foreign reserves while servicing Russian-era debt in recent months. This being said, medium-term projections suggest that a comprehensive program will require exceptional balance of payments support for a period that goes well beyond the horizon of the proposed program. The gaps are, however, relatively small in light of the existing vehicles for providing such support, though there are considerable uncertainties both on the up and downside. 84. Under the proposed program, the Fund would be providing access to its resources despite the fact that Russia is in arrears to private creditors. As early Fund support is considered essential for the success&d implementation of Russia’s adjustment program, and in view of the authorities’ intention to pursue appropriate policies and seek a collaborative agreement with creditors, such lending could be deemed appropriate. It should also be noted that all purchases under the agreement will be subject to financing reviews until such time as the arrears have been eliminated. 85. Staffwelcomes the decision to unify the interbank market for foreign exchange, as well as the commitment to abolish, before the completion of the first program review, the deposit requirement for prepaid imports. It supports the request for technical assistance from the Fund to help the authorities develop more effective and less intrusive means for preventing illegitimate capital outflows. In view of the need to stem pressures on reserves, stafTis not .opposed to the temporary maintenance of some form of the restrictions on the convertibility of balances held in nonresidents’ S- and T-accounts, and on the repatriation of ruble balances of nonresidents who have not accepted the GKO-OF2 novation offer. In the absence of a time- bound plan for the removal of these restrictions, however, staff cannot formally recommend their approval. In addition, staff does not recommend approval of restrictions regarding advance import payments to residents of Latvia, and the use of a more depreciated value of the ruble for repatriation of funds in nonresidents’ S-accounts. The authorities should expeditiously formulate a time-bound plan for the removal of all remaining restrictions. Staffwelcomes the decision to give priority to trade liberalization, but urges the authorities to eliminate the preferential treatment of domestic cars under the tax on luxury cars.

Against a backdrop of negative developments in the statistical system, the authorities have taken some steps to strengthen statistical reporting. The staff urges the authorities to promptly take measures to enhance the availability of timely and comprehensive economic data, and to accelerate the passage of a Statistical Law adequate to provide the framework for systemic improvements in the future. Finally, the authorities should ensure that the apparent lower priority given to the statistical agency in the recent reorganization does not affect future data integrity and transparency. 87. The past record of policy implementation and the heightened risk of setbacks in the run- up to next year’s election suggest that there are considerable risks to the program. On the other hand, the basic strategy of the program is generally in line with polices that the Fund has been advocating in the past, adjusted as needed for changes that have occurred in the external environment. Furthermore, Russia is largely cut off from international capital markets, and can no longer rely on external financing to delay much needed fiscal adjustment. This may justify a somewhat greater optimism on implementation than has been the case in the past. Recent policy performance and the implementation of up-front measures are also encouraging. On balance, the staff considers the program to be deserving of Fund support. 88. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

PROPOSED DECISIONS The following draft decisions are proposed for adoption by the Executive Board A. 1999 Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Russian Federation’s exchange measures subject to approval under Article VIII, in light of the 1999 Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in EBS/99/124, the Russian Federation imposes restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions which are subject to approval under Article VIII. In the circumstances of the Russian Federation, the Fund grants approval of the restrictions arising from (i) a minimum waiting period imposed upon the convertibility of balances held in nonresident ruble “s” accounts, (ii) limitations imposed upon the convertibility of current proceeds held in nonresident ruble “T” accounts; and (iii) limitations imposed upon the convertibility of current proceeds of GKO/OFZ bonds held by nonresidents who did not participate in the GKO/OFZ novation. Approval for the retention of these measures is granted until July - 2000, or the completion of the next Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation, whichever is earlier.

Exchange rate arrangement: The exchange rate of the ruble is determined in the interbank market and the over-the-counter markets. On August 17, 1998, the Government and the CBR announced that the exchange rate will be maintained within a band of rubles 6.0 to 9.5 per U.S. dollar for the remainder of 1998. The official rate would be defined on the basis of the daily outcomes in the exchange and over-the-counter markets. The ruble was, however, subsequently allowed to float beyond the band and the official exchange rate has recently been set equal to the weighted average rate in the SELT electronic trading system. VIII. Article IV consultations: Russia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last consultation was concluded on May 16, 1997. IX.

The onset of the crisis in August 1998 had an immediate, significant deleterious impact on project implementation-for example through freezing of Special Accounts and lines of credit, reduced repayment capacity of final borrowers, including local governments, and weakened availability of counterpart funds. Consequently, overall performance of the portfolio (percent of projects rated “satisfactory”) has slipped to 54 percent at the time of the last review in November 1998 from 78 percent at end-July 1998. Average monthly project disbursements during the IZmonth period ending June 1999 were $30 million. The Bank is currently discussing its prospective program in Russia for FY 2000-01 with the Government of the Russian Federation in the context of a new Country Assistance Strategy This strategy is expected to be discussed by the IBRD’s Board of Executive Directors in late August 1999. At present, the bank is operating under an interim plan discussed by the Bank’s Directors in December 1998, the key elements of which include: l Policy advice and technical assistance onfinancial sector restructuring. Advice and assistance, financed in part by restructuring the Financial Institution Development Project (FIDP), is being provided in partnership with IMF/MAE with regard to the establishment of a legal framework that is conducive to sound future development of banking, and for audits of banks to ascertain their condition and suitability for restructuring. The Bank is continuing to coordinate with EU, EBRD, and bilateral donors. * Addressing social issues. To assist in responding to the crisis, the Bank is at the government’s request: (i) continuing with the Social Protection Implementation Loan (SPIL) and, in particular, accelerating the extension of targeting tools piloted under that project to more regions of the country; (ii) recalibrating the third tranche of the Social Protection Adjustment Loan (SPAL); (iii) developing a new operation that would provide targeted assistance to the most needy under crisis conditions; (iv) standing ready to finance an emergency purchase of essential drugs if needed; and (v) accelerating the preparation of high priority social sector projects. l Intensive follow-up to the results of the special Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR). IBRD project portfolio performance deteriorated sharply in the aftermath of the August crisis. After reaching agreement with the Government on the results of the CPPR, the Bank and government are implementing a joint action plan for improving portfolio performance. l Revisiting the Agenda for Structural Reform The Bank has maintained an intensive dialogue with the government on structural and sectoral development since the August 1998 crisis. This has recently culminated in agreement on the restructuring of adjustment operations (SAL3, SPAL, and Coal SECALII) what were in implementation. These Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - APPENDIX II proposed restructured operations will be submitted shortly to the IBRD Board for its consideration. l Continue preparation of projects currently in pipeline. Preparation of selected, high priority investment operations for possible Bank investment lending or guarantee financing is being maintained. l Emphasize strengthening ofpublic resource management. A diagnostic, survey analysis is underway to document current practices, identify weaknesses in systems for ensuring that public Rmds management and public administration are conducted honestly and efficiently, and propose remedies in current policies, systems and procedures to eliminate these weaknesses. Remedial actions could in time be supported through lending or provision of Ruther technical assistance. This will also be a principal topic of the public expenditure analysis and management analytical work now beginning. The Government has also requested a loan to strengthen the Treasury management system, on which work is now beginning. In view of serious concerns about the efficiency and transparency of use of public sector resources, work in this area is expected to feature prominently in the Bank Group’s Russia program for the foreseeable future. As of May 3 1, 1999. IFC’s portfolio held amounted to $256 million and comprised investments in financial ($54 million or 21 percent of total portfolio), manufacturing ($46 million or 18 percent), oil, gas, and mining ($40 million or 16 percent), timber, pulp, and paper ($37 million or 16 percent), industrial and consumer services ($3 1 million or 12 percent), infrastructure ($28 million or 11 percent), cement and construction ($13 million or 5 percent) and food and agribusiness ($8 million or 3 percent) sectors. The August 1998 crisis negatively impacted IFC’s existing portfolio, particularly in the financial sector. IFC’s loan loss reserves are 27 percent of the disbursed portfolio and equity loss reserves are 65 percent of the disbursed portfolio. The Corporation’s main priority in the medium term will be intensive supervision of its existing project portfolio aimed at helping its investee companies through restructuring and possible follow-up investments. The Corporation will continue to seek to work with Russian partners in projects where IFC can encourage high standards of governance, transparency, accounting, and management. Technical assistance will continue to play an important role in IFC’s development strategy and it will be provided in those areas where the new Government has demonstrated a commitment to reform, and where donor financing remains available. The 13 projects currently being implemented under the technical assistance program focus on small and medium enterprise development with an emphasis on privatizing and restructuring enterprises, developing legal and regulatory frameworks, strengthening and building institutions and creating an investment friendly environment. Given the need to improve investor confidence, FIAS tentatively plans (depending on the availability of financing) to expand its program of assisting subnational governments in improving the FDI climate. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIX II Since the extent to which IFC will be able to generate new investments depends on sponsors interest in investing in Russia, IFC expects its investment activity to be limited to those areas where foreign investors see strong comparative advantages and lower country risks, i.e., mostly export-oriented projects, particularly in natural resource-based industries. In the financial markets area, IFC will target investments focussed on institution building with strong technical assistance components and, where possible, foreign sponsors. Financial sector institutions and instruments that IFC will seek to develop will comprise trade finance, insurance, housing finance, insurance and leasing. IFC will also consider follow-on investments in support of portfolio companies, provided that other shareholders are willing to co-invest and that the new investment is financially attractive. MIGA’s portfolio in Russia consists of 15 contracts of guarantee for a Maximum Aggregate Liability of slightly over $350 million. MIGA has received, and is still receiving, large numbers of applications for Russia. MIGA currently has 93 preliminary applications with a total investment potential of $12 billion pending. MIGA is currently accepting new applications for Russia. Coverage is provided for Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, War and Civil Disturbance, and Breach of Contract on a case-by- case basis. MIGA recently executed two projects, one in mining and one in manufacturing, for a total amount of $58 million. Another project, in agribusiness sector, in the amount of $24 million, is currently being underwritten. MIGA has never received any claims in Russia. MIGA did obtain a waiver from the Russian Government with respect to the Moratorium of the Central Bank on capital transactions (August 15-November 15, 1998). Transfers of funds by clients who had MIGA coverage during the period of the Moratorium were executed without delay. MIGA’s total guarantee capacity for Russia, taking into consideration the Treaty Reinsurance Agreement, is $620 million, and its per-project capacity is $200 million.

State and private enterprise activities are measured through forms sent to firms included in enterprise registers, with sample surveys increasingly replacing full-count collections. Although the enterprise registers have been expanded, the reporting system remains oriented to medium and large former state enterprises, and includes little coverage of new private-sector firms, which are typically small. The authorities are generally cooperative in reporting to the Fund, mainly through the resident representative office and missions, Data are transferred on a timely basis, albeit with a few exceptions. Russia produces a wide range of regular, timely publications on financial and economic statistics. The authorities report data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics, Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. An IMF Resident Statistical Advisor continues to assist the Russian authorities in improving macroeconomic statistics. Also, an EUfIacis advisor assists the Russian Statistics Agency (RSA), which took over the tlmctions of the former national statistical agency-the Statistical Committee of the Russian Federation (Goskomstat)-on May 25, 1999. National Accounts RSA compiles and publishes cumulative quarterly and annual national accounts data on a regular, timely basis, based on the 1993 System of National Accounts. Source data are obtained from surveys of businesses and households, supplemented by reports from other agencies. There has been much effort to improve coverage, but the basic data are widely considered to substantially understate economic activity. However, other problems with the national accounts sources and methods may have an offsetting effect on the estimates of GDP, and there is no hard evidence at hand to conclude that, on balance, they result in a systematic bias in the official GDP estimates. The official estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) incorporate approximate adjustments for gaps in coverage and for under-recording-based in part on surveys of informal markets and comparisons of different statistics-amounting to around 20 percent of GDP. The production-based estimates of GDP are considered more reliable than those derived from expenditure and income approaches, but the differences between the production and expenditure approaches are generally no more than 5 percent. More effort would be desirable to improve the data collections according to national accounts concepts, data items, and classifications, and to expand the coverage. Institutional sector data are also needed. The delay in finalizing a modem statistics law-requiring firms to provide data and with realistic penalties for noncompliance, together with a guarantee of confidentiality-is an impediment to the lurther improvement of the national accounts data. Prices RSA compiles a good quality national consumer price index, developed with Fund technical assistance. With the substantial reduction in inflation since 1996, the full index is now only calculated on a monthly basis, with weekly estimates based on a limited number of items. Further Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX III improvements could be made on the basis of a new household budget survey, under consideration for some time, and from current efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal items in the index and to standardize specifications of items. World Bank and Tacis assistance will be used in these areas. RSA also publishes a producer price index, The State Customs Committee has initiated the development of foreign trade indexes, Government Finance Statistics The staffis provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and financing of the federal and local governments, but adjustments are needed to render the data analytically useful Monthly data classified by economic type and comprehensive data on extrabudgetary funds are not published. The published timctional classification of expenditure differs from international standards. No regular data are published on domestic or external federal debt. The statistical capabilities of the Ministry of Finance need strengthening to meet these deficiencies. Monetary Statistics Monetary data are reasonably comprehensive and generally in accordance with international standards. The new plans of accounts that were introduced in the beginning of 1998 for the central bank and commercial banks are fairly adequate for the compilation of analytically sound monetary statistics directly from accounting records. Nevertheless, the recent money and banking statistics mission made recommendations on several important methodological issues that have not been properly addressed in the compilation of monetary data, such as the appropriate treatment of(i) the repurchase agreement operations with nonresidents; (ii) accounts of insolvent banks with revoked licenses; and (iii) foreign-owned banks operating in the Russian Federation and branches of Russian commercial banks that are officially licensed abroad and carry out regular banking activities, Analytical accounts for the monetary authorities and commercial banks are reported for publication in IFS with a lag of one month. Timely interest rate data are available. Balance of Payments Statistics In cooperation with the Fund, significant progress has been made with regard to balance of payments statistics. More detailed data have been published, a RSA survey of trade in services has begun to provide data, the compilation of data on private sector debt has improved markedly, and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has published an international investment position for the banking sector. The quality of statistics, however, still has limitations and requires improvements, in particular as regards coverage and reliability. Efforts would need to be made to improve the coverage of nonbank corporate sector debt (including off-balance-sheet obligations). Moreover, it would be desirable to post data on private and regional government debt on the CBR website, as is done with government debt, The coverage and quality of data on private debt service and capital movements also need to be improved. Merchandise imports data published by Customs are subject to large adjustments for under recording, especially for “shuttle trade” by individuals. Accurate measurement of the large trade credit items is difficult and improvements are needed in the “passport” source data compiled by Customs, which relate trade flows to actual receipts and payments. The new services survey has Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 51- APPENDIX III improved measurement in this area, but is subject to coverage and reporting problems. Large, persistent differences between partner country and customs data on imports remain, although statistical agencies are seeking to reconcile the data with those of partner countries, Income data on direct and other foreign investment need improvement. With respect to private investment, indirect measurement suggests that a considerable unrecorded amount of investment has occurred in the past five years. Deficiencies also exist in measuring travel (there is no survey in this area), in the reporting of short-term capital flows, and in official external debt data. The CBR has developed a high standard of technical expertise in balance of payments compilation and a Russian expert has been appointed to a committee advising the Fund in this field. Special Data Dissemination Standard The authorities have indicated that they do not intend to subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. Staff is urging them to reconsider this position.

Washington, D.C. 2043 1 U.S.A. Dear Mr. Camdessus: The objectives and policies of Russia’s economic program for 1999, and the broad goals for 2000, are set out in the attached Statement on Economic Policies, which has been endorsed by the Government of the Russian Federation and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). The program aims, in the wake of our economic crisis of August 1998, to restore macroeconomic stability, and lay the foundation for lasting economic growth and improvement in the well-being of Russia’s citizens. On the basis of this program, we are requesting Fund support in the form of a 17 month stand-by arrangement in an amount equal to SDR 3.3 billion, or 55.5 percent of quota. Purchases under the arrangement will be subject to quarterly reviews and quarterly performance criteria covering fiscal and monetary policy as well as external borrowing. These performance criteria are set out in the attached Table 1, and described in greater detail in the Memorandum of Definitions. The first quarterly review under the arrangement will assess the 2000 budget. In addition, it will assess the monetary program in light of overall economic developments and review financing assurances under the program. In the structural area, progress in bank restructuring and in improving cash collections of infrastructure monopolies will be emphasised. The second quarterly review will set quantitative targets for the year 2000, and, on the structural side, will focus in particular on bank restructuring, improvements in tax administration and enhanced control over expenditure commitments. Financing assurances under the program will also be reviewed. Since a number of measures specified under previous programs supported by the Fund were not implemented, the government and the CBR have, prior to Board consideration of the program, put in place a critical mass of significant measures aimed at pursuing our broad agenda, a number of which required Duma approval. In particular, as we are committed to ensuring that fiscal policy is implemented in a manner that is transparent and consistent with the program’s fiscal targets, we have ensured adoption by the Duma of legislation necessary to implement the fiscal program and of all revenue measures described in the Statement. In addition, we have enacted legislation required for bank restructuring. We believe these actions clearly demonstrate the broad political commitment to the economic program necessary for successful implementation.

INTRODUCTION 1. This memorandum sets out the economic objectives and policies for 1999 of the Government of the Russian Federation and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). The economic program described below is aimed at overcoming the negative economic and social consequences of the economic crisis that arose in August 1998, restoring macroeconomic stability, and laying the basis for sustainable economic growth, financial and external viability, and the full integration of Russia in the world economy. 2. The economic reforms pursued since 1992 have achieved a number of positive results. First, the liberalization of prices and external trade, along with enterprise privatization, has helped create a market-oriented economy in Russia. In addition, efforts were made to bring Russian laws into correspondence with the requirements of a modern economy. Finally, macroeconomic stabilization measures succeeded in bringing inflation under control from extremely high levels. 3. Despite these achievements, however, the government has been unable to successfully address the underlying fiscal imbalance, setting the stage for the August crisis. The erosion of federal government revenue, and especially cash payments, made a durable fiscal consolidation and sustainable macroeconomic stabilization impossible. The continued fiscal imbalance led, in turn, to an excessive reliance on external borrowing and lefl the Russian economy extremely vulnerable to changes in world commodities and financial markets. Moreover, the continued absence of hard budget constraints throughout the economy contributed to the rapid spread of the nonpayment problem, limiting the possibilities for economic growth and severely complicating efforts of the government to collect tax revenue in cash. 4. We readily acknowledge that these fundamental elements of the crisis reflect, in part, the fact that implementation of the government’s economic program, over the past several years, has been incomplete. Further, in certain respects, weak implementation has served to worsen structural problems. In particular, the inability of the government to enforce cash payment of statutory tax liabilities and to pay its own bills in a timely fashion has played a significant role in the spread of the nonpayment problem. Moreover, potential benefits from reforms, most significantly privatization, have been diminished owing to the absence of transparency in the process and a failure to ensure that economic gains were broadly distributed among the population, and this has served to dampen public support for the reform process in general. 5. Given the inability to advance structural reform and fiscal adjustment, the macroeconomic strategy followed since 1996 of combining fixed exchange rates with a heavy reliance on external borrowing proved unsustainable. While such a policy stance did allow Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 78 - ATTACHMENT earlier inflation improvements to be prolonged into mid-1998, sharp reductions in the world prices of key Russian exports, along with the significant spillover effects from the Asian economic crisis beginning in mid-1997, eventually brought this tenuous stability to an end. On August 17, faced with dwindling reserves despite dramatic increases in interest rates, the government announced a series of emergency measures, including a de facto devaluation of the ruble, a restructuring of ruble-denominated government debt falling due before December 3 1, 1999, and a 90-day moratorium on private sector payments on external liabilities. The most immediate impact of these measures was the insolvency of much of the banking sector. Interbank transactions virtually ceased, and the payments system was paralyzed, contributing to a sharp contraction in output. Meanwhile, driven by the depreciation of the ruble, inflation rose sharply, reaching 38 percent for the month of September. 6. Since the events of August, the authorities have generally pursued cautious financial policies, aimed at reducing pressures on prices and the exchange rate and restoring confidence in the government. Inflation has fallen sharply, to 3 percent per month in March and April 1999, while the decline in output has been arrested. In addition, the government has formulated a bank restructuring plan, and has made efforts to strengthen the social orientation of the adjustment, including by ensuring timely payment of wages and pensions and through the clearance of budgetary arrears, Nevertheless, we recognize that a durable solution to the serious economic difficulties facing Russia requires a more comprehensive economic program addressing the underlying fscal problems and providing for the implementation of wide- ranging market reforms, while devoting special attention to increasing support for the reform process. II. ~MACROECONOMI~A~FII~ANC~LPOLICIES A. Basic Strategy and Objectives 7. The government’s ultimate objective is to generate sustainable economic growth, and enhance the well-being of the Russian population. To achieve this goal, we aim to develop, over the medium term, an efficient market economy, supported by a limited but effective public sector, and operating in an environment of macroeconomic stability and external and financial viability. The program for this year, as detailed below, will clearly move us only part way toward realizing this vision. However, in the present very difficult economic circumstances, it represents an important step forward, and sets the stage for further progress in the coming years. 8. Our program for 1999 seeks to move Russia toward these goals through progress in four main areas: . First, we are tightening substantially our fiscal stance, through both increased revenue collection and compression of noninterest spending. To ensure that this fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 79 - ATTACHMENT adjustment is a lasting one, the government will take steps to improve tax administration, eliminate unproductive expenditures, and enhance spending control . Second, we will pursue broad-based structural reforms needed to strengthen the basic elements of a market economy, and to eliminate Iimdamental bottlenecks to economic grow&To a large extent, this requires that we effectively implement policies planned over the past several years, including those aimed at encouraging economic restructuring and addressing the problem of nonpayment throughout the economy. Solving these problems will require the imposition of hard budget constraints, focusing initially on key sectors, but eventually throughout the economy. In addition, in the wake of the August crisis, the government and the CBR must take rapid action on bank restructuring to provide the basis for a banking system that can firhill the financial intermediation needs of a market economy. We are implementing a comprehensive plan, within the context of the limited resources available for public support, focused on the rehabilitation of a core group of banks identified by transparent and objective criteria and the liquidation of a large number of nonviable banks. . Third, monetary policy will be conducted in the context of a flexible exchange rate policy and will be geared to reducing inflation. . Finally, in conjunction with our adjustment efforts, we are seeking an orderly restructuring of external debt accumulated prior to January 1, 1992, based on cooperative relations with, and comparable treatment of, our creditors. While we would wish to avoid the fbrther accumulation of debt and the need for continued balance-of-payments assistance, this will only be possible over the medium term. However, we maintain the firm intention of servicing all external debt accumulated after January 1, 1992. 9. On the strength of this policy package, the program targets a decline in the 12-month inflation rate to 50 percent by December 1999. The external current account is programmed to improve by about 8 percent of GDP, owing mainly to a sharp compression in imports, while gross reserves are programmed to remain broadly unchanged. Real GDP is expected to contract by about 2 percent for the year as a whole. Policies for 2000, which will be specified in greater detail later, will aim at further significant fiscal adjustment, a reduction in inflation, and an end to negative economic growth. 10. The program for 1999 contains many elements of previous economic programs of the Russian Government and the CBR-including those supported by the 1996 extended arrangement from the Fund and the 1998 extension of the arrangement, including the SRF and CCFF facilities-that were not always implemented on a sustained basis. The government and the CBR intend to fully implement these earlier specitied measures now. We believe that the broad political support that exists in the federal assembly for our economic program augurs Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 80 - ATTACHMENT well for our ability to implement policies. The up-front implementation of the key measures listed in Table 2 will provide evidence of the strong political resolve behind our program. B. Fiscal Policy 11. The fiscal stance envisaged for 1999 is consistent with a steady reduction in inflationary pressures, and with a move, over the medium term, to financial and external viability. The program targets a federal government primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP, compared with a primary deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP last year. This major fiscal adjustment is based on a substantial rise in cash revenue collection and a significant reduction in real noninterest spending. As interest payments (on a commitments basis) will rise sharply in 1999, the overall deficit ofthe federal government would fall only from 5.9 percent of GDP to 5.1 percent of GDP. The deficit of the enlarged government is expected to be 5.1 percent of GDP as well. 12. While the fiscal adjustment envisaged represents an important step toward achieving financial viability, the government recognizes that further efforts will be required over the medium term to allow a durable solution to the underlying fiscal imbalance. In this regard, we are aiming to reinvigorate our program to improve tax administration, and to build on our efforts initiated in 1998 to reduce unproductive expenditure and improve expenditure management. At the same time, steps will be taken to place the finances of the Pension Fund on a sound footing and to rationalize federal-regional fiscal relations. We are planning a further significant increase in the federal government primary surplus in 2000. Revenue collection and tax policy 13. The fiscal adjustment planned for 1999 includes an increase in cash revenue of nearly 3 percent of GDP. Efforts to increase revenues of the federal government will take a two-pronged approach. First, in order to close the fiscal gap in 1999, a number of tax measures will be implemented, aimed primarily at increasing taxation of consumption and at capturing some of the windfall gains to exporters owing to the large depreciation of the ruble since August 1998. Second, the government will implement measures aimed at improving taxpayer compliance, including several steps envisaged under previous programs, which will lay the foundation for improved collections in 1999 and beyond, and set the stage for an eventual reduction in the high statutory rates for direct taxes and the elimination of a number of particularly inefficient taxes. 14. Underlying our efforts to improve revenue collection will be an end to the widespread use of tax offsets and ad hoc negotiated tax payments. In support of this step, the government will achieve passage in the Federation Council of amendments which remove from the Budget Code those articles permitting offsets. Abstaining from any form of tax offset arrangements will be a continuous performance criterion under the 1999 program. Further, the government will not, under any circumstances, conduct a tax amnesty. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-81 - ATTACHMENT 15. The government has adopted a package of revenue measures for 1999 which aims to raise 1% percent of GDP. The 1999 budget provides for the transfer of 3 percentage points of the personal income tax to the federal government, which will generate % percent of GDP in revenue and an increase of land- and water resource-related tax rates, which will increase collections by an additional 0.2 percent of GDP. In addition, given our overriding need to generate revenue, an export tax on oil, petrochemicals, timber, ferrous and nonferrous metals and other commodities has been introduced on a temporary basis, which is expected to generate about 0.6 percent of GDP in revenue this year. Additional revenue of 0.4 percent of GDP will be raised through the adoption of a number of measures to improve tax legislation, including the introduction of an annual tax on luxury automobiles; reduction of preferential (10 percent) VAT taxation; and enhancing administrative control over production and sale of alcoholic products. Finally, we will forego any reductions in the VAT rate until tax compliance has shown a durable improvement, and at least until January 1, 2000. In this regard the President has vetoed the law putting the VAT rate reduction in place as of July 1, 1999. 16. A number of changes in the tax law will aid in revenue collection. We have reduced the number of tax preferences, including some tax exemptions for closed administrative territories In order to further strengthen the tax system, the draft 2000 budget will contain a provision mandating the transfer of federal taxes collected in closed territories to the federal budget-which will automatically eliminate the possibility for closed territories to provide exemptions on these taxes-with corresponding compensation to the territories from the federal budget. In addition, the government will take additional administrative measures by September 30, 1999 to limit the application of these exemptions in 1999. Finally, we will restore the implementation of the gas excise tax on an accruals basis. 17. We are revitahzing our efforts to enhance tax administration. Central to this program has been the passage of amendments to Part I of the Tax Code, in order to address a number of important deficiencies in the current Tax Code. Among the changes introduced are those: increasing the powers of the tax authorities by eliminating the need for the Ministry of Taxation to use the already over-burdened court system and giving them the ability to issue hens on bank accounts of delinquent taxpayers; introducing legal sanctions against tax agents who fail to deposit withheld taxes into government accounts in a timely fashion; eliminating the ceiling on total interest accruals on overdue taxes, as well as the ceiling on the interest rate; extending deadlines for collection orders; and introducing stronger penalties and sanctions for failure to file tax invoices, tiling of false invoices, or bookkeeping practices in violation of the law. 18. The government intends to increase its efforts to reduce tax arrears in the energy sector. The government has introduced individual schedules for each oil company to move progressively to full payment of taxes in cash in compliance with the law of the Russian Federation beginning from November 1999 and for Gazprom to do the same from July 2000. Until conventional tax administration proves fully effective and at least until the end of 1999 the government is taking an extraordinary short-term measure, starting with the monthly Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 82 - ATTACHMENT allocations for June 1999, to permit access to the export oil pipeline transport system only for oil companies, which themselves-or whose holding company and all affiliates thereof that have any significant commercial relationship with the oil companies in question-have no arrears of scheduled federal tax obligations arising on or atIer April 1, 1999. Any company with such federal tax arrears outstanding at the beginning of the month in which export pipeline allocations for the following month are determined will be denied access to export pipeline capacity for the entirety of the month in question. Pipeline access will not be limited by the government for any other reason unrelated to normal technical requirements and payment compliance as set out in oil transportation contracts. Pre-April, 1999 tax arrears will be cleared by December 3 1, 1999. 19. In addition, to reduce the current very high level of tax arrears throughout the economy, we will intensify efforts to establish effective collection processes, and to initiate asset seizures and bankruptcy actions in appropriate cases; take action to impose sanctions, provided under the Criminal Code, on enterprise managers contributing to noncompliance; and redirect our tax examination program to focus on cases with maximum potential revenue yield. By end-1999, we will recover at least Rub 8 billion in tax arrears for the federal budget other than in the oil and gas sectors, based on tax examinations. Finally, we will take all necessary steps to make the Federal Debt Center-set up in 1998 to sell assets seized from tax debtors-fully operational, including the passage of a government resolution clarifying that it has an exclusive right to sell attached property. 20. The government intends to support the implementation of recently-established plans in the Ministry of Taxation (MOT) that are designed to improve its ability to control the affairs of taxpayers whose business activities span several regions, and to achieve efficiency gains through a program of work consolidation initiatives, The government is also committed to strengthening control over and monitoring of the largest taxpayers. Toward this end, it will take steps to effectively implement the core system of large taxpayer inspectorates to deal with the largest taxpayers on a consolidated basis, and will ensure that the units are adequately funded and staffed, and are provided the necessary legal authority to conduct their work, direct taxpayers to file returns, and specify where tax payments will be made. 21. Steps have also been taken to improve customs collections. To enhance coverage of shuttle trade, we have imposed a mandatory customs inspection for all importers declaring customs payments below a specified threshold per kilogram. In addition, the possibility for tax-exempt imports of cars has been eliminated, with privileges for certain groups of citizens and for cars clearing customs in Belarus removed. In order to reduce losses to the federal budget, the government will, by July 10, 1999, adopt a resolution increasing the list of commodities whose duty-free importation into Kaliningrad is subject to quotas, The government will do everything within its power to ensure that a federal law eliminating excise and VAT exemptions for goods imported to Kaliningrad is adopted by end-1999. 22. In recent years, the federal government has received a decreasing share of revenues from collections of taxes defined as federal in Part I of the Tax Code, while the federal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 83 - ATTACHMENT government’s share of total tax arrears has been growing at a rapid rate. To address this issue, we will take several steps. Beginning with the 2001 budget, we will reflect sharing of federal taxes with the regions as an expenditure item, and will execute all such sharing through the federal treasury. Further, in the context of the 2001 budget, we will adopt a single rate of revenue assignment for shared federal taxes, to limit the scope for regions to abuse the revenue-sharing arrangement and to allow simplification of the tax payment process. Expenditure policy and management 23. Fiscal adjustment in 1999 and beyond will rest to a significant degree on substantial reductions in real spending as well as enhanced control of expenditure commitments to avoid a new buildup of budgetary arrears. The 1999 budget foresees a reduction in noninterest spending to 9.6 percent of GDP, a decline of 2 percent of GDP compared with 1998, implying large reductions in real spending. The government is concerned that these cuts will not be sustainable over the medium term, and is therefore undertaking a concerted effort to identify and eliminate inefficient or unproductive expenditure programs. 24. To this end, the government began to implement already in 1998 a comprehensive expenditure reduction plan, including substantial downsizing and organizational reform in the public sector. The number of federal executive authorities and other legal entities that are first-tier recipients of federal money declined from 132 at the beginning of last year to 106 in the 1999 budget. In addition, the number of positions in the federal executive authorities was reduced during 1998 by about 79,000 or 19 percent, and additional reductions in employment have also been seen in transport, education, and health care. We will continue progress in these areas in 1999. As a first step we have prepared an analysis of the impact of the expenditure reduction plan in 1998, and a program for continued expenditure rationalization in 1999. This program includes substantial further reductions of 41,000, or 12 percent, in the number of public employees. In addition the government will take steps to control the off- budget assets of budgetary institutions; undertake an audit and reduction in the number of federal programs; complete the registry of federal government real estate; and introduce norms for assessing social programs. A new federal commission has been established to examine options for further streamlining the civil service, and it is anticipated that this will result in a further reduction in the number of federal agencies. The government is committed as well to conducting a public expenditure review during 1999, covering at least the health and education sectors. 25. To enhance control over spending commitments, our plan to transfer all federal budgetary entities to the Treasury will be put in place. The operations of the Employment Fund will be brought under Treasury control by December 3 1, 1999, the operations of the Road Fund by December 3 1, 1999, and the operations of all other earmarked budget tunds by June 30, 1999. Budgetary recipients of the Ministry of Defense will be included within the Treasury by June 30,ZOOO and, to this end, a second pilot project for extending Treasury control over second and third-tier military expenditures was approved and launched at end-April 1999; and a program for modernization of the Ministry of Defense accounting Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 84 - ATTACHMENT system, fully compatible with that used in other government agencies, will be approved and fully implemented with execution of the 2000 budget. In addition, the government will refrain from setting up transit accounts for tax revenues, outside the Treasury. Further, the government will implement a system of pre-approval of all federal contracts, and all obligations lacking such approval will be declared invalid. This preapproval will rely on a reporting system monitoring the amount of registered contracts against budget limits on an ongoing basis, with all contracts that exceed federal budget spending limits being denied. Finally, all budgetary arrears from previous years will be verified in 1999 and measures to restructure these arrears will be proposed. 26. We are concerned that cuts in spending fall heavily on the poorest segments of the population, notably pensioners. Proceeds of the sale of humanitarian assistance will be used for the clearance of pension arrears (see paragraph 29, below). The repayment of all pension arrears from previous years will limit the fall in actual cash payments to pensioners to 25 percent in real terms in 1999. In order to lessen the hardship on the poorest pensioners, the government has granted an increase of Rub 60 per pensioner to the lowest income pensioners (those with a pension less than Rub 300 per month). The government will, however, clearly have to make allowances for larger increases next year, especially for minimum pensions, offset by savings in other spending areas. Social funds and regional governments 27. The effort to address the fiscal imbalance in Russia will also need to encompass the social funds and subnational governments. To help ensure financial sustainability of the Pension Fund (PF), the government will avoid any indexation or general increases in benefits that cannot be fully financed by PF revenues, including allocations from the federal budget. In order to increase the rate of payroll tax collections, we will restructure tax arrears and provide incentives for early repayment, with particular attention to the largest enterprises. Steps will also be taken to improve the efftciency of expenditures by the Social Insurance Fund (SIF). The government will introduce legislation to the Duma limiting expenditures under the Social insurance Fund to sick and maternity benefits effective January 1,2000, and specifying that, effective January 1, 2000, sick benefits for the first three days of illness will be paid by the employer. To offset this increase in cost for employers, the government will submit to the Duma, by August 3 1, 1999, legislation to reduce the payroll tax contribution to the SIF from 5.4 to 4.4 percent. In addition, beginning January 1, 2000 the centralized portion of the SIF’s resources (currently about 20 percent) will be ti.dly managed through the Federal Treasury system. 28. With regard to federal-regional relations, the government will begin to implement measures aimed at improving tax collection, eliminating unfunded mandates, promoting equitable treatment of regions, and encouraging structural reforms. To this end, by October 3 1, 1999 the government will establish the necessary details and legislation to support the Concept Paper on Subnational Fiscal Reform, which provides conceptual guidelines for the reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations. In addition, the government intends to adopt Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 85 - ATTACHMENT an improved formula for allocating transfers to regions, to take account more t%lly of the revenue-raising potential and expenditure needs of regions, which will be implemented in the context of the 2000 budget, The system of regional transfers will be made subject to greater conditionality, in particular on the nonaccumulation of arrears on wages, payroll taxes, and utility payments. 29. About 0.5 percent of GDP in federal expenditure savings in 1999 is expected to arise from the repayment of federal loans by regional budgets and transfers from regions of proceeds from humanitarian aid to finance the payment of pension arrears. This is an area in which results have fallen far short of targets in the past. We intend to enforce these repayments by withholding transfers and VAT-sharing payments to regional governments that are delinquent in making payments, In this context, we have established a monthly payment schedule by region, and have begun to implement this mechanism to enforce repayments. Within the context of this schedule, we expect to collect at least Rub 1. I billion in repayments on budgetary lending to regions by end-April, Rub 2.2 billion in repayments on budgetary lending to regions by end-May, and Rub 0.3 billion in humanitarian aid proceeds by end-June. We will provide monthly reports to the Fund on compliance with the payment schedules. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 30. Monetary policy will be conducted in the context of a flexible exchange rate policy, guided primarily by the evolution of reserve money. However, the assessment of reserve money is subject to particular uncertainty in the current economic environment, due to uncertainty concerning the demand for bank liquidity as bank restructuring is initiated and the interbank market starts functioning again, and about developments in the demand for money as individuals gain access to deposits in banks subject to restructuring. Under these circumstances, developments in the foreign exchange market will provide a particularly important indicator of the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance. The CBR will, accordingly, closely monitor developments in this market and stand ready to tighten reserve money growth, through a reduction in net domestic assets, in the event that pressures are observed. 31. The monetary program for 1999 is based on the assumption that velocity will tend to rise somewhat during 1999 as individuals gain access to their deposits in restructured banks while confidence in policies takes hold only over time. It also takes into account the impact on the money multiplier of the sharp increase in aggregate liquidity over recent months, with a large rise in hanks’ free reserves at the CBR and in households’ holdings of currency. The CBR will not, during 1999, provide rediscounting of promissory notes, or engage in targeted lending to specific sectors of the economy, including through earmarked lending to commercial banks. Furthermore, the CBR will provide no new rehabilitation loans or otherwise provide long-term credit to insolvent banks. The quarterly program reviews, and monthly monitoring, will provide the opportunity to review on a regular basis the appropriateness of the monetary program. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 86 - ATTACHMENT 32. While inflation has declined to monthly rates of 34 percent in February and March, developments in late March-when the injection of a small amount of liquidity led to strong pressures on the exchange rate and prices-indicate the precariousness of the situation. Further, the continued large balances of commercial banks at the CBR represent an additional potential source of pressure on prices and the exchange rate; for this reason we will be widely using operations to attract deposits from commercial banks at the regional level. The CBR is, however, currently constrained in its choice of instruments with which to mop up excess liquidity. Amendments to the CBR law will be enacted by July 15, 1999, whereby the issuances, volumes, and pricing of OBRs is left entirely to the CBR’s discretion. The authorities will continue to review the range of monetary policy instruments available to the CBR to achieve the monetary policy objectives and develop them further as need arises. Also, the restructuring of government debt has left commercial banks without short-term instruments to manage liquidity. With a view to correcting this problem, the CBR and h4JCEX will jointly set up an interbank repo market. Finally, the draft 2000 Budget Law will contain provisions for interest payments at market rates on CBR credit extended after July 1, 1999. 33. The exchange rate will be market determined; with the CBR’s interventions solely guided by macroeconomic policy consideration, and with a view only to smoothing fluctuations in the rate. The CBR, in cooperation with h4JCEX and other organized currency exchanges, will also ensure that participation in the foreign exchange market is competitive and that the exchange rate is not being manipulated by private parties. 34. The foreign exchange market was unified on June 29, 1999. All other remaining foreign exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII will be eliminated during the period of the program. With respect to the recently-introduced deposit requirement for prepayment of imports, exemptions have already been introduced for clearly valid imports, such as those financed by letters of credit, and a market rate of interest will be paid on deposits. The requirement for deposits will be eliminated by September 30, 1999. In the meantime, we will put in place the necessary legal amendments and institutional mechanisms to allow the authorities to detect and punish illegal capital flows through fake import contracts without preventing normal trade activity, Also the prohibition on foreign exchange purchases with ruble balances in correspondent accounts of foreign banks was eliminated on June 30, 1999. In addition, during the period of the program, the Russian Federation will not impose or intensify any exchange restrictions, introduce or modify any multiple currency practices, conclude any bilateral payments arrangements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Funds Articles, or impose or intensify any import restrictions for balance of payments purposes. We will consult with Fund staff before introducing modifications or amendments to the implementation of the system of capital controls. 35. The CBR will continue to increase the transparency of its own operations and will put in place requirements to increase the transparency of commercial banks. The policy of announcing weekly data on Russia’s gold and external reserves and on base money was begun in June 1998. The annual 1998 audit of the CBR by an international auditing firm was completed in May 1999 with a special focus on the financial relations between the CBR and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 87 - ATTACHMENT commercial banks owned by the CBR both abroad and in Russia. Comprehensive annual audits of the CBR will continue to be conducted in compliance with the deadlines established in the Law on the Central Bank The investigation of the relationship between the CBR and FJMACO, of the reporting to the Fund under previous arrangements arising from the financial relations between the CBR and commercial banks owned by the CBR, both abroad and in Russia, as well as the handling of the July 1998 Fund purchase will be completed by July 10, 1999. The results of these investigations will be made public. The CBR will seek the adoption of amendments to the Law On Banks and Banking to require lending institutions to make annual public disclosure of banks’ key financial indicators, such as capital adequacy ratios and provisions against bad assets, and income statements to be introduced by December 3 1, 1999 for fiscal year 1999; to have annual accounts prepared and audited by a qualified firm; and to publish quarterly reports, The CBR will continue to publish summary information on the financial situation of the largest banks on a monthly basis. D. Debt and Foreign Trade Issues 36. As a result of the August crisis, with the attendant loss of access to international capital markets, Russia is currently unable to meet in full its scheduled obligations to external and domestic creditors. Total external debt of the federal government now stands at about $150 billion, or 90 percent of GDP, and the government’s scheduled external debt service is projected to amount to about 90 percent of federal budget revenues, well beyond any realistic threshold for repayment capacity. The government is therefore seeking debt relief. 37. Action has already been taken to restructure domestically-issued debt. In December 1998, following discussions with investors, the government announced a novation of the GKOs and OFZs on which payments were frozen as of August 17, 1998; in the course of the novation period 95 percent of domestic holders restructured their portfolios, and the corresponding number of nonresident holders was 88.5 percent. We will continue to make best efforts to reach agreement with the remaining holders of these securities. Where agreement cannot be reached, we will honor obligations according to the original terms, although the transferability of proceeds from such payments will be subject to restrictions. 38. Russia will also honor its other obligations to external creditors. Our debt servicing difficulties are expected to continue for several years. Accordingly, we are seeking a rescheduling on debt-service obligations on external debt accumulated prior to January 1, 1992, the effective Paris Club cutoff date for debt of the former Soviet Union, while paying in full obligations accumulated by Russia since then. In preparation for this rescheduling, the government has been in close contact with its creditors and has expressed its intention to undertake the negotiations on debt rescheduling in a cooperative environment, with due attention to comparable treatment of creditors. 39. The government remains committed to a liberalized trade regime. Since the August crisis, however, we have had to implement a number of measures, including the imposition of some export taxes, to address the government’s difficult fiscal position. We intend to review Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 88 - ATTACHMENT and abolish these measures as soon as Russia’s financial conditions permit. In the meantime, the government is committed not to impose new quantitative restrictions on international trade. Furthermore, to accelerate Russia’s integration in the global economy, in 1999, the government will continue negotiations toward WTO accession, and will ensure that any new trade restrictions would be fully consistent with WTO rules. 40. The government will take a number of important steps to further liberalize the trade and foreign investment regimes, many of which are being supported by the World Bank SAL3: (1) ad valorem tariffs on approximately 75 tariff lines will be lowered from 30 percent to 20 percent during each quarter of 1999; (2) specific duties on 80 tariff lines will be reduced during each of the years 1999 and 2000; and (3) the total number of exemptions from import tariffs specified in the law On Customs Tariffs will be reduced substantially in each of the years 1999 and 2000. Moreover, to help ease bureaucratic impediments to foreign trade, the authorities will take steps by September 30, 1999 to eliminate the fimctions of the Federal Service for Foreign Currency and Export Control (VEK) that duplicate the Rmctions of the various government ministries, the CBR, and Ministry of Taxation. In order to eschew quantitative control of exports the government will also modify Government Resolution #I 55 by removing the mandatory aspect of controls of the quantity and quality of certain exports and by clarifying the voluntary nature of the export contract inspection system. E. Structural Reforms 41. The government recognizes that progress on achieving macroeconomic stability and enabling private sector growth depends critically on a revitalization of the program of structural reforms. To aid in reaching these objectives, we have agreed with the World Bank on a comprehensive program of reforms, in the context of a renewed SAL3. This program focuses on the broad objectives of improving the competitiveness, transparency and accountability of infrastructure monopolies; enhancing the development of the private sector and industrial restructuring; liberalizing the policy regimes governing foreign direct investment and international trade; enhancing fiscal management; and reforming the financial sector. Two specific areas-bank restructuring and measures to deal with the nonpayment problem, in addition to the measures for fiscal structural reform-have been elaborated as critical elements of our structural reform program for support by both the Bank and Fund. Bank restructuring 42. The government’s involuntary restructuring of part of its debt obligations and the devaluation of the ruble in August 1998 undermined the stability and solvency of the banking system, and revealed the fragile financial condition of the banks, notwithstanding the substantial efforts prior to the crisis to lay the legal and regulatory foundation for a market-based banking system. The government is undertaking, as a priority, the restructuring of the banking system in line with the recommendations of the joint lMF/World Bank team that has been assisting us. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 89 - ATTACHMENT 43. The current legislative framework for bank restructuring and bank liquidation represents a major roadblock in our efforts to reconstitute the banking system. Therefore, we are, as a matter of the highest priority, developing a more suitable legal framework. In this context, we will enact, by July 15, 1999, a self-standing Bank Restructuring Law as well as, by October 3 1, 1999, amendments to the Law on the Central Bank and the Civil Code. These legal changes will strengthen the ability of the authorities to write down the capital of banks, empower and regulate the activities of the Agency for Restructuring of Credit Organizations (ARCO), and ensure that sales of all bank assets by ARC0 will be conducted in a transparent manner. In particular, the Bank Restructuring Law will contain the following elements: (1) banks can be referred to ARC0 only by a directive of the CBR on the basis of specific criteria; (2) ARC0 will be empowered to assess the viability of a bank referred to it and will have fill authority to refuse acceptance of any referred bank; (3) where current owners are unsuitable or unwilling to invest new capital in the bank, plans for restructuring will include the write-down of shareholder value, the disenfranchisement of current shareholders, and regulatory seizure and assumption of full control over the bank by ARCO; (4) the law will provide an equitable and transparent mechanism under which creditor write-downs can be imposed; (5) ARC0 will be empowered to restructure a bank as it deems necessary in the interests of the depositors and creditors (including the creation of a new bank and transfer of assets and household deposits to the new bank); and (6) ARC0 will have the power to seek to repudiate contracts and the undoing of affiliate transactions and transactions for inadequate value or made with intent to defraud depositors and creditors of the insolvent bank. Under no circumstances will current shareholders retain preferential rights to resume ownership of the bank after restructuring is completed. 44. The Government of the Russian Federation will adopt necessary normative acts which will provide limited guarantees on household deposits in commercial banks which are subject to liquidation, Measures on transfer of deposits from commercial banks to be closed to other banks will be supported by providing these banks with the equivalent amount of assets in the form of government securities. 45. The Bank Bankruptcy Law provides standards for the CBR to appoint temporary administrators for banks; gives the CBR the powers to certify receivers for bank bankruptcy and to propose candidates for receivers to the Arbitration Court; and provides an expedited liquidation procedure for banks. However, in order to facilitate the restructuring process, a number of amendments to the current law will be submitted to the Duma by September 30, for enactment by October 3 1, 1999: (1) to require that the temporary administrator remain in place until the bank has been restructured or the CBR revokes the license and the arbitration court appoints an arbitration receiver in a bankruptcy proceeding; (2) to provide that ARC0 will be appointed arbitration receiver for banks it controls; and (3) to incorporate a capital insolvency definition as grounds for bank bankruptcy. Further, the general Bankruptcy Law will be amended to provide that any transaction made for inadequate value or made with the intent to defraud a bank, its creditors, the CBR or ARCO, can be undone (and that if the asset has been conveyed to a good faith purchaser, then the proceeds can be recovered), and to provide that sales of bank assets will be conducted by open tender or other fully transparent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 90 - ATTACHMENT manner determined by the liquidator to maximize value. Finally, the Civil Code, the Law on Pledge, and the general Bankruptcy Law will be amended to strengthen the rights of secured creditors to recover promptly and liquidate collateral. 46. In order to deepen the bank restructuring process, the CBR will, on an ongoing basis, use all powers granted to it to limit the activities of banks in poor condition, promote restructuring efforts, and revoke the licenses of insolvent banks. The CBR has identified from among the eighteen banks which were the subject of the 1998-99 financial review those which are insolvent and do not have the potential to prepare and implement successful restructuring plans, and revoked their banking licenses, and will initiate bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings against them shortly. For the remaining insolvent hanks, the CBR will (i) immediately appoint temporary administrators for these banks, and (ii) refer these banks to ARCO. Within three months of the referral of any bank to ARCO, the Agency will determine for each of these banks whether they will be accepted for restructuring or should be immediately liquidated. With respect to those banks to be liquidated, the CBR will revoke their banking licenses and initiate bankruptcy/liquidation proceedings in accordance with the Federal Law on Insolvency of Credit Organizations. With respect to those banks to be restructured, ARC0 will have sole responsibility for preparing, approving, and implementing of detailed restructuring plans developed according to an internationally accepted format. 41. ARC0 will have the sole responsibility for the restructuring of banks that receive public hmds for recapitalization. The CBR will, as a matter of principle, provide liquidity support only through its existing regular facilities (Lombard credit, overnight credit, intra-day credit, and repos), when fully collateralized, and only to solvent hanks or banks implementing restructuring plans approved by ARCO. 48. Sberbank is the largest bank in Russia and will continue playing a key role in the country’s payment system. With this in mind (i) a detailed assessment of the financial condition of the institution, including its branch network will be carried out, and (ii) on this basis, an analytical report on Sberbank’s development strategy, which will also recommend actions (including tirewalls between management, state and CBR with regard to the bank’s day to day operations) to establish a level playing field for Sberbank to operate in a competitive environment, will be prepared. Terms of reference for financial review will be finalized by July 15, 1999, and the review will be completed by October 3 1, 1999. Terms of reference for the analytical report will be finalized by July, 3 1, 1999, work will begin by October 3 1, 1999 and the report will be completed by March 3 1, 2000. The CBR and the government will prepare a business strategy for the development of the bank by May 3 I, 2000. 49. Draft amendments to the Law on Banks and Banking Activity have been submitted to the Duma, with a view to enactment by October 3 1, 1999 to provide that appropriate governance structures and fit and proper rules are applied stringently to bank shareholders and management when applying for approval of new bank licenses or for transfer or continuation of bank licenses in a restructured institution. Associated CBR regulations will also be amended by that date. The CBR will also establish revised and tightened fit and proper criteria Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT for the licensing of banks. ‘These will include changes in the calculation of initial capital, elimination of cross-holdings as a source of capital, consideration of the viability of the bank’s business plan, and assessment of the transparency of corporate shareholder groups. These criteria will be applied to any shareholder with more than S percent direct or indirect ownership in the bank or who otherwise may be deemed to be able to exercise a comparable degree of influence in the bank’s activities. On the basis of this test, and consistent with best international practice in defining fit and proper critera for bank owners, such shareholders having contributed to the insolvency of a bank shall be barred from continued ownership of any bank. Addressing the nonpayment problem 50. Our effort to deal with the growing problem of nonpayment is based on the enforcement of hard budget constraints throughout the economy, and follows four broad tracks. To a significant degree, this will require the effective implementation of policies developed in the context of previous economic programs supported by the Fund and World Bank. First, as discussed above, we seek to improve tax compliance, and will take a number of structural measures in this regard, including denying access to the oil pipeline for enterprises with tax arrears, and levying the gas excise tax on an accruals basis. Second, we will move to ensure that the government meets its own spending obligations. Third, we are committed to improving cash collections by infrastructure monopolies, which play a central role in sustaining the nonpayments chain. Finally, we will strengthen bankruptcy legislation and its implementation, and ensure that the government plays a full role in the bankruptcy process. 51. With regard to government fultillment of its spending obligations, we will ensure that there are no new arrears incurred by the federal government in 1999, and that budgetary expenditures are fully executed in cash, including for the consumption of energy by budgetary organizations. Further, the government will pass all enabling regulations to implement a mechanism by which federal financial assistance to regions can be adjusted depending on compliance with a number of requirements, including schedules to eliminate the outstanding stock of payroll tax and wage arrears; maintenance of wage arrears at 30 days or less of the current wage-bill; maintenance of payroll tax arrears at one month or less of average monthly liabilities; incentives for payments by households for utilities; and the gradual phasing out of offsets. The government will take all necessary measures to maintain accounts payable by the federal government and its related agencies to infrastructure monopolies of no more than 30 days sales equivalent. 52. The government is committed to reduce domestic noncash payments and arrears in the int?astructure monopoly sector. Toward this end, we have ceased state directives to oil companies to supply nonpaying refineries, and will not issue further such directives for any deliveries without an agreed contract between suppliers and buyers. There will be no state orders for delivery except against cash payment or an agreed contract between buyer and seller. In addition, the government will reduce the list of “strategic” companies to which supply may not be terminated. To !%ther increase collections, procedures for termination of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 92 - ATTACHMENT supply to nonpaying consumers will be clarified and simplified, and suppliers will be indemnified against the consequences of legally implemented termination of service. Reflecting these measures, we have set quarterly targets for 1999 for cash collections as a share of total sales in each of these sectors. These require, for electric power, district heating, and natural gas, an increase to 25 percent by the end of the second quarter of 1999,35 percent by the end of the third quarter, and 40 percent by end-year. For freight service provided by the railways, increases to 52 percent, 60 percent and 65 percent are required for the last three quarters of the year. 53. The existence of an adequate bankruptcy law and the ability to employ it when necessary is perhaps the fundamental element underlying the enforcement of hard budget constraints. To enhance the efficacy of the bankruptcy process, the government has confirmed its commitment to make full use of such procedures and, to this effect, will rescind the government directive of January 27, 1999, to cease initiating bankruptcy proceedings against tax debtors. Further, except for the banking sector, the gavernment will refrain from submitting to the State Duma draft laws which envisage special bankruptcy terms for any type of debtor, and will ensure the independent status of the Federal Insolvency and Financial Rehabilitation Service (FIFRS) and take measures to complete its staffing. 54. To address shortcomings of the current Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy), the government has submitted to the Duma with a view to ensuring passage by October 3 1, 1999, of amendments to eliminate the bias in the law towards reorganization rather than liquidation of enterprises, eliminate court discretion in overruling the creditors’ decision to liquidate the debtor enterprise; and provide for the participation of the state in bankruptcy proceedings at all stages where relevant for the protection of the public interest. The amendments will also provide a legislative basis for creditors to utilize bankruptcy procedures in a special accelerated manner, including faster introduction of external management of enterprises under bankruptcy. Finally, to enhance the incentive of managers to maintain solvency of their enterprises and to abide by the Law on Insolvency, the government will submit to the State Duma, by November 30, 1999, a draft law providing for increased personal financial liability and management disqualification for improper conduct by management resulting in the insolvency of enterprises managed by them. 55. Effective reform will, as indicated earlier, require improved governance and enhanced transparency. We have outlined above steps to improve the transparency of the CBR and the banking system, and have presented plans to bring all federal government operations under the treasury, which will serve to make activities of the public sector more transparent. In our view, this effort should be extended to the rest of the public sector and natural monopolies. To this end, by September 30, 1999, contracts will be awarded for the execution of financial management reviews, leading to annual audits, carried out in line with international auditing standards, of the Pension Fund, Social Insurance Fund, Medical Insurance Fund and the Road Fund In addition, the government will issue a decision requiring Gazprom, RAO UES, the Railways, and Transneft to prepare and publish on a quarterly basis financial accounts consistent with the International Accounting Standards (IAS), commencing with accounts for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 93 - ATTACHMENT the first quarter of 2000. Further, the consolidated IAS financial accounts of Gazprom, RAO UES Rossii, and Transnefi are to be audited by independent qualified auditors in accordance with international auditing standards and published annually by June 30 of the following year, starting with the financial accounts for 1998. The same will be done for the Railways starting with 1999 financial accounts. F. Program Monitoring and Disclosure of Economic and Financial Information 56. The Government of the Russian Federation and the CBR are aware of the importance of public disclosure of information in restoring market confidence in economic policy and promoting greater public awareness of the choice of economic policy options, Clearly the timely publication of comprehensive economic and financial data which characterize the status of the real sector of the economy, government finance, the banking sector, and financial markets plays a key role in IXilling this objective. In addition to the weekly publication of reserves data mentioned in paragraph 35, the CBR places an increasingly large amount of regular data on its website and through its bulletins and statements. Likewise the Ministry of Finance maintains an active website which will include this statement. Moreover, during 1999 a number of steps will be taken to improve current practices for compiling. and in line with the guidelines under the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard, publishing these data. 57. The Government of the Russian Federation and the CBR will provide the IMF with the information needed to monitor the implementation of the program in accordance with the timetable established in the agreed Memorandum of Definitions, as well as other information that may be needed to monitor adequately financial and economic developments in Russia. Monitoring the program will be part of the responsibilities of the Government of the Russian Federation and the CBR. Monthly indicative targets have been established under the program and will be assessed in conjunction with IMF staff, Furthermore, the implementation of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies and related structural issues under the program as well as macroeconomic and financial developments will be monitored jointly by the Russian authorities and the IMF staff on a continuing basis, Id ISI S.
