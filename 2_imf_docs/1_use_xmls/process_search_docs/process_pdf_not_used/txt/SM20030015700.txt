The staff team comprised J.E. De Vrijer (head), B. Zavoico, M. Farahbaksh, M. Pani (all EU2), and B. Joshi (PDR). G. Kostina, the office manager of the IMF Office in Tashkent, assisted the mission. F. Zurbrugg, Executive Director for Uzbekistan, and S. Vafaev, assistant to the Executive Director for Uzbekistan, participated in some of the meetings. Staff from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank also joined some of the discussions as observers. 1 The team met with Deputy Prime Ministers Azimov, Ganiev, and Usmanov, Presidential Advisor ~ Golishev, Minister of Finance Nurmuradov, Chairman of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) Mulladjanov, and other senior officials, members of parliament, and representatives of the business and diplomatic communities. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation with Uzbekistan on March 8, 2002, Executive Directors welcomed the policy dialogue with the Fund that resulted in agreement on a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) in January 2002. Directors urged the authorities to fully implement the SMP so as to address the Uzbek economy’s main problems, including high inflation and a heavy external debt burden. In particular, Directors encouraged a rapid liberalization of the foreign exchange market supported by tight macroeconomic policies. Directors urged the authorities to undertake a strengthening of the financial system, including by eliminating directed credits, and pushing ahead with reforms in the agricultural sector. Directors also called for an early resolution of data issues to provide a credible basis for possible future Fund financial support. Uzbekistan continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, but no longer maintains exchange restrictions under those transitional arrangements. Uzbekistan’s foreign exchange system was again reviewed by staff in September 2002 and, although that review is still on-going, it identified a number of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices which Uzbekistan should eliminate before it accepts the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4. Uzbekistan has not sought, and staff does not recommend, approval of those exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices. Uzbekistan’s relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix I. Relations with other international financial institutions are summarized in Appendix II, and statistical issues are addressed in Appendix III.

The economic situation in 2002 remained difficult as growth declined and imports were compressed. Progress was made with a number of key measures envisaged under the Staff Monitored Program (SMP), including the gradual liberalization of access to foreign exchange and the introduction of reforms in agriculture. However, decisive further action is still needed to fully implement these reforms. Moreover, heavy restrictions on external and domestic trade were imposed from mid-2002 that ran counter to the authorities’ undertakings under the SMP to progressively open up the economy. The government’s economic program for 2003 contains positive elements but a fundamental change is needed in the authorities’ strategy of closely regulating and controlling economic activity. Under current policies, the outlook for 2003 is a further decline in economic growth and continued high inflation. With political will, the liberalization of the foreign exchange market can be accomplished in the course of 2003. This would require the prompt removal of any remaining undue obstacles to access to the OTC market and for the CBU to sell cash foreign exchange to banks to fully satisfy demand. In addition, the government should take all steps necessary to move to acceptance of Article Vlll, Sections 2,3 and 4. The authorities are urged to reconsider their approach to trade regulation and to dismantle the most harmful restrictions, including re-opening the borders with neighboring countries, streamlining the tariff schedule, lowering non-tariff barriers, and removing obstacles to easy entry and competition in domestic trade. This would also contribute to improved regional cooperation. Tight fiscal and monetary policies need to be maintained. In the fiscal area, corrective measures are needed in light of the expected shortfall in external assistance, compared with the 2003 budget. Such measures would include cutting non-priority outlays, refraining from further wage increases in 2003, and limiting support to enterprises under financial stress. Central bank lending to the government should be strictly limited. The CBU’s increased reliance on indirect policy instruments is welcome, and the refinance rate should be kept under close watch to ensure that it remains positive in real terms. Decisive implementation of structural reforms remains a priority. It is particularly important to improve the business climate by reducing government interference, fully implement the planned reforms of state procurement in agriculture, strengthen financial intermediation, and improve the financial situation of the energy sector. The authorities are encouraged to step up their efforts to improve Uzbekistan’s statistical database and increase the transparency of economic policy making.

Since Uzbekistan became independent in September 1991, only limited progress has been made in the transition to a market economy. Despite a relatively generous endowment of energy and mineral resources, which could have eased the move to a more open trade and foreign exchange regime, the authorities have remained hesitant in allowing market forces to determine key economic outcomes. 2. The Uzbek authorities have pursued an economic strategy based on import- substitution and extensive state control over the economy. State enterprises were supported by directed and/or government-guaranteed credits and through the multiple exchange rate system, using resources obtained from the state procurement system for cotton and grain, low energy prices, and a state monopoly on gold production. Ambitious external borrowing brought the external debt-to-GDP ratio from less than 20 percent in 1996 to 60 percent by end-2001.’ Real GDP growth during 1996-2001 was in the order of 2% 4 percent per annum, but the failure to move toward a market economy resulted in sizable efficiency losses, a decline in living standards, and the entrenchment of vested interests.2 Thus, Uzbekistan did not benefit from the pick-up in growth enjoyed by most other CIS countries in recent years (Figure 1). Loose monetary and fiscal policies resulted in consumer price inflation, as estimated by staff, in the range of 40-60 percent per annum during the period 1996-200 1, well above the average in other CIS countries. The external current account deficit was kept in check by import quotas and restricted access to foreign exchange. 3. The authorities began to reconsider their economic strategy in 2000 as it became apparent that the state enterprise sector was not on a path to self-sustaining profitability and the amount of external borrowing required under this strategy would result in an unsustainable debt build-up. Taking advantage of the post-September 11 international interest and improved security in the region, the authorities, in consultation with staff, elaborated a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in early 2002, which covered the period January 1,2002- August 3 1,2002, and aimed at stabilizing the economy and accelerating the transition to a market economy. ’ Measured at the indicative exchange rate, which is calculated as a weighted average of the official exchange rate, the over-the-counter (OTC) rate, the cash market rate, and the curb market rate. 2 Based on staff estimates. Per capita GDP in U.S. dollars is estimated to have dropped from about $500 in 1996 to some $300 in 2001.

II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTS 4. Uzbekistan has exhibited considerable political stability in recent years and the composition of the government has changed little. The presidential term was extended from five to seven years in the January 2002 national referendum, which also approved the creation of a bicameral parliament. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December 2004, and the next presidential election for December 2006. In the run-up to the EBFUI Annual Meetings to be held this year in Tashkent (May 5-6), there has been renewed international focus on Uzbekistan’s human rights record. 5. Although progress was made in implementing some key SMP measures during 2002 and early 2003, there were also major setbacks and overall performance was uneven (Box 1). The authorities adhered to tight fiscal and monetary policies, gradually improved access to foreign exchange, and introduced reforms in agriculture. However, contrary to their undertakings under the SMP, they also put in place wide-ranging trade restrictions which offset the benefits of the reforms that had been implemented, cast serious doubt on the authorities’ commitment to liberalize the economy, and thwarted the provision of external financial support, including from the Fund.

Further severe restrictions have been imposed. Statistical agency established, but data problems remain. 11 The staff monitored program covered the period January 1,2002-August 3 1,2002. 6. The economic situation in 2002 remained worrisome. While according to official statistics real GDP growth continued at a rate of 4 percent in 2002, staff estimated that it fell to about 3 percent (Table 1). The positive impact of a bumper grain harvest because of favorable weather was more than offset by a contraction of trade activity as a result of heavy restrictions imposed during the second half of the year. Both official data and alternative estimates indicate a drop in annual consumer price inflation in 2002, to 21 percent according to official data and to 27 percent according to staff estimates. Monetary tightening and an appreciation of the curb market exchange rate helped moderate price pressures.3 Divergences between official data and staff estimates for real GDP growth and consumer price inflation were substantially reduced during 2002, but reappeared at year-end (Box 2). 3 The increase in the GDP deflator remained at a rate of some 45 percent in 2002, reflecting the impact on producer prices of the significant devaluation of the OTC market exchange rate of 40 percent during the year, and the effect of cotton and gold export price increases. The evolution of consumer prices is mostly affected by changes in the curb market exchange rate, which appreciated by about 17% percent during 2002.

Uzbekistan: Divergences Between Official Real GDP and CPI Data and Staff Estimates Over the past few years, the official statistics on real GDP and the consumer price index (CPI) have suffered from a number of problems that hampered an accurate assessment of economic developments. These problems related to technical shortcomings in compilation and to the politically sensitive nature of statistics in Uzbekistan. While these divergencies were significantly reduced during the first three quarters of 2002, they re-emerged during the last quarter of the year (see table). In view of the weaknesses of official CPI, the IMF resident representative office and UN staff have for several years collected price data for a number of key food items in Tashkent and two other regions (which make up about 70 percent of the CPI basket). These indices generally show much larger price increases than the food component of the official price index. In the alternative CPI calculation, the food component in the official index is replaced with a weighted average of the alternative food price indices. In September 2002, the authorities presented staff with new CPI estimates for the first eight months of 2002. The revised indices showed a cumulative inflation of 14.1 percent, compared with the official CPI increase of 6.8 percent reported earlier. On the basis of the revised official CPI, cumulative inflation was reported at 17.4 percent over the first nine months of 2002, compared with an alternative estimate of 20.3 percent. The staff accepted the new official CPI for the first nine months of 2002. However, the gap between the official and alternative estimates of the CPI widened again in the fourth quarter.

The external current account in 2002 is estimated to have turned into a surplus of 23/4 percent of GDP from a deficit of 1% percent in 200 1, as a result of a strong compression of imports, lower-than-expected interest payments, and the receipt of grants, mainly from the United States (Figure 2). Exports other than of cotton and gold declined considerably due to the very restrictive business environment, despite a real effective exchange rate depreciation of 9 percent (Figure 3). Foreign direct investment decreased further from its already low level in 2001. As a result of the authorities’ conservative external borrowing policy in 2002 and limited access to new credits, the debt stock was contained and the total external debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 60 percent at end-2001 to 55 percent at Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 0 -1000 Figure 2.

External debt service payments also declined to 23% percent of exports of goods and services in 2002 from almost 26 percent in 200 1. The overall balance of payments strengthened considerably, and gross international reserves increased by some $200 million to $1.2 billion (equivalent to almost 5 % months of imports) .4 8. Progress was made in liberalizing the foreign exchange regime in 2002 and early 2003, but restrictions have remained. The spread between the curb market and the over- the-counter (OTC) market exchange rates was reduced from about 120 percent in early January 2002, to below 30 percent by end-December 2002, and further to below 10 percent by mid-April 2003 (Figures 4 and 5a). The decline of the spread in early 2003 in part reflected the negative impact of external trade restrictions on the demand for foreign exchange. Transaction volumes on the cash market increased since mid-2002 (Figure 5b), but lines at exchange bureaus indicate continued rationing of cash foreign exchange, and police investigations of exchange bureau clients have also deterred public access. Steps were taken to open access to foreign exchange on the OTC market, but there were still delays in the pre-registration of import contracts and in obtaining conversions through commercial banks. Although a number of larger enterprises reported that access to foreign exchange had improved, smaller enterprises continued to experience difficulties. As a result, transaction volumes on the OTC market in 2002 did not increase as expected. 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 4co 200 0 Figure 4.

From mid-2002, a large number of measures were put in place to restrain imports of consumer goods and regulate domestic wholesale and retail markets (Box 3 and Annex I). These included a sharp increase in effective external tariff rates and in non- tariff barriers; prohibitive re-licensing requirements for and restrictions on the operations of domestic traders; the temporary closing of markets; and the prohibition of external trade in consumer goods through commodity exchanges.5 Shortages of consumer goods led Uzbek consumers to cross into neighboring countries to purchase needed supplies. In response, the authorities closed the borders with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic for non-official traffic at end-December 2002. In February 2003, the government instructed two trading companies (one of which had been the former Ministry of Trade and retained significant state ownership) to improve the operation of wholesale enterprises throughout Uzbekistan, including by promoting domestically produced goods. Box 3. Uzbekistan: Recent Measures Restricting Domestic Trade . Obligatory use of cash registers by individual retailers (Ministry of Justice Registration No. 1169; August 3 1,2002). l Prohibition for natural persons from selling goods imported by others (Ministry of Justice Registration No. 1169; August 3 1,2002). l Requirement for wholesalers to only sell to retailers with cash registers (Cabinet of Minister’s (CM) Resolution No. 295; October 1, 2002). l State interference with line of business of already privatized enterprises and possible reprivatization of enterprises that have changed their business status, creating uncertainties relating to property rights (CM Resolution No. 402; November 26,2002). . Prohibitive licensing requirements for wholesalers, especially high minimum authorized capital and requirement that wholesaler acquire/own warehouse and equipment (CM Resolution No. 407; December 1,2002). l Government interference in the wholesale sector through the activities of two enterprises (Uzbeksavdo and Uzbekbirlashuv; COM Resolution No. 62; February 4,2003). 10. Fiscal policy in 2002 was tighter than foreseen, mainly because of lower-than- expected foreign-financed project lending. The general government deficit rose slightly to 1.8 percent of GDP (original SMP target: 3.6 percent of GDP; Figure 6 and Tables 2 and 3). Tax performance weakened because of lower collection ratios of the profit tax, VAT, and property taxes, largely reflecting changes in tax policy. As of January 1,2002, the base rate of 5 Most of these measures were introduced with short implementation deadlines and with no prior consultation with affected economic agents.

Given a significant shortfall in external project financing compared to the budget projection, the authorities kept total government expenditures in terms of GDP broadly at their 2001 level. Support for externally indebted public enterprises that were hit by the devaluation of the OTC exchange rate was increased (Box 4), while spending on the socio-cultural sector, the social safety net, and centralized investments was curtailed.

Monetary policy was tightened in 2002, in line with the authorities’ objective to lower inflation. Broad money growth was sharply reduced to less than 30 percent from 54 percent in 2001, through a strict control of reserve money growth (Tables 4-6). The CBU made greater use of indirect monetary policy instruments (mainly central bank CDs) in controlling base money growth, and access of the government to CBU financing was strictly limited. CBU lending to commercial banks leveled off in 2002 as its directed credit program was terminated. The CBU increased its refinance rate from 27 percent to 37 percent per annum on January 1,2002, and kept it unchanged through the remainder of the year. As CPI inflation decreased, the refinance rate turned positive in real terms by year-end. 12. Financial intermediation remained inadequate.7 The CBU improved access to cash from bank accounts in the second half of 2002 and the cash emission plan was abolished at year-end. However, problems with cash withdrawals remain despite the ample liquidity of commercial banks, with ease of access varying by region, because of bureaucratic inertia following the formal abolition of the cash emission plan. A deposit insurance scheme was introduced in April 2002. However, the role of banks as financial intermediaries was undermined later in the year by enhanced monitoring of individual transactions in 6 In addition, a reform of teacher salaries in September 2002 led to a 6 percent reduction in the average wage for teachers. 7 For more details of the Uzbek banking system, see the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

Uzbekistan: Financial Support to Enterprises Servicing Government-Guaranteed External Debt Debt service obligations for enterprises with external debt guaranteed by the government were $478 million in 2002 and are projected to reach $574 million in 2003, equivalent to 6.4 percent of GDP (see Chart). ~ In addition, the official exchange rate, at which the enterprises service their foreign debt, has been devalued Chart. External Debt Service Guaranteed by the Government significantly since 2000, increasing the real cost of external debt service. The real official exchange rate, based on the PPI index, was devalued by 25 percent in 400 2001 and by 19 percent in 2002; the 4.0 300 cumulative depreciation since 2000 thus 2.0 200 amounted to about 50 percent. 100 These two effects combined are 0.0 0 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 estimated to have pushed the real cost of debt service in 2002 to about 1% times 0 In percent of GDP (left scale) +ln million US$ (right scale) its 2000 level (see Table). Enterprises with little or no export markets (where higher receipts could offset higher debt service costs) were particularly hard hit. In 2002, the government provided financial support to such enterprises in the amount of $68 million, or 0.7 percent of GDP. This support was provided both through the budgetary Guarantee Fund, used to honor government guarantees when they are called, and through extra-budgetary support in the form of loans under Resolution 423. In total, this support covered 14.3 percent of total government-guaranteed debt service obligations. Table.

Box 5. Uzbekistan: Banking Sector Vulnerability The portfolios of Uzbek commercial banks have deteriorated during the past several years as the balance sheets of many indebted enterprises have been hit by the combination of large devaluations in the OTC exchange rate that started in mid-2000 and the more recent slowdown in the economy. This is reflected in the decline in the proportion of loans classified as “standard” or higher during 2001 and 2002 (see below). Although improvements have been made in bank supervision and risk management at commercial banks, indicators of loan quality may not always reflect actual loan performance. The deterioration in the performance of commercial bank loan assets has been buffered by the substantial share of government-guaranteed credits in their portfolios-at end-December 2002, 73 percent of all loans extended by commercial banks were guaranteed by the government (government-guaranteed loans are automatically classified as being of good quality). Whereas the government has been able to make good on their guarantees on a flow basis, if there is a further deterioration in the balance sheets of these enterprises, the stress on the budget from meeting these debt servicing costs could become severe. If loan portfolios of commercial banks are considered excluding government-guaranteed credits, the deterioration is more pronounced, with the share of loans that are classified “sub-standard” or below increasing from 12 percent at end-2001 to 3 1 percent at end-2002. As these poor performing loans represented about 5 percent of the total commercial bank assets at end-2002, they are a matter of some concern. If the quality of the loan portfolios continues to deteriorate in the period ahead, this could expose the financial health of the banking system to substantial risk.

While the marketing reform in the grain sector was broadly successful, there are signs of difficulties in implementing the planned reforms in the cotton sector. The number of price controls was substantially reduced and utility tariffs were increased by about 60 percent during 2002 in the first phase of a multi-year program to improve cost recovery in the energy sector. However, business confidence was shaken in late-2002, when the government adopted regulations that (i) required privatized retail and service enterprises to request official permission to change their line of business; (ii) threatened to re-privatize enterprises that had changed operations without proper authorization unless they agree with the authorities on corrective actions; and (iii) raised the minimum capital requirement for joint-stock companies to the equivalent of $50,000. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 14. The discussions focused on how to achieve the authorities’ stated goal of increasing economic growth and reducing poverty through accelerating Uzbekistan’s transition to a market economy. The authorities argued that the reform process was well underway in light of the progress made in the implementation of key SMP measures in 2002. Staff acknowledged the progress that had been made but emphasized that decisive action was still needed to fully implement the reforms, and that the stifling trade restrictions imposed from mid-2002 were contrary to the authorities’ undertakings under the SMP and had depressed economic activity. 15. The government’s economic program for 2003 includes a number of positive elements, but assigns an excessive role to the state in directing economic activity. The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to further reduce inflation; accelerate privatization; restructure or liquidate unviable public enterprises; deepen reforms in agriculture; and improve the financial situation in the energy sector. At the same time, the state continues to be given the lead in setting up market institutions and closely regulating economic activity. The authorities believed that concerted implementation of their program would enable reaching two key policy objectives: achieving currency convertibility later in 2003 and accelerating Uzbekistan’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).’ The mission strongly urged the authorities to reconsider their strategy with regard to the role of the state in the economy. In the staffs view, creating an environment in which market forces prevail in the allocation of resources on a level playing field would enable Uzbekistan to better realize its economic potential. ’ Uzbekistan’s accession Working Party was established in December 1994 and its first meeting took place on July 17,2002. The WTO Secretariat is now awaiting a response from Uzbekistan on follow-up questions before convening a second meeting of the Working Party.

In light of the differences of view regarding trade policies and the role of the state in the economy, staff could not reach understandings on specific measures that could pave the way for discussions on a Fund-supported program as envisaged under the SMP. Staff indicated that for this to happen a major reorientation of policies and clear demonstration by the authorities of their commitment to market-based reforms would be necessary. Since the return of the February mission, an active dialogue notably on trade issues, has been maintained. The authorities hope that this dialogue and policy adjustments that may be made in due course could lead to intensification of relations with the Fund at a later stage. A. Outlook for 2003 17. The authorities expected that real GDP growth in 2003 would increase to some 5 percent and annual CPI inflation could decline to 12 percent. Growth was expected to pick up because of a sharp rebound in trade and brisk activity in the construction sector. The reduction in inflation would reflect the continuation of a tight monetary policy and wage restraint. As of May 1,2003, the authorities have granted a wage and pension increase of 20 percent; they had indicated to staff that they would refrain from further wage increases in 2003. 18. Staff considered the government’s growth projection and inflation target for 2003 as optimistic. Under current policies, staff projected real GDP to grow by less than 2 percent. Industrial growth is likely to remain anemic, while trade activity would decline somewhat further due to the cumulative effect of the recent restrictions. In addition, growth in agricultural output was expected to slow as grain output returns to a more normal level. Staff expected that demand for foreign exchange in the curb market will revive as traders find their way around the new trade barriers, leading to depreciation of the curb market exchange rate and putting upward pressure on prices. In light of the limited external financing available to the government, continued CBU financing of the budget deficit was also foreseen. As a result, annual CPI inflation was projected to remain close to 30 percent in 2003. 19. Under current policies, the external current account surplus is expected to widen to almost 5 percent of GDP in 2003. In light of Uzbekistan’s self-sufficiency in energy, the direct impact of the war in Iraq is expected to be small. Exports are projected to increase somewhat on account of higher projected cotton and gold prices (Tables 7 and 8). Due to the trade restrictions and further net capital outflows, imports would remain compressed. Notwithstanding an increase in scheduled debt service payments, Uzbekistan is expected to remain current on its external obligations. In this connection, the mission encouraged the authorities to take steps to resume negotiations with Russia on technical credits received in 1992-94 that are under dispute, in order to seek an early resolution of this issue. Gross international revenues would remain at $1.2 billion (5 months of import cover) by end-2003. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- B. Exchange and Trade Policies 20. The authorities considered that access to foreign exchange had been significantly liberalized in 2002 and early 2003, but acknowledged that further action was needed. Staff agreed that, provided the authorities act with determination, the planned liberalization of the foreign exchange markets is within reach. It is key to avoid any undue delays in the pre-registration of import contracts and in conversions by commercial banks. To eliminate the lines at cash bureaus, the mission stressed that the CBU should stand ready to sell cash foreign exchange to banks in any amount required and excessive police inspections of clients need to stop. To ensure that the foreign exchange regime worked as intended, the CBU undertook in March 2003 an information campaign in the mass media and among commercial banks. 21. The authorities pointed out that the trade measures taken from mid-2002 were aimed at restoring order in the consumer goods market that was riddled with smuggling, tax evasion, and low-quality and potentially dangerous products. They also noted that some of these measures could be temporary. In light of staff concerns, a number of adjustments had already been made in 2002, including the elimination of the surcharge on imports of consumer goods by legal entities and the reduction of the unified import tariff for natural persons from 90 percent to 70 percent for non-food items and from 50 percent to 40 percent for food items. The authorities also argued that the measures they had taken were fully consistent with WTO guidelines. As regards the closure of borders with the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan, the authorities explained that this was done primarily to halt the spread of infectious diseases and that the borders would be reopened as soon as it would be safe to do so. 22. The staff argued that the recent restrictions were not consistent with an efficient and market-based trade system and strongly urged the authorities to reconsider their approach to trade regulation. In the staffs view, the costs to the economy of such heavy- handed measures and loss of credibility of Uzbekistan’s economic reform program far outweighed any possible positive results. lo The measures have already led to a decline in economic activity, an expansion of the underground economy and worsening of corruption, and a deterioration of economic relations with neighboring countries. Staff also pointed out that Uzbekistan’s external trade regime is the most restrictive among CIS countries (Figure 7). Opening the economy to trade would create better conditions for export growth and help bring about a much-needed supply response to the real depreciation of the sum. Corrective measures would need to include opening the borders with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic; eliminating all import surcharges; unifying tariffs for all economic agents; limiting quality certification to products hazardous to health, safety, and the environment; i” A partial indication of the relative size of smuggling is that the total value of apprehended goods during May-December, 2002, amounted to less than 1 percent of imports in 2002.

Early and decisive action would also help Uzbekistan achieve its objective of gaining WTO accession. Figure 7.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies 23. The government budget for 2003 foresees a sharp increase in the general government deficit to 5.8 percent of GDP, assuming that disbursements of external project loans would increase significantly, and that the government’s reform program would be supported by external budgetary assistance. The deficit, excluding foreign-financed project spending, would amount to 1% percent of GDP. Central bank lending to the government would be limited and only used to support enterprises that have difficulty in servicing their foreign debt. 24. Staff considered that the 2003 budget was based on optimistic projections for tax revenue and external assistance, and that the general government deficit should be limited to 1.4 percent of GDP, in order to limit recourse to inflationary financing by the CBU. As in previous years, part of the needed adjustment would be automatic as projects Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - would not be undertaken unless the external financing was forthcoming. l1 In addition, however, under current policies staff projected an uncovered fiscal gap of about 1 percent of GDP. To limit inflationary financing by the CBU, this gap would need to be covered by cuts in nonpriority outlays, including on the economy, centralized investments, and other spending. The mission cautioned the authorities to limit cuts in social spending in light of the planned hikes in energy tariffs and to cushion the impact of enterprise restructuring on vulnerable groups. Staff also estimated that the lowering of contribution rates to the Pension Fund in 2003 would result in a sizable deficit. Thus, there is a strong need to implement cost- reducing measures, including streamlining entitlements. The authorities agreed with the need to revise the budget and are elaborating measures to cover the fiscal gap and to address the financial problems at the Pension Fund. 25. The mission urged the authorities to continue structural reforms in the fiscal area. The reform of public expenditure management, including the establishment of a treasury, is ongoing with technical assistance from the Fund and other international agencies. In addition, the mission stressed the need to streamline the tax system, including by reducing exemptions, and to introduce modem tax collection methods. The authorities agreed that enforcing tax collection through the banking system undermines financial intermediation and indicated that they would welcome Fund technical assistance in this area. 26. Staff concurred with the authorities that monetary policy in 2003 will need to play a key role in containing inflation and avoiding destabilizing fluctuations in the exchange rate. The monetary program of the CBU aims to limit reserve money growth to 26% percent in 2003. In light of the steps being taken by the CBU to improve access to cash, the money multiplier would decline somewhat. Broad money is projected to grow by 23 percent, implying a modest increase in velocity. The CBU intends to increase its reliance on indirect instruments, notably issuance of CDs and, to a lesser extent, open market operations in treasury bills. In this context, staff encouraged the government to increase the use of treasury bills to finance the budget deficit, in order to develop the market for these instruments. The CBU also intended to end all lending to the government in 2003, and to strictly limit liquidity support to commercial banks. In the staffs view, however, given the shortfall in external budgetary financing, some CBU financing of the deficit would be unavoidable. Such borrowing should be limited to $4 percent of GDP. Staff also urged the CBU to keep its refinance rate under close watch and to stand ready to increase it if inflation picks up again. In the event that inflation continues to decline, staff agreed that the CBU could consider reducing the rate in due course. l1 If additional external financing would become available, staff could support a limited increase in the budget deficit, provided it does not lead to a material increase in CBU financing.

The authorities realized the importance of streamlining the operations of the banking system. The mission welcomed the steps taken by the CBU to inform the public of improvements in access to cash from their bank accounts, and underlined the importance of encouraging banks to comply with these reforms. To increase confidence in the banking system, it is crucial to abolish the obligatory daily deposits of cash receipts by retail and catering enterprises, and to end the reporting of individual bank transactions. The mission also emphasized that all remaining undue government interference in bank operations, including by local authorities, should be terminated. 28. While the authorities maintained that the banking system remained robust, the staff feared that banks have become increasingly vulnerable. Financial stress of externally indebted enterprises arising from the large devaluations of the OTC exchange rate during 2001-02 has increased the need for the CBU to ensure that commercial banks make early provisions for non-performing loans. In addition, the government should cease guaranteeing new loans. The CBU concurred and explained that its supervisory capacity was being strengthened and that banks had already started to increase provisions. Moreover, 18 commercial banks had been subject to an external audit on the basis of international standards in 2002. The staff also encouraged the authorities to conduct comprehensive portfolio reviews of the National Bank of Uzbekistan and Asaka Bank in preparation for their planned privatization. The CBU plans to undertake a comprehensive audit of its 2002 balance sheet, consistent with International Accounting Standards (LAS). 29. The authorities indicated that considerable progress in agricultural reform was made in 2002. Farmers had benefited from both an increase in state procurement prices for cotton and grain to near-world market levels and the relaxation of the state procurement mechanism. The mission noted that agricultural reforms remain key to reducing poverty and realizing Uzbekistan’s export potential. It acknowledged that the authorities had begun to move away from the comprehensive state procurement system for cotton and grain, and also recognized the difficulties in overhauling the cotton marketing framework. Producer prices paid to farms for their share in the 2002 cotton crop (50 percent) should fully reflect the recent increase in the world market price for cotton and depreciation of the official exchange rate, while payments to farmers should be made in a timely fashion. Staff also argued that it is crucial to ensure the prompt licensing of new private cotton buyers authorized to buy cotton from the ginneries. 30. The authorities recognized that the energy sector required substantial restructuring. They had initiated a series of utility price increases as of mid-2001, and continued with their ambitious program of installing electricity, gas, and communal heating meters to improve billing and enhance efficiency in energy use. The staff strongly supported these steps, which would help reduce the sector’s quasi-fiscal deficit estimated at $1.9 billion Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - (about 20 percent of GDP).12 Further improvement in the financial position of the energy sector will require the removal of all legal impediments to commercial discipline. Staff urged the authorities to begin addressing the problem of continuous accumulation of payments arrears and offsets by introducing a strict cut-off policy. It also stressed the need to combine future tariff hikes with well-targeted social safety net measures to cushion the adverse impact on the poorest segments of the population. With a view to the possible future privatization of energy enterprises, staff urged the authorities to put in place a transparent regulatory framework for the sector. 31. The authorities noted that headway had been made in the privatization of state enterprises, with 1,252 small and medium scale enterprises privatized in 2002, compared with 827 in 2001. Also, a Presidential decree of January 2003 provided for the sale of government shares in enterprises in which the state held a capital share of less than 25 percent, and for a reduction in the influence of trade associations on the supervisory boards of privatized enterprises.13 Staff acknowledged the gains that were being made in privatization, but cautioned the authorities that the business environment remained very difficult. Future success in the sale of state-owned enterprises (including banks) will depend critically on making substantial reforms in the legal and regulatory system to enhance the ability of enterprises to freely operate, trade, and invest without undue interference from state and local authorities. In this context, staff urged the authorities to rescind the regulation that aims to increase government control of already privatized retail and service enterprises. Staff agreed with the authorities on the need to improve corporate governance, including through better protection of the rights of minority shareholders. However, it considered the newly imposed authorized capital requirement of $50,000 for joint-stock companies to be excessively high and as likely to hamper competition. The staff encouraged the authorities to go ahead with their plans to abolish the registry of monopoly products. 32. The authorities acknowledged that with regard to regional economic cooperation policy reversals took place in 2002. They are aware that improving regional cooperation, including under the CIS-7 Initiative, is indispensable for the economic development of Uzbekistan. Under the present circumstances, however, they considered the recent measures to restrict trade and transport with neighboring countries to be in Uzbekistan’s best interest. The mission disagreed and urged the authorities to re-open the borders with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as to abolish the surcharge on third-country products imported from adjacent countries.

Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - E. Medium-Term Outlook 33. The authorities indicated that they intend to adhere to their gradualist approach to reform. Over the medium-term, their strategy is to continue to implement tight fiscal and monetary policies in order to further reduce inflation, maintain their prudent external debt policy, and progressively reform and privatize the enterprise sector within a framework of strict government oversight to minimize tax evasion. The authorities’ development strategy also included pushing ahead with further import substitution while continuing to support industries where considerable investments had already been made (e.g., the automobile sector). The authorities expected their strategy to yield annual growth rates in the order of 5 percent per annum over the medium-term. 34. The staff evaluated the medium-term outlook on the assumption that the authorities will implement their strategy as described. Although the commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and privatization is welcome, the staff believed that an economic strategy that combines extensive protection and far-reaching government interference in the economy will result in a slowdown of economic growth and continued high inflation. Moreover, such a program would also make it difficult for IFIs to offer financial support to Uzbekistan. With little prospect for commercial lending, Uzbekistan would have considerable difficulty mobilizing capital to finance its development effort. Thus, under current policies, the staff expected real GDP growth to remain subdued at about 2% percent in 2004 and beyond. Annual CPI inflation is projected to remain in the range of 30-35 percent per annum, in light of the expected continued government recourse to CBU financing and bank lending to enterprises. The current account is expected to register modest surpluses in the medium term reflecting continued import compression and net capital outflows. Lack of access to new loans would result in a decline in the external debt-to-GDP ratio from 52 percent in 2003 to 35 percent in 2007 and a corresponding reduction in the debt service ratio. Gross international reserves would gradually increase to almost 5% months of import cover by 2007. 35. Assessing vulnerabilities, staff expected that under current policies Uzbekistan will remain heavily dependent on cotton and gold exports. Possible sharp declines in the world market prices of either of these commodities would weaken its external position. An additional vulnerability relates to the overhang of government-guaranteed loans held by commercial banks. A prolonged period of low growth could make it difficult for the government to honor its loan guarantees and possibly compromise the stability of the banking system. 36. The staff also assessed external and fiscal debt sustainability over the medium term (Annex II). The conclusion was that the respective baseline scenarios-which could include some additional external financing as discussed in footnote 1 l-are sustainable. However, permanent shocks commensurate with the country’s historical experience, as well as certain temporary shocks-such as to cotton exports receipts or realization of the government’s contingent liabilities on guaranteed debt-would increase Uzbekistan’s Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - external debt ratios to dangerous levels and increase strains on public finance. In addition, the implicit contingent liabilities related to the large quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector are a source of risk if the government does not follow through with the implementation of measures to improve the financial situation of the sector. This underscores the vulnerabilities that Uzbekistan still faces-even with a conservative external borrowing policy and reducing government guarantees-and emphasizes the need for pursuing reforms that would help diversify the productive base of the economy and yield higher growth. 37. The staff also discussed with the authorities an alternative medium-term scenario, in which tight fiscal and monetary policies are accompanied by a market- based reform program, including full liberalization of the foreign exchange regime, reversal of the most harmful restrictions on trade and private enterprise, lifting of undue restrictions on banking operations, and full implementation of the reforms in the cotton sector. Under this scenario, Uzbekistan could receive considerable financial support from the international community, including the Fund, which together with the improved business environment would permit real GDP growth to increase to 5 percent by 2007 and annual CPI inflation to fall to below 10 percent by 2005. The current account deficit would slip into deficit from 2004 (1- 1% percent of GDP), reflecting the impact of the liberalization of the trade regime and the higher imports that would be associated with the foreign direct investment that is expected to accompany the reforms. External borrowing would be substantially larger than under the current policies scenario, but the faster pace of real GDP growth would nevertheless permit the external debt-to-GDP ratio to decline to about 3 1 percent by 2007 F. Statistical Issues 38. Although some progress has been made in improving economic data, especially as regards the consumer price index, Uzbekistan’s economic statistics continue to suffer from major weaknesses. Key weaknesses include problems with source data, the application of inappropriate techniques, and apparent political interference in the processing and dissemination of data. The establishment of the legally independent State Committee for Statistics in December 2002 is an important step forward in improving Uzbekistan’s economic and financial database. In this context, the authorities intend to request Fund technical assistance in the area of the national accounts and price statistics. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 39. Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in March 2002, the Uzbek authorities have reduced inflation, improved access to foreign exchange and introduced reforms in agriculture, but progress toward creating a market economy has been slow and uneven. The staff welcomes that as a result of strict fiscal control and appropriate tightening of monetary policy, the high rate of inflation has come down. In addition, a number of key reforms envisaged under the SMP were gradually put in place, although decisive further measures are needed to fully implement these reforms. From mid-2002, however, the authorities imposed heavy restrictions on external and domestic trade that ran Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - counter to their intention to progressively open up the Uzbek economy as envisaged under the SMP, and dampened economic activity. In the staffs view, these restrictions represented an effort of powerful vested interests to recoup rents that were lost as the multiple exchange rate system was being dismantled. 40. In light of the uneven performance under the SMP, the authorities would need to take corrective actions to establish a sound basis for discussions that could lead to a Fund-supported program. Such actions would need to clearly demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to market-based reforms, and include steps to implement outstanding SMP measures in a sustained manner, as well as the early reversal of the most damaging restrictions on external and domestic trade. 41. The economic situation in 2002 remained a cause for concern as economic growth declined and imports were compressed. The very difficult environment for private sector activities prevented a supply response in the tradables sector, despite a further depreciation of the real exchange rate. These developments are particularly worrisome in view of the deteriorating living standards and the strong economic expansion in other CIS countries, notably in neighboring Kazakhstan. Under current policies, the outlook for 2003 is a further decrease in economic growth and continued high inflation. 42. Although the government’s economic program for 2003 includes a number of positive elements, it also envisages that the state would continue to closely regulate and control economic activity. In light of the disappointing economic performance of the last decade, the staff considers that a fundamental change in this aspect of the authorities’ strategy is needed. It is crucial to leave economic decision-making to a much larger extent to the private sector and drastically widen the scope for free competition on a level playing field. 43. The achievement of current account convertibility remains a key policy objective for 2003. With political will, the liberalization of the foreign exchange market can be accomplished in the course of this year. This would as a matter of priority require the prompt removal of any remaining undue obstacles to the OTC market and for the CBU to sell cash foreign exchange to banks in any amount required. In order to be able to move to acceptance of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, the authorities need to provide all requested information that would allow staff to complete its review of Uzbekistan’s foreign exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices. 44. There is a strong need for the authorities to reconsider their approach to trade regulation and regional cooperation. The trade restrictions put in place in 2002 have increased the inward-looking orientation of the Uzbek economy, hampered export growth, and stand in the way of achieving the authorities’ objective of accelerating Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO. An important first step would be to dismantle the most harmful recent restrictions, including by re-opening the borders with neighboring countries, streamlining the tariff schedule, lowering non-tariff barriers, and removing the obstacles to easy entry and competition in domestic trade. Such steps are indispensable to enable Uzbekistan to benefit Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - from the significant real depreciation of the sum in 2001-02 and the concomitant improvement in competitiveness. 45. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to maintain a prudent fiscal stance in 2003. To this end, it is important that the government take corrective measures to compensate for the expected shortfall in external financing. It will be crucial to keep the support to enterprises under financial stress from the devaluation of the OTC exchange rate within the established limits and to continue to channel all such assistance through the budget. Strictly limiting borrowing from the CBU and refraining from further wage increases will also be essential to help moderate inflation expectations. At the same time, care must be taken to ensure that social safety net outlays are adequate. 46. The tight monetary policy stance needs to be maintained to limit inflation and avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations. The staff welcomes the increasing reliance on indirect policy instruments and urges the CBU to keep its refinance rate under close watch to ensure that it remains positive in real terms. The CBU will also need to step up its efforts to strengthen financial intermediation, notably by further liberalizing cash withdrawals from bank accounts, abolishing obligatory deposits of cash receipts by enterprises, and removing the banks’ financial oversight and tax collection functions. It is also important to reinforce bank supervision and to ensure adequate provisioning. Finally, the staff welcomes the planned audit of the CBU’s 2002 balance sheet according to IAS, and encourages the CBU to publish the results. 47. Decisive implementation of structural reforms remains a priority. Improving the environment for private sector activities, notably by reducing government interference, is of the utmost importance. In this connection, the plans to increase government control of activities of already privatized enterprises should be abandoned. While encouraging steps have been taken in introducing reforms of state procurement in agriculture, much remains to be done. In particular, it is important that the producer prices paid to cotton farmers on their own share of the 2002 crop reflect the increase in world market prices and the devaluation of the OTC exchange rate, and that the licensing of new private buyers proceeds smoothly. Improving the financial situation in the energy sector through further tariff increases and strengthening payments discipline is crucial to arrest the deterioration in the sector’s infrastructure and improve energy efficiency. 48. The authorities need to step up their efforts to improve Uzbekistan’s statistical database and to increase the transparency of economic policy making. The establishment of an independent statistical agency hopefully creates the appropriate institutional framework for a significant strengthening of Uzbekistan’s economic and financial database. The staff encourages the authorities to begin publishing widely a quarterly statistical bulletin presenting key indicators, including on public finance, and the financial and external sectors. Staff also urges the authorities to agree to the issuance of a PIN and the publication of the staff report following the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation.

Uzbekistan maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2 or 3 as described in Annex I. In the absence of a clear timetable for their removal, the staff does not recommend their approval and urges their speedy elimination. 50. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

INTRODUCTION’ 1. Uzbekistan’s trade and exchange system is administered by several institutions. The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is responsible for foreign exchange regulations. The Agency (formerly Ministry) for Foreign Economic Relations (AFER) is the primary government body for trade matters. Trade policies are implemented as part of an overall development strategy, coordinated with the Cabinet of Ministers (CoM). Customs policies are implemented by the State Customs Committee. An interdepartmental customs tariff council (headed by AFER) determines the structure of the import tariff regime.’ 2. Traditionally, Uzbekistan has exercised control over its external trade through a combination of trade and foreign exchange restrictions, which are extensive even by the standards of other transition economies. This is reflected in Uzbekistan being rated a “9” on the IMF’s Trade Restrictiveness Index, which makes it the most restrictive economy in the CIS.3 While there was some reform of the foreign exchange regime in 2002, many restrictive measures were undertaken in the trade sector, which had the effect of making the Uzbek economy even more closed to the outside world. II. TRADE AND PAYMENTS SYSTEM 3. The trade regime was made even more restrictive in 2002 with a number of measures taken to further inhibit both external and internal trade (Box A-l). Included among these was a measure that established a different customs regime for legal entities and natural persons (a category dominated by “shuttle traders”). ’ Two previous documents “Republic of Uzbekistan: Recent Economic Developments” (N/00/10, January 13,200O) and “Republic of Uzbekistan: Recent Economic Developments” (SM/O l/l 9, January 23,200 1) provide historical background to this section, 2 Members of this council include, in addition to AFER, representatives of the Ministry of Finance, State Tax Committee, State Customs Committee, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Department of Cabinet Affairs. 3 This index is a composite indicator of trade restrictiveness based on constituent indicators of tariff restrictiveness and non-tariff barriers. For more details, see IMF, “Trade Liberalization in Fund-Supported Programs” (WEO/EAO 18997, February 13, 1999).

Excessive list of consumer goods for which conformance certificates are required, and limited acceptance of internationally recognized certification (Cabinet of Ministers (CM) Resolution No. 295; August 21, 2002). l Prohibition of imports of consumer goods through commodity exchanges (MoJ Registration. No. 1169; August 3 1,2002). . Imposition of unified tariff on imports by natural persons at a level higher than the tax burden on legal entities (CM Resolution 335; September 27,2002). l Custom clearance of consumer goods imported by natural persons must be performed by entrepreneurs themselves (CM Resolution No. 407; November 26,2002). l Imposition of 20 percent surcharge on imports of non-food consumer goods produced in third countries and re-exported to Uzbekistan from contiguous countries (CM Resolution No. 425; December 5, 2002). l Mandatory labeling in the Uzbek language of certain consumer goods prior to clearing customs (CM Resolution No. 427; December 5,2002). . Restriction on duty-free importation of personal goods from adjacent states (Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic) by physical persons limited to $50 (the limit for importing from other countries is $1,000) (MoJ Registration No. 1196; December 28,2002). l Closing of borders with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic for non-official traffic (December 28,2002). A. Imports by Legal Entities 4. The tariff regime was amended in May 2002, simplifying tariff rates applied to legal entities, but increasing the average tariff rate.4 According to the new schedule, the number of tariff bands was reduced to three (0, 10, and 30 percent) and the maximum rate was reduced to 30 percent. However many items previously exempted or taxed at zero rates became subject to positive tariff rates, and many items were shifted to a higher tariff band.5 As a result, the average unweighted tariff rate increased from 10.4 percent to 15.4 percent.6 4 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 189 (May 22, 2002). 5 In some cases, the new tariff regime has become prohibitive. For example, lubricants imported from countries that do not enjoy the status of Most Favored Nation (MFN) were previously exempt from tariffs. Currently they face a tariff of 60 percent, to which must be added an excise tax of 11.1 percent, a customs fee of 0.2 percent, and VAT of 20 percent- yielding a total taxation of 105.6 percent-more than three times the previous rate of 33.6 percent. 6 Contrary to usual practice, Uzbekistan reports tariffs in reference to MFN countries-the rate for non-MFN countries being set at double the MFN rate. Under international practice, tariffs are defined with respect to non-MFN countries, discounting them for MFN. (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - ANNEX I The interdepartmental customs tariff council has proposed a modification to the tariff regime whereby tariff rates on goods would be set depending on the scope for their domestic production.7 In addition, a uniform customs fee of 0.2 percent is charged on all imports (to offset the costs of operating the customs service). 5. There are numerous exemptions to customs duties.8 The following specific exemptions have been granted: . goods imported under intergovernmental and loan agreements signed or guaranteed by the Uzbek Government; . imports funded from the consolidated budget in accordance with resolutions of the Uzbek Government; . goods imported by foreign legal entities making foreign direct investments in the Uzbek economy totaling more than $50 million provided that the imports originate from the same legal entities’ foreign subsidiaries; . raw materials supplied by non-resident customers, materials and accessories brought in/out for industrial processing and producing of goods subject to import/export; . imports originating from countries in the free trade zone, consisting of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, and Tajikistan; and . Goods brought as exhibits for exhibitions, advertisement, or presentations. Accordingly, the relevant number for comparisons with other countries is higher than the numbers shown in the text. In terms of protection, however, the Uzbek presentation may be appropriate as a significant proportion of its trade (56 percent in 2002, according to data provided by the AFER) takes place with MFN countries. 7 According to the authorities, the following changes are envisioned: For goods that Uzbekistan does not produce and will not produce in the future, customs tariff will be set at zero, as will the excise rate, leaving only VAT to be paid. For goods that Uzbekistan currently produces, and expects to expand production in the future, there will be a moderate customs tariff, no excise, and the usual VAT rate. For goods that the country produces domestically and expects to export, customs tariff will be set up to 30 percent, with 20-30 percent excise, plus VAT. 8 To assist small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), Presidential Decrees Nos. 1702 (January 1997) and 1987 (April 9,200O) exempted SMEs from payment of customs duties on production equipment and items required to meet their internal needs. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - ANNEX I 6. The customs code of Uzbekistan (adopted by the parliament on August 29,1997) mandates the State Customs Committee to levy, during the process of customs clearance for imports, a customs clearance fee, a customs service fee, and a customs certificate issuance fee. The revenues from such fees are transferred to the accounts of the State Customs Committee and are used to cover its costs. Pursuant to Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 204 (dated April 30, 1999), the following goods are exempt from these fees: . goods whose value does not exceed ten times the minimum wage or the maximum limit on duty-free imports or exports; . humanitarian aid; . goods in transit; . cultural goods for permanent or temporary storage or display in state museums or libraries; . military equipment brought into or taken out of Uzbekistan by the Ministry of Defense, the National Security Service and the Interior Ministry; and . goods intended for official use by diplomatic missions of foreign states, international organization and associations enjoying customs privileges in Uzbekistan. 7. In addition to the customs tariff and customs fee, imports face domestic taxes as well. These domestic taxes include VAT and excise tax. Except for certain exemptions, VAT of 20 percent is applied to all goods and services imported into Uzbekistan and collected by customs officials.’ In addition, an excise tax is applied to the customs value and must be paid during the customs clearance process. In 2002, the list of imported goods subject to excise was expanded. The expanded list includes items such as tea, sugar, refrigerators, and sunglasses with excise taxes ranging from 5.25 percent to 90 percent of the total customs value. lo 9 Technological equipment imported into Uzbekistan is exempt from VAT if used: . to equip priority facilities included in the investment program; l for investment projects financed from foreign loans guaranteed by the government; l for newly built and rehabilitated enterprises manufacturing consumer goods; and l by foreign investors as their contribution to the capital of joint ventures. lo The rates shown here are defined as a proportion of total value excluding the excise tax. In Uzbek legal documents, excise rates are expressed as a proportion of the total value inclusive of excise taxes.

On August 1,2002, a 30 percent surcharge was applied on imports of non-food consumer goods by legal entities. l1 This surcharge was included in the VAT tax base and, until October 1, had to be paid in hard currency. The surcharge was reduced to 20 percent (payable in national currency) on September 23,12 to 10 percent on December 1, and was finally removed by year-end. On January 1,2003 a surcharge of 20 percent was levied on imports of non-food consumer goods that were imported (without certificate of origin) from contiguous countries but produced in non-contiguous countries (or “third countries,” e.g., a Chinese produced good imported from Kazakhstan).13’ l4 9. There are numerous administrative controls on trade. Import contracts have to be registered ex ante with AFER, mainly to ensure that import goods are not overpriced relative to international norms. l5 be problematic.16 While this process has been streamlined over the years, it can still A registered import contract is required to be submitted for customs clearance and must accompany all requests to purchase foreign exchange. l7 In October 1997, pre-shipment inspections (for a fee) were introduced to facilitate the registration process.18 AFER guidelines introduced on June 30,2002, provide for registration of contracts with a l1 Presidential Decree No. 3 105. l2 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 327. l3 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 425 (January 1,2003). l4 The 20 percent surcharge applies to both legal entities and natural persons. For legal entities, the surcharge is applied on top of the applicable non-MFN tariff. l5 Import contract registration with the AFER is required only for import contracts that need a purchase of foreign exchange at the OTC market. However, imports financed from own foreign exchange sources still have to be registered with the importer’s commercial bank. I6 Earlier changes are described in “Republic of Uzbekistan: Recent Economic Developments” (SM/O1/19). l7 An application for registration of a contract can be rejected for the following reasons: inadequate foreign exchange resources; lack of a foreign exchange conversion license; a contract price that is higher than the world market price; the value of the contract exceeds the importers’ own funds; and the contract is for imports of equipment judged to be economically inefficient or obsolete. ‘* Once an independent inspection agency approves a contract, registration is generally granted by the AFER. Typically, the review process checks on quantity, quality, and the price of imported goods, and other contract provisions.

Uzbekistan does not have import quotas, but bans imports of certain items and requires licenses for imports of others. These items include published materials, manuscripts, videos, pictures, films, and other items aimed at undermining the state and public order. Import licenses are required for imports of the following goods: . weapons and military ammunition, special components for their production; . precious metals and gems, weapons, scrap metals, radioactive substances; . ecologically hazardous waste and toxic substances; and . narcotics and psychotropic substances. 11. The law “On Customs Tariffs” of August 1997 allows various anti-dumping, countervailing, and other special duties (safeguard measures). Dumping is defined as occurring when “goods are imported into the territory of Uzbekistan at a price lower than the production cost of the exporter in the exporting country, if such import can cause or threaten material damage to local producers of similar or competitive goods, or interferes with the establishment or expansion of production of similar goods in the Republic of Uzbekistan.” Countervailing duties are also permitted on imports that benefited from subsidies in the exporting country, if such importation is deemed to impede development of production of similar products in Uzbekistan. Procedural rules have not been introduced for either anti- dumping duties or countervailing duties; such measures are planned as part of the WTO accession process. B. Imports by Natural Persons 12. In June 2002, the imports by natural persons were made subject to a special tariff regime. This group is dominated by “shuttle traders”-individuals engaged in importing and exporting predominantly consumer goods. Prior to June 2002, natural persons paid the usual customs tariffs and fees, excises and VAT but were also subject to an additional “customs fee” at the rate of 25 percent on food items and of 50 percent on non- food items. Since June 2002, all these payments have been replaced by a “unified customs payment” in the amount of 50 percent for food items and 90 percent for non-food items, irrespective of the origin of the import.193 2o Effective September 1,2002, individuals importing goods for commercial purposes (i.e., for sale at bazaars, or stationary trading points) must be registered as individual entrepreneurs with the right to engage in foreign l9 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 154. 2o Excises, when applicable, have to be paid on top of this unified rate. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - ANNEX I activities and in retail trade. On October 1,2002 the unified custom payment was reduced to 40 percent for food (excluding flour, which was exempt from customs duty) and 70 percent for non-food.21 The 20 percent surcharge on consumer goods imported from third countries introduced on January 1,2003 also applied to natural persons (see paragraph 7 above). 13. In addition, effective August 1,2002, natural persons were required to pay the unified customs tariff in convertible currency.22 Since the unified customs tariff is computed at the official rate, which is more appreciated than the curb market rate used by most traders, this amounted to an increase in the effective tariff rate. This requirement was rescinded in October 2002 after which payment of the unified customs tariff could again be made in sum. 23 C. Exports 14. Most controls on exports have been removed. Export licenses were abolished in November 1997, except for goods such as armament and military equipment, precious metals, and uranium and other radioactive substances. Exports of sugar, vegetable oil, wheat and flour products, livestock and poultry, meat, antiques, raw hides, scrap metal, silkworm cocoons, and raw silk are banned.24 Export contracts for raw materials (such as cotton, precious, and non-ferrous metals) are subject to review by AFER, and to ex-ante registration with a commercial bank. 15. Export tariffs were eliminated in January 1998. Excise taxes on exports do not exist since they were not included in the 2003 budget resolution (Council of Ministers Resolution No. 455, December 30,2002). For VAT purposes, only exports in hard currency are zero-rated.25 16. A 100 percent prepayment or a letter of credit or a bank guarantee is required for export transactions and advance delivery of exports exchanged under barter contracts is not allowed. For imports, the maximum prepayment that is permitted is 15 percent of the value of the import contract (up to a maximum of $100,000) and advance delivery is required for imports under a barter contract. Barter trade has been restricted and is 21 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 335. 22 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 248. 23 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 335. 24 Presidential Decree Nos. 1871 (October 10, 1997), 2212 (February 5, 1999), and 2553 (February 28,200O).

A prohibition was placed on import of consumer goods through commodity exchanges (Ministry of Justice Registration. No. 1169; August 3 1,2002). 17. Income earned by exporting enterprises (under all forms of ownership) is subject to various regulations regarding payment of profit and property taxes. If the share of goods of own production exported for hard currency is between 15 and 30 percent of total sales of an enterprise, the statutory profit tax rate is reduced by 30 percent. If the share of goods of own production exceeds 30 percent of total sales of the enterprise, the profit tax is reduced by 50 percent (Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 455, Annex 3, December 30, 2002). If the share of goods of own production exported for hard currency is between 15 and 25 percent of total sales of an enterprise, the property tax is reduced by 30 percent; if the share of goods exported is between 25 and 50 percent of total sales, the property tax rate is reduced by 50 percent; and if the share of goods exported exceeds 50 percent, the enterprise is exempt from the property tax (Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 455, Annex 14, December 30,2002). 18. The state is involved in trading certain commodities, such as cotton, energy, and certain metals. Raw cotton production in Uzbekistan is subject to the state order system. Uzbekneftegas is responsible for production and distribution (including exports) of domestic oil and gas resources. D. Bilateral and Multilateral Trade Relations 19. Uzbekistan has Free Trade Agreements with ten CIS countries.26 Bilateral agreements have determined the extent of tariff concessions. Recent border closings with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic have, however, greatly restricted movement of goods between Uzbekistan and these neighboring countries. 20. Uzbekistan has also been pursuing accession to the WTO. Application for accession was received by the WTO on December 8, 1994, after which a working party was established. A Memorandum of Foreign Trade Relations was submitted in October 1998. Additional questions and replies were addressed in April 2001. In order to proceed further, Uzbekistan needs to prepare answers to questions from the last meeting, implement various legislative changes to bring its trading system in line with WTO standards, clear away various import restrictions, and make appropriate access offers on a bilateral level. There are various technical barriers to trade. USAID is currently supporting a standards reform project, 26 Bilateral free trade agreements have been signed with Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. In April 1994, Uzbekistan signed the CIS Agreement on Creation of a Free Trade Area with Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.

The current practice regarding quality conformance certificates on imports will also need to be changed as it goes beyond the WTO-sanctioned requirements for health and sanitary reasons. The Government has stated its desire to request another working group meeting later this year. III. EXCHANGE SYSTEM 21. The national currency, the sum, was introduced on July 1,1994, to replace the transitional sum coupon introduced in late 1993. The conversion rate was 1,000 sum coupons to 1 sum and the initial auction-based official exchange rate was sum 6.94 per U.S. dollar. Through 1996, the official exchange rate was the auction exchange rate as determined by auctions of U.S. dollars held twice a week (daily since March 1997). Effective January 1, 1997, a system of multiple exchange rates was formally introduced. The official exchange rate was set as the weighted average of the U.S. dollar auction rates from the previous week plus a discretionary adjustment; in practice, this exchange rate deviated only slightly from the auction rate. Official exchange rates for 30 other currencies and the SDR are established through U.S. dollar cross rates and are applied to official transactions and used as accounting rates by the central bank. Until June 30, 1998, the central bank formally limited the margin at which foreign exchange bought at the official exchange rate could be sold on the official commercial bank and cash markets to a maximum of 12 percent. Effective July 1, 1998 the commercial bank exchange rate was officially delinked from the official rate and the spread allowed to increase. Export proceeds are subject to a compulsory surrender requirement of 100 percent in the case of centralized exports and 50 percent in the case of non-centralized exports. 22. Further changes have taken place over the years. On May 1,2000, the official exchange rate was unified with the commercial bank exchange rate at the commercial bank rate level. On July 1,2000, two new exchange rates were introduced: (i) a new commercial bank exchange rate applicable to imports of consumer goods for license holders and the non- surrendered part of the receipts from non-centralized exports; (ii) a cash foreign exchange bureau rate applicable to cash foreign exchange transactions conducted at authorized foreign exchange bureaus. These two new exchange rates were initially set at the same level and close to the then prevailing curb market exchange rate. After November 2000, the cash foreign exchange bureau rate was allowed to become systematically more devalued than the commercial bank exchange rate. In November, 2002, enterprises producing consumer goods for export were permitted to deduct the cost of raw materials from export proceeds before applying the 50 percent surrender requirement (for the period 2003-2005). 23. Since mid-2001, the CBU took a series of measures to streamline the foreign exchange regime. On July 1,200 1, the commercial bank rate was replaced by an over-the- counter (OTC) rate determined by supply and demand at interbank auctions, although in practice this rate has been set administratively. Small and medium-sized enterprises exporting their own production were exempted from the surrender requirement, and all transactions-except the mandatory surrender of proceeds from centralized exports and the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - ANNEX I service of external debt owed or guaranteed by the government and contracted before July 1,2001-were transferred from the official market to the OTC market. Effective August 1,2001, the system of licenses and quotas for imports of consumer goods was abolished, but quarterly limits were set for the allocation of foreign exchange for “socially significant” consumer goods and medical supplies. On November 1,2001, the official exchange rate was devalued and was newly defined as an adjusted weekly average of the OTC rate. Since that date, the official exchange rate formally applies only to statistical and reporting purposes, and for the calculation of customs payments; however, in practice, some transactions (mainly the obligatory surrender requirements for centralized exports) are still effected at this rate. Effective October 1,2002, quarterly foreign exchange limits for “socially significant” consumer goods and medical supplies were abolished. 24. The negative list of goods for which the allocation of foreign exchange was “not recommended” was formally abolished in phases during the first half of 2002. On May 1,2002, access to the foreign exchange bureaus for cash was effectively liberalized when documentation requirements were streamlined, and the ceiling on the purchase of foreign exchange was raised up to the equivalent of US$l,OOO in cash and US$l,OOO in travelers’ checks. As of June 1,2002, the limit was increased by an additional US$500 in cash per individual per quarter. Access to the OTC market, through which most trade passes, was improved effective July 1,2002 when action was taken to ensure swift pre-registration of import contracts. Effective, July 1,2002 the sum was made the legal tender for the payment of all goods and services in Uzbekistan (hitherto the payments by non-residents for some services was made in foreign exchange). Effective July 16,2002, the authorities shifted transactions related to the import of consumer goods, services, and communications from the OTC market to the cash market, resulting in a step devaluation equivalent to 39 percent for these transactions. From August 1,2002, an import surcharge on non-food consumer goods, as well as the unified customs payment by shuttle traders, had to be paid in hard currencies. These provisions were abolished by October 1,2002, when the sum was declared the sole legal tender for all payments in Uzbekistan. 25. Uzbekistan retains a large number of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) or 3. These were identified by LEG during the September 2002 mission as follows: (i) a restriction arising from practical difficulties in obtaining foreign exchange; (ii) two MCPs arising from the segmentation of the exchange market in relation to the cash and OTC exchange rates, and the OTC and central bank exchange rates; (iii) a restriction on the percentage value of an advance payment in respect of an import contract; (iv) a quantitative restriction on the amount of an advance payment in respect of an import contract; (v) both a restriction and an MCP resulting from the requirement for an importer making an advance payment to make a non-remunerated deposit in an amount equal to 100 percent of the advance payment pending receipt of the import; (vi) a restriction prohibiting advance payments to any of 46 offshore zones; (vii) a restriction prohibiting any payment for services being made to any of 46 offshore zones; (viii) a restriction prohibiting payments to non-residents who are third parties to import contracts; (ix) a restriction affecting the amount of interest and other payments which can be made in respect of foreign borrowing; (x) a restriction affecting the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - ANNEX I purchase of foreign exchange on the OTC market if the purchaser owes tax or any other amount to the government; (xi) a restriction resulting from quarterly, quantitative, limits on purchases of cash foreign exchange by individuals; (xii) a restriction limiting the amount of foreign exchange which can be purchased by nonresident individuals to the amount previously exchanged for sums; (xiii) a quantitative restriction limiting purchases of foreign exchange depending on the country of destination; (xiv) an MCP resulting from the procedures applicable to payments by Uzbek residents for invisible expenses; and (xv) an apparent restriction prohibiting the conversion of sum proceeds of the sale of certain imports from Kazakhstan or the Kyrgyz Republic. In addition, a number of questions are outstanding on other potential exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices.

Since independence, Uzbekistan has borrowed both externally and, to a lesser extent, domestically, to meet its financing needs. However, the rise in the stock of debt in the late 1990s raised concerns regarding its sustainability. This increased indebtedness has been in the form of both government borrowing as well as external borrowing by the nongovernment sector (with government guarantees). In recognition of the growing risks, the Uzbek government has recently begun to follow a conservative borrowing strategy, mainly through limiting commitments and disbursements of new loans to correspond with repayments and reducing new government guarantees. As a result of this, as well as limited access to new lending, external debt repayments exceeded disbursements in 2002 for the first time since independence. 2. For the purposes of this analysis, the approach followed is based on the one set out in IMF publication “Assessing Sustainability” (N/02/166, May 28,2002). The external debt sustainability analysis covers debt incurred externally by domestic residents (in the case of Uzbekistan, mostly public and publicly-guaranteed debt), with variables expressed in U.S. dollar terms at the official exchange rate. It also takes a look at the implications of external borrowings on the gross external financing needs (defined as non-interest current account deficit, interest and amortization on medium- and long-term debt, and short-term debt at the end of the previous period) of the country. In addition, the analysis also presents results of a fiscal sustainability exercise (based on the accompanying Selected Issues paper). For the fiscal sustainability analysis, three indices-debt-to-GDP ratio, primary deficit as a percent of GDP, and debt service-to-revenue ratio-are analyzed. The sensitivity analysis for the fiscal sector is broader than recommended in SM/O2/166 as further tests that apply to Uzbekistan’s particular situation are also considered. A. External Debt The Baseline Scenario 3. Under the baseline scenario (Tables A-l and A-2), external debt appears to be sustainable. The baseline for the analysis is derived from the macro framework presented in the main text of the staff report, under the assumption that current policies are maintained. Thus, it is assumed that inflation would remain high, real GDP growth subdued, and that there will be sustained depreciation of the sum (relative to the U.S. dollar). The nominal interest rate is also assumed to be lower than the historical average, consistent with WE0 projections. The government is assumed to continue to follow its conservative external borrowing policy, which, in addition to limited access to new loans under current policies, leads to gross external financing needs declining from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to 2.1 percent in 2007. Projections of external debt under this baseline scenario suggest that the debt trajectory will be sustainable through the medium-term, with the debt-to-GDP ratio declining steadily from 45 percent in 2002 to 32 percent in 2007. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - ANNEX II Sensitivity Analysis 4. Sensitivity analysis reveals that while Uzbekistan’s external debt may be sustainable, the country may still face pressures should certain downside risks materialize. While certain stress tests may look too stringent, the volatility of economic variables experienced in the past in Uzbekistan do not suggest that such results can be fully excluded. For the purposes of the analysis, and consistent with debt sustainability analyses for other transition economies, historical averages (and standard deviations) were calculated for a five-year period (1997-200 1). 5. Replication of historical economic performance suggests that a worsening of debt dynamics is possible. If key variables grow at their historical averages in 2003-2007, the relevant debt ratio increases steadily to 72 percent of GDP, with the gross external financing need more than doubling to 13 percent of GDP.’ While there is no standard cut-off point for debt unsustainability, as such a threshold is contingent upon various country- specific factors, a recent analysis (SM/O2/166) indicates that the probability of a debt crisis may become a concern when debt stock exceeds 50 percent of GDP for a country with an exports-to-GDP ratio in the order of 30 percent, as is the case for Uzbekistan. 6. Temporary shocks increase the debt stock. For some of the tests-shocks to nominal interest rate and to real GDP growth-the debt ratios initially climb, but then decline to below 40 percent, with similar trajectories being observed in the gross external financing need. Negative shocks to the GDP deflator, however, result in an increase in the debt stock to nearly 90 percent of GDP. This is partly a result of a mechanical application of the stress test-as the standard deviation over the five-year period is quite high. While the stress test may be too strict, it may also be taken as evidence of the downside risks faced by Uzbekistan as the variability factors are derived from its own recent history. 7. The vulnerability of Uzbekistan’s ability to repay its debt is highlighted by the stress test on the external current account deficit. In the baseline scenario, Uzbekistan runs a current account surplus, an outcome of import compression and relatively higher exports receipts due to an increase in cotton and gold prices. Since these commodity prices are contingent upon various global political and economic factors, examining the risks posed to Uzbekistan by downturns in the prices of these key exports is central to a debt sustainability exercise. Accordingly, a negative shock on the current account balance is projected, reflecting a decline in the prices of export commodities (or, alternatively, a sharp increase in demand for imports, possibly resulting from the satisfaction of pent-up demand for imported products). Such a shock, even when limited only to 2003 and 2004, rapidly increases debt stock to above 50 percent of GDP; gross external financing need also increases rapidly to over 17 percent of GDP before declining to more manageable levels. This further ’ The variables include real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, changes in the GDP deflator in US dollar terms, and net FDI (non-debt creating capital inflows). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- ANNEX II illustrates the vulnerability of Uzbekistan, and, in particular, highlights the risks associated with a high degree of export dependence on only two commodities. A reform strategy that opened the economy to trade would also lead to a diversification in exports and in this way help mitigate Uzbekistan’s exposure to risks associated with volatility in cotton and gold prices. 8. Other external risks remain. The baseline scenario itself assumes nominal depreciation each year of around 30 percent. An increase in this rate of depreciation to 50 percent for one year would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio (by decreasing GDP expressed in U.S. dollars), but this ratio would subsequently decrease again to around 50 percent over time. B. Government and Government-Guaranteed Debt The Baseline Scenario 9. The baseline scenario also indicates a sustainable fiscal position in the medium term. Over the medium term, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to stabilize in the range of 23-26 percent of GDP and debt service obligations are expected to decline to about 6% percent of government revenue at the end of the projection period, after peaking at 9% percent in 2004 (Table A-3). These levels are not generally regarded as creating any fiscal vulnerabilities. 10. The total amount of government and government-guaranteed debt at end-2002 amounted to $4 billion, or about 42 percent of GDP.2 This comprised: (i) direct government debt equivalent to 18 percent of GDP, consisting mainly of external project loans used to finance the development of agriculture, public infrastructure, and other investment projects; and (ii) government-guaranteed external debt equivalent to 24 percent of GDP, mainly on-lent to large state enterprises. 11. The contingent liabilities deriving from government-guaranteed debt are very large. In 2002, debt service obligations guaranteed by the government amounted to $478 million (19.2 percent of government revenue); in 2003 they are projected to increase further to $574 million (27.3 percent of projected government revenue), before declining in 2004. However, most of the debt service on government-guaranteed debt has been paid by the enterprises themselves. In 2002, which was a particularly difficult year for state enterprises due to the real depreciation of the OTC exchange rate in 2001-02, the budget took responsibility for $68.3 million of debt service payments, which was equivalent to 14.3 percent of total government-guaranteed debt service obligations in that year. In the baseline scenario, this share is projected to decline to about 7% percent by 2007. 2 Including debt to the IMF.

The sensitivity analysis for fiscal sustainability focuses on the fiscal adjustments that would be required to keep the general government fiscal balance as under the baseline scenario, assuming the same financing constraints. This analysis suggests that the major risk is an increase in the degree of government participation in external debt service payments on govemment- guaranteed loans in the event that the financial condition of state enterprises that carry the government-guaranteed debt deteriorates in a significant way. If the share of govemment- guaranteed debt service obligations that the government needs to service would increase to 20 percent, a fiscal adjustment of about % percent of GDP is needed to keep within the existing financing limits. If this share rises to 30 percent, this adjustment would increase to about 1 percentage point. The 50 percent coverage test highlights the strain that contingent liabilities can impose on the budget as in this case the necessary adjustment would increase to 1 S-2 percent of GDP. 13. Other factors pose lower risks to fiscal vulnerability. More moderate risks are posed by a fall in cotton prices (or other major export products) and by an increase in international interest rates. In the latter case, an increase in the primary surplus by about % percent compared with the baseline scenario would be required. With growth rates as low as zero percent, the primary deficit would need to be only slightly higher than in the baseline scenario. A larger real depreciation would also have a moderate impact. While these results should be interpreted with care, the overall picture does not highlight major immediate risks to fiscal sustainability, aside from the contingent liabilities deriving from govemment- guaranteed debt. D. Conclusions 14. The evolutions of Uzbekistan’s external and fiscal debt-to-GDP ratios were examined over the medium-term under the baseline scenario and under various alternative scenarios. Although projections under the respective baseline scenarios do not give rise to any immediate concerns, moderate permanent shocks (commensurate with the country’s historical experience) as well as certain temporary shocks increase Uzbekistan’s debt ratios to levels considered potentially dangerous. This underscores the vulnerabilities that Uzbekistan still faces, even with a prudent external borrowing policy, and emphasizes the need for pursuing market-based reform policies that allow for the realization of the country’s growth potential. Over time, such policies would materially reduce the risks facing the economy.

Technical Assistance: Technical assistance and training have been provided by the Fund (MAE, FAD, STA, LEG, INS) to Uzbekistan in a number of areas. Bilateral donors and other international agencies, including the World Bank, the European Union, and the OECD, also have provided considerable technical assistance. Technical experts from a number of countries have accompanied Fund staff on technical assistance missions. The Fund intensified its program of technical assistance to Uzbekistan in 1994-97. However, in the past five years fewer requests for technical assistance have been received from the authorities. Additional technical assistance is needed in many areas, and follow-up technical assistance is envisaged on national accounts and price statistics, money and banking statistics and balance of payments statistics.

In particular, a member of LEG participated in the 2000 Article IV consultation mission to review the foreign exchange system, with a view to identifying the issues that needed to be addressed before Uzbekistan could accept the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF Articles of Agreement. In September 2002, another member of LEG conducted a similar review. Training Uzbek officials have participated in courses in Washington, at the Singapore Institute and at the Joint Vienna Institute in the areas of macroeconomic management, financial programming, taxation, public expenditure and treasury management, monetary statistics and policy, and balance of payments analysis. Courses on selected topics were also organized in Tashkent in June 1993, May 1994, and April/May 1998. 12. Resident Representative: The Fund’s first Resident Representative, Mr. Istvan Szalkai, was in Tashkent from September 1993 to September 1995. His successor, Mr. Mark O’Brien, served from November 1995 to December 1997. He was replaced by Mr. Christoph Rosenberg who served from January 1998 to April 200 1. Currently, the Fund does not have a resident representative in Uzbekistan, but maintains a locally staffed office in Tashkent. 13. Resident Advisors: Mr. Richard Grzebinski served as advisor on computerization to the State Tax Committee from January 1994 to January 1995. His successor, Mr. Emmanuel Sigler, served from April to June 1995. Mr. Alexander Agafonoff served as an advisor on monetary policy at the Central Bank of Uzbekistan from November 1994 to December 1995. Mr. Jim Stevenson began his service as an advisor on treasury operations at the Ministry of Finance in September 1996. His assignment was prematurely terminated in July 1998 because of a lack of cooperation by the Ministry of Finance. Mr. John Zohrab began his service as an advisor at the Ministry of Finance in February 2003 for an initial period of six months.

THE WORLD BANK (As of March 3 1,2003) 1. Uzbekistan became a member of the IBRD and IDA in September 1992, of the IFC in October 1993, and of the MIGA in November 1993. 2. The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering FY02-04 was discussed by the Bank’s Executive Directors in March 2002. It proposed two lending scenarios-a Low Case and a Base Case. The Low Case, totaling US$lSO million, focuses on social, environmental and disaster mitigation issues. The Base Case, totaling US$300-350 million, emphasizes an accelerated program of reforms. Policy actions in five key areas would be required to achieve Base Case lending: (1) foreign exchange regime; (2) private and financial sector development; (3) agriculture; (4) poverty alleviation including preparation of a I-PRSP; and (5) public governance and transparency. The Base Case does not provide for adjustment lending. If the government establishes a track record of credible macroeconomic and structural reforms supported by an IMF financial arrangement, a CAS Update will be submitted to the Board with a recommended strategic response. Starting with the FY02-04 CAS, Uzbekistan will be accessing both IBRD and IDA resources. An IDA Eligibility Paper was transmitted to the Bank’s Executive Directors in December 200 1. 3. As of March 3 1,2003,12 IBRD loans and one IDA credit had been committed, namely: Institution Building Technical Assistance (US$2 1 million, approved October 1993, fully disbursed and closed in October 2000); Rehabilitation (US$l60 million, approved March 1995, fully disbursed and closed in June 1996, but performance rated unsatisfactory); Cotton Subsector Improvement (US$66 million, approved May 1995 and closed in June 2002); Pilot Water Supply’ (US$5 million, approved September 1996); Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Health (US$75 million, approved August 1997); Tashkent Solid Waste (US$24 million, approved May 1998); Enterprise Institution Building (US$28 million, approved June 1998); Health (US$30 million, approved September 1998); Financial Institution Building (US$25 million, approved May 1999); Urban Transport (US$29 million, approved May 2000); Rural Enterprise Support (US$36.14 million, approved December 200 1); Bukhara/Samarkand Loan (US$20 million, approved March 2002; and BukharaSamarkand Credit (SDR20 million, approved March 2002). 4. The undisbursed balance of nine effective ongoing loans was US$206 million as of March 3 1,2003. Preparation of proposed loans for the Drainage, Karshi Pumping Station Rehabilitation, Public Finance Management Technical Assistance, and Health II projects is currently underway. ’ Subsequently subsumed and refinanced under the US$75 million Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Health loan approved in August 1997.

The Bank’s non-lending activities have included a living standards/poverty assessment (FY03), a country economic memorandum (FY03), a social and structural policy review (FYOO), a country procurement assessment (FY02), a series of economic notes on social costs of currency convertibility, competition policy and foreign exchange regime (FYOO-02) and environmental management (FYOO). Presently several economic reports are under preparation-a financial accountability assessment (FY03), anti-corruption diagnostic surveys (FY04) and an energy sector review (FY04). 6. The International Finance Corporation has focused its activities on developing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and strengthening financial markets. Four SME credit line facilities have been approved, including two with small private regional banks. Technical assistance for pre- and post-investment support is being provided to SME borrowers. Other approved IFC investments are in the pharmaceutical industry, furniture manufacturing, granite processing, and cheese production. In the financial sector, emphasis has been placed on the creation of a strong and competitive private banking sector. IFC has approved an equity investment in ABN-AMRO Bank Uzbekistan and a technical assistance component to two local banks to assist them in becoming more efficient and prudent financial intermediaries. Leasing activities have been a priority with assistance given to draft the law on leasing and IFC investments in two joint-venture leasing companies. A regional early stage equity investment fund is being developed by IFC and SEAF, a leading manager of small equity funds. II. THEEUROPEANBANKFORRECONSTRUCTIONANDDEVELOPMENT (EBRD) (As of March 3 1,2003) 7. Uzbekistan became a member of the EBRD in 1992. A new Country Strategy covering the period 2003-2005 was approved in March 2003. The Strategy notes the difficult investment environment, which limits the extent to which the EBRD can support private sector investment in line with its mandate. At the same time, it charts a cautious approach towards public sector lending by the EBRD, taking into account the fragile macroeconomic situation with increasing external debt levels and the need to achieve strong progress in structural reform (“transition impact”) against the background of uneven progress in the transition so far. The new strategy highlights several benchmarks for progress in political and economic reforms and intends to review the progress made towards these benchmarks within one year in the context of its Country Strategy Update. 8. The EBRD’s cumulative commitments of EUR 612 million are concentrated in three areas: financial institutions (34 percent), natural resources (27 percent), and transport (23 percent). Most of the Bank’s funding is in the form of debt (95 percent of the Bank’s portfolio in Uzbekistan) with only EUR 3 1 million in equity investment. The current disbursement ratio is 55 percent of total commitments. Overall, EBRD’s portfolio is performing well, with the exception of two private sector operations, one in textiles and one in construction materials. With 54 percent of EBRD financing in the private sector, the Bank’s operations in Uzbekistan are below the target ratio of 60 percent, reflecting the difficulties of finding strategic sponsors to invest in the country.

In 1999, the Board of Governors of the EBRD decided to hold the Bank’s 2003 Annual Meeting in Tashkent, scheduled for May 4-5. III. THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (AsDB) (As of March 3 1,2003) 10. Uzbekistan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1995. The current operational strategy is to: (i) manage transition through support for basic reforms and minimizing the social costs of transition; and (ii) enhance the potential for growth through regional cooperation, investment in the rural sector, and direct support for the private sector. At the same time, recent emerging priorities of the government, including assistance to the drought-affected areas of western Uzbekistan, the health sector, and mitigation of the social costs of macroeconomic and structural reforms are also proposed to be addressed within the scope of the existing operational strategy. 11. As of March 3 1,2003, AsDB had approved 15 loans amounting to US$675.5 million from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) and US$20 million from the concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF). Disbursements in 2001 totaled US$40.1 million and in 2002, as of November 30, it totaled US$ 28.0 million. Since 1998, Uzbekistan has been classified as a Group C country which makes it eligible for OCR loans only. Loans have been provided for: (i) rural/agricultural development; (ii) social infrastructure, in particular education and water supply; (iii) railways and road rehabilitation and modernization; (iv) regional power transmission; and (v) SME development. the financial sector. In addition, AsDB has extended technical assistance amounting to US$24.13 million for 43 projects. 12. Support for policy reforms in sectors critical for Uzbekistan’s successful transition to a market-oriented economy is a vital component of AsDB’s lending operations in Uzbekistan. AsDB’s approach has been to target assistance to those sectors where the government has shown demonstrable commitment to reform. So far, AsDB has approved one policy-based sector development program loan in the education sector (US$70 million). In addition, policy dialogue is an important feature in all of AsDB’s loan projects in Uzbekistan. This includes reform of the state procurement system in the cotton and grain sub-sectors of agriculture under the Ak Altin Agriculture Development project and strengthening the regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing under the small and microfinance development project. 13. AsDB’s regional cooperation program complements its country-level operations. AsDB support for regional economic cooperation in Central Asia began in 1997. Its focus has been on priority regional issues such as transport and trade facilitation and the rational use of vital water and energy resources. A number of investment projects have been developed in the areas of transport, trade facilitation and energy. These projects are at various stages of preparation for implementation, including the Central Asia power transmission system modernization project and customs modernization and cooperation project. AsDB has also provided targeted assistance in areas with significant and direct poverty reduction impact Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - APPENDIX II such as cooperation in education and addressing micro-nutrient deficiency of mothers and children which covers six countries in the region, including Uzbekistan. 14. AsDB’s non-lending activities support: (i) institutional strengthening and capacity building in key areas of the public and private sectors that would have a catalytic role in furthering reforms; in particular, promoting improvements in finance and trade policy, public and corporate governance, and land management; (ii) human development through improving the efficiency and transparency of institutions providing education and other social infrastructure services, including targeted poverty reduction and promotion of gender equality; and (iii) the fostering of regional cooperation and environmental preservation and management. AsDB is also providing technical assistance to develop a comprehensive medium-term strategy for improving living standards, building on the World Bank’s Living Standard Assessment. The resulting strategy is expected to be an important element in discussions that could lead to a poverty partnership agreement in late 2003.

In the area of national accounts, the Uzbek statistical authorities have made some progress in developing statistics that are compatible with SNA standards, with technical assistance provided by the OECD and the Fund and following the guidelines of the CIS statistical committee. 2. A number of deficiencies were identified by a STA mission that visited Tashkent in February 1998. These include an overestimation of real GDP growth rates in past years due to a number of factors, including: (i) the inconsistent treatment of informal sector activities over time; (ii) inappropriate procedures for dealing with the increased share of high value commodities with low trade margins in organized retail turnover;’ and (iii) the use of the downward biased consumer price index as a deflator for trade activities and subsidies. While the staff have made independent estimates for 1997-2002, the data base is insufficient to prepare estimates for the preceding years. Serious problems also persist at the level of primary data, which continue to be collected and processed following statistical methodologies of the former centrally planned economy. Divergences between official data on real growth and staff estimates increased further in 2002. 3. The February 1998 STA mission also identified a significant downward bias in the consumer price index owing to an incorrect methodological treatment of prices of all goods that are temporarily unavailable, including seasonal products. This resulted in a major difference between official and Fund staff estimates for food price increases in the capital, Tashkent, although both sets of calculations were based on identical raw data supplied by the authorities. STA has recommended that the authorities recalculate the consumer price index from January 1997 using the correct methodology. However, material differences between the official estimates of food price increases and those prepared by Fund staff persisted. In September 2002, the authorities revised the inflation data for the first eight months of 2002, and the resulting increase in the CPI became closer to the staffs alternative estimate. Divergences between official data on inflation and staff estimates reappeared at year-end. 4. Further deficiencies have been identified in the methodology used to compute sectoral deflators, while no price indices for imports, exports, and investment exist. Although the authorities have made substantial progress in constructing a producer price index, the enterprise and product coverage should be expanded. ’ The Uzbek statistical authorities estimate output of retail trade in constant prices by using a volume index for total retail turnover rather than disaggregated retail turnover volume indices. This method does not take account of changes in the commodity structure of trade. As the share of high-value commodities with low trade margins (automobiles) increases, it results in an overstatement of growth in retail trade.

Regarding data on external trade, exports of cotton and other bulk exports are valued on a c.i.f. basis rather than f.o.b., and no adjustments are made to capture informal cross- border trade and shuttle trade. Also, two parallel systems now exist for compiling trade data-one based on customs declarations and the other based on enterprise surveys. STA has recommended that the customs data be used for compiling merchandise trade statistics whereas the enterprise reports be used to collect data on trade in services only. Government finance 6. Detailed data on revenues and expenditures of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds are compiled by the Ministry of Finance on a monthly basis, and these are available after a processing time of about three weeks. The authorities provide the Fund staff data on the state budget execution on a regular basis, but only broad categories for revenue and expenditures of the major extrabudgetary funds are provided regularly. 7. When available, detailed data on the components of state-budget expenditure are organized according to the largely functional classification. An economic classification of expenditure data is available only annually, and the quality of these data is inadequate. Detailed data on revenue and expenditure of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds often include items that should be classified as financing (e.g., credit repayments). The Ministry of Finance has started to provide occasionally data on tax and expenditure arrears. The authorities have also started to provide information on total proceeds from privatization operations. A FAD mission visited Tashkent in October 2002 to undertake a public expenditure management review. As a follow up, FAD sent a resident advisor in February 2003 to assist the authorities in developing efficient expenditure management procedures, including budget and treasury reforms 8. Uzbekistan does not report government finance statistics to STA. As a result, a country page in the International Finance Statistics (IFS) or Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) cannot be prepared as yet. Money and banking 9. Following the introduction of new charts of accounts for the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) and for the commercial banks in 1997, a number of monetary and financial statistics missions have assisted the CBU in compiling monetary statistics using data from the new charts of accounts and in accordance with the IMF recommended methodology. With the implementation of major recommendations of these missions, considerable progress was made in resolving issues linked to the preparation of monetary and financial statistics for eventual inclusion in a proposed Uzbekistan page in IFS. Balance of payments and external debt 10. Uzbekistan does not report any balance of payments data to STA. Therefore, balance of payments data cannot be disseminated in the IFS or the Balance ofpayments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY). A STA mission that visited in March 2000, as a follow-up to the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - APPENDIX III February 1998 mission, reported that the authorities have made considerable progress in the compilation of balance of payments statistics. Progress was noted in the compilation of data on the financial account and external debt. Additionally, there was an increased interest and cooperation on the part of all institutions to work jointly to improve the compilation of the balance of payments. Specific improvements were made in accordance with the recommendations of the February 1998 mission. These include the preparation of balance of payments data on a quarterly basis in U.S. dollars, the classification of which conforms closely with the recommendations of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual (BPMS), shuttle trade statistics in the recorded international trade data, estimates for migrant transfers, and other adjustments to the exports and imports data. Despite these improvements, some problems remain with respect to the understanding of travel data and construction services, and the unavailability of enterprise data on direct portfolio and other investment. 11. Data provision on external debt has improved considerably in 2002 and is broadly satisfactory. Data on the external debt owed or guaranteed by the government is decomposed by currency. Loan-by-loan data are provided in the currency of denomination. The data are submitted on a quarterly frequency, though often with some delay. Aggregate data are decomposed into government and government-guaranteed debt and then further classified by type of lender (multilateral, bilateral, and commercial). However, the authorities do not indicate separately the amount of debt extended on concessional terms, or the amount of private debt owed or intermediated by banks. The data includes projections of future debt service obligations under existing agreements. 12. Data on external debt guaranteed by the government, including projections of future debt service obligations and new loan agreements, are provided by the central bank. Aggregate data is submitted on a quarterly basis, while loan-by-loan data is submitted on a yearly basis. In addition, debt projections should distinguish between the debt service obligations due under existing agreements and those arising from debt that has not yet been contracted.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Uzbekistan On [May 19, 20031, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Uzbekistan.’ Background Since Uzbekistan became independent in September 1991, only limited progress has been made in making the transition to a market economy. Taking advantage of the post-September II international interest and improved security in the region, the authorities elaborated, in consultation with IMF staff, a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in early 2002, covering the period January I-August 31,2002, which aimed at stabilizing the economy and accelerating the transition to a market economy. From mid-2002, the authorities introduced wide-ranging external and domestic trade restrictions that offset the benefits of reforms already implemented. According to official data, real GDP grew by 4 percent, the same as in 2001. Favorable weather conditions contributed to a bumper grain harvest but trade activities contracted as a result of the new restrictions. Official data showed that consumer price inflation in 2002 declined to about 21 percent from 27 percent in 2001. However, alternative staff estimates suggest that real GDP growth in 2002 fell to about 3 percent and that consumer price inflation ran at a rate of 27 percent. The external current account balance is estimated to have turned into a surplus of 2% percent of GDP (from a deficit of 1 percent in 2001) as a result of a strong ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [May 19,2003] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Exports other than of cotton and gold declined considerably due to the restrictive business environment, despite a real effective exchange rate depreciation of almost 11 percent. The government followed prudent fiscal and monetary policies in 2002. Overall, the general government deficit rose slightly to 1.8 percent of GDP from 1.5 percent in 2001. Tax performance weakened because of lower collection ratios of the profit tax, VAT, and property taxes, largely reflecting changes in tax policy. Monetary policy was tightened considerably, in line with the authorities’ objective of lowering inflation. Broad money growth was sharply reduced to less than 30 percent in 2002 from 54 percent in 2001 through a strict control of reserve money growth. Financial intermediation remained inadequate, as problems with cash withdrawals remained despite the ample liquidity of commercial banks. Steps were taken to liberalize the foreign exchange regime in 2002 and early 2003. The spread between the curb market and the over-the-counter (OTC) market exchange rate-a key indicator of foreign exchange market liberalization under the SMP-was reduced from 120 percent in early January 2002, to less than 10 percent by mid-April 2003. However, this decline in the spread partly reflected the negative impact of external trade restrictions on the demand for foreign exchange. As some restrictions on access to foreign exchange remained, transaction volumes on the OTC market in 2002 did not increase as expected. State procurement prices for grain and cotton were raised and measures were introduced to allow farmers to dispose freely of 50 percent of their wheat and cotton crop. However, there were signs of difficulties in implementing these reforms in the cotton sector. The number of price controls was substantially reduced in 2002 and utility tariffs increased in a multi-year program to improve cost recovery. The business environment remained difficult, with confidence shaken by government steps in late 2002 to increase government control over activities of already privatized enterprises.
