The staff team included Messrs. Nashashibi (head) and Gardner, Mses. Sampic and Tumbarello (all MED), Mr. Milesi-Ferretti @ES), and Ms. Vimond (MED, administrative assistant). The mission met with Minister Oualalou (economy and finance), Governor Seqat (Bank Al-Maghrib), Minister Alioua (social development, solidarity, and employment), Minister Aouad (economic projections and planning), Minister El Midaoui (interior), Minister Filali (public sector and privatization), Minister Houssine (public administration and administrative reform), Minister Lahlimi (in charge of the general affairs of the government), Minister Sebbar (tourism), Minister Tazi (industry, commerce, and handicrafts), and Mr. Azoulay (Counselor to the King). Mr. Dan-i, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco, participated in all the meetings. The staff also met with public officials from various ministries and with representatives of the business and banking communities. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation, on June 9, 1999, Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management but were concerned about the low rate of growth and its social implications, and encouraged the authorities to proceed more forcefully on structural reforms. Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg had served Morocco well by providing a firm nominal anchor and by enforcing fiscal discipline. However, some Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to consider a more flexible exchange rate strategy. Morocco has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4. The principal authors of this report are Messrs. Nashashibi and Gardner.

On the positive side, there was a strong recovery of gross fixed capital formation and inflation has been stabilized at about 2 percent, and tourism receipts have risen markedly. The current account deficit was kept under 1 percent of GDP, and official reserves have been buoyed by the granting of a 2”d mobile phone license to a foreign-led consortium. However, export performance remains below its potential, undermined by a real appreciation of the Moroccan dirham of some 19 percent since 1990. The underlying fiscal deficit for FY 199912000 is expected to widen (to 4.9 percent of GDP) relative to the previous year, mostly on account of the nonrenewal of the fisheries agreement with the European Union (EU). Some of the revenue generated by the 2”d mobile phone license has been earmarked for additional investment spending in priority sectors, starting in 2000. Bank Al-Maghrib (central bank) had difficulties mopping up the liquidity injection from the mobile phone license; money market rates fell at one point to 2.5 percent but they have since returned to the 5-6 percent range. Structural reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and growth have proceeded, including on judicial and customs reform, the legal and administrative framework for private sector activity, governance, and labor market training and intermediation, The Association Agreement with the EU came into effect on March 1,2000, with the elimination of tariffs on imports of capital goods and tariff reduction on other goods, Policy issues Raising growth to a sustained rate of 6 percent is a precondition for reducing unemployment and poverty. The authorities intend to achieve this objective through continued structural reforms, fiscal deficit reduction, and increased public investment. However, present policies are not consistent with these objectives in terms of both budgetary developments and the pace of structural reforms. The transitional budget for the second half of 2000 envisages a widening of the fiscal deficit to over 7.5 percent of GDP on an annualized basis, on account of increased investment (including drought-related measures), but also wage increases, which will keep the wage bill to well over 12 percent of GDP for the next few years. In the absence of any offsetting tax measure, the underlying fiscal deficit is set to deteriorate significantly. Privatization revenues expected over the next few years will reduce the government’s borrowing requirement, but they might also be the occasion for deferring adjustment. It would be desirable to use these exceptional resources to finance budgetary and structural reforms (i.e., civil service retrenchment and price liberalization in agriculture and in basic food staples) that will reduce the underlying deficit over the medium term, making room for pressing social and infrastructure expenditure requirements. To jump start growth, budgetary consolidation would have to be accompanied by faster and deeper structural reforms (e.g., labor market, trade regime, and agricultural policies) as well as an exchange rate policy which would restore competitiveness and maintain it over time.

The smooth transition and gradual political opening that began with the electoral victory of a coalition of former opposition parties in November 1997 and continued with the accession of Mohammed VI to the throne have allayed concerns about the stability of the political system. The new king’s call for improved governance and greater attention to social issues has raised expectations of more fundamental changes. The human rights situation has improved markedly and, in this more open environment, civil society is thriving. Still, the process of political transition is far from complete. In this context and in the face of conflicting pressures, the government’s concern with consensus building and with avoiding social conflict has been translated into a slower pace of economic reform than warranted by pressing employment needs and by budgetary pressures. 2. Meanwhile, the social and economic situation has continued to deteriorate. The decline in trend growth observed during the 1990s (to less than 3 percent presently), combined with a rapid rise in the working age population (3% percent per year in urban areas) have resulted in growing unemployment, which reached 23 percent in urban areas in the 4” quarter of 1999. In rural areas, the lack of work opportunities manifests itself more in the form of underemployment than unemployment and in a steady stream of migration to urban areas. At the national level, the poverty rate, as measured by the Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMV), has increased from 13 percent in 1990/91 to 19 percent in 1998/99. Other social indicators have improved over the last decade, but they remain quite weak, with an illiteracy rate of 47 percent compared with an average of 16 percent for middle income countries. A. Economic Developments in 1999 3. A cereal crop failure due to drought conditions and the ensuing decline in private consumption resulted in a contraction of overall GDP in 1999 (-0.7 percent) and in a rise in urban unemployment rate by nearly 3 percentage points from the 4* quarter of 1998 (Chart 1). On the positive side, the strong recovery in gross fixed capital formation that began in 1998 continued into 1999, raising the investment rate to 24 percent of GDP. However, this increase reflected in part lumpy purchases of transportation, power generating and telecommunication equipment, and it is not clear whether trend investment is on an upswing. 4. CPI inflation remained low at 2.0 percent (excluding food) in 1999 (Chart 2). Because of a significant decline in food prices that reflects, with a lag, the good crop of 1998 and food imports, the overall CPI actually rose by only 0.7 percent. The incomplete pass through of the hike in international oil prices also contributed to containing price inflation. Notwithstanding this strong performance in price stabilization, the CPI-based real effective real exchange rate appreciated by nearly 1 percent.’ ’ The appreciation reflects an even better price performance by industrial countries and some large depreciations of trading partners’ currencies among developing countries.

The trade deficit widened mostly on account of a deterioration in the terms of trade, but thanks to strong tourism receipts the current account deficit only widened from 0.4 percent of GDP in 1998 to 0.8 percent of GDP in 1999. The granting of a Yd mobile phone (Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)) license to a foreign-led consortium attracted over US$l billion in private capital inflows (3.2 percent of GDP), raising offkial reserves to US$5.8 billion in December 1999 (six months of imports). Outside of this operation, foreign direct investment remained relatively small. Under Morocco’s fixed exchange rate regime, the real effective exchange rate has tended to appreciate, although at a more moderate pace in recent years because of the decline in domestic inflation. Nevertheless, since 1990, the cumulative appreciation until end-l 999 has reached 19 percent (Chart 3). B. Policy Developments in 1999 6. The central government budget deficit was reduced to 2.5 percent of GDP in FY 1998/99 (ending June 30,1999) from 3.4 percent in PY 1997/98, thanks to strong revenues, buoyed by tax settlements related to a tax amnesty and to exceptional dividend payments from public enterprises (Chart 4). However, the underlying deficit (excluding cyclical effects and one-off revenues and expenditures) widened to 4.5 percent of GDP. 7. The FY 1999/2000 budget targeted a deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP or 3.7 percent when including the expected revenue from the 20d GSM license. The budget was based on conservative tax revenue projections, the nonrenewal of the fisheries agreement with the European Union (EU) (DH 1.5 billion), and expenditure growth of about 5 percent in nominal terms, relative to the previous year’s budget. The wage bill was set to increase by 4.5 percent. 8. Budgetary execution through December 1999 was broadly on track. Corporate tax receipts were particularly robust, despite the slowdown in growth, reflecting the accounting restructuring linked to the tax amnesty of the previous year and better targeting of tax audits. By contrast, customs revenues declined, owing to a change in the composition of imports toward (less protected) capital goods. On the expenditure side, budget implementation went according to plan; some saving was realized on food subsidies on account of weak domestic cereal production.’ 2 Because of the price differential between domestic and (cheaper) imported cereals, the subsidy element is positively correlated with the level of domestic production. However, budgetary savings on account of droughts are offset in part by higher expenditure on drought relief.

The treasury made impressive strides toward modernizing its liquidity and debt management during 1999 and virtually eliminated domestic payments arrears, which had been used as a short-term financing instrument and stood at 3.8 percent of GDP at the end of 1998. In June 1999, the treasury also converted into treasury bills a central bank advance dating back to 1995, and it is now committed to meeting its short-term financing needs through market borrowing.3 The development of the government bond market has enabled the authorities to pursue the substitution of external debt with domestic debt. Thus, while the overall government debt ratio has remained on a downward path (76 percent of GDP in 1999 compared with 83 percent in 1995), the domestic debt ratio has been on the rise (40 percent of GDP in 1999 compared with 36 percent in 1995). 10. The success of the granting of the 2”d GSM license owes much to the transparent and open bidding conditions in which it took place. By royal instruction, the unbudgeted portion of the GSM revenue (DH 6.8 billion equivalent to 2 percent of GDP) was earmarked to the creation of a special fund’ (Hassan II Fund) for the financing of investment projects in selected priority areas, such as development of tourism and industrial zones, highways, irrigation and rural development, as seed money to induce private sector investment5 While investment projects were being identified, the treasury decided to use GSM receipts to draw down domestic debt, through early repayments and by refraining temporarily from any new domestic borrowing. 11. Monetary policy management was dominated by the challenge of mopping up the liquidity injection from the 2’d GSM license inflows. In the months following the conversion of the outstanding central bank advance into treasury bonds, the central bank sold its entire stock of securities (DH 5 billion) to withdraw excess liquidity. Nonetheless, in the absence of other instruments of intervention and because of the sheer magnitude of the cash inflow, money market rates fell at one point to 2.5 percent. Unable to tighten monetary conditions through other means, the central bank introduced an open deposit facility at an interest rate of 4.5 percent and tightened reserve requirement rules, moving from a monthly 3 Under the central bank statutes, the treasury still has access to an interest-free advance equivalent to 10 percent of the previous year’s ordinary revenues, which it uses in full. 4 While the fund is extrabudgetary, it is included within the overall budgetary framework and it is managed by the treasury. 5 The distribution of funds is as follows: DH 0.5 billion for tourism, DH 0.5 billion for industry, DH 1 billion for highways, DH 1.2 billion for agriculture and rural projects, DH 0.25 billion for fisheries, DH 0.35 billion for social measures, DH 1.8 billion for housing, DH 0.2 billion for information technology, DH 0.4 billion for cultural projects, DH 0.25 for sports infrastructure, DH 0.1 billion for microcredit, and DH 0.28 billion yet to be allocated.

With the return of the treasury to the primary market toward year-end, money market rates increased to the level prevailing earlier in 1999 (5-6 percent), but have remained volatile (Chart 5). 12. Monetary aggregates grew at a rapid pace in 1999, accelerating in the second half of the year on account of the liquidity injection from the GSM inflows, and overshooting the target growth rate of 7-8 percent (broad money grew by 10 percent through the year). Credit to the private sector continued to expand at a sustained pace of over 10 percent, despite the weak growth performance, but in line with the observed surge in investment. 13. The first stage of trade liberalization with the EU only came into effect on March 1,2000, due to the late ratification of the Association Agreement with the EU (AAEU) by some EU member states. Because of its phasing, trade liberalization with the EU implies an increase in effective protection over the first three years of the agreement, with potential diversion of resources toward capital intensive activities. Although tariffs were lowered on some capital and intermediate goods on July 1, 1999, Morocco’s trade barriers remain quite high, with an average most favored-nations (MFN) tariff rate of 3 1.6 percent.6 14. The pace of structural reforms was slowed down by legislative delays (notably on privatization) and some hesitancy in taking key decisions. A substantial number of legislative changes were introduced that improve the overall investment environment (Box l), and the debate continued on some of the major outstanding issues such as agricultural price liberalization and labor market reform, but no major decisions were taken on either count. Growing awareness of the shortcomings of the civil service prompted the government to adopt measures to improve its functioning and to limit scope for corruption and abuse. However, little progress was made toward the formulation of a civil service reform based on the diagnostic study conducted in 1999. The privatization program slowed 6 Unweighted average based on six-digit tariff level, including the fiscal duty that has been incorporated into the tariff structure. Subsidized food products are also subject to surcharges (rkpivalents tarz$zires) raising the tariff to over 100 percent in order to attain parity with producer prices. Outside of agricultural products for which special tariffs apply, there are six tariff bands, ranging from 0 to 50 percent. Nontariff barriers exist in the form of reference prices and license requirements for specific goods on health and security grounds. Combined with moderate nontariff barriers, this gives Morocco a trade restrictiveness rating of 8, on a scale of 10, with respect to the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index. Under the AAEU, tariffs on capital goods are reduced to zero at the outset (March 1,2000), those on selected industrial goods that do not compete with domestic products are reduced by 25 percent annually and phased out over four years starting in March 2000, while those on industrial goods that compete with domestic products are phased out over a ten-year period starting in March 2003.

This, nonetheless, allowed to lay the ground for major operations in 2000 (Maroc Telecom and Royal Air Maroc); and a new privatization law came into effect in May 1999, broadening the scope of the privatization program and simplifying its procedures. 15. The banking sector remains generally sound, although nonperforming loans have increased to 14.2 percent of total credits (6.8 percent, net of provisions) and some public sector banks are still undercapitalized, notably the C&lit immobilier et hatelier (CIH). The bulk of nonperforr@g loans is located in two public sector banks. Because of increasing competition, profit margins have been squeezed, albeit it from a relatively high level. The restructuring of public sector banks has proceeded with a rehabilitation plan for the CIH, and the draft plans for the restructuring of the agricultural bank (Caisse nationale de crCdit agricole (CNCA)). 16. External public debt was reduced to USN7.5 billion (50 percent of GDP) at the end of 1999, from US$19.3 billion a year earlier. Active external debt management (refinancing of more expensive debt, early repayments, and debt-equity conversions), and a concerted effort to replace foreign with domestic debt have contributed to reducing external debt and debt service, although about half of the reduction of the debt in U.S. dollar terms in 1999 reflects the appreciation of the dollar, The October 1999 decision by the Paris Club to raise the ceiling on debt-equity swaps from 20 percent to 30 percent of eligible debt opens the door for a third round of debt reduction of some US$lSO million owed to France and Spain. Some US$450 million of debt owed to other Paris Club creditors could become the object of similar operations. Despite the efforts made to reduce the debt burden, Morocco’s external debt service remains relatively high at 30 percent of exports of goods and services (25 percent when including workers’ remittances). Although the Moroccan dirham is fully convertible for nonresidents, portfolio inflows remain modest, and the growing domestic government debt market has not yet attracted any significant participation from foreign investors, possibly reflecting the fact that Morocco has not yet received an investment-grade rating. C. Prospects for 2000 17. Prospects for a strong recovery in growth have been severely compromised by a worsening drought.’ Activity will be sustained by a rise in public investment and by the pickup of economic activity in Europe, but overall GDP is unlikely to grow by more than 2.5 percent The textile and garment industry, a traditional exporter focussed on the Europe& market, has been experiencing an acute recession due to the appreciation of the dirham vis-A- vis the euro and has proposed to the government various remedial actions including a tax 7 Agriculture and fisheries accounted for 15 percent of nominal GDP in 1999.

The adverse terms of trade shock stemming from oil price developments should result in a deterioration in the external current account deficit, which should rise to about 2 percent of GDP. 18. In the context of the social dialogue with labor unions, it was agreed that the minimum wage (salaire minimum interprofessionnelgaranti) will be raised by 10 percent beginning July 1,200O. This was defended by the authorities on the grounds that no increase in the minimum wage was granted since 1996. The increase will have a small negative impact on the budget and mostly raise the costs of labor intensive industries, including the textile industry although enforcement of the minimum wage is quite weak in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 19. The budget deficit for the current fiscal year (ending June 30,200O) is projected at 4.8 percent of GDP (excluding GSM revenues and spending by the Hassan II Fund), in line with the original budget. Savings from lower food subsidies and higher dividend payments from state enterprises are expected to compensate for higher capital spending, stemming largely from one-off drought-related measures. The underlying deficit is expected to widen anew, to 4.9 percent of GDP, on account of the structural decline in customs receipts and the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with the EU. The authorities decided to return to calendar year budgeting starting in 2001 and to adopt a six-month transition budget for the second half of 2000.8 II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 20. Morocco’s rising unemployment and poverty resulting from lackluster growth were at the center of the discussions. For the first time, net job creation was negative both in 1998 and in 1 999.v While Morocco was among the best growth performers among its southern Mediterranean partners in the 1970s and 198Os, it fell near the bottom of the list in the 1990s (Box 2). A more frequent occurrence of droughts contributed to the stagnation of output in the primary sector since 1990, but the situation in agriculture has been aggravated by a price support system promoting crops, notably cereals, that are particularly vulnerable to Morocco’s drought conditions. The absence of growth in agriculture has, in turn, constrained * It had been thought that the switch to July-June fiscal years in 1996 would improve the budget process by synchronizing it with the agricultural season. However, the advantages proved to be questionable compared with the statistical problems that ensued. v It is estimated that the economy lost 55,000 jobs in 1998, and that between the 4” quarter of 1998 and the 4* quarter of 1999, there was an additional loss of 80,000 jobs (Direction de la statistique).

Morocco: Economic Growth Morocco’s growth rate during the past three decades has declined from 5.7 percent in the 1970s to 2.3 percent in the 1990s. As a result, Morocco has lost ground vis-a-vis other countries in the region (Table A). Growth in the agricultural sector has contributed to this negative trend, but nonagricultural GDP growth in the 1990s has also been modest (Table B)-lower than the increase of working age population in urban areas (3.6 percent).

The volatility of growth in agriculture has increased from 10 percent in the 1970s to 40 percent in the 1990s (Table B), as rainfall has become more erratic and as a larger share of cereals has been planted in rainfed areas because of high support prices. As a result, the standard deviation of growth during the 1990s has been 6.3 percent, high by international (and regional) standards, The inadequacy of growth is reflected in the steady increase in the unemployment rate and poverty levels. During 1998 and 1999, there was a net reduction in urban employment, notwithstanding positive nonagricultural GDP growth-a development that can be associated with a process of substitution of capital for labor. Looking ahead, given the projected annual growth rate in the urban workforce (which could exceed 3.5 percent), and an elasticity of urban employment with respect to output of about 0.7 (the average for the high growth years in Morocco), nonagricultural GDP growth of at least 5 percent would be needed simply to absorb new workers. Generating further job creation so as to reduce unemployment would require even higher growth. In order to achieve these higher growth rates Morocco will have to rely on developing its export potential, given the limited scope for reviving domestic demand through fiscal or monetary policy. In a small open economy such as Morocco, the external sector can act as an important source of growth and technological progress. However, even though the external accounts do not show signs of serious imbalances, export growth has been lackluster (Box 3). In a forward-looking sense, Morocco’s tariff reductions, the elimination of textile quotas under the WTO, and the need for multilateral trade liberalization will further erode Morocco’s competitiveness.

The authorities also pointed out the adverse effects of the increase in external debt service after the end of the Paris Club rescheduling agreements in 1993 and of the lower growth of Europe in the 1990s. The mission noted that these external constraints on growth had been compounded by a weakening of external competitiveness, as revealed by the losses in export market shares observed in the 1990s and the fact that export growth (4.7 percent over the last decade) was about half of that of developing countries (Box 3 and Chart 6). This loss in competitiveness is also evident in the appreciation of the REER-which does not appear to have been offset by adequate increases in productivity, as indicated by manufacturing surveys conducted by the ministry of industry. The mission also questioned whether the recent surge in investment would be sustained beyond the need to replace aging equipment. 21. With the urban working age population growing at about 3.5 percent a year, doubling the rate of growth to about 6 percent on a sustained basis becomes an economic imperative to prevent further increases in unemployment and poverty. The mission stressed that restoring competitiveness in the traded goods sector and preparing it for free trade with the EU were essential preconditions to reverse the downward trend growth. Improved sectoral policies, notably in agriculture, tourism, and in the housing sector, could help unleash a supply response. An added stimulus could be expected from increased public investment in infrastructure, which can catalyze additional private investments. However, in view of the medium-term fiscal consolidation objectives, domestic consumption could not be counted on as a source of growth. A. Medium-Term Framework 22. The authorities’ five-year plan covering 2000-04 is committed to raising average annual growth to about 5 percent, based on a three-point increase in the domestic saving and investment rates by 2004. The underlying fiscal objective is to reduce the deficit to about 1 percent of GDP by 2004, based on a 2 percentage point reduction in the wage bill to GDP ratio, tax measures to compensate for the loss of trade tariff revenues and other, as yet unspecified, measures. At the same time, the plan envisions an increase in the public investment rate of about 1 percent of GDP.‘” Delays in adopting the plan, which was first discussed in the fall of 1998, and the recurrence of drought have meant that the macroeconomic framework will only be adopted this year. The pickup in growth is expected to result from the cumulative effect of structural reforms already undertaken or in the pipeline, and from higher public investment spending. lo Public investment is low in Morocco, equivalent to about 3 percent of GDP (national accounts definition).

Morocco: Market Shares 1fter remaining stable for most of the 1980s Morocco’s export market share for goods in world markets ncreased at the end of that decade, peaking in 1991. Since then, however, it has fallen back. It is interesting to :ompare the evolution of export market shares between Morocco and a sample of 13 other economies ncluding both industrialized and developing countries.’ The comparison centers on both absolute export narket shares (exports of goods as a share of world imports) and relative export shares (exports of goods as a #hare of the exports of goods of a group of competing countries). The group of competing countries has gained significant market share on world markets during the past two decades (see Chart A). Progress has been particularly rapid during the 199Os, with a gain in market share of jver 3 percentage points (from 8.6 percent to over 11.7 percent). Within this group, only Egypt and Indonesia ost market shares (Indonesia only during the 1980s). At the other extreme, Ireland and Korea tripled their narket share over the past 20 years. While its relative share at the beginning of the 1990s was close to the one It the beginning of the 198Os, Morocco lost significant ground during the 1990s with respect to other emerging zonomies. In terms of world exports, Morocco’s market share declined from 0.143 percent in 1990-9 1 to 1.132 percent in 1998-99.’ vlorocco’s decline in market shares reflects a slowdown in export performance during the last decade. The lverage compounded growth rate of Morocco exports in US dollars since 1990 has been 4.7 percent per year, :ompared with 6.3 percent for world exports and 8.5 percent for developing countries (see Chart B). Three nain factors have contributed to this performance: declining competitiveness because of the Moroccan lirham’s real appreciation, heavy dependence of Moroccan exports on EU markets (73.8 percent of total :xports) characterized by slow growth, and stronger competition from Eastern European and Asian countries.

In the view of the staff, the growth dividend from structural reforms will be slower in coming than envisaged under the plan, owing to delays in addressing major issues (e.g., subsidies and labor market flexibility) and to the absence of a well-articulated action plan for the implementation of medium-term policy objectives. The progress achieved in modemizing the economy should bear fi-uit in the years to come in terms of increased productivity and profitability but in the face of eroding competitiveness it will not be sufficient to strengthen the traded goods sector. Trade liberalization with the EU and the dismantling of textile quotas under the WTO will increase competitive pressures domestically and on export markets. On the fiscal front, the mission cast doubts that the deficit and wage bill reduction objectives could be realized under current policies. In all, the staffs baseline projections envisage some pickup in growth, but certainly not of the magnitude envisioned by the authorities (Table 2). On the assumption that some corrective fiscal measures will be taken (e.g., containment of the wage bill and other current expenditures, tax measures to compensate for the trade tariff reduction, and a gradual phasing-out of the food subsidy/price support system), the budget deficit would converge to about 5 percent of GDP and public debt would decline from 77 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 75 percent of GDP in 2005. With export growth averaging some 5 percent a year (in volume terms), nonagricultural GDP growth would gradually rise to 4 percent and the investment rate would increase by 1.5 percentage points of GDP f’rom 1999 to 2005. A commensurate increase in the saving rate would help bring the external current account deficit back down to about 1 percent of GDP, following a temporary widening in 2000 due to adverse terms-of-trade developments. 24. According to the staff, to significantly reduce poverty and unemployment, a much more ambitious set of policies would be needed, primarily to restore competitiveness, move the economy to a higher growth path, and set fiscal policy on a sound footing. To that end, the mission recommended the adoption of mutually supportive actions on several fronts including: (a) uptiont measures to address the main sources of budgetary rigidity that are inhibiting the government from devoting more resources for human and physical infrastructure development; (b) an acceleration and a broadening of structural reforms, particularly greater trade liberalization and price liberalization in agriculture; (c) an exchange rate policy that restores competitiveness and maintains it overtime; and (d) an increase and an improvement in the quality of social spending. An illustrative medium-texm scenario to restore and maintain competitiveness based on such a strategy could raise growth to about 6 percent (Table 3). Stronger growth and a marked increase in the investment rate (to about 30 percent of GDP) would result in a widening of the external current account deficit to under 3 percent of GDP by 2005, which would be tilly financed by nondebt-creating capital inflows. B. Fiscal Policy 25. A significant increase in government saving, equivalent to some 5 percentage points of GDP, will be required by 2004, if the dual objective of reducing the budget deficit in 2004 to close to 1 percent of GDP and raising government investment by 1 percent of GDP Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - is to be attained. The mission pointed out that these targets would be out of reach if the three main weaknesses in the budget were not addressed promptly, namely the size of the wage bill, the inefficient and costly system of price subsidies, and the gradual erosion of tariff revenues under the A4EU, cumulatively estimated at about 2 percent of GDP. 26. Contrary to these objectives, the draft budget for July-December 2000 envisages a significant widening of the fiscal deficit to over 7.5 percent of GDP on an annualized basis.” The draft budget contains a further increase in the wage bill and higher investment spending but no new revenue-generating measure. On a calendar year basis, the budget deficit for 2000 would come to 6.9 percent of GDP. Excluding one-off items (mostly drought-related investment spending) and correcting for cyclical factors, the underlying balance in calendar year 2000 comes to 5.6 percent of GDP, compared with 4.9 percent in FY 1999/2000. Financing pressures will be contained because of the substantial revenues expected from the partial privatization of Maroc Telecom, estimated at DH 11.4 billion or 3.2 percent of GDP. 27. The wage bill is set to increase substantially (to 12.5 percent of GDP in the second half of 2000, on an annualized basis) on account of a planned upgrade of budgetary positions through automatic promotions and regularization of temporary position to be phased in over 2000-03. Pressures for generalizing this measure across all ministries have been building ever since it was applied selectively to the education and health ministries in 1997. On grounds of fairness, the authorities felt that they could no longer object to such demands. However, the initiative could have been offset by reforming the remuneration system so as to limit the large wage drift built into the present system. The terms of the wage increases have yet to be fmalized, but the full cost of the operation (to be phased in over three years) could be as high as DH 5.7 billion (1.5 percent of GDP). Prospects for reducing the wage bill through retrenchment or redeployment also appeared to be slim. The budget for the second half of 2000 envisages gross hiring of 17,453 (about 15,000 in net terms), largely to meet the need for primary school teachers. In all, on present policies, the wage bill is set to remain above 12 percent of GDP through 2005. Only through retrenchment in the context of a civil service reform could the wage bill be reduced to about 10 percent of GDP by 2004 (Box 4). 28. Moreover, there are as yet no firm plans for phasing out the food subsidy and price support system. Under the current system, and in a normal agricultural year, the budgetary cost of subsidies stands at 0.8, percent of GDP.12 While the budgetary cost is not II This annualization adjusts revenues and expenditures for seasonality and one-off effects, and the resulting deficit is therefore different from the actual deficit of 9.1 percent of GDP (excluding spending by Hassan II Fund) for the second half of 2000 as reported in Table 4. I2 Another 0.8 percent in subsidies is financed by customs tariffs on wheat, sugar, and vegetable oils which exceed 100 percent.

Morocco: The Wage Bill and Civil Service Reform As described in Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper for the 1999 Article IV consultation @M/99/121, 5/26/99), the Moroccan civil service suffers from a number of rigidities that both limit its effectiveness and impart an upward bias to the wage bill. The main hindrances to effectiveness are excessive centralization, promotion rules based more on seniority than on merit, and an imbalance in the structure of employment with overstaffing at the lower levels and at the secondary school level and under-staffing at the managerial level and in primary education. With limited scope for redeployment, staffing shortfalls (notably in the primary education sector) are met through new hiring (some 12,000 a year and 17,453 in the second half of 2000). In addition, the wage bill is inflated by a large structural wage drift (about 2.5 percent a year) due to the promotion system and the automatic integration into the civil service of occasional workers that have cumulated seven years of employment with ministries or parastatal entities. Finally, uneven treatment across ministries generate constant pressures for discretionary increases, which in turn have cascading effects on the rest of the public sector, as witnessed in the current round of wage adjustments through job upgrades. Taking into account the current wage drift, and assuming gross new hiring of 15,000 a year, the wage bill would remain between 12 percent and 12.5 percent of GDP by 2005, depending on the extent of wage concessions under the current round of job upgrades (Chart C). Containment of gross new hirings alone would not achieve a significant reduction in the wage bill, and would only aggravate the staffing shortfall in primary education and other social sectors. Achievement of the wage bill objective (10 percent of GDP by 2004) will therefore entail some degree of retrenchment through voluntary departure schemes in the context of a civil service reform, which would also be the occasion to improve the qualification of staff. A scenario that includes a 4 percent reduction in the wage bill through retrenchment in both 2001 and 2002, and a reform of the remuneration system that would reduce the wage drift to 1 percent a year would compress the wage bill to about 10 percent by 2004. On the assumption that the cost of voluntary retrenchment comes to two years in wages for those who take advantage of the scheme, the upfront cost of the operation would come to 2 percent of GDP.

The subsidy system stems from the high levels of protection of the three protected food staples and benefits essentially inefficient domestic producers and intermediaries. It also introduces very serious distortions in agriculture in favor of drought- sensitive crops. Some steps toward recovering the subsidies benefiting industrial users were taken in 1999, but the mission does not view these steps as addressing the problem, Although the authorities indicated that a broader initiative could be taken in 2000 on edible oils, reform was stalled by concerns over possible social repercussions, particularly in a year of drought. In the mission’s view, the social cost of liberalization to the poor would be minimal in a situation where consumer prices often exceed targeted levels and are not significantly lower than import prices. A much more ambitious schedule of subsidy reductions across all three subsidized items therefore seems appropriate. To be sure, the budgetary saving would probably be fully utilized to compensate farmers through temporary income support or reconversion schemes and to reinforce social spending in other areas, but at least major structural gains would have been achieved. 29. Government revenue (excluding privatization) are due to decline with the dismantling of trade tariffs with the EU and lower dividend payments from partially privatized public enterprises. To maintain the tax ratio at present levels (22 percent of GDP, excluding tariff surcharges on subsidized food staples), the authorities have taken measures to improve tax administration, and have begun a debate with the business community on the tax system and its reform. At the same time, the authorities have extracted “exceptional dividends” from public enterprises at levels, which may not be justified by the enterprises’ financial conditions. The mission also voiced concern about the fi&tre budgetary impact of not passing through the increase in oil prices and the need to harmonize the income tax applied to the banking sector (39.5 percent) with the standard rate (35 percent), and to reduce the top marginal rate of the individual income tax (44 percent). To improve the investment climate, the draft budget law for the second half of 2000 proposes to eliminate a number of nuisance taxes at a minimal budgetary cost. Meanwhile new demands for selective tax exemptions are gaining strength, a typical reaction of the traded goods sector when there is an erosion in competitiveness. Already a drawback was introduced for selected exporters to allow them to recover the cost of energy taxation, and the measure could be extended to other exporting sectors. The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to modernizing the tax administration but restated the need to move forward as well on a reform of the tax system, which has been discussed with Fund missions since 1996 in conjunction with Fund technical assistance. 30. The FY 1999/2000 budget integrated some of the staffs proposal on the taxation of financial income, but a number of other proposals made by Fund technical assistance missions and which would raise revenue by 1 percent of GDP remain on the table.13 The I3 These recommendations were mostly drawn from the FAD technical assistance report of May 1997, titled “Maroc: La poursuite des reformes fiscales et tarifaires”.

The blanket exemption granted by royal decree will come to an end at the end of 2000, offering a unique opportunity to close this major gap. The mission proposed that the authorities at least integrate the modem agricultural sectors into the normal tax system (VAT and income tax) or introduce a land tax on larger properties as an effective and administratively simple system of taxation. The authorities agreed with the mission that there was a need to review tax policy and they intended to seek technical assistance from the Fund in this respect. However, they expressed doubts about the potential revenue impact of taxing agriculture, particularly in view of the difficult tax administration issues involved, but conceded that there was scope in taxing large irrigated holdings and associated agribusiness. 31. Expenditure pressures are rising from many sides. In the short term, emergency measures to counter the effects of the drought will add some DH 2 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) in spending in 2000. The decision to insulate domestic prices corn the rise of petroleum prices since mid-1999 will deplete the reserve position of the compensation fund, but could eventually be borne by the budget.‘” Over the medium term, the commitments made under the education restructuring program and the five-year plan (both under discussion in parliament) will generate additional outlays. The investment commitments implied by the education program alone (i.e., new schools and institutions) could cost some DH 3-4 billion, or 1 percent of GDP in addition to the added personnel expenditure arising from the hiring of new teachers (as already seen in the next budget). Resources will also need to be found to finance social programs such as enhanced medical coverage for the poor. Although such increases in investment and social expenditures are clearly desirable, discussion of these plans should integrate a costing exercise so as to mobilize the required budgetary resources. 32. Contingent and other liabilities also weigh on the budget, beginning with the cost of reforming the pension system of the national railway company, estimated at DH 4.4 billion (1.2 percent of GDP).‘, The pension funds of a few other public enterprises may similarly be in need of recapitalization and, although the enterprises may be able to cover the gaps themselves, this will be at the cost of reduced dividend payments to the state (Box 5). Furthermore, a significant share of nonperforming loans of public banks might have to be taken over by the state, notably those to public housing institutions. The housing bank (CIH) has nonperforming loans equivalent to 3 percent of GDP and is in urgent need of l4 Domestic petroleum prices are indexed to international prices. A margin is provided within the mechanism to smooth price changes with the cost being borne by the compensation fund (c&se de compensation), which had accumulated reserves in the past. I5 The cost of this operation will be partially offset by the budgetary saving realized when the convention providing for DH 700 million of yearly budgetary transfers to the railway company lapses in 2000.

Morocco: The Pension System The Moroccan pension system is composed of many pension funds with different rules with respect to the financing of the systems, the benefit formula, the retirement age, the eligibility condition, the internal rates of return, etc. The four major funds are: (a) Caisse nationale de securite sociale (CNSS) for private employees; (b) Caisse marocaine de retraite (CMR) for civil servants and army; (c) Regime collectif d’allocation de retraite (RCAR) for employees of public enterprises and temporary civil servants; and (d) Caisse interprofessionnelle marocaine de retraite (CIRM) which is a supplementary fund for private employees who desire voluntary coverage beyond the CNSS replacement rate.’ Both CNSS and CMR are mandatory publicly managed pay-as- you-go (PAYG) systems.’ The RCAR is a mandatory publicly managed PAYG system which has nonetheless a structural surplus and reserves of DH 14 billion. The CIRM is a voluntary privately managed mixed system, partly financed on a PAYG basis, partly on a funded basis. Most large public enterprises also maintain their own pension funds. The features of the Moroccan pension system are: Low coverage. The four major pension funds cover only 30 percent of the employed. Only 25.6 percent of the labor force contribute to the pension system. Eighty percent of the employed are in the private sector while only 55 percent of contributors to the pension system are private employees. The coverage is therefore biased toward the public sector. The demographic trends are still favorable but unemployment rates impose fiscal pressure on the PAYG system. Both the increase in life expectancy and the reduced fertility rate increase the share of the old age population. But the share of the population between 15 and 59 is expected to increase in the next 15 years. This could have a positive effect on the financial sustainability of the pension system, in terms of additional revenues. Moreover, compared with other countries Morocco will have a rising participation rate of women, The demographic dependency ratio (the ratio between 60+ years of age and 15-59 years of age) will be stable at 12 percent till 2014 and start to rise thereafter. However if the unemployment rate increases and results in a reduction in the number of contributors, the PAYG system will be put under increasing financial pressure. Cross subsidization. The CNSS provides not only pension benefits (long-term benefits), but also family allowances and other short-term benefits. The surplus generated by the family allowance contributions is used to subsidize the pension system. This implies a nontransparent redistribution from intragenerational perspective. Financial balance. The four major funds recorded an overall surplus of about DH 2.3 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) in 1998, although a large portion of the surplus originated from the family allowance scheme. One of the major threats to the current pension system is the contingent liabilities arising from some special funds. The national railway (Office nationale des chemins de fer (ONCF)) pension fund, which is financed on a PAYG basis, is actually running a deficit of DH 210 million, while arrears amount to DH 4.4 billion ( 1.2 percent of GDP). This is in part due to the generosity of its pension system in terms of retirement age and reference earnings, which include not only wages but all the benefits, resulting in a very high replacement rate. The policy of employment retrenchment in the railroads during the last few years has reduced sharply the number of contributors. The revenues have been therefore reduced, making the system not only unsustainable in the long run but also underfunded in the short run. Along with the transformation of the ONCF into a commercial company, its pension fund will be merged with the RCAR. The cost for the RCAR to assume the liabilities of the ONCF pension fund has been put at DH 4.4 billion, which ultimately will have to be borne by the state. The government is aware of the moral hazard problem inherent in a potential bailout as other public enterprises may follow suit. Alternative solutions are being explored for resolving this situation. ’ The replacement rate is defined as the ratio of the average pension over average wage. 2 In PAYG system, pension benefits are paid out of workers’ contributions.

Extra-budgetary outlays by the Hassan II Fund starting in 2000 will boost investment spending over the next few years. In the current context of excess capacity, rising unemployment, and stable external accounts, the mission recommended that these expenditures be accelerated. However, budget restructuring is also necessary to accommodate future recurrent expenditure arising from these investments. 34. The resumption of privatization should generate at least US$l.O billion yearly through 2004. The partial privatization of Maroc Telecom (with 35 percent of its capital to be sold to a strategic foreign investor) is expected to generate at least US$l billion, possibly by year-end, and the (partial) privatization of the national airline, the tobacco company monopoly, and a public bank should follow in short order. The authorities stated that these resources would be devoted to public investment. The mission cautioned the authorities not to rely on these temporary revenues to defer adjustment, warning that even spending on public investment will entail recurrent costs in future budget. This stream of privatization revenue offered a unique opportunity to: (a) reduce public debt thereby reducing the high interest burden in the budget (5 percent of GDP); (b) finance costly structural reforms, notably civil service reform and liberalization of agricultural prices, with the associated elimination of subsidies that would reduce the underlying fiscal imbalance over the medium term; and (c) strengthen infrastructure in rural areas for poverty alleviation. 35. Decentralization offers another opportunity to improve the quality of public expenditure. Spending by local governments already amounts to 4 percent of GDP, and the share is due to increase with the creation to regional governments, which will initially receive a budgetary transfer equivalent to 1 percent of income tax receipts, but will inevitably drift toward larger appropriations. The mission noted however that current expenditure, and personnel spending in particular, accounted for an increasing portion of local government spending in contrast to the need to reinforce public investment, particularly in rural areas. Admittedly, an increase in personnel expenditures is required to strengthen the capacity of local governments, but the mission stressed that decentralization should be clearly associated with a transfer of real spending responsibilities and should also be the occasion for redeploying personnel. I6 Even though the central bank and other public institutions would be contributing (as shareholders) to the CIH recapitalization, there would be consequences for the budget, in terms of reduced dividend payments from these institutions to the state.

A number of structural rigidities have hampered private sector development during the 199Os, but the broad reform agenda pursued over the last few years, and aimed at correcting or removing the many impediments to growth, has undoubtedly improved the investment environment. The mission noted in particular the progress realized in: (a) the areas ofjudicial and customs reform; (b) the legal framework for private sector activity (e.g., law on industrial property rights and competition and price liberalization law); (c) shortening the approval procedures for large-scale foreign investments; (d) expanding the scope for private sector activity (through public concessions, liberalization in the transportation sector, and creation of industrial zones); (e) improving and increasing transparency in the relations between government and the private sector (e.g., adoption of a code of good practices for public employees, new customs code, new public procurement rules, and elimination of payment arrears by central government); and (f) launching on-the- job training programs and improving labor market intermediation. 37. The new draft labor code should also help reduce long-standing rigidities in the labor market. After prolonged discussions with the social partners, the government has drafted a revised labor code, which should introduce greater flexibility in the labor market. The authorities indicated that, in parallel, they were planning to introduce a limited unemployment insurance scheme, with a maximum coverage of six months at the minimum wage, to be financed through social security contributions. In January 2000, Morocco also ratified the international convention on minimum age for admission to employment. As recognized by the authorities, rigidities in the present labor code have promoted the development of the informal sector and perversely increased the precariousness of employment conditions for a large share of the population. The new draft code still provides considerable protection against dismissals not justified by economic reasons-and in this regard it is not supported by the employers-but it sets limits to court-awarded compensations for such dismissals.” The mission welcome this long overdue step toward modemizing the labor market and increasing incentives for enterprises to invest in a stable labor force, but noted that the true test of the effectiveness of the new law would be in its application and its enforcement in the courts. 38. Considerable work remains to be done on the structural front before a significant growth dividend can be realized. In particular, there is a need to: I7 The limit for salaried employees above the minimum wage is 24 months of salary while employees at the minimum wage are compensated at the discretion of the court thereby maintaining the contested provision of the old labor code. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - . Improve the effectiveness and capacity of the civil service and reduce the administrative burden on enterprises. Despite the significant weight of the government wage bill, the level of government services remains inadequate in a number of areas that are crucial to private sector development. For instance, the court system, which was upgraded with the establishment of the first six commercial courts in 1998, needs to be strengthened through proper staffing and training. Foreign (and domestic) investors still face administrative hurdles in setting up new businesses or new investments, and greater efforts are needed to simplify the regulatory framework and to make it more transparent. In the same vein, recent initiatives and actions taken to curb corruption will need to be reinforced. . Restructure the education system to the needs of a modern economy. A high illiteracy ratio and a shortage of qualified workers are serious obstacles to the development of higher value added activities. Managerial skills are also lacking, particularly in SMEs, as evidenced by the difficulty enterprises have in formulating financeable investment plans or accessing foreign markets. Many of these shortcomings are recognized in the objectives of the education program now under discussion in parliament (aimed at universal schooling and reduction of illiteracy to 35 percent by 2004) and in the measures taken to improve school-to- work transition and promote on-the-job training (Plan Action Emploi). . Liberaiize further the trade regime and establish free trade among Maghreb countries. Morocco’s high degree of protection has contributed to insulate domestic producers Corn competitive pressures. The opening of a large gap between the MFN trade regime and the EU trade regime will also result in trade diversion and increase incentives for fraud. Moreover, unless free trade is established among Maghreb countries to create one large unified market, foreign investors will prefer serving North African markets from a European base rather than investing locally. Recognizing such risks, the authorities have entered into similar free trade agreements with countries in the region.‘* However, liberalization on a much broader scale would be needed, starting by limiting the tariff differential (between the MFN and the bilateral trade regimes) to 10-15 percent at most. . Maintain a strict wage policy. One factor, which has contributed to a rise in unemployment, is a shift in relative prices in favor of capital. This is related to the lowering of interest rates, the real appreciation of the dirham, the income tax advantages provided to investors, and, since March 1,2000, the dismantling of tariffs on capital equipment with the EU. This shift in relative prices will be further exacerbated by the increase in the minimum wage slated for July 1,200O. Unless aggregate demand picks up substantially, only a decline in the real wage could generate substantially higher employment. I* An agreement similar to that with the EU has come into effect with European Free Trade Association countries and free trade agreements have been signed with Jordan, Tunisia, and &YPt- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- . Improve access to land for both industrial and touristic developments and reform housing policies. The ongoing expansion of industrial sites should begin to alleviate the problem. More could be done by easing the zoning rules and the taxation of land (the draft law for July-December 2000 introduces some simplifications in this regard). The creation of a public land agency (ugencefonci&e) could also help speed up the development of public domains. Many of the same problems constrain the development of the housing sector. The rate of construction of new units (some 85,000 a year) falls short of the estimated 110,000 annual requirement, adding to an existing gap of about 750,000 units in urban areas.lg The mission welcomed recent steps taken to revitalize the sector. The introduction of a revised rental housing law, which corrects most of the bias against investors and landlords, and a law for the securitization of mortgages should be supported by a concerted public program to increase supply. More could be done to improve access to credit (e.g., through earmarked savings accounts and by recapitalizing the housing bank), to simplify the taxation of property, to streamline bureaucracy, and to attract private sector investors. The mission saw the development of the housing sector as a potentially important source of growth for the economy because of its labor-intensive nature and its ability to mobilize household saving. . Reform agricultural policies. As noted before, the incentives provided for the production of cereals have proven to have costly consequences in a drought-prone country such as Morocco. To reduce the impact of droughts, the authorities have proposed to ensure a minimum production of 6 millions tons of cereals a year by extending and improving the irrigation network. Such a venture may prove to be both very expensive and inefficient in terms of managing the country’s scarce water resources. The mission has urged a complete review of agricultural policies and continues to favor price liberalization as a more efficient way to unleash the growth potential of agriculture and to reconvert land to uses more adapted to Morocco’s climate and comparative advantage (citrus, olives, and grazing). This strategy is supported by the World Bank provided it is accompanied by investment in basic rural infrastructure and an agricultural export promotion campaign. . Expand further the scope for private sector activity and for competition. The law on public concessions presently under preparation should permit to expand, in a transparent manner, private sector involvement in the provision of traditional public sector services (e.g. water, sewage, electricity, etc.). There is scope for expanding private competition to other sectors such as energy distribution. The mission welcomed the resumption of the privatization program and the emphasis put on transparency.

Morocco’s competitiveness gap has its origin primarily in the economy’s structural rigidities but it is unlikely that structural reforms alone can trigger the desired increase in growth over the next few years. Given the real appreciation of the dirham and weak export performance, the mission suggested that an exchange rate policy which restored competitiveness and maintained it overtime would accelerate the adjustment process and increase the responsiveness of the economy to structural reforms. 40. The mission stressed that exchange rate policy should be assessed in a forward looking and more dynamic context. Forthcoming trade liberalization with the EU and dismantling of textile quotas that constrain Morocco’s competitors are akin to an appreciation of the real exchange rate, with adverse consequences for the traded goods sector. In this context, export performance is unlikely to improve substantially unless some of the REER appreciation is reversed. The mission also noted that such a policy stance would be an ideal occasion for lowering trade barriers multilaterally. Finally, to promote employment it was important to correct the recent shift in relative prices in favor of capital. This said, the mission underscored that a more active exchange rate policy should not be seen in any way as a substitute for structural reforms or for stronger action on the fiscal front, but rather as complement to them. It also stressed that it should be accompanied by strict incomes and monetary policies to avoid inflationary pressures from becoming entrenched. The mission also restated its position that a more flexible exchange regime supported by appropriate monetary and fiscal policy would be necessary to prevent any further appreciation of the real exchange rate and would better serve Morocco’s multiple macroeconomic objectives. 41. The authorities questioned the mission’s position on exchange rate policy on several grounds. Firstly they underscored the absence of any pressure on the external current accounts that would typically be associated with a misaligned exchange rate. Secondly, they noted that agricultural exports would not be responsive to an exchange rate change, reflecting in part Europe’s restrictive trade policies. Thirdly, the authorities feared that they would not be in a position to resist ensuing inflationary pressures, particularly as concerns wage policy. Fourthly, they noted that an exchange rate realignment would weaken incentives on private enterprises to modemize and improve productivity through internal adjustment. 42. The mission acknowledged the absence of pressures on the external accounts, but noted that the viability of the current account had been achieved in large part because of loti domestic growth. A higher growth path, even if led by stronger exports, would widen the external gap at the current exchange rate. The mission also stressed that the advantages of a more active exchange rate policy should not be measured solely in terms of the potential response of existing exports but also in terms of the potential for developing new activities through resources reallocation. The mission was also confident that exchange rate and wage policies could be jointly managed so as to achieve stronger competitiveness and higher Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - employment. Finally, on the issue of private sector incentives to modemize, the mission felt that it would be more appropriate to pursue this through structural reforms with possible state support (e.g., as the investments earmarked by the Hassan II Fund) than through an exchange rate commitment. E. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues 43. The strains observed in monetary policy management in coping with the large liquidity injection due to the revenue inflow from the 2”d GSM license revealed the limits of existing monetary policy instruments. Having exhausted its limited stock of government paper, the central bank felt compelled to intervene through a new ad hoc deposit facility and a more rigid reserve requirement mechanism. Although these measures constituted a step backward in the move toward market-based instruments of intervention, the mission recognized that they had been clearly called for by the urgency of this highly unusual situation. A return to more flexible reserve requirement rules and the development of market- based instruments to mop up liquidity (such as auctioning access to the central bank deposit facility) are now desirable, for dealing with forthcoming privatizations and for improving the control over money market rates which have remained volatile-often moving outside of the official intervention corridor of the central bank. The mission recommended that, in order for the central bank to reconstitute its holdings of government paper, it would be desirable to phase out the existing government overdraft facility and to convert it into bonds, 44. In the absence of adequate central bank sterilization instruments, the mission noted that the treasury should play a more active role to sterilize the monetary impact of the external cash inflow. Accordingly, the mission urged the monetary and fiscal authorities to collaborate closely ahead of the upcoming large-scale privatizations of Maroc Telecom and Royal Air Maroc, possibly by allowing the treasury to build up remunerated deposits at the central bank. 45. The monetary authority viewed the current level of interest rates (about 5% percent for one-year treasury bills) as appropriate. The mission agreed that, with real interest rates presently in the 3 percent range and in the absence of inflationary pressures, there was no reason to change monetary stance. The temporary drop in interest rates and the associated acceleration of monetary growth in 1999 were unlikely to have adverse inflationary consequences, given current cyclical conditions. However, the monetary growth objective set for 2000 (7-8 percent increase in narrow money) may end up being overly ambitious in view of the economy’s projected weak growth. Because of the recent instability observed in the broader monetary aggregates, the mission also urged the central bank to focus on a larger set of indicators in assessing monetary conditions. It recommended, in particular, that the central bank develops and monitors a measure of underlying inflation. This would be particularly important should Morocco shift to a more flexible exchange regime. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 33 - 46. Much of the problem with nonperforming loans remains concentrated in the specialized public (and semipublic) credit institutions, notably the housing bank (CIH) and the agricultural bank (CNCA) (26 percent of the credit of public credit institutions were nonperfoxming, with a provisioning rate of 39 percent as of December 1999). Moreover, two of these specialized credit institutions fall below the required solvency ratio. The mission commended the authorities for putting in motion a recapitalization plan for the CIH of DH 3.2 billion (1 percent of GDP) drawing on the participation of major shareholders, bank loans, and a contribution by the Fonds de garantie. The authorities indicated that the recapitalization of the CIH would have to be accompanied by an improvement in its management and loan recovery. Indeed, a strengthening of internal credit appraisal and control is crucial to avoid the re-emergence of solvency problems down the road. The mission stressed the need to move forward with the restructuring of the CNCA and the separation of its commercial activities from its quasi-fiscal support to small farmers. A draft law for the restructuring of the CNCA is under discussion, but the terms under which budgetary support would be provided for its quasi-fiscal activities has yet to be defined. 47. The ratio of problem loans to total credits has risen for traditional commercial banks as well to 9 percent of total credits, but provision is adequate (two-thirds of bad loans) and solvency ratios are relatively high (14.6 percent for traditional commercial banks), There were encouraging signs of growing competition in the banking sector-with downward pressures on lending rates-thanks to the creation of consumer credit institutions and the development of financial markets and of mutual funds. Although mutual funds and consumer credit institutions belong in many instances to the major banks, their appearance has diluted the monopoly power of banks. The combination of growing competition in the banking sector and weakening economic growth, however, increases the risk of a deterioration in the quality of the banks’ loan portfolio. The mission welcomed in this context the introduction of a new banking accounting framework as of January 1,2000, which extends the coverage of supervision to all credit institutions and will apply it on a consolidated basis. The mission also welcomed the plan for privatizing the Banque centrale populaire (the central institutions of the cooperative banking network), and expressed hope that the long-planned privatization of the Banque nationale pour le developpement tconomique (the former development bank) could proceed in the near future. F. Poverty Reduction 48. The aggravation of poverty since 1990-91 (Box 6) was of serious concern to the authorities and the staff. Restoring growth is the surest way of reversing this trend, but there is equally a need to intervene directly through better-targeted social policies. The authorities insisted that the fight against poverty should not take the form of additional social assistance, but rather focus on promoting income-generating activities and employment for the poorest members of society, particularly in rural areas, and on improving education and human capital. To that end, they would give priority to investment projects in the 28 poorest provinces. The authorities have identified the main axes along which they want to intervene: Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - Box 6. Morocco: Poverty Trends and Remedial Actions Trends in poverty are worsening in Morocco. There are 5.3 million people below the poverty line (of which 66 percent are in rural areas) in 1998, anincrease of 56 percent since’1990.’ The head-count index, defined as the percentage of population with an average consumption below the poverty line, rose from 13 percent in 1990 to 19 percent in 1998. The rise in poverty is confirmed by different poverty measures: the head-count index (which measures the diffusion of poverty), the poverty gap index (which measures the depth of poverty, i.e., the distance of the poor below the poverty line), and the squared poverty gap index (which measures the severity of poverty, i.e., the inequality among the poor). The years being compared are also roughly similar in terms of agricultural production, although the two-three years preceding the 1990 survey benefited from good rainfall and agricultural performance. Urbanization (due to internal migration and to the redefinition of urban area) has meant that the number of poor in urban areas has also increased. However, the incidence of poverty is still much higher (27 percent) in rural areas, where severity and depth of poverty are also much higher. Nevertheless, on the basis of social indicators the situation of the poor appears to have improved during the 1990s (e.g., in terms of access to safe water, immunization rate, life expectancy, and primary school enrolment rates). While illiteracy in Morocco is still high, there has been much progress toward its reduction from 55 percent in 1991 to 47 percent in 1998. While increasing the provision of social services, the authorities aim to alleviate poverty through income generating policies rather than through social assistance. Thus the Social Development Agency (Agence de diveloppement social) created in August 1999 is specifically intended for the financing of small infrastructure works such as projects for safe water, access to basic health services, construction of rural roads as well as for providing microcredit to develop microenterprises. The authorities also are in the process of restructuring the ~ Entraide nationale, a program providing assistance to poor families and those unable to work. However, the effectiveness of this program in fighting poverty is very low as it reaches only 114,400 people out of 5.3 million and it suffers from internal inefficiency with a very high ratio of staff to beneficiaries. The Promotion nationale (PN), created in 1961 under the ministry of interior, is another instrument of social development. PN finances mainly public works in rural areas and is in this regard an effective way of reducing the poor through self-selection. The ministry of social development is also currently working to reinforce the social safety net through the introduction of unemployment insurance with coverage of six months. The ministries of social development and health are taking steps to increase the coverage of health insurance (only 15 percent of the population is presently covered by formal health insurance). They are also formulating a plan to provide health assistance for the poor. The World Bank involvement. The World Bank’s assistance strategy consists of an integrated social sector program called BAJ (Bamamaj al Aoulaouiyat al Ijtimaiya-Social Priority Program), started m 1996, and implemented in the 14 poorest provinces of the country. The BAJ includes projects on health and basic education aimed particularly at reducing the gap in girls’ school enrolhnents and on rural infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and safe water. The World Bank is currently preparing a Social Protection Strategy note ta assess the effectiveness of the current social protection system and is working with the Moroccan authorities to produce an integrated matrix on social protection, The World Bank is also preparing a poverty update based on the 1998-99 Living Standards Measurements Survey and expects to produce an action plan on poverty as a conclusion to the poverty update. ’ The authorities recognize that the most effective way to reduce poverty is to shift the economy toward a higher growth path. Nevertheless, a restructuring of public expenditures and improved targeting of the most vulnerable groups would help alleviate the impact of the low growth and high unemployment of recent years on the poor. ’ Although both 1990 and 1998 showed strong GDP growth, the two years correspond to different points in the business cycle.

The staff, in coordination with the World Bank, encouraged the authorities to translate these intentions into concrete initiatives in the course of 2000 so as to arrest and possibly reverse the rising poverty trend. III. STATISTICS 49. Morocco benefits from a broad array of quality statistical data and a high degree of transparency. An increasingly large set of information, including budgetary data, is made available via the Internet. Cooperation with the staff has been exemplary and the authorities have provided the necessary statistical information for effective surveillance. Morocco has received multisector technical assistance from STA, and follow up visits have been requested on national account methodology and on the consolidation of fiscal accounts for general government. The ministry of planning is also working on rebasing national accounts from 1980 to a more recent year and on bringing it in conformity with the United Nations revised system of national accounts. Morocco announced its intention to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard but no firm calendar has been set. Iv. STAFF APPRAISAL 50. Internal and external stability have been successfully maintained: underlying inflation has been stabilized at about 2 percent; the external current account deficit is well under control, even in the face of the deterioration in the terms of trade projected for 2000; external reserves have been replenished to a very comfortable level; and large nondebt creating private inflows are expected in the next couple of years with the resumption of privatizations. 51. Progress toward fiscal consolidation has been less encouraging. Little has been done to address the major sources of budgetary rigidity, namely the size of the wage bill, the inadequacies of the tax system (in terms of excessive exemptions), and food subsidies. Exceptional revenues (i.e., t,ax amnesty settlements and privatization and license receipts) have nonetheless permitted to fill much of the budgetary gap, allowing for a reduction in the public debt ratio. There has also been a notable improvement in cash and debt management and the staff particularly commends the treasury for eliminating outstanding payments arrears and refmining from using this instrument to manage its cash flow. 52. Overall, while macroeconomic stability has been achieved, the country is in the midst of a growth crisis. At about 3 percent, trend growth presently falls short of the 5 percent rate that is needed just to prevent a further deterioration in the unemployment rate. To be sure, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - social indicators have improved over the last ten years but they remain weak for a middle income country, which is integrating with the global economy. A concerted effort must, therefore, be put in motion to raise growth to about 6 percent a year so as to absorb new entrants to the labor force and reduce unemployment. 53. The authorities’ medium-term plan to 2004 sets out ambitious growth objectives based on continued structural reforms, and a major increase in budgetary saving that would permit both a reduction in the deficit and an increase in public investment and social spending. Unless important changes are made in the current fiscal, structural, and exchange rate policies, these objectives are unlikely to be reached. The significant widening of the fiscal deficit in the draft budget for the second half of 2000 will help sustain economic activity through a second year of drought. However, the structural nature of this increase in the deficit (particularly in regards to the wage bill and the absence of fundamental reforms) raises concerns about the sustainability of this fiscal stance. 54. In the short run, large privatization receipts could alleviate financing problems for the budget, which will however reemerge down the line unless an action plan is put in place to address underlying budgetary weaknesses. The staff urges the authorities to utilize privatization revenue mainly to reduce external debt and to finance the one-off cost to structural reforms so as to reduce the underlying deficit and, thereby, make room for durable increases in public investment and social spending aimed at poverty reduction. 55. The substantial increase in the wage bill expected in 2000 and beyond, on account of larger net hirings and a new round of job promotions, clearly goes in the wrong direction. Although the latter measure may have been inevitable to restore an equitable balance across ministries, it should have been accompanied by a reform of the compensation system. Meanwhile, little progress has been made toward civil service reform, which the staff views as an essential precondition to reducing the wage bill and to increasing the efficiency of the public administration. 56. Fiscal retrenchment needs to be supported by an increase in the tax yield, especially in view of the revenue shortfall created by trade liberalization with the IN, and the need to reduce tariffs multilaterally and by resisting to demands from various sectors for tax exemptions. The emphasis should be on recapturing sectors of the economy that are either untaxed (e.g., agriculture) or undertaxed (e.g., diesel fuel, the informal sector). The staff fully supports the ongoing efforts at simplifying the tax regime and strengthening tax administration, and encourages the authorities to consider measures for raising the tax yield by revisiting the recommendations made by IMF staff in the past. 57. Medium-term fiscal objectives need to incorporate adequate provisions for projected increases in social and investment spending, as well as for one-off restructuring expenses (including the recapitalization of pension funds and state banks). Similarly, the decision not to pass through recent oil price increases is undermining the transparent indexation system that was painstakingly put in place with open-ended risks for the budget.

The difficulties experienced in mopping up the large liquidity injection due to the foreign investment inflows of 1999 revealed the need to reinforce monetary policy management. The scale of the inflows was admittedly exceptional, but a similar operation is expected this year. The staff encourages the monetary and fiscal authorities to collaborate closely to prevent such inflows from destabilizing unduly the money market and interest rates, and to endow the central bank with the necessary instruments to withdraw excess liquidity from the system. In situation where inflows exceed the capacity of the central bank to intervene, the treasury would have to contribute to sterilizing the monetary impact of privatization revenues. 59. In view of its strategic location, Morocco has an enormous untapped potential for attracting foreign direct investment. Progress toward modemizing the economy has been made on several fronts. The authorities ought to be commended for the achievements realized in: (a) judicial reform; (b) improving the legal infrastructure for private sector activity and the approval procedures for foreign investment; (c) opening up new sectors of the economy to the private sector; and (d) the measures taken to increase the transparency of the public administration. Much remains to be done, however, to slim down the burden of bureaucracy and to simplify codes and regulations. The staff also welcomes the government’s adoption, after years of discussion, of a new labor code. Although the new code does not fully meet the expectations of enterprises, it goes some ways toward relaxing the rigid dismissal rules of the present code. The staff hopes that parliament will put it into law speedily with a strengthened content in favor of greater flexibility. 60. However, numerous unmet challenges are still to be addressed in addition to civil service reform. The severe drought of 1999/2000 has once again revealed the cost of the price distortions favoring drought-sensitive crops. At current international prices, the elimination of subsidies combined with price liberalization would result in only minimal changes in the prices of subsidized sugar, flour, and vegetable oils for consumers. Besides freeing considerable budgetary resources, price liberalization would also begin to restore a proper balance of incentives toward land uses more appropriate to Morocco’s climate. In this regard, the staff views with concern the emphasis put by the authorities on ensuring a minimum level of cereal production through increased irrigation, and recommends instead that these resources be devoted to help farmers and producers hurt by liberalization reconvert to other crops and land uses. 61. Trade liberalization with the EU by exposing domestic producers to stronger competition will act as an important stimulus toward the modemization of Morocco’s economy. To fully realize these benefits and avoid the emergence of new distortions, the staff believes that liberalization on a much broader scale is required. The multilateral trade regime is still very restrictive and should be liberalized to avoid the emergence of significant trade tariff differentials on goods from different origins, which would encourage trade diversion. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38 - 62. Combined with stronger fiscal adjustment and deeper and faster structural reforms, a more active exchange rate policy would, in the view of the staff, contribute to jump-start the economy, placing it on a higher growth path. Improved sectoral policies (notably in housing, tourism, and agriculture) can contribute to raising growth but, in Morocco’s strategic location, the export and tradable sectors have the potential for being the strongest motor of growth. This is all the more important given the limited prospects for reviving domestic consumption through wage and fiscal policy in Morocco. As noted, external competitiveness is presently constrained by a number of structural rigidities and the authorities are rightly focussed on removing these obstacles to growth. However, the payoff of such reforms is unlikely to be realized in the near term. In the meantime, the loss of competitiveness observed during the 1990s will be compounded by increased competitive pressures ,due to trade liberalization with the EU and the dismantling of textile quotas. A forward-looking pro- active exchange rate policy would help accelerate the adjustment process, while increasing the responsiveness of the economy to structural reforms. In addition, the introduction of greater exchange rate flexibility supported by appropriate monetary and fiscal policies would avoid the reemergence of any sustained appreciation of the real exchange rate. 63. Commendable efforts have been deployed to improve the dissemination and timeliness of statistical data, which has become mostly available on the Internet.

However, Morocco maintains restrictions for security reasons against Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The exchange rate is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange market which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the exchange rate within its target range, defined around a fixed central rate. The central Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-49- APPENDDC I exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a basket of currencies representing Morocco’s principal trading partners. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations in the value of the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international exchange markets. On February 29, 2000, the SDR-dirham exchange rate was SDR 1 = DH 13.87. Since the 9 percent devaluation of May 1990, the dirham exchange rate has remained constant in relation to the basket. Article IV consultation Morocco is on the 12-month cycle. The last consultation discussions took place in Rabat during February 22-March 5,1999, and were concluded by the Executive Board on June 9, 1999.

The Executive Board approved the loan on May 6, 1999. A single-tranche Policy Reform Support Loan (PRSL) for US$250 million was approved by the Executive Board on June 1,1999. Parallel financing of US$200 million by the African Development Bank has already been approved. The PRSL is to support govemment’s commitment to establish and maintain a sound macroeconomic framework and to implement a broad reform program covering public sector reform, private sector development and poverty reductions and human resource development. Project loans During fiscal year 1997, the following loans were approved: a vocational training project (US$23 million) and a railroad restructuring project (US$SS million). During fiscal year 1998, the following loans were approved: a municipal finance project (US$70 million), a rural water supply project (US$lO million), and a water resource project (US$20 million).

In the current fiscal year 2000, the Integrated Small And Medium Irrigation Program (US$50 million), the judicial reform project (US$5 million), and the information systems project (US$lOO million) are scheduled to go to the Executive Board. Technical assistance The IBRD has provided extensive technical assistance to Morocco through its various lending operations for projects, as well as through its sectoral adjustment loans. Small-scale technical assistance on specific issues has been provided since 1990 with the support of Institutional Development Fund grants. In addition, at the authorities’ request, the World Bank has prepared a number of policy notes on sectoral issues such as education, administration and the financial sector, and related long- term prospects.

A framework law on statistics, providing for additional budgetary allocations, was also approved. Following the Fund’s multisector statistics mission in March 1998, the authorities started implementing an action plan for the upgrading of the country’s statistical system and have received Fund technical assistance on real sector, monetary and public finance statistics. Nevertheless, despite the clear intention of the authorities to subscribe to the SDDS, the actions that may have been taken toward achieving this objective have not been communicated to the Fund. Real sector The ministry of planning is also working on rebasing national accounts from 1980 to a more recent year and on bringing it in conformity with the United Nations revised system of national accounts. The progress on rebasing the producer price index and wholesale price index has been slow. A technical assistance mission from STA may be useful in this regard, but a complete revision of the consumer price index will only be worthwhile once the results of the new household budget survey (scheduled for October 1999-September 2000) are available. Government finance Central government finance data are generally available to MED with a few months lag. GFS data reported by Morocco for publication in GFS Yearbook are not timely, and their coverage is limited to the budget of the central government, the Moroccan pension fund, the National Social Security Fund, and partial information on the extrabudgetary funds. No data for the central government on a monthly or quarterly basis are reported to STA for publication in IFS. There are important gaps in the data on local government finances. A technical assistance mission from STA was in Rabat in February 1999 to assist the government in establishing appropriate consolidation procedures for a presentation of general government data. The mission noted areas for further improvement in the compilation of both central and local government statistics. A follow-up mission took place in February 2000 to pursue this effort. A timetable for timely and regular reporting of consolidated central government data for publication in the GFS Yearbook and II;S and the production of statistics for the various entities of local government was agreed with the authorities. Monetary accounts Monetary data were revised in 1998 and reporting to STA was disrupted as a consequence. However, with STA technical assistance (February 1999), IFS publication of Moroccan monetary statistics resumed in July 1999.

Balance of payments The recording of private foreign debt, in particular short-term debt, needs to be improved. Since May 1998, the Office des Changes has been publishing, in its new Internet site, monthly statistics on trade, tourism, private transfers, and incoming foreign direct investment. These data are available within a lag of between two and three months. Improvements of data on transport and insurance as well as tourism are still underway. Balance of payments statistics are now reported in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.
