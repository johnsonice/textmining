The external current account deficit was smaller than anticipated reflecting delays in implementing important investments for sugar sector restructuring, while nonfinancial public sector net domestic borrowing was higher than envisaged in the program. Official gross international reserves were about at programmed levels. l Slippages in fiscal and structural policies led the 2001 PRGF-supported program off track in the first half of 2001, and the program’s midterm review could not be completed. Beginning in mid-2001, corrective policy actions were taken to help contain the fiscal deficit and progress was made in implementing the delayed critical structural reforms. l In the attached Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the authorities have requested a new three-year PRGF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 54.55 million (60 percent of quota), as well as additional interim HIPC relief from the Fund in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.133 million. l The program builds on the adjustment and reform momentum exhibited since mid-200 1, and is designed to promote macroeconomic stability and long-run sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Fiscal policy envisages revenue-enhancing and expenditure-restraining measures (including tax reform and wage restraint) to improve public-sector savings and place public debt ratios on a downward trajectory. Moreover, higher savings are programmed to help finance an increase in poverty-reducing spending and critical investments in the sugar sector. Monetary policy will aim to keep inflation low in the context of the floating exchange rate regime. The program also incorporates structural reforms that are critical for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. These include comprehensive sugar-sector restructuring with World Bank technical assistance, the privatization of the largest loss-making public bauxite company in the near term and a strategy for restructuring the sector in the medium term, measures to strengthen the financial sector (including the privatization or resolution of the remaining state-owned and insolvent bank), and structural fiscal reforms to improve fiscal governance and fiscal savings. Risks to the program exist, including adverse terms-of-trade shocks, excessive increases in public-sector wages, and slippages in implementing structural reforms, but the latter two risks are mitigated by a record of improved policy implementation since mid-200 1. l The full PRSP was submitted to the World Bank and the Fund in February 2002. Progress is being made in implementing most of the enhanced HIPC Initiative completion-point triggers, with the exception of the submission to parliament of satisfactory investment legislation and the envisaged progress on civil service reform (which are being recast with World Bank and IDB support). The completion point could be reached in early 2003 following the first program review. This would require advancing critical reforms, including in the fiscal and financial sectors, and procurement reform.

In November 2000 the Executive Board concluded the 2000 Article IV consultation, and approved a second annual arrangement under the PRGF. ’ Also in November 2000 the Executive Boards of the Fund and the World Bank determined that Guyana had reached the decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and agreed to provide interim HIPC Initiative relief during the period prior to the floating completion point.2 Owing to policy slippages and delays (as discussed below), the 200 1 PRGF-supported program went off track and the midterm review was not completed by the Executive Board. The commitment period under the three-year PRGF arrangement expired at end-200 1. 2. At the conclusion of the 2000 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors noted that the pursuit of a prudent fiscal policy was crucial for Guyana to achieve higher real GDP growth, moderate inflation, poverty reduction, and the maintenance of financial stability. They stressed the importance of raising public savings in order to provide increased room for public sector investments that benefit the poor. To this end, Directors emphasized the need to restrain the government’s wage bill, and to modernize the state-owned sugar company (GUYSUCO) to enable it to compete internationally, and they welcomed the authorities’ intention to privatize the heavily subsidized bauxite companies. Directors also urged the authorities to bring the insolvent Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB) promptly to the point of sale. Moreover, they considered that by the time of the HIPC Initiative completion point, the authorities should make improvements in the quality and availability of data to monitor progress with their poverty reduction strategy. 3. Guyana’s political structure is polarized and the present political stability is fragile. Following the general elections of March 2001, some progress has been made by President Jagdeo and opposition leader Desmond Hoyte to address various sources of tensions and the political situation has stabilized. However, the distrust between the main political parties undermines consensus building and support necessary for implementing structural reforms and improving governance. 4. The staff visited Georgetown during November 28-December 13,200 1, for Article IV consultations. Discussions on the authorities’ request for a new three-year PRGF arrangement began in Washington D.C., during January 17-l&2002, and were concluded in * Guyana’s three-year PRGF arrangement in the amount of SDR 53.8 million (59.2 percent of quota) was approved in July 1998. In July 2001 the Executive Board extended the commitment period of the three-year PRGF arrangement to end-200 1. On July 3 1,2002, outstanding Fund credit to Guyana was SDR 71.43 million, or 78.58 percent of quota (see Appendix II). 2 Fund interim assistance expired in November 2001. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Georgetown during February 13-27 and April 22-23, 2002.3 4 Guyana’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was published in November 2001; its macroeconomic framework was updated in April 2002 to take into account the changed international and domestic economic conditions, and a revised assessment of available funding. The updated framework forms the basis of the 2002 public sector budgets approved by parliament. 5. In the attached Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the authorities have requested a new three-year PRGF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 54.55 million (60 percent of quota), as well as additional interim HIPC Initiative relief from the Fund in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.133 million (covering 38 percent of each principal obligation falling due until end-2002 and 29.3 percent of each principal obligation falling due between January 1,2003 and the date 12-months from the date of approval of additional interim assistance). The program is based on the authorities’ PRSP, and builds on the adjustment and reform momentum exhibited since mid-2001. It is designed to promote macroeconomic stability, and envisages structural reforms that are critical for achieving long-run sustainable growth and poverty reduction. II. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDPERFORMANCE UNDERTHE 2001 PROGRAM 6. In the context of economic stabilization and structural reform programs, actions taken since the late-1980s in the fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and structural areas lowered inflation, and led to a sharp increase in output in 1993-97 and a substantial reduction in poverty (Figures 1 and 2). However, the initial gains from stabilization and the first set of structural reforms have largely been exhausted. Despite a substantial increase in external assistance, since 1998per capita output has declined as a result of adverse 3 The Guyanese representatives included President Jagdeo; the minister of finance; the Acting Governor of the Bank of Guyana; and other senior officials. Consultations were also held with private sector businesses, members of the donor community, and leaders of the main opposition political party. The mission was comprised of Mr. Guzman (Head), Ms. Eble, Mr. EgoumC-Bossogo, and Mr. Nelmes (all WHD) and Ms. Cui (PDR). The first mission was joined by Mr. Worrell (MAE), and both missions were assisted by Mr. Faal, Resident Representative in Georgetown. Mr. Portugal, the Executive Director for Guyana, participated in the program discussions in Georgetown. 4 Staff from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) joined Fund missions in Georgetown. The staffs of these institutions collaborated closely with Fund staff, particularly on structural reforms in the social, public, and financial sectors, and with respect to governance reforms.

Output contracted by 1.4 percent in 2000 (2.5 percent increase in the program), followed by an increase of 1.4 percent in 2001 (4.2 percent in the program) (Table 1). This outturn primarily reflected production difficulties in the state-owned sugar and bauxite companies, ongoing adjustments to recent adverse terms-of-trade shocks, and overly tight credit conditions. Consumer price inflation fell from 5.8 percent during 2000 to 1% percent during 2001 (6 percent in the program). The 12-month rate of inflation in June 2002 was 6.1 percent. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 4 percent during 200 1, and by a further 5.3 percent through June 2002 (Figure 3). 8. The external current account deficit widened from US$lO9 million (15.3 percent of GDP) in 2000 to US$13 1 million (18.8 percent of GDP) in 2001 (about as in the program, adjusted to exclude programmed imports associated with GUYSUCO restructuring now scheduled to commence in 2002) (Table 2).’ In U.S. dollars, exports of goods and nonfactor services declined relative to the previous year, mostly reflecting lower bauxite and sugar export volumes, while imports were flat, as a small increase in import volume was offset by lower fuel prices. Following a 9 percent contraction in 2000, the terms of trade recovered in 2001 largely reflecting lower fuel prices. Net capital inflows including official grants fell in 200 1 primarily reflecting lower private sector inflows (lower foreign direct investment and an increase in commercial banks’ net foreign assets). The balance of payments deficit was covered by HIPC Initiative debt relief. Official gross international reserves fell at end-2001 to US$285 million, the equivalent of 4.3 months of projected 2002 imports of goods and nonfactor services. At end-June 2002, official gross international reserves stood at US$280 million. 9. Although macroeconomic stability was broadly maintained in the run-up to the March 2001 elections, policy implementation was weak in early 2001. Fiscal policy slipped in part owing to delays in eliminating electricity subsidies as envisaged under the program,6 and reflecting an unanticipated deterioration in government revenues and in the 5 As mentioned in paragraph 46 and Appendix V, Guyana’s economic and financial statistics are deficient. In particular, GDP is substantially underestimated. As a result, the ratios of variables to GDP that are presented in this report are substantially overestimated and should be used cautiously, particularly in inter-country comparisons. 6 The original 2001 program had envisaged that electricity subsidies would be eliminated by end-2000 as the increasing costs of electricity generation would be gradually passed on to electricity customers. However, to help avoid undermining social peace in the 2001 electoral period, the authorities decided to restrain electricity tariff adjustments and the subsidy rose to the equivalent of 1.8 percent of GDP on an annual basis as international fuel prices increased.

As a result, the program’s March 200 1 performance criteria for net borrowing and net domestic borrowing of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) were not observed (Table 6). Civil disturbances surrounding the national elections delayed the resumption of parliament and the presentation of the 2001 budget, and the implementation of the structural reform agenda stalled. Target dates for the three structural performance criteria under the program were missed (viz., the separation of 1,000 unqualified temporary civil servants from the public sector, the offer for sale of GNCB, and an agreement with World Bank staff on a modernization plan for GUYISUCO).~ 10. In June 2001, faced with a weaker domestic and external economic environment, fragile political stability, pressures to increase public spending beyond programmed levels (particularly on wages), and continuing substantial opposition to some of the structural reforms envisaged in the program (particularly in the civil service area), the authorities and the staff discussed policies that would help restore the path toward fiscal and external viability, and sustainable poverty reduction. 11. Following these discussions, policy implementation improved in the second half of 2001. To rein in the fiscal deficit, electricity tariffs were adjusted beginning in July to eliminate subsidies, capital spending was cut, and the ad valorem tax on gasoline was increased by 15 percent in December. GNCB was put up for sale in October and progress was made in advancing GUYSUCO reforms, albeit slowly. In December 2001 the government unilaterally instituted across-the-board government wage increases in line with the program and restrained capital spending further.s Measured from above the line, the NFPS deficit (after grants) rose from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 7.0 percent in 2001, compared to 5 percent in the program (excluding programmed GUYSUCO restructuring costs). However, when measured from below the line, the borrowing requirement of NFPS was 7.7 percent of GDP, well in excess of the deficit measured from above the line.’ 7 While a Memorandum of Understanding between the authorities and the World Bank to modernize GUYSUCO was signed in June, the underpinnings of the modernization plan were not agreed. Such underpinnings include goals and policies for the modernization plan (e.g., in terms of GUYSUCO’s expected performance and profitability, and supporting wage and employment policies), and medium-term financing plans and cash flow projections. * The authorities were unable to agree with the public sector unions on wage increases for 200 1 that would be consistent with the availability of resources for necessary investments and poverty reducing programs (unions were asking for increases of 35 percent in 2001 and 30 percent in 2002). 9 The staff and the authorities are working to determine the sources of the discrepancies in measuring the net borrowing requirement of the NFPS.

Monetary policy was relaxed gradually over the course of 2001, as economic activity stagnated and inflation declined. Broad money grew by 8.9 percent during 2001, while credit to the private sector grew by only 0.7 percent (Table 7). Although treasury bill (t-bill) nominal interest rates fell, credit conditions tightened in real terms over the course of 200 1: ex-post real 91 -day t-bill rates (calculated using the contemporaneous year-over-year CPI inflation rate) rose from 3.4 percent at end-2000 to 4.8 percent at end-2001; also, commercial banks’ nominal lending rates did not fall in line with t-bill and deposit rates owing to higher perceived credit risk. The cautious relaxation of monetary policy continued in the first half of 2002. T-bill nominal interest rates declined further, to around 4.5 percent at mid-2002. At the same time, broad money continued to grow at about 8.5 percent on a 12-month basis, while credit to the private sector remained stagnant. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total assets of commercial banks remains high, at 18.9 percent in December 2001 (14 percent excluding GNCB). Loan-loss provisions remained unchanged during 200 1, while the capital adequacy ratio remained at about 16.2 percent (14.5 percent excluding GNCB). 13. GNCB (with about 15 percent of banking system deposits) continued to post losses in 2001, equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP. As in the past, the government covered these losses with a capital injection of government debentures bearing below-market interest rates. In July 2001 the authorities intervened and initiated procedures to liquidate a small nonbank financial institution (GTICL, with less than 1 percent of the total assets of financial institutions) that was bankrupt. The authorities have indicated publicly that they will guarantee small deposits (there are about 4,000 small depositors with deposits not exceeding US$l,lOO). However, GTICL shareholders recently won a legal action against the Bank of Guyana to halting liquidation proceedings, and the authorities are in the process of considering next steps. 14. Although the authorities reduced the core civil service (excluding teachers and health- care workers) by over 1,300 in late 2000 and early 200 1 by outsourcing security services, they set aside plans to separate 1,000 temporary and unqualified staff from the core civil service as envisaged in the original 2001 program because they perceived the risk of civil disruptions to be high, while the financial impact of such downsizing would be low. The IDB and the World Bank agreed with the authorities’ changed thrust in this area of reform (see paragraph 39). A new investment code was tabled in parliament in 200 1, but it was not signed into law. 15. A Money Laundering Prevention Act was enacted in 2001 and the Bank of Guyana (BOG) has been appointed the implementing authority. The government has indicated its intention to seek membership in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in 2002, while the BOG has indicated its intention to request technical assistance from CARTAC to train staff in anti-money laundering procedures.

The experience of the 1990s highlights the importance of economic growth for improving welfare and reducing poverty in Guyana. The sharp terms-of-trade deterioration and output slowdown of recent years, as well as the expected erosion of preferential export markets for sugar and a bleak outlook for the publicly owned bauxite companies over the medium term (because of high production costs), point to the urgency of implementing policies aimed at strengthening the economy’s productivity and competitiveness. 17. The authorities’ economic objectives, outlined in their PRSP, are to boost productivity, restore output and employment growth, and reduce poverty on a sustainable basis. These goals are to be achieved through the implementation of sound fiscal, incomes and monetary policies, and through the implementation of an ambitious agenda of structural reforms and social programs. 18. In March-April 2002 the authorities and staff reached understandings on a quantified macroeconomic framework for 2002-06 that is based on the authorities’ PRSP (see PRSP addendum and Box 1). The program envisages a gradual increase of output growth over the medium term as the implementation of structural reforms begins to impact positively on productivity and competitiveness. The prime sectors of growth are expected to be agriculture, mining and construction, as well as related services. Real GDP is projected to increase gradually over 2002-06. lo Inflation is projected to rise slightly in 2002 reflecting higher imported inflation, including a moderate exchange rate depreciation, and corrective utility price adjustments, and fall gradually from that level over the medium term. The external current account deficit is expected to increase in 2003-04 reflecting temporarily higher concessionally financed public investment spending associated with GUYSUCO restructuring. The NFPS deficit (after grants) would widen through 2004 (despite strengthened savings associated with tax measures, current expenditure restraint and the effects of structural reforms) owing to the impact of the GUYSUCO project; also, about 3% percentage points of GDP of the deficit starting in 2003 reflects a change in the recording of most projected HIPC Initiative debt relief (from grants to flow rescheduling and lower amortization after stock of debt reduction) (Figure 4). Official gross international reserves would stay at comfortable levels. Assuming Guyana reaches the HIPC Initiative floating completion point in early 2003, staff preliminary projections show that the ratio of the net present value (NPV) of public debt to GDP would decline from 106 percent at end-2003 to to Output growth would accelerate gradually reflecting the modernization and substantial increase in the stock of physical capital (via increases in both public and private investment); increased productivity of both public and private physical capital (via the implementation of structural reforms); and improvements in human capital (via increased and more efficient social spending).

The framework’s medium-term policies include: (1) limiting NFPS deficits to levels consistent with adequate credit expansion to the private sector and satisfactory public debt dynamics; (2) public sector wage increases consistent with programmed inflation and productivity increases; l2 (3) restructuring the sugar and bauxite sectors, and higher spending on programs and projects to develop human capital, improve economic infrastructure, and reduce poverty; (4) in the context of a flexible exchange rate policy, a monetary stance consistent with the program’s inflation objectives; (5) public sector reforms to raise saving and efficiency in the delivery of essential public services; and (6) other structural reforms in the financial and tax systems to improve efficiency and encourage private investment. Structural reforms deemed critical to the success of the PRGF-supported program will be subject to program conditionality (Box 2). 20. Box 3 provides an overview of the government’s social sector policies. Total poverty- reducing spending under the program would rise from 16% percent of GDP in 2002 to 17% percent by 2006 (Table 8). The authorities intend to create in 2002 a Policy Coordination and Program Management Unit in the office of the president to monitor the implementation of the PRSP. The World Bank and the IDB have offered the authorities assistance to undertake in 2002 and 2003 social impact analysis of some of the envisaged reforms and to design programs to alleviate their adverse impact on affected groups. 21. The main risks to the program are that: (1) efforts to restrain public sector wages will lead to political instability or public sector wage increases will be granted above the programmed level; (2) critically-needed reforms (particularly in the state-owned enterprises and the tax system) and governance improvements will be delayed owing to political resistance or implementation capacity constraints; (3) public debt ratios decline over the medium term, but remain relatively high; (4) credit conditions will remain excessively tight; (5) the terms of trade will deteriorate relative to projections; (6) financial support for the program (including interim HIPC Initiative debt relief) will fall short of envisaged amounts; ” After HIPC grants and flow rescheduling, central government interest payments would equal 16 percent of government revenue in 2003-06. l2 Government wage increases would be in line with targeted inflation and about half of the growth of real GDP (as a rough proxy of productivity gains). In GUYSUCO, wage increases would be governed by profitability objectives. Public sector employment would be reduced through attrition in the central government and GUYSUCO, and by layoffs in the state-owned bauxite companies.

Coverage of Structural Conditionality in the Current Program Only those structural reforms deemed critical to the success of the program will be subject to program conditionality. A number of other measures that are relevant for achieving the program’s objectives and which are within the Fund’s core competencies will be monitored but are not subject to conditionality or benchmarks. Prior actions for Board consideration of the authorities’ request for a three-year PRGF arrangement, and structural performance criteria for the first year of the arrangement are set out in Table 1 and Table 2 of the MEFP, respectively. Structural-reform-related prior actions include: understandings between the authorities and the World Bank on wage and employment policies related to restructuring of the state-owned sugar company (GUYSUCO); competent private-sector management of the state-owned commercial bank (GNCB) taking into account World Bank recommendations; satisfactory steps toward government procurement reform; beginning implementation of payroll audits of the Georgetown-based core public service; and agreement on a review of the tax system and its administration. Structural performance criteria for the first year of the program cover: (1) public sector wage policy; (2) actions toward restructuring GUYSUCO; (3) the privatization or restructuring of LINMINE, the largest loss-making state-owned bauxite company; (4) the privatization or resolution of GNCB; (5) implementation of appropriate arrangements for the recovery of GNCB’s nonperforming loans; (6) agreement on reform of tax system and its administration; and (7) enactment of satisfactory procurement legislation. Given the authorities’ plans to spend US$l 10 million on GUYSUCO restructuring (equivalent to 15 percent of 2002 GDP), and given GUYSUCO’s large share in economic activity, employment and exports, a successful restructuring is critical for achieving the program’s growth, poverty reduction, fiscal and external objectives (Box 1 shows the impact of GUYSUCO restructuring on primary savings of the NFPS). LINMINE absorbed over 1% percent of GDP in fiscal transfers in 2001, compared to total employment costs of only 0.7 percent of GDP, and prospects are for this situation to worsen. This negative value added drains scarce resources from productive and poverty-reducing activities, and thus the privatization or closure of LINMINE is critical to achieving the program’s fiscal and poverty-reduction objectives. For similar reasons, and to remove a potential source of instability in the financial system, GNCB would be privatized or resolved under the program. Tax reform is critical for improving the investment climate, for funding poverty-reducing current spending, and for generating the primary savings required to finance the authorities’ planned capital investments. Procurement reform and payroll audits are crucial sources of improvements in fiscal governance and expenditure efficiency. 2. Status of Structural Conditionality from Earlier Programs Except for civil service reform, the structural performance criteria included in the original 2001 program supported by the second annual arrangement under the PRGF were met, albeit with delays. 3. Structural Areas Covered by World Bank and IDB Lending and Conditionality The World Bank is preparing a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for 2002. Structural reforms covered under the PRSC include measures to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and move towards PRSP goals in the area of education. In the area of public sector and governance, the program will help strengthen the implementation and mnitoring of the PRSP, improve procurement on public sector projects, reform audit legislation and improve financial management in local governments. The program will also help improve efficiency in the water and sugar sectors. In the former sector, tariffs and subsidies will be adjusted and management will be privatized. See Box 6 for a description of the latter reform. IDB lending and technical assistance will, inter alia, support financial sector reform, audit reform, strengthening of public investment, procurement and financial administration systems, and public sector modernization, including: (1) a gradual, needs based restructuring of public administration and civil service; and (2) a comprehensive reform of the public pension system. 4. Structural Areas Covered by HIPC Completion Point Conditionality There are four outstanding triggers for the e-HIPC completion point pending implementation: (1) a period of satisfactory performance under the PRGF in the form of one review of a PRGF-supported program covering a period of policy implementation of at least six months; (2) the submission to parliament of satisfactory procurement legislation; (3) the submission to parliament of satisfactory investment legislation; and (4) downsizing the core civil service. Three triggers are subject to complementary conditionality under the proposed PRGF: (1) government procurement reforn+-enactment of legislation consistent with World Bank advice is a performance criterion under the PRGF; (2) the completion of civil service staff audits+ommencing payroll audits of Georgetown-based core civil servants with IDB technical assistance is a prior action under the PRGF; and (3) proceeding with GUYSUCO modernization-implementation of GUYSUCO wage and employment policies recently agreed with the World Bank, and agreement on other modernization technical underpinnings are performance criteria. Assuming ,the PRGF-supported program remains on track, and all other conditions are met, the completion point could be reached following the first program review. 5. Other Relevant Structural Conditions not Included in Current Program Past attempts to retrench the public sector have been unsuccessful due to the fragile civil peace in Guyana. Measures to downsize the civil service by separating nonessential employees are not included the current program, given the high risk of civil disruptions and the low potential financial impact. Rather, the authorities are downsizing employment through attrition and undertaking a broader public sector modernization program (including civil service reform), with support f?om the IDB.

Guyana: Social Impact Analysis (SIA) of Reforms Background During 1991-2000 Guyana entered into a series of programs supported by the IMF, the World Bank and the IDB aimed at stabilizing the economy, and promoting sustainable output and employment growth and poverty reduction. The programs have been successful in reducing inflation and rebuilding the economy. As a result, the share of the population estimated to be living in poverty and in extreme poverty declined sharply between 1993 and 1998. Fiscal and monetary policies have been a focus of these programs, with important consequences for the social sector of Guyana. High inflation had led to the virtual collapse of revenues and real wages of civil servants and other critical public expenditures had declined dramatically. A major tenet of the program was to improve the elasticity of the tax structure, broaden the tax base, and improve tax administration. This, together with privatization and the downsizing of public employment, allowed a gradual recovery in social and other expenditures, and stopped the erosion of public sector wages, which had contributed to a sharp deterioration in the quality of public services. Social Safety and Poverty Programs The government also stepped up its efforts to combat poverty. Social sector spending was increased, partly with funds made available through reduction in the size of the public service and in transfers to public enterprises. In addition to various social programs of the National Insurance Scheme and of the Ministry of Human Services, Labor and Social Security, two social investment funds (the Social Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) and the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF)) were established to finance community-based projects and improve the access of the poor to social services and infrastructure. The effectiveness of social spending improved, including through enhanced budgetary and expenditure management. Also, remittances from the diaspora represent an important safety net for many households. Nonetheless, the formal social safety nets in Guyana are weak and there is need to improve the focus of SIMAP and the BNTF. Also, the financial and resource constraints of the Ministry of Human Services need to be addressed. SIA of the Program for 2002-05 In its discussion with the authorities, the Fund, the World Bank and the IDB have drawn attention to the need for a broad-based job-generating growth to further reduce poverty and to the importance of restructuring key sectors of the economy to eliminate operational subsidies to free up resources for pro-poor expenditures. The reforms envisaged under the PRGF, include eliminating subsidies to water and the bauxite industry, modernizing the sugar company, and privatizing a state-owned bank. A key objective of the program is to remove structural weaknesses in the budget and rationalize public expenditures. Also, policy advice has focused on the cost-effectiveness and financial viability of social policy options. In the short term, these reforms are likely to adversely affect certain groups, including the poor. For instance, while the removal of generalized price subsidies on water may cause real incomes of domestic consumers to decline in the short term, overtime water quality and service coverage are expected to increase, benefiting the poor. Also, while state-owned enterprise restructuring would result in job losses, the budgetary resources that are correspondingly released would be used to foster job creating investment in other areas. Moreover, the program supported by the Fund includes resources for social safety net measures to mitigate adverse short-term effects on vulnerable population groups. To alleviate the temporary adverse social impact of some of the policies envisaged in the program, the Fund and the World Bank staffs have encouraged the authorities to undertake social impact analysis and to develop social safety programs to mitigate adverse effects. These are likely to include, inter alia (i) severance payments to departing workers; (ii) employment counseling, retraining, and courses in entrepreneurial development; (iii) food-for-work programs for those unable to secure alternative employment opportunities; and (iv) land transfers.

In view of the implementation risks to the program, and to better align with Guyana’s financing needs in 2002-05, the disbursements under the proposed PRGF arrangement are backloaded. IV. POLICYDISCUSSIONSANDTHEPROPOSEDPROGRAMFOR 2002 22. The proposed 2002 program13 is predicated on output growth of 1.8 percent. Inflation is envisaged to rise to 5 percent reflecting an expected realignment of relative prices within the economy (in particular, real interest rates and the real exchange rate) that would support investment, and export and output growth. Reflecting the structural reforms that are expected to be implemented, the NFPS deficit (after grants) is programmed to widen while covered primarily by concessional external borrowing. Wage restraint in the public sector would continue. The program envisages a moderate easing of monetary policy in line with achieving the program’s inflation objective and a comfortable import coverage of official gross international reserves would be maintained. It also foresees advances in the implementation of structural reforms (covering the public enterprises, the financial sector, and government procurement and expenditure management) and progress in the preparation of other structural reforms to be implemented in 2003-05 (covering, inter alia, the tax and public investment systems). Room would be made for spending on programs to assist temporarily those adversely impacted by some of the above reforms. 23. To help ensure that the program objectives can be attained, the authorities have implemented most of the agreed prior actions in the macroeconomic, structural, and governance areas (Table 1, of the MEFP), including: (1) enactment of central government and public enterprise budgets in line with the program; and (2) progress in the implementation of most key structural reforms. They have recently completed the prior action on reaching understandings with World Bank staff on wage and employment policies consistent with satisfactory medium-term profitability targets for GUYSUCO operations. Progress on the other pending prior action-satisfactory steps toward procurement reform- has advanced following the May 2002 submission to parliament of procurement legislation that contained significant shortcomings and failed to take into account advice from the World Bank in critica areas.14 The authorities have recently put in place, with World Bank support, an interim legal framework under which government procurement will be conducted while an amendment to the legislation to correct for the aforementioned shortcomings is prepared. The interim framework is based on best practices and its implementation is to be monitored by the World Bank. l3 The program year begins July 1. l4 The shortcomings include allowance for discretionary cabinet intervention in procurement, and ill-defined and overlapping functions for various procurement bodies.

The 2002 NFPS deficit (after grants) is programmed at 7.5 percent of GDP, covered mainly by concessional external assistance, and consistent with adequate private credit growth and with progress toward public debt sustainability. l5 Reaching this target will be challenging because of: (1) falling tax collection relative to GDP partly owing to the recent expansion of tax exemptions; (2) declining central government nontax revenue associated with lower production in the large privately-owned gold company; and (3) an expected weakening of public enterprise savings, owing to continuing production difficulties in the state-owned bauxite companies, low sugar export prices, and rising international fuel prices. To reduce the prospective fiscal deficit by about 2 percent of GDP on an annual basis and help achieve the above fiscal deficit target, over the past year the authorities increased electricity tariffs to eliminate electricity subsidies, and raised the gasoline tax. Preliminary information suggests that fiscal performance in the first half of 2002 was in line with the program’s indicative targets. 25. In the discussions, the staff urged the authorities to eliminate discretionary tax exemptions, since they erode the already narrow tax base, help perpetuate high marginal tax rates, and contribute to a culture of tax evasion and governance problems that undermine the rule of law and private investment. The authorities argued that the increase in tax losses owing to tax exemptions had been solely the result of higher scheduled exemptions related to longstanding contracts and external treaties, not discretionary exemptions (see Box 4 for an examination of data on tax exemptions). In their view, the latter were essential to promote private investment under the current tax system and they were unwilling to take action to eliminate the ministry of finance’s discretion in granting new exemptions before a comprehensive review of the tax system had been completed. 26. In this context, the authorities’ program incorporates a reform of the tax system and its administration that would aim at eliminating the inefficiency, corruption and the scope for discretion existing under the current system, broaden the tax base, promote revenue stability and economic efficiency, and promote private investment while taking into account Guyana’s commitments in the trade area (PRSP p. 28 and 66).16 A mission is planned for September 2002 to reach agreement on reform of the tax system and its administration consistent with FAD technical assistance recommendations (Box 5). Agreement on tax reform is a program structural performance criterion for end-December. l5 The program targets are adjustable upward (up to certain limits) for costs associated with the privatization/restructuring of the major loss-making bauxite company (LINMINE) and the GNCB. l6 Guyana has an overall trade restrictiveness index rating of four, which is expected to stay constant in the program period.

Guyana: Tax Revenues and Exemptions The tax structure in Guyana is typical of developing countries, with more reliance on indirect than direct taxes. Customs collection, comprising mainly collection of consumption taxes on imports and import duties, account for about 38 percent of total revenues and 42 percent of tax revenues. Since 1990 the tax system in Guyana has gone through a series of reforms aimed at reducing the substantial fiscal imbalance that arose during the previous decade. The reforms were designed to broaden the revenue base, improve compliance, and remove the distortions associated with the previously complex tax system. Reforms included conversion of all specific consumption taxes to ad valorem bases, elimination of exemption of state corporations from consumption taxes, and a reduction in the number of consumption tax rates from 14 to 3. The tariff structure for imports was simplified, the share of exempted imports reduced, the market exchange rate adopted for customs purposes, and the operations of the Customs and Inland Revenue Departments were merged under the newly created semi-autonomous Revenue Authority. Notwithstanding these reforms, the revenue yield has stagnated as a percentage of GDP since 1995 despite rising expenditures, as the tax system is still characterized by high rates, a narrow tax base and weak administration. In particular, import taxes remained high, and the level of tax exemptions granted in recent years escalated. Based on data from the ASYCUDA system of the Guyana Revenue Authority, import tax exemptions have increased from G$12.8 billion (15.8 percent of import value) in 1999 to G$22.5 billion (20.6 percent of import value) in 200 1, Contractual exemptions, including those granted to foreign direct investment companies, pioneer companies, and the ones granted under the Common External Tariff (CET), have remained broadly stable at 6.2 percent of imports. In contrast, “remissions,” for which the importer must obtain approval from the ministry of finance, jumped from 9.5 percent of imports in 1999 to about 14 percent in 2001. As a share of GDP, remissions increased from 6.5 percent in 1999 to about 12 percent in 2001. These remissions have important implications for fiscal sustainability, impose an administrative burden, are not transparent, and raise governance concerns. Against this backdrop, a strong effort is needed to further improve the tax system and its administration. The major challenge facing the authorities is to broaden the tax base, reduce the incidence of highly distortionary taxes and increase revenue collection, taking into account obligations under current and prospective regional trade arrangements. Box 5 provides a summary of specific recommendations for tax reform made by a recent FAD technical assistance mission.

Guyana: Tax Reform The FAD mission that visited Georgetown in May 2002 found that Guyana’s tax rates are high, and the tax base is relatively narrow because of widespread tax evasion, extensive granting of discretionary tax, and customs duty exemptions and a consumption tax (CT) which excludes services from its base. The tax system is inequitable because of a low threshold of the personal income tax (PIT) which is mostly paid by employees and largely evaded by the self-employed. The tax laws provide for wide discretionary powers which are extensively used. Although efficiency in collecting revenues is improving slowly following the establishment of the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) more than two years ago, there is widespread disappointment with the continuing high level of corruption due to the fact that the GRA was unable to dismiss corrupt officers at its inception as envisaged in the act under which it operates. In order to address these issues in the short and medium terms, the mission recommended reforms aimed at broadening the tax base, reducing economic distortions, improving equity, and strengthening tax and customs administration, including the following: Tax policy Stop granting discretionary tax and customs duty exemptions and repeal relevant sections of the Income Tax, the Customs Act, the Consumption Tax Act, and the Financial Administration and Audit Act with a view to eliminating powers of the president and/or the minister of finance to grant discretionary exemptions; Abolish (discretionary) tax holidays-grandfathering investors currently enjoying them-and legislate effective investment incentives, such as additional capital allowances and/or accelerated depreciation in the income tax act which should apply automatically to all qualifying investors; Impose taxes on a wider range of services in the short term; Convert the CT into a VAT, introduce a system of excises on standard excisable commodities, abolish all other selective indirect taxes such the travel tax, and introduce a presumptive tax for businesses below the VAT threshold; Reduce the corporation income tax rate for “commercial” companies in two phases from 45 percent to 35 percent, the rate for “noncommercial” companies; Change the base of the minimum tax from turnover to gross assets, maintain the rate at 2 percent, and extend the tax to “noncommercial” companies; Increase withholding taxes from lo/15 percent to 20 percent, the minimum rate under the PIT; and Increase the annual threshold of the PIT in three phases beginning in 2003 from G$2 16,000 to at least G$300,000; increase the top marginal rate under the PIT from 33% percent to 35 percent; and impose a minimum income tax on professionals in self employment. Tax and customs administration . Strengthen management of the GRA; . Give the GRA full authority to recruit and dismiss its employees; . Implement a credible plan for eliminating or reducing corruption to a minimum and dramatically improving the work culture and code of conduct at the GRA; .

To contain the growth of the wage bill, the authorities have indicated their intention to: (1) limit across-the-board central government wage increases (to 6 percent) in line with the program targets on NFPS wages (MEFP Table 2); (2) continue reducing central government employment-excluding teachers and health workers-through attrition; and (3) implement payroll audits of Georgetown-based public servants with IDB assistance to eliminate ghost-workers and other irregularities in civil service payrolls. Lower election related spending (local elections are tentatively due to take place in 2002) and the elimination of electricity subsidies would help make room for poverty-reducing spending and more domestic interest outlays associated with the planned GNCB recapitalization or resolution. 28. In the context of overall wage restraint, the staff recommended wage differentiation in key policy areas, such as banking supervision and tax administration, to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The authorities agreed on the need for human resource improvements in such areas, but argued that a policy of substantial wage differentiation could not be implemented at this time because it could reinforce pressures for high public sector wage increases. They have requested that envisaged external technical assistance in support of tax, financial and civil service reforms explores ways of improving human resources. 29. Relative to GDP, NFPS capital spending in 2002 is projected to remain virtually unchanged from 2001, as cuts in nonpriority investment make room for expenditures on GUYSUCO modernization. The level of capital spending envisaged in the program is in line with available external support and historical evidence concerning implementation capacity. The authorities have identified poverty-reducing projects that would be implemented in the event that grant flows (including HIPC Initiative debt relief) exceed programmed levels. 30. During the discussions, the authorities informed the staff that they planned on entering into a specific build-operate-and-transfer (BOT) operation with private parties for the construction of a costly bridge (US$43 million, or about 6 percent of GDP) over the Berbice River in the under-developed eastern part of the country. The authorities see such a project as vital for Guyana’s economic development and regional integration. The staff stressed that the proposed BOT agreement-under which the government effectively guarantees a commercial rate of return for the private investors over the long term-would constitute a guarantee of a nonconcessional external private debt, and would thus contravene the PRGF arrangement’s zero limit on nonconcessional external borrowing. The original private contractor has since pulled out of the deal, but the authorities plan to pursue the project. In that context, the staff has strongly urged the authorities to seek IDB support for a full feasibility and economic impact study of the project before proceeding any further. The authorities requested that the issue be revisited in light of an IDB analysis of the project. B. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Policies 31.

An easing would also help to strengthen the basis for a recovery in private-sector investment and the growth of output and exports. Broad money is projected to grow slightly faster than inflation and output, and growth of credit to the private sector is projected to pick up as monetary conditions ease, nonperforming loans are restructured and the business climate improves. Gross international reserves of the BOG are projected to decline in 2002 to four months of imports, while rising to 571 percent of short-term external debt on a residual maturity basis. This level of reserves would be adequate to deal with possible adverse exogenous shocks. The authorities will continue to look at an eclectic mix of indicators to help calibrate open market operations, including the exchange rate, money and credit growth, and inflation. 32. A 200 1 joint Monetary and Exchange Affairs-CARTAC technical assistance mission assessed the overall strength and supervisory practices in the financial sector. It found that the high level of capitalization and liquidity of banks, and the recent strengthening of the regulatory framework (including through the introduction of modern banking legislation, and a new Bank of Guyana Act) have mitigated the risks to the banking system stemming from the high level of nonperforming loans. Nevertheless, the prospects are for a continuing weak performance by the financial sector as a whole, and confidence in the banking system remains fragile. Issues in need of policy action include: (1) a strengthening of supervisory skills and procedures at the BOG; (2) introduction of effective supervision by the BOG over large nonbank financial institutions; (3) the possible introduction of deposit insurance; and (4) improvements in the legal system to speed up creditors’ ability to realize collateral, which currently can take years. 33. The program calls for a number of measures to strengthen the financial sector, with support from the international financial institutions and CARTAC (PRSP p. 29, 5 1 and 61). These include: (1) the privatization or resolution of the insolvent GNCB in 2002, and the development and implementation of a satisfactory plan to recover its nonperforming loans; (2) a strengthening of financial supervision capacity and procedures; (3) the implementation of arrangements for BOG supervision of building societies (which comprise about 14 percent of total financial system assets); (4) an examination of appropriate deposit insurance coverage; (5) a study on institutional changes to speed the realization of loan collateral; and (6) a comprehensive review of the Financial Institutions and BOG Acts and their modification to strengthen the BOG’S ability to deal proactively with problem institutions and ensure consistency vis-a-vis international best practice. If necessary to privatize the GNCB, the authorities will modify legislative limits on the ownership concentration of financial l7 Guyana’s exchange system is free of restrictions on current transfers and payments.

Other Structural Reforms” 34. The authorities are working with the World Bank to flesh out GUYSUCO’s modernization plan and begin project implementation in the second half of 2002 (PRSP p. 3 1, 5 1 and, 68). According to World Bank analysis, after the plan is implemented fully, GUYSUCO should be profitable and competitive in international markets, notwithstanding the price erosion in preferential markets expected to occur beginning in 2007 (Box 6 and Table 9). Progress in implementing a satisfactory modernization plan will be a structural performance criterion for end-December. 35. Attempts in the last few years to find interested buyers of the two state-owned bauxite companies-BERMINE and LINMINE -have not met with success. LINMINE registered a deficit of about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2001 (excluding government subsidies), crowding out other government spending, including for poverty reduction. In mid-200 1, the sole private shareholder in the AROIAMA Bauxite Company (in which the government had a 50 percent stake) withdrew and left the government in full control. 36. In early 2002 a foreign mining company opened discussions with the authorities on the purchase of LINMINE, the most heavily subsidized of the companies, and informally has expressed interest in the purchase of operations of the other bauxite companies as well (PRSP p. 33 and 5 1). The program’s quantitative framework will make room for the costs likely to be associated with the privatization, including severance payments. Given the enormous drain on the public finances of subsidizing LINMINE’s continuing operating losses, its privatization or employment downsizing as part of a comprehensive restructuring is a program structural performance criterion for end-December. Once the actions on LINMINE l8 Current legislation restricts domestic concentration of bank ownership, which could disqualify the domestic financial institutions from offering bids to buy GNCB. l9 If there are no buyers for GNCB, the authorities would close it and shift its performing assets and deposit liabilities in parts to interested private domestic commercial banks. The resulting consolidation of banking activity would be efficiency enhancing for the system as a whole. 2o Table 2 of the MEFP is meant to be used as a roadmap for structural reforms that are in the PRSP and that have a significant macroeconomic impact. Only a few select elements deemed critical to the success of the PRGF-supported program would be subject to Fund conditionality (see Box 2).

Guyana: Sugar Sector Modernization During 1975-76 the Government of Guyana nationalized the sugar industry and consolidated the two primary sugar producers (Bookers and Demerara Sugar Estates) into one public corporation-the Guyana Sugar Company Limited (GUYSUCO). Under government control, GUYSUCO became increasingly uncompetitive, as needed investment was not made, poor management and frequent labor strikes adversely affected productivity, and political considerations overtook profitability concerns. Production fell by over 50 percent to 130,000 tons in 1990, significantly less than Guyana’s European quota. Expatriate management was put in place in 1992 and production rebounded to an average 284,000 tonnes per year during 1992-2001. Today, Guyana is the largest producer of sugar in the Caribbean. The sugar sector provides cash income of US$ZOO per month per family to about 10 percent of the population, accounts for 16 percent of GDP, and 25 percent of export revenues, and employs 20 percent of the labor force of the country. The sector is a major economic contributor to the rural communities and therefore plays an important role in stemming rural-urban migration and the associated social problems. Guyana’s sugar is mostly exported to the EU and the U.S. markets under preferential arrangements, and to CARICOM. About 10 percent of exports are sold on the world market. Reform of the Sector The management of the company has been successful in strengthening productive capacity in the fields and in processing factories, and unit production costs have been reduced from US$O.23 cents per pound in 1996 to about US$O. 17 cents in 200 1. Given the expected price erosion in preferential markets, GUYSUCO has developed a plan to restructure and modernize the company to reduce costs and to become more competitive. The authorities signed a Technical Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank on June 25,200l that provides a policy framework for the sugar sector restructuring. The understandings were specified further in early 2002, and an agreement was signed with the World Bank in July 2002 on wage and employment policies GUYSUCO would pursue under the restructuring plan in the period to 2006. Action Plan The restructuring/modernization plan aims at bringing down production costs to US$O. 13 cents per pound by 2006, and US$O.l 1 cents by 2008. Also, output per worker would rise on average by about 11 percent per year over this period, while employment costs would decline from around 54 percent of total recurrent costs to 43 percent by 2006. The main elements of the strategy are: . Construct and expand production in a modernized and more efficient processing plant, capable of processing 110,000 tonnes of sugar per annum. . Shift production to the high yield areas, in particular the Berbice area. Rationalize loss-making factories and estates. . Shift management incentives from volume targets to technical, cost, and profitability targets. . Link wage increases and staffing decisions to profitability targets, rather than production targets. Downsize employment. . Convert identified land to freehold title to undertake land sales, and increase production from private cane farmers. . Increase productivity in the field by employing more resistant crops, higher replacement rate of crops, improved land management techniques, and mechanization of some manual work. Investment The estimated total cost of the project is US$l 10 million, with most of the expenditure earmarked for 2003-04. The financing of the project is covered by concessional loans from the World Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank, government transfers, as well as proceeds from land sales and retained earnings. Key Policy Actions In the context of an expected price erosion in preferential markets, the timely implementation of the above required investments and institutional and operational measures to increase output and reduce production cost are crucial for the success of the strategy. In particular, the key will be completion of a modem Skeldon factory and the ability of GUYSUCO management to limit wage increases and take appropriate staffing decisions in line with medium-term profitability targets. A signed agreement between the government and GUYSUCO on sector performance and profitability (based on findings of World Bank technical studies) and commencing the implementation of the wage policy and employment downsizing agreed with the World Bank in July 2002 are structural performance criteria for end-December. The authorities will be preparing social impact analysis of the reform, with World Bank assistance (see Box 3).

To raise the low productivity of public investment, the program envisages a number of steps to make public procurement and investment more efficient over the medium term. As noted in paragraph 23, the authorities have put in place an interim legal framework, prepared with the assistance of World Bank experts, that strengthens the transparency and efficiency of government procurement practices and institutions, to be followed by the amendment of the Procurement and Tender Act to increase transparency, curtail political interference and discretion in government procurement, and strengthen government procurement institutions (PRSP p. 10, 34 and 67). Enactment of satisfactory procurement legislation is a program structural performance criterion for end-December. In addition, the institutional framework and procedures for the preparation, selection, and implementation of projects in the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) needs to be reformed (PRSP p. 33). Under current procedures, public investment projects can be undertaken without being underpinned by economic viability considerations, or linked to poverty reduction or social returns. As a result, there is a potential for inefficient use of scarce public resources, and associated governance concerns. Under the program, the authorities plan to reform the PSIP institutions and procedures, with assistance from the IDB. 38. The authorities are reforming the systems of budgetary and expenditure management, as well as treasury operations, with assistance from CIDA and CARTAC (PRSP p. 28 and 66). The reform includes modifying the relevant legislation and regulations, modernizing technology, training of personnel, and the phased introduction of program budgeting in the ministries. Also, with support from the IDB and the World Bank, the authorities intend to implement programs to strengthen the Auditor General’s and Accountant General’s Departments (PRSP p. 33 and 66). In addition, the authorities requested a Fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), which was conducted in July 2002. 39. With financial and technical support from the IDB, the authorities are working to put in place and implement a comprehensive public sector modernization program that will include the completion of staff audits, improvements in human resource management systems, assessments of the organizational and personnel requirements by ministry, and, on that basis, a multiyear restructuring of the public administration and the civil service to enhance service delivery (PRSP p. 67). V. MEDIUM-TERMEXTERNALOUTLOOKANDCAPACITYTOREPAYTHEFUND 40. Assuming the completion point is reached in early 2003, the external current account deficit is projected to increase steadily from 18.8 percent of GDP in 2001 to 23.4 percent in 2004, before declining to 16% percent of GDP in 2006. The rise in the deficit reflects to a large extent higher capital imports related to the programmed GUYSUCO investments. Export growth is projected to be low through 2005 before picking up in 2006. Higher Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - external demand, along with improvements in the productive capacity of GUYSUCO and the bauxite companies (as a result of restructuring) more than offset a decline in gold exports (as mineral deposits dwindle in the largest mine in the country). The projected current account deficits are covered by debt relief granted under the HIPC Initiative, as well as concessional external financial assistance, and foreign direct investment. On this basis, the staff estimates that economic vulnerabilities would fall and the net present value of public external debt to government revenue ratio would decline from 380 percent in 2002 to 246 percent in 2006 (Tables 10 and 1 1).2’ 41. The above projections indicate that Guyana should experience no difficulty in servicing its obligations to the Fund (Tables 12 and 13). Also, Guyana has established a good track record in servicing past debts. The BOG is subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement. The off-site assessment of the BOG is currently underway. The external audit assessment of the BOG under Guyana’s previous arrangement with the Fund was completed in December 2001. The assessment concluded that the BOG’S external audit mechanism may not be adequate in certain respects, and recommended, inter alia: (1) following the end of the BOG’S financial year, a three-month deadline for the issuance of the auditor managements’ letter and financial statements; (2) the establishment of formal procedures regarding the periodic rotation of the external auditor; and (3) the establishment of a formal process for oversight of the external audit and financial reporting. VI. CONDITIONALITY AND PROPOSED ACCESS 42. Conditionality covers only those policies that are deemed to be critical to macroeconomic stability and the successful achievement of the program’s objectives. Prior actions are listed in Table 1 of the MEFP. Structural performance criteria cover: (1) public sector wage policy; (2) GUYSUCO modernization; (3) the privatization or restructuring of LINMINE; (4) the privatization or resolution of GNCB; (5) arrangements for the recovery of GNCB’s nonperforming loans; (6) agreement on tax reform; and (7) enactment of satisfactory procurement legislation (Table 2 of the MEFP). Quantitative performance criteria or benchmarks are set out through December 2002 in Table 3 of the MEFP. The first review is expected to be completed in early 2003 and will cover, inter alia, end-December quantitative performance, including with respect to public sector wages, and progress in critical reform measures in the public enterprises, the financial sector, public procurement, and the tax system. The second review will be completed in August 2003 and will cover, inter alia, progress on critical structural reforms. 21 The debt dynamics would remain satisfactory if there are short delays in reaching the HIPC completion point and HIPC interim assistance continues to be disbursed by the creditors that are envisaged to provide it in the second-half of 2002.

Access under the requested PRGF arrangement would be the equivalent of SDR 54.55 million (60 percent of quota) consistent with the identified financing needs and with the broad principles governing a successor arrangement (Table 14). The phasing of disbursements reflects the financing needs, as well as the importance of continuing to build a track record of satisfactory policy performance (Table 15). VII. ENHANCED HIPC INITIATIVE COMPLETION POINT STATUS AND OTHER ISSUES 44. The authorities are keenly interested in reaching the enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point. As mentioned above, progress is being made in implementing most of the completion-point triggers (Appendix I), The full PRSP was published in November 2001 after wide public consultations and the authorities’ recently issued addendum to the PRSP will be discussed with stakeholders later in the year. In their joint assessment, the staffs of the IMF and World Bank consider that, on balance, the PRSP presents a credible poverty reduction strategy and provides a sound basis for Bank and Fund concessional assistance. 45. In September 2001 the World Bank, with assistance from the Fund, assessed Guyana’s capacity to track poverty-reducing public expenditures (Box 7). The assessment indicates that Guyana has demonstrated the capacity to report on social sector spending under the original HIPC Initiative, and has a satisfactory system in place to identify additional poverty-reducing spending in the budget that can be tracked going forward under enhanced HIPC Initiative debt relief. Nevertheless, the assessment makes a number of important recommendations for improvements in the current methodology. The necessary improvements will be facilitated by continued progress under the above-mentioned technical assistance programs aimed at improving government financial management. 46. Guyana provides the core minimum data for surveillance and for tracking progress under the program. Notwithstanding, important data deficiencies exist with respect to quality, timeliness, and coverage that hamper the comprehensive assessment of economic developments (Appendix V). The authorities are committed to improving compilation and dissemination practices with external technical assistance, including from the Fund. With IDB support, the authorities are preparing a population census, a new household expenditure survey and a poverty map. VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL 47. The authorities faced a number of difficult challenges in 200 1. Some arose due to recent years’ exogenous factors, such as the difficult external environment, while others reflected the complex political situation and halting policy implementation efforts, particularly in the early part of the year. In either event, the result for 2001 as a whole was that the NFPS net domestic borrowing was larger than programmed, important structural reforms ran behind schedule, and real growth fell short of the level envisaged under the second annual PRGF arrangement.

Implementation Status of Actions to Strengthen the Tracking of Poverty-Reducing Expenditures Guyana has demonstrated the capacity to report on social sector spending under the original HIPC Initiative, and it is able to identify additional poverty-reducing spending in the budget that can be tracked under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Nevertheless, during their September 2001 mission, the World Bank made a number of recommendations for improvements in public expenditure management that would strengthen the tracking of poverty-reducing expenditures going forward. These recommendations are summarized in the table below.

Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - 48. Notwithstanding the program slippages in 200 1, the authorities made commendable efforts aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability during the difficult electoral period and at raising the reform momentum subsequently. Good progress was made in a number of important-and in some cases politically very difficult-areas, including the elimination of electricity subsidies, the successful implementation of a more restrictive wage policy, the offer for sale of GNCB, and the opening of negotiations on LINMINE privatization. 49. Looking ahead, the economy will likely continue to be buffeted by exogenous shocks, political cooperation and consensus building will likely improve only gradually, and both human and institutional capacity constraints will have to be overcome. In this context, the most pressing challenges going forward are: (1) to cement policies that deliver macroeconomic stability; and (2) to undertake structural reforms and efficiently channel scarce domestic and foreign resources to projects and programs that will deliver higher sustainable growth and faster poverty reduction. The authorities’ proposed program for 2002-05 is designed to address many of these challenges. 50. The success of the program will hinge on strong policy implementation. Indeed, while debt ratios decline over the medium term, and in particular the external debt to revenue ratio falls below the relevant threshold under the HIPC Initiative, they remain at relatively high levels, thus underscoring the need for strong and consistent policy implementation-as well as prompt corrective action should slippages occur. With respect to fiscal policy, the authorities are committed to efforts to raise savings and improve efficiency in the delivery of priority public services and of capital spending in order to raise potential growth and reduce poverty. In order to achieve the program’s fiscal target for 2002, the authorities intend to restrain wage increases in the civil service and public enterprises, continue to reduce public employment (excluding teachers and health-care workers) through attrition, and complete the public sector payroll audit exercise. Public capital investment under their program will appropriately focus on modernizing the key sugar sector and implementing growth-oriented, poverty-reducing projects financed with external support, including external debt service relief. The staff supports these efforts. 51. The tax reform envisaged in the authorities’ program is essential for improving governance and enhancing the environment for private investment and output growth. It should aim at broadening the tax base, reducing high marginal tax rates, eliminating the scope for discretionary exemptions and corruption, and improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. The staff urges quick and determined actions in moving forward with such a reform, despite the authorities’ reluctance to make changes in some of these areas. The staff strongly supports the authorities’ linking of public sector wage increases to targeted inflation and productivity improvements, while addressing the needed improvements in human capacity in critical areas, such as banking supervision and tax administration. 52. With respect to monetary policy, the authorities’ implementation framework, including the use of the monetary program’s quantitative framework and of a broad set of information variables to help guide policy actions, is appropriate to achieve the program’s Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - inflation target. Given the very open nature of Guyana’s economy and the prevalence of exogenous shocks, the staff fully supports the authorities’ strategy to give prominence to attaining the inflation objective, while allowing market forces to determine the value of the exchange rate in the context of the floating exchange rate regime and strengthening export competitiveness by way of structural reforms. In this light, given the disinflation pressures that persisted through 2001 and the continued stagnation of credit to the private sector, the easing of monetary conditions undertaken in 200 1 and early 2002 was appropriate. With inflation having ticked upward in early 2002, however, further monetary easing should be put on hold, in order not to jeopardize attaining the program’s inflation target. 53. Reform of the public enterprises is a critical element for increasing the economy’s potential growth path. GUYSUCO modernization, in particular, is expected to contribute significantly to growth and fiscal savings once complete, and the authorities’ program envisages a substantial amount of resources for modernization. In order for GUYSUCO to be profitable and competitive, the authorities should press ahead with their intention to implement complimentary reforms to the overall financial management and incentive structure of GUYSUCO with World Bank assistance. In particular, the GUYSUCO management contract and worker remuneration will need to be based on profitability rather than on production (as is currently the case). 54. The publicly owned bauxite companies, in particular LINMINE, drain substantial resources from the public finances and the program envisages their privatization, restructuring, or closure. The authorities are commended for their efforts aimed at privatizing LINMINE to free up resources for poverty reduction. The staff urges them to redouble efforts aimed at completing this process as soon as possible or to begin restructuring the company in 2002. They are encouraged to begin exploring options for restructuring or privatizing the other two state-owned bauxite companies. 55. Given the financial sector’s current weakness and its critical importance for private investment and growth, the authorities should proceed with financial reforms. In particular, the privatization or resolution of GNCB is critical to the success of the authorities’ program. GNCB’s losses redirect scarce public resources away from more productive uses and have contributed to fragile public confidence in the banking system as a whole. The staff supports the authorities’ plan to privatize or resolve GNCB in 2002, as well as implement measures to help recover its nonperforming loans. Also, Fund and CARTAC technical assistance recommendations to strengthen financial regulation and supervision should be implemented expeditiously. 56. The staff welcomes other programmed reforms aimed at enhancing public sector efficiency and improving governance. It will be important to put in place new procurement legislation and regulations as planned, as well as design and implement plans to strengthen the preinvestment analysis of public investment projects with external technical assistance. In this light, the staff urges caution in proceeding with the proposed Berbice River Bridge BOT project, as decisions on this project should be informed by full feasibility and economic Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - impact studies, and framed in the context of the program’s fiscal targets. Moreover, financing arrangements should not involve explicit or contingent guarantees of nonconcessional external debts. The authorities’ efforts in improving budgetary and expenditure management systems are welcome, as is their undertaking a Fiscal ROSC in 2002. 57. The authorities are urged to make use of available support from the World Bank and the IDB to carry out promptly social impact analysis of certain planned reforms. Such analysis will be a critical input in the design of programs to assist those that may be adversely affected by these reforms. 58. Finally, the authorities need to direct more effort and resources toward improvements in the quality, timeliness, coverage and dissemination of statistics, particularly in the areas of national accounts, public finance, and monetary statistics. Assuming that additional resources will be made available, the staff supports the authorities’ request for further technical assistance in these areas. Planned improvements in the compilation of social statistics are welcome. 59. As outlined above, Guyana will continue facing challenges in its efforts to achieve sustainable growth and reduce poverty. The authorities’ proposed program for 2002-05, which is based on Guyana’s PRSP, embodies a coherent policy framework for overcoming the main existing macroeconomic obstacles to sustainable output growth and poverty reduction. Risks to the program do exist, including from adverse terms-of-trade shocks, excessive increases in public-sector wages, and slippages in implementing structural reforms. However, the policy implementation momentum exhibited since mid-200 1, and the implementation of the agreed prior actions, mitigate concerns over such risks. On this basis, the staff supports the authorities’ request for a new three-year PRGF arrangement and additional interim HIPC Initiative relief. 60. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the 24-month cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15,2002.

PROPOSED DECISIONS The following draft decisions, which may be adopted by a majority of the votes cast, are proposed for adoption by the Executive Board. Decisions 1 and 2 are proposed for adoption in principle and shall become effective on the date on which the Fund decides that the World Bank has concluded that the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper submitted by Guyana provides a sound basis for World Bank concessional financial assistance. Decision 1 1. The government of Guyana has requested a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 54.55 million. 2. The Fund approves the arrangement set forth in EBS/02/167, and decides that Guyana may request the first disbursement under the arrangement, on the condition that the information provided by Guyana on the implementation of the measures referred to in Table 1 attached to the Letter of Intent dated August 20,2002 as prior actions is accurate.

In addition, under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, IDA supports debt reduction and increased budgetary allocations to social sectors. IDA has also recently completed some analytical work to inform policy reforms (including an update of the action plan of a 1999 Country Procurement Assessment, an update of a 2000 Public Expenditure Review, and a new Country Financial Accountability Assessment). The IDA strategy for the period 2002-05 is now being finalized. The proposed strategy will involve a fundamental shift away from individual sectoral investment projects to a program of policy-based lending so as to focus Bank support on the implementation of the policy reform agenda set out in Guyana’s PRSP. Thus, the main thrust of the strategy will be a series of programmatic adjustment loans (PRSCs) which will focus on institutional and policy reforms critical for greater public sector efficiency, private sector- led growth, and poverty reduction. The PRSCs will contribute to Guyana’s financing requirements under the PRSP. The proposed strategy will also include a technical assistance credit designed to help build capacity for the implementation of the PRSP; the upcoming Guyana operation under the ongoing Caribbean Region HIV/AIDS project; a Global Environmental Facility-Financed National Protected Areas System Project; and a grant to support capacity building at the new Ministry of Amerindian Affairs. IFC’s portfolio consists of investments in the manufacturing, financial and tourism sectors. IFC will support the Guyanese private sector through a greater emphasis on the use of credit lines to, and facilities with, partners in the Caribbean region. IFC will also look for opportunities in sectors with competitive advantages and/or a less constrained investment climate; the implementation of IFC’s investment activity will depend largely on the quality and strength of projects, sponsors, and corporate governance practices.

The IDB has been a partner in Guyana’s development since 1976. The Bank’s objectives are to collaborate with Guyana to reduce its level of poverty in the medium term, while simultaneously addressing chronic institutional and human resource problems which must be alleviated in order for the country to achieve sustainable, equitable growth in the long term. The Bank’s strategy seeks to achieve the above-mentioned objectives by providing selective assistance in the three areas of development challenges confronting the country: achieving sustainable economic growth through policy reform and the enhancement of productive infrastructure, improving governance and public sector efficiency, and strengthening social programs. 2. The IDB is currently Guyana’s major source of concessional financing with projects spanning most sectors. Since 1976, the Bank approved 40 projects for US$SO8.7 million and 153 nonreimbursable technical cooperation programs for US$54.5 million. Adjustment lending has concentrated on the agricultural, financial, energy and air transport sectors, which lead to significant policy reform and an improved climate for public and private investments. Project lending is focused on poverty reduction, education, health, institutional development, and basic infrastructure rehabilitation or expansion. Of the above-mentioned operations, 13 loans were active as of August 1, 2002 (see below) for a total of US$277.9 million, of which US$242.1 million remains undisbursed. The IDB is also Guyana’s largest multilateral donor under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiatives.

Although Guyana provides the core minimum data needed for surveillance, there are deficiencies with respect to quality, timeliness, and coverage (particularly in the areas of national accounts, public finance, and balance of payments) that hamper a more comprehensive assessment of economic developments. The Fund and bilateral donors have provided a significant amount of technical assistance in the recent past, but lack of counterpart resources and poor coordination between agencies have limited the improvement. National accounts Considerable work is still required to strengthen the national accounts, including completion of the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) register of enterprises and improvement in response rates for business surveys. Prices From July 1989 through December 1994, because of concerns about the unrepresentativeness of available weights, no official consumer price index (CPI) was published. Since January 1994, an index has been compiled by the BOS, based on weights derived from a household income and expenditure survey (HIES) for the year comprising the second quarter of 1992 through the first quarter of 1993 and prices collected in the Georgetown area. Government finance The June 1998 GFS mission was a follow-up to a 1993 STA multisector mission, which expressed concerns about the classification of government transactions and the need to resume GFS reporting. A 1997 MAE mission found substantial weaknesses in the public accounting system and inconsistencies in monetary and fiscal data. The 1998 GFS mission found significant deficiencies in the fiscal data. In particular, the mission found that (i) there is a lack of clarity and documentation regarding compilation procedures and available fiscal data, (ii) annual data, which (unlike monthly fiscal data sent to WHD) covered all budgetary transactions, had significant statistical discrepancies, (iii) budgetary central government data reported monthly for Fund monitoring purposes covered only revenue and expenditure transactions, (iv) some budgetary central government data were not collected on a cash basis, and the procedures for recording transactions were deficient, and (v) the Accountant General permitted unwarranted flexibility in the recording of transactions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V The mission outlined a plan of action aimed at improving the compilation and reporting of these data. The plan called for, in the near term, improved reporting of GFS aggregates on the budgetary central government on the basis of improvements in the data base, reclassifications of transactions, and adjustments identified during the mission. While many improvements have been made, work needs to be undertaken to compile and report consolidated data on the budgetary and social security subsectors. The plan, calling for the subsequent compilation of GFS data, explained that the timing for compiling GFS would depend on additional resources to ensure an adequate data base, on the extent of institutional coverage and detail of compiled GFS data, and on the priority given to the work by the authorities. The authorities need to demonstrate a commitment to compile and report adequate and timely fiscal data to the Fund’s Statistics Department. Monetary accounts After the recommendations of the 1993 multisector mission were implemented, a monetary and financial statistics mission visited Georgetown in 2002. It reviewed the proposed new chart of accounts for commercial banks, and made several recommendations, including: expanding the depository corporations survey (monetary survey) to include the New Building Society and deposit-taking trust companies, in conformity with the new monetary andfinancial statistics manual; compiling the financial corporations survey (which covers financial companies, insurance companies and pension funds) on a quarterly basis; and commencing the collection of information on credit unions for inclusion in such surveys in the future. The mission also investigated inconsistencies in the positions among financial institutions, between monetary data reported to WHD and STA, and between monetary and fiscal data. Balance of payments The Fund assigned a balance of payments advisor to the Bank of Guyana during June 1995-June 1996 to assist in establishing a compilation system for balance of payments statistics according to the fifth edition of the balance ofpayments manual. This was followed by a technical assistance mission from November 25December 13, 1996. The mission was in response to the need to lend further support to the Bank of Guyana (BOG) to implement the enterprise-based survey approach for compilation of balance of payments statistics. The authorities have made some progress in implementing the recommendations contained in the advisor’s final report of July 19, 1996. However, balance of payments data in the balance ofpayments yearbook is only available through 1995. The Bank of Guyana Act of 1998 has designated the BOG as the official compiler of balance of payments statistics and has empowered the BOG to collect all data relevant for balance of payments purposes. A Balance of Payments Unit has been created in the BOG Research Department and a Balance of Payments Standing Committee, chaired by the governor, has been set up. However, the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) will maintain its own inhouse capacity for balance of payments compilation, as it views the balance of payments as an integral part of the national accounts. Deficiencies with the ASYCUDA system have not yet been resolved, and therefore, the BOS has not replaced its own system for processing customs data with the ASYCUDA system.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Guyana On September -, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Guyana.’ Background In the context of externally supported economic stabilization and structural reform programs, actions taken since the late-1980s in the fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and structural areas lowered inflation, and led to a sharp increase in output growth in 1993-97 and a substantial reduction in poverty. Since 1998, however, per capita output growth has stagnated, in part as a result of adverse movements in the terms of trade, a real appreciation of the currency, and a slowdown in the implementation of structural reforms. In November 2000, the Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank agreed that Guyana had fulfilled the conditions for reaching the decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and agreed to provide interim assistance during the period prior to the floating completion point. After contracting in 2000 due to ongoing adjustments to adverse terms-of-trade shocks, real GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.4 percent in 2001 as agricultural production and manufacturing activity rebounded. In the absence of domestic demand pressures, and reflecting low imported inflation, average consumer price inflation fell from 5.8 percent in 2000 to ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the September -, 2002 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-73- APPENDIX VII 1.5 percent at end-2001. By mid-2002, however, inflation rebounded to around 5 percent. In line with low inflation and a relative stable nominal exchange rate, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by around 4 percent in 2001, and by a further 1/2 of 1 percent through mid-2002. Overall borrowing by the nonfinancial public sector rose in 2001 to 7.7 percent of GDP from 6.5 percent in 2000. This increase mainly reflected the need to cover for a weaker financial performance of the state-owned bauxite companies, lower central government revenues associated in large measure with a decline in import tax revenues, and higher noninterest expenditures, particularly on public sector wages and salaries, and on capital projects. Monetary policy implementation remained prudent, as evidenced by the continued control over inflation. Short-term government treasury bill interest rates fell to around 5.5 percent in mid- 2002, and the 12-month rate of growth of broad money was around 9 percent in mid-2002 (down from around 12 percent in the preceding 12-month period). Credit to the private sector increased by 1 .O percent in the 12 months to mid-2002. The external current account deficit widened from 15.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 18.8 percent in 2001. Exports declined by about 3 percent year-over-year in 2001, mostly reflecting lower bauxite exports. Imports were flat, as a small increase in import volume was offset by lower imported fuel prices. The terms of trade improved by about 8 percent in 2001, largely as a result of lower fuel prices. Net capital inflows including official grants fell in 2001 primarily reflecting lower private sector inflows, and the balance of payments deficit was covered by HIPC debt relief. Official gross international reserves remained at comfortable levels. The implementation of structural reforms regained momentum in 2001, and has continued in 2002. The Guyana National Cooperative Bank was offered for sale, implementation of the plan for modernizing the Guyana Sugar Company has commenced, the strengthening of government procurement has begun, and technical work on tax reform has been initiated.

Dear Mr. Kiihler: 1. The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the objectives and policies that the Government of Guyana intends to pursue in the context of its medium-term program covering the period July 2002-June 2005. To facilitate the achievement of these objectives and the implementation of these policies, the Government of Guyana hereby requests: (i) a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in an amount equivalent to SDR54.55 million (60 percent of quota); and (ii) based on the completion of all prior actions proposed for consideration of Guyana’s request for a new PRGF arrangement, an amount equivalent to SDR 4.133 million, as additional interim relief from the IMF under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, to cover debt- service payments to the Fund falling due until end-2002, and between January 1,2003 and the date 12-months from when the decision to grant additional interim relief is approved. It also requests an early completion point under the Initiative. 2. A first program review will be completed by February 2003 and will consider, inter alia, the budgetary framework for 2003 and progress in advancing structural reforms in the public enterprises, the financial sector and public procurement, as well as the tax system. The second review under the arrangement will be completed by August 2003 and will consider, inter alia, further progress in the implementation of critical structural reforms. Subsequent reviews will follow the standard semi-annual pattern. The Government of Guyana will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program as set out in the attached memorandum. 3. The Government of Guyana believes that the policies and measures set out in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program; and it will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. In particular, it will restrain nonpriority public expenditures as necessary, to meet the 2002 program’s objectives for fiscal policy. During the course of the new PRGF-supported program, the government will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of any measures that could be appropriate, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation. Moreover, after the period of the new PRGF arrangement and for as long as Guyana has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund arising from loans under the arrangement, the government will consult with the Fund from time to time, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director requests consultation, on Guyana’s economic and financial policies.

INTRODUCTION 1. Since 1988 Guyana has implemented far-reaching policy and structural reforms and made strong efforts aimed at improving the delivery of social services, with substantial external support. As a result, output and per capita consumption increased sharply during 1991-97; also, according to household survey data, the share of the population living in poverty and extreme poverty dropped substantially between 1993 and 1999. Since 1998, however, output growth has slowed. This change in trend reflects adverse exogenous factors, including a decline in commodity prices, unfavorable weather conditions, as well as a difficult domestic political and labor relations environment that delayed the implementation of structural reforms and undermined investor confidence. 2. In 2000 and 2001 both exports and output were weaker than envisaged in the Government of Guyana’s (GoG) economic program, which was supported by the second annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Performance under the program’s quantitative targets fell short of expectations and the implementation of the structural reform agenda stalled in the first half of 2001. These developments reflected a fragile political environment and civil disturbances in the period following the March 200 1 national elections, continuing weak demand and prices for export commodities, and production difficulties in the state-owned bauxite companies. Nevertheless, inflation decelerated faster than anticipated and official international reserves remained strong owing to prudent monetary management. 3. Against this background, the Guyanese authorities and IMF staff reached understandings in June 200 1 on necessary modifications to macroeconomic policies. The GoG’s modified policies aimed to strengthen the public finances and advance key structural reforms to restore the path toward fiscal and external viability, and sustainable output growth and poverty reduction. Policy performance gained momentum as the year progressed. Most of the envisaged policy actions were completed by end-December 2001. In addition, the effects on public sector revenue of lower activity and prices than envisaged in the program were partly offset through higher than anticipated grants and expenditure restraint. II. THEPOVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY 4. In its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), Guyana sets out a home-grown approach to economic development and poverty reduction. The PRSP builds on existing strategies, including the over-arching National Development Strategy (NDS), which was prepared in broad consultation with civil society and sets out a long-term vision for the country. The PRSP also draws on an extensive consultation process, held over five months in mid-200 1, which involved discussions at the local, regional and national levels. These Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-77- ATTACHMENT II discussions were open to all sections of society, and included women, young people, and Amerindian Communities. In all, over 200 consultations were held involving over 8,000 people. The findings from these consultations were incorporated into the PRSP, which was further discussed at a National Review Conference in October 2001. 5. The GoG has recently revised its macroeconomic framework taking into account the worse international economic environment and lower external financing than envisaged in the original PRSP. The revised framework and public sector investment program form the basis for the enacted 2002 nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) budgets. The GoG intends to review in 2002 other aspects of the PRSP to ensure consistency with the revised macroframework. In doing so, it will consult with stakeholders and disseminate widely its revised PRSP to civil society. 6. Guyana’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) aims to make further substantial progress in reducing poverty in line with the Millennium Development Goals for the year 2015. To do so, it rests on the following pillars: (1) broad based, job generating economic growth; (2) environmental protection; (3) stronger institutions and better governance; (4) investment in human capital, mainly through basic education and primary health; (5) the expansion of economic infrastructure; (6) improved safety nets; and (7) special intervention programs to address those adversely affected by structural reforms and regional pockets of poverty. In this context, the broad policies, programs and projects that will be implemented during 2002-05 are described in the PRSP and reflect the priorities that emerged from the consultation process. Thus, the PRSP provides the GoG an overall framework for coordinating its economic and social policies, and the support of its external partners. 7. The GoG is aware that progress toward achieving its poverty reduction objectives will require further specifying and integrating its macroeconomic, structural and poverty reduction policies. To this end, this memorandum presents the GoG’s revised medium-term program for 2002-05, for which IMF support is being requested. It sets out the macroeconomic objectives that the GoG intends to achieve during this period taking into account the ongoing difficult external economic environment, and describes the policies necessary to achieve those objectives, with special attention to the policies that will be implemented in the first year of the program. III. THE MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK 8. The challenge facing Guyana over the medium term is to restore economic growth and set the economy on a higher, sustainable growth path that would substantially expand employment opportunities, reduce poverty, and improve living standards in the context of low inflation. The GoG believes that implementing prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and decisively forging ahead with critical structural reforms are key to maintaining macroeconomic stability, increasing national savings and investment, accelerating broad- based growth and job creation to benefit the poor, and reducing economic vulnerabilities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-78- ATTACHMENT II 9. Taking into account a continuing difficult environment for Guyana’s traditional exports, the GoG’s macroeconomic framework for 2002-05 is based on a sustained gradual rise of output growth, reflecting the implementation of structural reforms aimed at improving productivity and competitiveness and a strong rise in domestic investment. The main sectors of growth in this period are expected to be agriculture, mining and construction, as well as related manufactures and services. Inflation is targeted to remain in the low single digits. Reflecting the projected strong rise in domestic investment associated with the implementation of strnctural reforms, the external current account deficit in relation to GDP is projected to widen in 2003-04; it is expected to decline subsequently, as national saving strengthens in response to efficiency enhancing structural reforms. Gross official international reserves are targeted to remain in excess of the equivalent of 3% months of imports during the program period. 10. Fiscal policy will aim at reducing pressures on domestic interest rates and creating room for higher private investment, while increasing budgetary expenditures to benefit the poor. In this context, the deficits of NFPS (after grants) will be held broadly to levels that can be covered by concessional external assistance and that are consistent with reducing the public debt to GDP ratio. To help achieve the program’s fiscal objectives, the GoG will: (1) restrain wage increases in the central government in line with projected inflation and productivity gains and in the public enterprises in line with profitability objectives; (2) substantially increase spending on poverty-reducing programs and projects; (3) restructure the state-owned sugar company (GUYSUCO); (4) privatize or restructure the loss-making bauxite operations in order to eliminate government transfers to the state-owned bauxite companies in 2003 and beyond; (5) implement a comprehensive reform of the tax system and tax administration; and (6) improve both public procurement and the selection of public investment projects to increase the productivity of public investment and the efficiency of service delivery. The fiscal program, which is being supported by international financial institutions and multilateral and bilateral donors, incorporates sizeable spending associated with the restructuring of the sugar and bauxite sectors. It also assumes that Guyana will reach the enhanced HIPC Initiative floating completion point in early 2003, which would make available additional resources from lower external public debt servicing for funding poverty reducing programs and projects, as described in the PRSP. 11. In the context of Guyana’s flexible exchange rate system, and in line with the implementation of prudent fiscal and wage policies, the overriding objective of monetary policy will be to attain the program’s inflation targets. The exchange rate will continue to be market determined and exchange market interventions by the Bank of Guyana (BOG) will aim at maintaining the programmed levels of official foreign exchange reserves. The management of Guyana’s external public debt will continue to be strengthened and public external borrowing (or guarantees of private external debts) at nonconcessional terms will be avoided. 12. The program’s priorities in the structural area will include the public sector reforms (listed in paragraph 10 above) to raise public saving, increase the efficiency of public investment and improve the delivery of essential public services, as well as reforms covering Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 79 - ATTACHMENT II the financial sector (Table 2). In addition, the government will regulate private utilities so as to improve the functioning of markets, reduce domestic production costs and help expand private investment. The Government of Guyana (GoG) also is committed to improving governance, through actions that will increase transparency and improve controls and oversight over the use of public resources, while continuing to strengthen the judiciary and participatory democracy. The GoG will work with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and donors in 2002-03 to: (1) analyze the social impact of some of the structural reforms it intends to implement, and design and take temporary measures to assist those that might be adversely affected; and (2) put in place more effective social safety net programs. IV. ECONOMICANDFINANCIALPROGFUMFOR 2002 13. Guyana has continued to face a difficult economic environment in 2002, as commodity prices remain weak, the state-owned bauxite companies continue to experience low production and loss in market share and the ore reserves of the largest private gold mine (OMAI) begin to decline. Taking these developments into account, and in line with the medium-term objectives outlined in paragraph 9, the program for 2002 is based on output growth of nearly 2 percent, and aims to limit inflation to 5 percent and maintain official gross international reserves at the equivalent of four months of 2003 imports of goods and nonfactor services. It also aims at appropriately supporting critical structural reforms and poverty reducing programs and projects. A. Public Finances 14. Fiscal policy in 2002 will support the achievement of the program’s inflation target and a lowering of domestic interest rates in real terms to encourage private investment and output. The fiscal program makes room for necessary outlays for restructuring of the sugar and bauxite companies and expanding poverty-reducing programs and projects. To this end, the fiscal program envisages a deficit of the NFPS of G$10.4 billion after grants (7% percent of GDP), which will be covered largely by concessional external assistance. The fiscal program would be consistent with a decline in the ratio of public debt to GDP and progress toward external debt sustainability. In line with the above fiscal policy stance, the GoG has established quarterly limits on the net borrowing requirement of the NFPS and on the net domestic financing of the NFPS deficit through December 2002, as shown in Table 3. 15. To help achieve the program’s 2002 fiscal targets, NFPS expenditures will be restrained. In doing so, central government current expenditure (excluding transfers to the public enterprises) will not exceed G$47.3 billion (34.1 percent of GDP). In line with the GoG’s commitment to limit the wage bill of the NFPS in 2002 as described in Table 2, the GoG will restrain across the board increases in wages of government employees, will freeze hiring in the core civil service, and started payroll audits in May 2002. Even so, the government will continue to recruit additional education and health personnel in line with its PRSP objectives. Central government current spending on other goods and services will be limited to G$9.9 billion (7.1 percent of GDP), while current transfers (excluding the public Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 80 - ATTACHMENT II enterprises) will be limited to G$lO.O billion. To this end, electricity subsidies, except for pensioners and old-aged people on fixed incomes were removed in the second half of 2001. In line with projected available funding, NFPS capital expenditure will be held to no more than G$19.4 million (14.0 percent of GDP). This will accommodate outlays for the implementation of the GUYSUCO restructuring project and part of poverty-reducing projects, in part financed by interim assistance from the enhanced HIPC debt relief.’ 16. Total revenue (excluding grants) of the NFPS is projected to increase to G$45.0 billion (32.4 percent of GDP) in 2002. Consumption taxes on fuels are projected to increase by about the equivalent of % percentage point of GDP, reflecting a reversal in December 2001 and early 2002 of the temporary fuel tax reductions that were implemented early in 2001, to offset the domestic impact of the temporary surge in international fuel prices. The public enterprises’ current balance (which is counted as NFPS revenue) is expected to decline relative to 200 1 to G$ 1.1 billion reflecting a lower external demand for bauxite and weaker sugar export prices. To help ensure that the enterprise current balance does not deteriorate further, public enterprises will continue to streamline their employment, and remuneration and bonuses will be limited in line with the limit on the wage bill of the NFPS specified in Table 2. Nontax revenue and grants, including enhanced HIPC interim assistance, are projected to decline somewhat relative to 2001. 17. The Revenue Authority will seek to enhance its effectiveness by taking actions to: (1) strengthen staffing and training; (2) improve the detection of underinvoicing of imports; (3) improve management information systems; and (4) improve cross-checking of information on tax receipts and returns with third-party sources. Tax audits will be intensified. B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies 18. In the context of Guyana’s flexible exchange rate system, the overriding objective of monetary and credit policies in 2002 will be to achieve the program’s inflation targets. With an improved political environment indications of continuing excess supplies of agricultural products and labor, and the support of the fiscal and wage policies outlined above, the BOG will endeavor to ease monetary conditions in 2002 through the use of indirect monetary control instruments. In this context, the BOG’S monetary program envisages base money and broad money growth of 8.8 percent during 2002, slightly more than projected output growth and targeted inflation. BOG intervention in the exchange market will be guided by the need to achieve the program’s targets on official net international reserves. Consistent with this approach, appropriate performance criteria and benchmarks on the BOG’S net domestic assets and net international reserves are contained in Table 3. ’ GoG intends to begin implementing additional poverty-reducing capital outlays once additional debt relief associated with Guyana reaching the enhanced HIPC completion point becomes available. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 81 - ATTACHMENT II 19. The GoG is committed to building a sound and efticient financial system. Developing strong and effective bank supervision remains key to achieving this objective. With technical assistance from the International Financial Institutions and CARTAC, the BOG will endeavor to apply fully the Base1 Core Principles for effective banking supervision. Loan classification and provisioning will be strengthened further, commercial banks’ accounting practices will be updated, and they will be encouraged to modernize their risk management practices and comply with money laundering laws. In doing so, the BOG will establish a Financial Stability Unit by end-2002. It also will take steps to strengthen skills of staff in the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) through training and by implementing a human resource policy in line with CARTAC technical assistance recommendations. 20. The BOG recognizes that prompt action to deal with problem financial institutions is essential to preserve financial stability, provide appropriate incentives for sound financial management and minimize public sector contingent liabilities. In this context, the BOG will, by November 2002, introduce comprehensive amendments to the Financial Institutions and Bank of Guyana Acts regarding the role of the BOG to: (1) prohibit loans for purchase of own shares; (2) grant special emergency power to take prompt remedial actions as necessary; (3) specify statutory liabilities of directors of licensed financial institutions; and (4) provide penalties for providing false information to licensed financial institutions for purposes of securing a loan. The BOG will also prepare a handbook that clarifies the legal rights and obligations of directors of licensed financial institutions. The GoG will take steps to help ensure that licensed nonbank financial institutions are properly supervised; such steps will include the appointment of a Legal Officer at the Bank of Guyana and of a Commissioner of Insurance in 2002. It also will bring the New Building Society under the supervision of the FIA in 2002. 21. The GoG is committed to privatize to a fit and proper buyer, or initiate the resolution of the sole remaining state-owned commercial bank (GNCB), which was put up for sale in late-200 1. The timetable to privatize GNCB has been delayed in order to broaden the pool of interested buyers. It is now expected that the bank could be awarded to an interested buyer by end-October 2002; if not, the government will proceed immediately to implement an appropriate resolution strategy, in line with CARTAC and World Bank recommendations. A competent management team will remain in place until the privatization of the GNCB is completed or its resolution is secured. The GoG will put in place appropriate arrangements for the recovery of GNCB’s impaired loan portfolio. The GoG is also committed to a satisfactory resolution at the earliest possible date of the Globe Trust Investment Company Limited (GTICL), which is not in compliance with the Financial Institutions Act, is bankrupt owing to mismanagement, and was intervened by the BOG in 200 1. 22. The GoG, with the CARTAC assistance, will undertake a comprehensive study to examine the scope for introducing a well defined system of deposit insurance that, inter alia, would protect small depositors while limiting potential contingent public sector liabilities. 23. In 200 1 Guyana passed legislation and established a committee comprising the central bank, revenue authority, and law enforcement officials to control and to prevent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 82 - ATTACHMENT II money laundering for all financial intermediaries subject to the FIA. The GoG will join the Caribbean Financial Task Force and will establish by October 2002, a financial intelligence unit whose main function would be to detect funds originating from narcotics operations, arms trade, extortion, and corruption among others. 24. The BOG undertakes to update its external audit mechanism according to international standards and to publish the audit opinion together with the central bank’s annual financial statements beginning with the financial year 2002. C. External Sector Policies 25. The balance of payments projections are based on the outlook for the traditional sectors of gold, sugar, rice, bauxite, timber, and other nontraditional export sectors and for external financial assistance (including debt relief). The projections also are based on the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies (as described above), and the implementation of structural reforms (see below). In this context, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is expected to widen by 1.4 percentage points, to 20.2 percent of GDP in 2002. This deficit will be largely financed by external concessional loans, grants and debt relief to the public sector, as well as private capital inflows. 26. A policy of prudent external debt management will be pursued. The GoG will only have recourse to grants and/or concessional loans. To this end, it will refrain from contracting or guaranteeing new external loans with a grant element of less than 35 percent, with the exception of normal short-term import credits. To do so, all new loans contracted or guaranteed by the GoG will continue to be subject to the prior authorization of the minister of finance, who will confirm the concessionality of the proposed terms of the loan. The GoG will meet its public debt obligations on a timely basis and will accumulate no external or domestic payments arrears (except on external debt service payments consistent with the HIPC Initiative). 27. The COG will continue to actively participate in initiatives to promote regional integration, especially in the areas of the development of the regional financial market and single market economy under CARICOM, and the harmonization of external tariffs and indirect taxes. 28. The GoG will not introduce new or intensify existing exchange restrictions, introduce or modify any multiple currency practice. Also, it will not impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments reasons, or conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. D. Other Structural and Governance Policies 29. The GoG intends to begin implementing by midyear a project to restructure and modernize GUYSUCO with assistance from the World Bank and the CDB, which is expected to increase the industry’s competitiveness in anticipation of price erosion in preferential markets over the medium-term. The project involves, inter alia, modernizing a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 83 - ATTACHMENT II sugar factory, restructuring GUYSUCO’s private management contract to introduce profitability performance benchmarks combined with the requisite managerial autonomy, increasing cane production by private growers and selling GUYSUCO’s unused land. The restructuring project will be financed solely with concessional resources in the context of the implementation of the PRS. 30. The GoG has attempted in the last years to find interested buyers for two main state- owned bauxite companies, which have a combined deficit equivalent to nearly 2 percent of GDP. Recent discussions with a foreign mining company already operating in Guyana could lead to the privatization of one of these companies by end-October 2002. Regardless, the GoG is committed to a comprehensive restructuring of the sector, with a view to eliminating the need for government transfers to cover the companies’ operating losses in 2003 and onwards. The freed resources will be used in poverty reducing activities including job creation, staff retraining and community development. To help design and implement a satisfactory restructuring plan, the GoG may request technical assistance from the IDB in 2002. Critical benchmarks for the implementation of a plan will be incorporated in the program at the time of its first review. 31. The GoG is aware that, over the medium term, available balance of payments support will be reduced significantly and the revenue base will be threatened by the planned expansion of regional trade arrangements. In this context, the GoG will undertake a comprehensive reform of the tax system and its administration with IMF, World Bank and CARTAC assistance, with a view to broadening the tax base and reducing existing high marginal rates, so as to promote growth and reduce poverty, while meeting Guyana’s international trade obligations. It is expected that the reform would improve revenue administration and strengthen revenue collection. The GoG intends to hold public consultations on the proposals for tax reform by October 2002, and to submit tax reform legislation to parliament by end-2002, with a view to begin implementing tax reform measures in 2003. 32. The GoG believes that improving the delivery of essential public services requires strengthening the civil service. In this context, it completed in 200 1: (1) the clean up of the human resource database for the entire civil service; (2) the computerization of the payroll and pensions; and (3) the outsourcing of security services, reducing about 1,300 staff from the core civil service in late 2000 and early 2001. Looking ahead, the GoG will design and implement with IDB assistance a gradual multiyear public sector modernization program (PSMP) that will allow the matching of required and available competencies and skills, the redeployment of employees to areas where they are most needed, and the provision of appropriate incentives to improve service delivery. As steps in the PSMP, in 2002 the GoG will implement payroll audits of the Georgetown-based core public service, complete overview studies of the public service function and human resource allocation, and complete institutional and capacity assessments of some ministries. 33. To enhance the efficiency of public investment, the GoG will improve the institutional framework and procedures for the preparation, selection, monitoring and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 84 - ATTACHMENT II implementation of projects in the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). In this context, it will design, with IDB technical assistance, an improved system of preinvestment analysis of public investment projects, and continue to improve the coordination of the recurrent and capital budgets. 34. The GoG is in the process of introducing a new system of expenditure management and program budgeting and is reforming treasury operations and management with technical assistance from CIDA. The program budgeting will allow for a more efficient system of control and allocation of budgetary resources. The second enhanced pilot phase of the implementation of the system, covering seven agencies and regions was completed in December 2001. The third phase, which focuses on capacity building, will commence in May 2002. It is expected that all ministries will be incorporated into the system by end-2004. To be fully operational, the new system will require changes to the existing organic budget legislation, which will be drafted with CARTAC assistance and enacted in 2002. In addition, treasury operations and management are being modernized and the GoG will commence preparatory work, especially in the areas of record keeping/reconciliation and capacity building, ahead of the planned computerization of treasury functions. The GoG aims to achieve regional standards of best practices in the treasury by August 2003. In this context, an IMF technical assistance mission in mid-2002 conducted an assessment of fiscal policy practices. 35. The GoG is also moving ahead with other important initiatives to improve government procurement and auditing systems. The GoG will draft a new audit act with a view to enacting it in 2003. The GoG will also adopt new rules and regulations in 2002 based on World Bank technical advice to strengthen procurement procedures. By end- December 2002, it will amend the recently enacted legislation on government procurement and tender. Also, in collaboration with the IDB, it will design and implement a program to strengthen the Auditor General’s and Accountant General’s Departments in 2003-04. 36. Adequate and reliable supplies of low-cost public utility services are essential for sustained economic development and poverty reduction. In this context, the GoG is working with IDB technical support to improve the regulatory and operating environments for private investment and competition in the communications and electricity sectors, and expand the provision of these services in the rural areas. It also is working with the IDB, World Bank and bilateral donors to improve and expand the delivery of water and sewage services by merging the state-owned water companies, restructuring the new company and privatizing its management. 37. To help improve property rights over land, increase land ownership by the poor, facilitate the settlement of squatters, and provided title deeds that enables access to credit from financing institutions, in 2002 the Deed Registry will be fully computerized. To help improve credit allocation, a credit reporting bureau (or credit risk unit at the BOG) will be developed with IDB assistance to pool information about consumer and business payment records, and reduce credit risk and lending rates to debtors with good payment records. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 85 - ATTACHMENT II 38. The GoG believes that the successful implementation of the poverty reduction strategy will require continued efforts to improve its capacity to monitor and coordinate the policies being implemented. For this purpose, a Policy Coordination and Program Management Unit attached to the Office of the President will be established in 2002. At the same time, the GoG will prepare a multiyear action plan to strengthen the compilation and analysis of economic and social statistics, including strengthening the institutional capacity and staffing of the Bureau of Statistics. For this purpose, the GoG will be requesting technical support from the World Bank, IDB and CARTAC. Also, and in conjunction with the national population census to be conducted in 2002, an integrated household consumption/expenditure survey will be completed by end-2002, with World Bank assistance. These efforts are expected to lead to the production of a detailed poverty map, which will allow for better social impact analysis of some of the envisaged structural reforms, as well as the formulation of policies to assist the affected groups and reduce poverty over the medium term. v. PROGRAM MONITORING AND PRIOR ACTIONS 39. Implementation of the 2002 program will be monitored according to structural and quantitative performance criteria (see attached Tables 2 and 3, respectively). The program year begins July 1. The definitions of the variables monitored as quantitative and structural performance criteria are contained in the attached technical memorandum of understanding. Program implementation and the economic results recorded in connection with the program targets will be subject to a first review in February 2003, and a second review in August 2003. The GoG will implement all the prior actions indicated in Table 1 before IMF Board consideration of the request for a three-year PRGF arrangement. 40. The first disbursement under this arrangement will be available after Board approval, upon the request of the GoG. The second disbursement will be conditional upon observance of the quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2002 and completion of the first review, and the observance of structural performance criteria applicable at that time. The reviews and other conditions applicable to disbursements in 2003 will be established during the first and second reviews under the arrangement.

ACTIONS To BE TAKEN PRIOR To IMF BOARD CONSIDERATION OF A THREE-YEAR PRGF ARRANGEMENT Maintain competent private sector management of the GNCB taking into account World Bank recommendations. Approve government and public enterprise budgets for 2002 consistent with a nonfinancial public sector deficit of G$10.4 billion (7% percent of GDP) or less. The nonfinancial public sector budgets should be consistent with a combined nonfinancial public sector wage bill no larger than G$33 billion. Sign agreement between the GoG and the World Bank on wage policy and employment downsizing in 2002-05 consistent with satisfactory sugar sector performance and profitability, taking into account findings of World Bank technical studies. Formally agree to allow technical work to begin on a comprehensive review of the tax system and its administration with a view to designing a reform that would broaden the tax base and increase tax revenue, while taking into account Guyana’s commitment under regional trade/WTO arrangements. Implement a new framework for conducting government procurement, including the following steps: (1) sign into law the procurement legislation recently passed by parliament; (2) sign a loan agreement with the World Bank, amended with procurement provisions that, inter alia, increase transparency, curtail discretion in procurement decisions, and strengthen government procurement institutions; and (3) issue administrative order on new procurement framework and procedures. Begin to design a plan to strengthen pre-investment analysis of investment projects and system taking into account IDB technical studies. Begin to implement payroll audits of the Georgetown-based core public service. Refrain from contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector of new external loans (public or private) with a grant element of less than 35 percent, with the exception of normal short-term import credits.

This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets forth the definitions of the variables used in quantifying the targets and benchmarks, and explains the adjusters to these targets and benchmarks. The limits and targets for 2002 referred to in the letter dated August, 2002 (Table 3) are cumulative from December 3 1,2001, and include debt relief provided under the original HIPC Initiative and interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative but exclude any additional relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 2. All data for monitoring developments under the Fund supported program will be sent directly to the Fund’s Resident Representative within four weeks from the end of the relevant month or quarter. The Guyanese authorities will send through the Fund’s resident representative office monthly information on the operations of the public sector as specified in Section C below, as well as the information on the monetary sector reported by the Bank of Guyana, main macroeconomic indicators reported by the Bureau of Statistics, and external financing as reported by the ministry of finance. In addition, timely information will be provided to the Fund on economic and financial measures taken by the government and changes in legislation, including laws approved by the parliament and other key economic agencies, especially on the structural reforms highlighted in the program. A. Quantitative Targets 3. The net foreign assets of the Bank of Guyana (BOG) are defined as the gross international reserves of the BOG less current short-, medium-, and long-term external liabilities, rescheduled external liabilities, and (if any) external payments arrears of the BOG. Gross international reserves are defined as foreign bank accounts, securities, gold, SDRs excluding the net position in the Fund, and working balances in foreign currencies. Non-U.S. dollar reserve assets and liabilities are converted into U.S. dollars at the cross-exchange rate prevailing on December 3 1,2001, except for the U.S. dollar/SDR rate which is assumed at US$1.262=SDR 1.’ 4. The net domestic assets ofthe BOG are defined as currency held outside the BOG less net foreign assets of the BOG (as defined in paragraph 3 above) converted into Guyana dollars at the agreed accounting exchange rate.2 5. The public sector is defined as the nonfinancial public sector (as defined in paragraph 6) and the BOG, but excludes the Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB). ’ Excludes any encumbered reserves. 2 The assumed accounting rate is US$l=G$189.5. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 94 - ATTACHMENT III 6. The nollfinancial public sector (NFPS) comprises the central government, the National Insurance Scheme, and the nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises and agencies in which the government owns more than 50 percent of the shares, but are not consolidated in the budget-see the list at the end of this TMU). The total net borrowing requirement ofthe NFPS (NBR) is defined as the sum of: (i) net external borrowing (paragraph 7); and (ii) the net domestic borrowing (paragraph 8). 7. Net external borrowing is defined as the sum of the net inflows in foreign currencies (as reported by the ministry of finance) to the NFPS converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction. Net flows in foreign currencies to the NFPS are defined as the sum of disbursements (including loans, suppliers’ credits, leases, or any other financial instrument that gives rise to an external liability), less scheduled principal payments, plus principal and interest payments rescheduled or forgiven in the period, plus external arrears (see paragraph lo), plus net inflows from the GUYSUCO retention account. 8. The net domestic borrowing requirement by NFPS is the sum of: (i) the change in the stock of domestic debt of the NFPS; (ii) net receipts from divestment; (iii) the change in domestic arrears of the NFPS; (iv) the float. The change in the stock ofdomestic debt of NFPS (to be reported by the BOG) consists of changes in the net credit extended by the domestic financial system to the NFPS, excluding net receipts from divestment; and changes in the stock of treasury bills, debentures, and defense bonds held by the nonfinancial private sector, except for special debentures issued by the treasury to cover unrealized foreign exchange losses of the BOG and provisions for bad loans of the Guyana National Cooperative Bank. Treasury bills will be recorded at face value, except for those held by the banking system which will be recorded on a purchase price basis. The domesticflnancial system includes the BOG, the commercial banks, and the nonbank financial intermediaries (building societies, trust funds, insurance companies, and insurance schemes). Net credit by the domesticfinancial system is defined as the sum of: net credit (credit minus deposits) of the BOG; commercial banks’ advances and loans minus deposits; and net credit by the nonbank financial institutions. Net receiptsfrom divestment is defined as the change in the balance on the divestment account (3 179) as reported by the BOG. Thefloat is defined as the change in the balance of outstanding cash book related checks by the central government, measured by the difference between the ministry of finance cash book and the cash book balance at the BOG (account (3001)). 9. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt is defined to include debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector as defined in paragraph 5. The performance criterion on contracting external debt applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision approved on August 24,2000), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. The definition of debt set forth in point No. 9 of the guidelines reads as follows: “(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 95 - ATTACHMENT III services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lesser retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.” 10. Nonconcessionalpublic andpublicly guaranteed external debt: For the purpose of the ceiling on the contracting of nonconcessional external debt of the NFPS and the BOG, nonconcessional is defined as having a grant element (in net present value relative to face value) of less than 35 percent, based on the currency- and maturity-specific commercial reference rates (CIRR), published monthly by the OECD. The limit excludes the contracting of short-term import related debts, the use of Fund resources, and refinancing operations. 11. Changes in the externalpayments arrears of thepublic sector will be defined as the difference between the external scheduled debt service of the public sector that has fallen due and actual debt service as reported by the ministry of finance and the BOG less amounts programmed to be rescheduled, forgiven, or in dispute. Scheduled debt-service obligations are defined as projected scheduled principal and interest obligations on outstanding debt, including rescheduled debt and debt arrears plus projected principal and interest on new debt to be contracted. 12. Contractual debt service not paid following the signing of respective bilateral agreements with creditors and normalization of debt to other creditors will be considered to be in arrears.

The limit on the total net borrowing requirement ofthe NFPS will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount that the NFPS scheduled interest payments on external debt falls short of (exceeds) the programmed interest payments. 14. The required increase in the BOG net foreign assets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount that external amortization paid by the nonfinancial public sector falls short of (exceeds) the external amortization payments incorporated in the program. It is adjustable downward by up to the equivalent of US$lO.O million for severance outlays associated with the restructuring/privatization of LINMINE. Also, it is adjustable downward by up to the equivalent of US$13.2 million over January-December 2002 for shortfalls in HIPC interim assistance from the IMF and the IDB that arise for reasons other than the nonimplementation of the associated policy conditions. td’ The limit on the net borrowing requirement of the NFPS will be adjusted upward ownward) by the amount that project loan disbursements exceed (fall short of) the programmed disbursements of US$17.2 million during January-June 2002, US$26.9 million during January-September 2002, and US$38.4 million during January-December 2002. The limit on net borrowing and net domestic borrowing of the NFPS will be adjusted upward by up to the equivalent of US$lO.O million for severance outlays associated with the restructuring/privatization of LINMINE, and by up to G$2 billion for recapitalization of GNCB in preparation for its divestment. Also, it is adjustable upward by up to the equivalent of US$13.2 million over January-December 2002 for shortfalls in HIPC interim assistance from the IMF and the IDB that arise for reasons other than the nonimplementation of the associated policy conditions. The limit on net borrowing and net domestic borrowing of the NFPS will be adjusted downward by the amount that interest payments related to the privatization or closure of GNCB fall short of programmed amounts. Also, the limit on net borrowing and net domestic borrowing of the NFPS will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount that transfers of the BOG’S capital to the NFPS exceed (fall short of) programmed amounts. 16. The required increases in the net foreign assets of the BOG will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount that the cumulative disbursements of nonproject loans exceed (fall short of) the programmed amounts. Similarly, the net domestic borrowing of the NFPS will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of the shortfall (excess) in nonproject loan disbursement. The required NFA will not be adjusted downward and domestic borrowing of NFPS upward by the amount that the cumulative disbursements of nonproject loansfall short of the programmed amounts, except in cases where the shortfall was due to factors other than the nonimplementation of the associated policy conditions. 17. The net domestic assets ofthe BOG will be revised downward (upward) by the Guyana dollar equivalent of any upward (downward) adjustment in the net foreign assets of the BOG.

C. Public Sector Operations 19. To strengthen the monitoring of the operations of the public sector and minimize possible fiscal slippages from the program targets, the authorities will strengthen appropriate mechanisms to expedite the collection, processing, assessment, and reporting of the fiscal statistics. In this connection, and in addition to the fiscal data regularly provided to the Fund, the ministry of finance will provide the Fund’s Resident Representative on a regular basis with the following: (a> monthly and quarterly data on the operations of the central government and the public enterprises within four weeks from the end of the reported month or quarter; (b) monthly and quarterly (original and revised) budget targets for central government and public enterprises data provided in (a) above as soon as such data become available and no later than one week from the time that such data are compiled (or revised); cc> revisions of data previously provided in (a) and (b) above as soon as such data become available and no later than one week from the time of revision; and (4 monthly explanations of the main developments and planned policy responses, D. Exchange Market Operations The functioning of the exchange market should continue to be free of restrictions and the exchange rate should be fully market determined. The BOG will provide the Fund’s Resident Representative on a regular basis with weekly cambio market information and monthly foreign exchange cash flow of BoG (hard currency receipts and payments).
