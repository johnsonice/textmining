Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Malaysia were held in Kuala Lumpur during May 4-17, 1995.’ The mission met with the Governor ofBank Negara; the Secretary General of the Treasury; other senior government officials; and representatives of the financial and business community. Malaysia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.’ The last Article IV consultation was completed on September 23, 1994 (SM/94/239). At that time, amid indications that price and wage pressures were on the rise, Directors considered that the major challenge facing the authorities was the need to prevent the economy from overheating. Directors observed that monetary policy had been complicated by surging capital inflows, and they encouraged the early adoption of monetary policy measures that could more actively contribute to restraining demand pressures, noting that this would require the ringgit to appreciate. Directors commended the authorities on the strength of the fiscal position that had been attained in recent years, although some Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt a more ambitious target than maintaining overall budget balance over the medium term. The governing National Front coalition, led by Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, was returned to office with an overwhelming majority at the polls in April 1995. Malaysia publishes high quality economic and financial statistics on a regular basis. Recent improvements in the timeliness of core fmancial statistics, including international reserves, should facilitate the conduct of Fund surveillance. II. Economic Setting A. Background Following a recession in the mid-1980s. Malaysia has enjoyed a remarkable period of sustained economic expansion along with several of the countries in East Asia. Real GNP has grown at an average annual rate of 8% percent since 1988, while the rate of unemployment has declined steadily from 7 percent to less than 3 percent (Chart 1). Growth has been driven ‘The staff team consisted of Messrs. Kronenberg (Head), Khor, Yokoyama, and Faruqee, and Mrs. Santayana (Staff Assistant), all SEA. Mrs. Cheong, Alternate Executive Director for Malaysia, participated in the discussions as an observer. ‘The bilateral payments arrangements entered into by Malaysia that give rise to exchange restrictions as a result of settlement periods in excess of 90 days are temporarily exempted pursuant to Decision No. 10749-(94167) July 20, 1994 (see section 1II.E for further discussion). Also, Malaysia maintains restrictions on various transactions with Israel.

Although there was some variation, average inflation in Malaysia remained moderate at 3% percent. On the external side, the current account shifted from surpluses in the late 1980s to deficits in the 1990s. Although exports have expanded vigorously, import growth has been even more rapid, reflecting the strength of fixed investment. The services account has remained in deficit, reflecting substantial net payments of profits and dividends. The capital account has been consistently characterized by large net inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), associated with the rapid expansion of export-oriented manufacturing, particularly of electronics and electrical equipment. Mare recently, however, capital account developments have been dominated by massive inflows (1992-93) and outflows (1994) of short-term capital. The overall balance of payments recorded surpluses during 1989-93, which became very large toward the end of this period. However. the overall balance recorded a deficit in 1994 on account of the reversal of short-term capital flows. B. Recent Developments Real GNP expanded by 8.9 percent in 1994. underpinned by an acceleration in both private and public domestic demand (Table I). Against the background of a sharply higher rate of capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector and an improved corporate cash flow, real fixed investment increased by 19 percent, raising gross domestic investment’s share in nominal GNP to a record 40.5 percent in 1994. Gross national savings also increased, relative to GNP (to 33.9 percent) as the growth in income outpaced the acceleration in both private and public consumption The most recent data indicate that economic activity has maintained its strong momentum, with output in the first quarter of 1995 estimated to be IO percent higher than the first quarter of 1994. Manufacturing remained the dominant source of economic growth. Output increased by 14% percent in 1994, on the strength of growth in both domestic and export-oriented industries. Value added in the construction sector also increased sharply (by 15 percent), reflecting the implementation of several major infrastructure projects coupled with continued robust demand for residential, commercial, and industrial construction. In contrast, mining sector output increased only modestly, and agricultural production declined. Total employment is estimated to have increased by 3 percent during 1994, bringing the unemployment rate to below 3 percent, a level that the authorities regard as full ‘The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.

The tight labor market resulted in continued wage pressures (unit labor costs in manufacturing arc officially estimated to have increased by 3.7 percent in 1994) and an increasing incidence ofjob switching, as well as labor shortages in many sectors of the economy. Despite strong demand pressures, consumer price inflation remained moderate at 3.7 percent in 1994. about the same as in 1993 and down from a peak of 4.7 percent in 1992. During the 12 months through June 1995, the CPl increased by 3.9 percent. To some extent, the moderate rate of CPI inflation has reflected the impact of administrative measures, including the stricter enforcement of price checks on basic food items and actions to ensure that import duty reductions were passed on to linal prices. However, other indicators of inflation, such as the producer price index and the GNP deflator, accelerated markedly from about 1% percent in 1992-93 to over 4% percent in 1994. On the external front, the current account deficit widened from about 4 percent of GNP in 1993 to 6% percent of GNP in 1994, owing entirely to a deterioration in the merchandise trade account (Table 2 and Chart 2). While export performance remained strong, with the volume of exports rising by 19% percent, the import volume surged by 28% percent, led by large increases in imports of capital goods and intermediate inputs. The invisibles account deficit declined marginally relative to GNP. Net capital inflows fell sharply in 1994, owing mainly to a reversal of the interest differential in favor of Malaysia and the imposition of temporary restrictions on certain types of short-term capital inflows. For 1994 as a whole, the short-term capital account recorded a net outflow of $5.6 billion, slightly larger than the net inflow in 1993. In addition, net inflows of official long-term capital remained small. as increased borrowings by nonfinancial public enterprises were partially offset by the prepayment of some official foreign loans. However, net inflows of private long-term capital remained large ($5 billion) and continued to exceed the current account deficit ($4.4 billion). Reflecting the combined deterioration on both the current and capital accounts, the overall balance of payments swung from a surplus of I7 percent of GNP in 1993 to a deficit of 2% percent of GNP in 1994. Net international reserves declined further in early 1995, reflecting, in part, the withdrawal of fimds by institutional investors in the wake ofthe Mexican crisis. However, conditions subsequently stabilized, and there was a significant net accumulation of reserves in April-May. Gross external debt increased by $I billion to reach $26.2 billion at end-1994, roughly the same level as the central bank’s stock of gross interna- tional reserves. With the outflow of short-term funds, short-term debt declined to less than one sixth of the total. The debt-service ratio declined to about 5% percent. Malaysia’s exchange rate regime is a managed float. According to the monetary authorities, exchange market intervention is undertaken principally to maintain orderly market conditions.

However, with the stabilization of financial conditions, the ringgit recovered in the second quarter of 1994 and remained relatively stable during the remainder of the year. During the I2 months through December 1994, the nominal (real) effective exchange rate of the ringgit appreciated by 3.7 percent (3.5 percent). In mid-January 1995, the ringgit briefly came under speculative attack, along with other regional currencies, in the aftermath of the Mexican crisis. Bank Negara intervened to support the ringgit, and the attack dissipated within a few days. Since then, the ringgit has appreciated against the U.S. dollar while depreciating against the Japanese yen; in nominal (real) effective terms, the ringgit is estimated to have depreciated by 2.3 percent (2.4 percent) during the first four months of 1995. The conduct of monetary policy has been complicated in recent years by large inflows and outflows of short-term capital. In the early 1990s. monetary policy was tightened in an effort to restrain inflationary pressures. However, the tightening took place at a time when monetary conditions in the United States were easing. The resulting sharp swing in the interest rate differential between U.S. dollar and ringgit assets (Chart 4) induced massive short-term capital inflows in 1992-93, as reflected in the increased foreign liabilities of com- mercial banks and a buildup in net international reserves. The inflows became potentially destabilizing in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994, prompting Bank Negara to intervene aggressively in an effort to deter the speculative flows and avoid an overshooting of the exchange rate. Notwithstanding large-scale sterilization operations, the banking system was swamped with liquidity, and monetary aggregates accelerated sharply, with the l2-month growth rates ofMl and M3 reaching 35 percent and 23 percent, respectively, at end- December 1993 (Table 3 and Chart 5). Threatened with a loss of monetary control, Bank Negara imposed a number of monetary and administrative measures in January and February 1994, aimed at curbing the speculative inflows.J At the same time, sterilization operations were curtailed, and the three- month average interbank interest rate eased from 6.5 percent in December 1993 to 4.5 percent in June 1994. As the sterilization operations unwound, the central bank raised the statutory reserve requirement to a record I I .5 percent to mop up liquidity, and the interbank rate edged upward to 5.5 percent in December 1994. These developments, along with a sharp correction in the stock market and the upward trend in U.S. interest rates, resulted in a reversal of capital flows, with net external liabilities of the commercial banks declining from a peak of about $1 I billion in May 1994 to $2X billion at year-end and net international reserves declining by about $8 billion over the same period. The broad monetary aggregates decelerated, with growth in Ml and M3 slowing to 16.8 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively, in December 1994. Despite a pickup in domestic credit expansion to 17.3 percent in the 12-month period through March 1995, growth in Ml and M3 decelerated further to 12.5 percent and ‘For more details on the measures taken, see last year’s staff report (SM/94/239) and Box I Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - Table 3.

Box 1. Malaysia’s Recent Espcriencewith Capital Flows International capital flows have played n prominent role in the Malaysian economy in recent years. From 1990 to 1993, the level ofnet capital flows to Malaysia incrcascd substantially each year, from $3 billion in 1990 to a remarkable $I 3 billion (2 I percent of GNP) in 1993. Roughly half of Malaysia’s inflows have been in he folm offoreign direct investment (FDI), placing it as the second largest recipient ofFD1 among the dynamic 4SEAN economies, behind only Singapore.

Following the implementation of these policy measures and a reversal of interest rate differentials in favor of Malaysia, short-term capital Ilows experienced a shalp rwersal in the second half of 1994.

The federal government budget recorded an overall surplus of 3 percent of GNP in 1994, compared with approximate balance in 1993 and deficits averaging 3-4 percent in the late 1980s (Table 4 and Chart 6). The improvement in the budget balance during 1990-93 was due mainly to restraint on the expenditure side. with total expenditure falling from about 30 percent of GNP at the start of the decade to just over 25 percent in 1994. In addition, total revenues rose by I per- centage point of GNP in 1994, mainly on account of a sharp increase in asset sales.

Nevertheless, the overall balance of the consolidated public sector shiAed from approximate balance in 1993 to a surplus of I percent of GNP in 1994. III. Policy Discussions A. Economic Outlook According to the latest official projections, the economy is expected to grow by 8X-9 percent in 1995, with inflation held to below 4 percent. Although export performance is expected to remain strong, the current account deficit is projected to widen to about 7 percent of GNP, reflecting continued rapid growth in imports of investment goods. With greater stability and a lower volume of short-term capital flows, the authorities expect the overall balance of payments to revert to a small surplus in 1995. The authorities believe that structural measures to improve the hmctioning ofmarkets, along with increased investment in public infrastructure, will enable the economy to continue to grow at rates of 7-8 percent over the medium term with price stability. With the winding down of public infrastructure projects, the authorities expect the current account deficit to decline aAer 1995 and turn into surplus by the year 2000. While agreeing with the authorities’ assessment that medium-term prospects were generally favorable. the mission took the position that the balance of risks now tilted toward possible overheating and argued that the stance of financial policies should be tightened with a view to facilitating an orderly moderation of demand growth. In addition, the mission reviewed the structural policies needed to ease supply constraints and enhance the economy’s growth potential over the medium term B. Financial Policies The authorities took a cautiously optimistic view of the near-term prospects, pointing out that Malaysia had successfully sustained rapid growth with moderate inflation during the past several years. They also emphasized that, with a very high rate of investment, the capac- ity ofthe economy was expanding rapidly. In their view, the inflationary pressures in the economy stemmed mainly from supply constraints and cost-push factors, and hence the policy focus should be on structural measures to alleviate the supply constraints. In addition, the authorities had launched several “anti-inflation” campaigns to restrain inflation in the short run through reductions in import tariffs, increased imports of certain basic commodities, increased supply of low-cost housing, and administrative actions to prevent excessive markups by retailers ofbasic food items and other necessities. The mission pointed out that with labor and other factors of production heavily underutilized in the past, it had been possible for output growth to exceed potential for a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- considerable period of time. However, now that the slack in the factor markets had been fully absorbed, wage pressures had intensified and the current account deficit had widened. Although consumer price inflation remained moderate, this reflected, in part, the onetime effects of reductions in import duties and administrative measures to limit the price increases of basic food items. Moreover, other price indicators, such as the producer price index and GNP deflator, had accelerated over the past years. In addition, the effective depreciation of the ringgit in the early part of 1995 could be expected to add to demand and price pressures. Although the recent widening of the current account deficit was not, in itself, a cause for concern, the mission noted that large, protracted current account deficits could adversely affect the investment climate. Against this background, the mission argued that financial policies should be tightened. 1. Fiscal policy The Treasury’s latest forecast is for the federal government budget to record an overall surplus of 1% percent of GNP in 1995, significantly smaller than the 3 percent surplus in 1994.’ Compared with the 1994 actual outturn, the authorities envisage that federal government expenditure will decline by 2 percentage points of GNP in 1995, mainly through restraint in the size of the wage bill and cuts in subsidies and transfer payments to statutory bodies and other levels of government. Development expenditure is projected to increase moderately, reflecting efforts to complete a number of major infrastructure projects in the last year of the Sixth Malaysia Plan. Total budget revenue is projected to decline by about 3 percentage points of GNP, of which I percentage point is on account of the tax concessions contained in the budget.6 As before, the new revenue forecasts contain no provision for asset sales which amounted to 1% percentage points of GNP in 1994. As regards other public sector entities, capital expenditures of the NFPEs are expected to increase in 1995. As a result, the overall balance of the public sector is projected to weaken by 2’% percentage points of GNP to a deficit of about l’% percent of GNP in 1995. The mission observed that the projected weakening in the fiscal position implied that the public sector would impart a stimulus to demand, which would be unwarranted at a time ‘The present outlook is substantially better than that in the original 1995 budget which envisaged that the overall federal government balance would revert to a deficit of % percent of GNP Tax revenues are now expected to be significantly higher and the rate of capital spending is expected to be somewhat lower than originally envisaged. The wage bill, on the other hand, has been adjusted upward by 6 percent. ‘These tax concessions included: exemptions for remittances of overseas incomes by Malaysian companies; a reduction in the withholding tax rate on interest payments; a further reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 30 percent; a similar reduction in the tax rate of nonresident individuals; a 2-3 percentage point reduction in marginal rates on personal income tax to O-32 percent; and the reduction or abolition of import duties on more than 2,600 items.

While recognizing the importance of completing public sector investment projects to sustain growth over the medium term, the mission suggested that attempts to accelerate thetate of project implementation at this juncture could exacerbate demand pressures in the near term. Taking into account that asset sales in 1994 were unusually high, the overall fiscal position in 1995 should be maintained at a surplus at least comparable to the one recorded in 1994 in order to help alleviate demand pressures. Maintaining a larger fiscal surplus during periods of favorable economic conditions would also contribute to a further strengthening of the Government’s balance sheet and provide the authorities with wider policy options to absorb any shocks in the future, The authorities emphasized their continued commitment to fiscal discipline and consolidation and expressed the view that the public sector operations would not exacerbate inflationary pressures. Concerning the outlook for 1995, they observed that the budget deficit might still be somewhat better than forecast, particularly since the revenue projection contained no provision for asset sales. However, the authorities saw little scope for maneuver on the expenditure side, noting that it was essential to speed up the completion of the infrastructure projects in order to alleviate supply constraints. As capital expenditures tended to be import intensive, the impact of such expenditures was likely to be reflected in temporarily higher imports, rather than higher domestic inflation. As for the medium-term objectives of fiscal policy, the authorities reiterated their intention to maintain a broadly balanced budget position, with some reduction in revenue and expenditure as a proportion of GNP It was envisaged that a surplus would be maintained in the current balance at a level sufftcient to finance development expenditures. 2. Monetary and extertud policies The mission emphasized the need for monetary policy to play a supporting role in containing excess demand pressures. Although interest rates had risen moderately in Malaysia since the middle of 1994, overall liquidity in the banking system remained very high and domestic credit to the private sector had been expanding rapidly. Also, the ringgit’s nominal effective depreciation during the first several months of 1995 could be expected to contribute to demand pressures. In these circumstances, the mission took the position that early steps to tighten monetary conditions and reduce domestic credit expansion should be a priority, To avoid a recurrence of destabilizing short-term capital inflows, which had frustrated previous attempts to tighten monetary policy, the authorities should be prepared to see this tightening result in a market-induced appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate. This would be clearly preferable to allowing a real effective appreciation through higher inflation, which was the likely alternative outcome. Although the external current account deficit might widen in the near term, the mission argued that this should be viewed principally as a consequence of the current strength of domestic demand. With an appropriate tightening of both fiscal and monetary policies, the mission agreed that the current account deficit could be expected to decline to more comfortable levels over the medium term. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- The authorities underscored their continued vigilance over inflationary developments and their determination to prevent an escalation in inflation. They also observed that mone- tary aggregates had decelerated markedly while interest rates had risen since mid-1994. Although domestic credit expansion was buoyant in the preceding 12-month period, they noted that, to a certain extent, the high growth rate reflected the low demand for credit in the first half of 1994. Hence, they considered that the current stance of monetary policy was broadly appropriate, and no further tightening was called for at this time. On exchange rate policy, the authorities emphasized that their approach was already flexible, with intervention limited to maintaining orderly market conditions rather than opposing underlying market trends. Over the medium term, they recognized that the ringgit was likely to appreciate, in line with Malaysia’s strong economic fundamentals. They pointed out that such an appreciation would reinforce their strategy of productivity-led growth. However, in their view, excessive volatility in the exchange rate cauld be very disruptive to trade and investment flows and should be avoided. The authorities stated that the situation with respect to short-term capital flows and international reserves had stabilized significantly in recent months. While recognizing the need to maintain a strong international reserve position, they emphasized that it was even more important to ensure that the accumulation of reserves was sustainable and based on the under- lying strength of the economy. They noted that short-term flows could be subject to sudden reversal and, thus, could pose a risk to economic and financial stability. Looking back on the experience with restrictions on short-term capital inflows, the authorities reiterated that the administrative measures were needed under the circumstances to restore financial stability, and they considered that they had been largely successful in achieving this objective. At the same time, the authorities fully recognized that, if allowed to remain as a permanent feature, such measures could lead to market distortions and an inefficient allocation of resources. With the restoration of financial stability, most of the measures have been lifted.’ As regards prudential developments, the central bank has introduced a two-tier regulatory system, deregulating various operations of adequately capitalized banks. In response to the demand for a broader menu of financial instruments, the authorities have also approved the establishment of derivatives markets by the end of 1995, subject to various prudential guidelines. ‘The measures that remain in force are: the requirement of commercial banks to place with the central bank the ringgit funds held by foreign institutions in noninterest-bearing accounts; and the redefinition of banks’ eligible liability base to include all inflows of funds from abroad.

Structur:d Policies With growlh in the labor force and the capital stock likely to slow over the medium term, the authorities recognize that sustaining rapid economic growth will require total factor productivity to grow more rapidly than in the past. Toward this end, they have been pursuing structural reforms aimed at improving the flexibility of markets and facilitating a shift to more’ capital- and technology-intensive production techniques. Significant attention is being accorded to improving labor force skills and enhancing the flexibility of the labor market, particularly in view ofthe decision to limit the recruitment of foreign workers. As regards skills training, the Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF), launched in 1993 and financed by a I percent payroll levy, provides financial assistance to employers who send workers to approved training programs. Also, to raise the female labor force participation rate, which is low in comparison with other countries in the region, the aulhorities are encouraging greater flexibility in working hours, including increased use of par-time workers and the expansion of child-care facilities. To enhance labor market flexibility, the authorities have promoted a flexi-wage system to help ensure that wage developments are consistent with productivity trends. The authorities consider that the country’s infrastructure has become increasingly inadequate to meet the needs of a fast-growing economy, and they have, therefore, accorded a high priority to investment in economic infrastructure The major projects underway include the construction of a new international airport and a light-rail transportation system in Kuala Lumpur-. the expansion of port and power facilities, and upgrading the national railroad and highway networks. To complement the Government’s efforts, the role of the private sector in developing infrastructure has also expanded in connection with the authorities’ general privatization strategy. Public enterprise reform has contributed to a significant improvement in the efficiency of the NFPEs and eased the administrative and financial burden ofthe Government. The rolling Privatization Action Plan for 1994-95 identified I05 projects and entities for restructuring, and another 78 for privatization. Already some ofthe largest corporations in Malaysia, including the Malaysian Airline System, Syarikat Telekom Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (electricity), and HICOM (steel) have been privatized. Privatization has also contributed to the dcvelopmenr of the local stock market, which has become one of the largest in Asia. To enhance the competitiveness of the private sector and promote savings, the author- ities are continuing with tax reforms aimed at reducing the overall tax burden and broadening the tax base. In addition to the progressive reductions in marginal rates on corporate and personal income tax since 1988. plans are now being finalized for the introduction, probably in 1997, of a salts and services tax (SST). which would replace most existing sales taxes with a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - consumption-based value-added tax. The authorities also recognize that lower rates of corporate taxation should reduce the need for special fiscal incentives to promote investment. Malaysia has traditionally maintained a liberal trade regime to foster the competi- tiveness of the domestic industries and contain inflationary pressures. In the context of the I995 budget, the Government reduced or abolished import duties on more than 2,600 items, particularly on food and household items, and raw materials. As part of its Uruguay Round commitments, Malaysia has agreed to reduce and bind tariffs on 7,200 items, representing 65 percent of all tariff lines, and to phase out all nontariff barriers. The authorities expressed general satisfaction with the Uruguay Round results, noting that they would improve Malaysia’s access to international markets and facilitate the resolution of trade disputes, parti- cularly with regard to antidumping. However, they expressed disappointment with the long period for phasing out the restrictions on trade in textiles and clothing. On regional trade issues, the authorities indicated that they were on track to achieve the tariff reductions under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).” As for the APEC leaders’ 1994 Bogor Declaration, which calls for the achievement of free trade by the year 2020, the authorities regarded this as an indicative and nonbinding objective. They also emphasized that trade liberalization among APEC countries should be pursued on a multilateral (MFN) basis. D. Statistics Malaysia compiles and reports high-quality data consistent with Fund formats and definitions. On occasions, these statistics, including data on international reserves, have been reported with a lag of several months. More recently, however, notable improvements have been made in the timeliness of reporting core fmancial data. The authorities assured the mission oftheir continued cooperation with the Fund to ensure that the necessary data are transmitted on a timely basis. E. Bilrterzd Payments Arrangements hlalaysia maintains a number ofbilateral payments arrangements that give rise to exchange restrictions as a result of settlement periods in excess of 90 days. All such arrange- ments were concluded before July I, 1994 and are covered by the temporary exemption granted by the Executive Board. The authorities stated that they had contacted the authorities in the partner countries concerned with the view to amending the arrangements, as necessary, to eliminate their restrictive features. Pending the completion of this process, the mission encouraged the authorities to take steps to ensure that, for Malaysia’s part, the existing settlements are cleared in a manner that does not give rise to restrictions and to notify the Fund once such steps have been taken. ‘Under the recently shortened timetable for AFTA, ASEAN members are committed to a maximum tariff rate of 5 percent for most import items by January I, 2003.

StaffAppraisal Malaysia has achieved remarkable economic success over the past eight years, sus- taining one of the world’s highest growth rates in an environment of moderate inflation and generally strong balance of payments. This strong performance continued in 1994 when real GNP expanded by 8.9 percent, spurred by an acceleration in domestic demand. Although factor markets tightened further, with unemployment falling to a record low and capacity utilization rising sharply, consumer price inflation remained moderate. However, other indicators of inflation accelerated, wage pressures persisted, and there was a marked widening of the external current account deficit, notwithstanding a strong export performance. Net inflows of private long-term capital remained at a high level that was more than sufficient to cover the current account deficit. However, short-term capital inflows, which became massive and threatened financial stability in late 1993, were halted and reversed in 1994. and the overall balance of payments swung from a very large surplus to a deficit. In the near term, the outlook is for growth to remain robust, underpinned by rising household incomes and continued high rates of both private and public investment. Generally favorable conditions in Malaysia’s main trading partners, combined with the effective depre- ciation of the ringgit in the first half of 1995, suggest that external demand is also likely to remain strong. Looking farther ahead, the challenge for the authorities will be to sustain high rates of growth over the medium term while preserving price stability and external balance. In view of the economy’s strong fundamentals, as well as the authorities’ track record for prudent financial management, the prospects for continued success are bright. However, with the slack in the economy now fully absorbed and growth in domestic spending continuing to outpace potential output, the staff believes that the balance of risks has shifted decidedly in the direction of overheating. Timely action to tighten financial policies at this juncture would facilitate an orderly moderation in the pace of nominal demand growth, and avoid the need for a sharper tightening of policies at a later stage, which could have less desirable consequences for growth and the external balance. Fiscal policy will need to play a role in containing demand pressure. The federal government budget balance has improved steadily in recent years, from deficits on the order of 3-4 percent of GNP in the late 1980s to a record surplus of 3 percent of GNP in 1994. However, the latest estimates suggest that the budget surplus may be reduced significantly in 1995. While recognizing the need for continued spending on infrastructure projects in order to alleviate supply constraints, the staff believes that fiscal stimulus should be avoided at a time when other components of demand are growing very rapidly and the economy is already operating at full capacity. To reduce the risk of overheating, it would be prudent for the authorities to take measures aimed at achieving a fiscal surplus in 1995 comparable with the one recorded in 1994. In particular, the pace of project implementation should be consistent with the needed improvement in the fiscal position and should not exacerbate demand pressures. Doing so in the current favorable economic climate would also provide the authorities with wider policy options to absorb any shocks in the future.

In view of the strength of aggregate demand, monetary policy must play a key role in supporting a tightening of the financial policy stance. Although domestic interest rates have risen since mid-1994, liquidity in the banking system remains high, and credit has been expanding rapidly. In these circumstances, further increases in interest rates are warranted. To avoid a recurrence of the destabilizing capital flows that frustrated previous attempts to tighten monetary policy, the authorities should be prepared to see this tightening result in a market-induced appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate. Although the external current account deficit can be expected to widen further in the near term, this should be viewed as a consequence of the current strength of domestic demand, which the policy tightening is intended to address, rather than as the result of such an appreciation, per se. Indeed, allowing the exchange rate to appreciate in the context of a monetary policy tightening would contribute to the prospects for continued strong growth with a sustainable external position by helping to alleviate demand pressures, without placing an undue burden of adjustment on domestic investment. The staff agrees with the authorities that restrictions on capital flows should be used only as a last resort, as they can lead to market distortions and an inefficient allocation of resources. The staff, therefore, welcomes the authorities’ decision to lit? most of the restrictions on short-term capital inflows that were imposed in early 1994. The maintenance of a flexible exchange rate policy should reduce the risk that changes in monetary conditions will lead to destabilizing short-term capital flows that might require the reimposition of restrictions in the future. As regards other measures to develop the financial system and promote financial stability, the staff welcomes the implementation of the two-tier regulatory framework. The staff strongly endorses the thrust ofthe authorities’ structural adjustment strategy aimed at improving the flexibility of markets and generating more rapid growth in total factor productivity. In the labor market, emphasis is being given to the introduction of greater flexibility in compensation packages which should help ensure that wage developments are kept in line with productivity growth. Efforts to promote more flexible working hours, including part-time work, should facilitate the broader participation of women in the labor force, which is currently quite low. These steps are being complemented by a shift in the composition of public spending toward education and training and to urgently needed infrastructure development. The tax system is also being extensively reformed. Personal and corporate income tax rates have been significantly reduced, and plans are at an advanced stage to broaden the indirect tax base through the introduction of a comprehensive sales and services tax. In the area of trade policy, the Government has progressively reduced or eliminated import duties on a large number of products, exposing domestic markets to significantly greater international competition. Together, these steps can be expected to enhance the flexibility of markets and to improve incentives to work, save, and invest. Looking to the future, the lower level of corporate tax rates and import duties should promote the use of more capital-intensive production techniques and therefore reduce the need for special ftscal incentives in this area. The staff encourages the authorities to work in this direction, as well as to continue the process of trade liberalization.

With regard to bilateral payments arrangements, the staff welcomes and encourages the authorities’ efforts to work expeditiously in removing the restrictive features of the existing arrangements. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Malaysia be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

In the near term, aggregate demand growth is expected to remain strong, paced by rapid growth in both private investment and consumption. External demand is also projected to remain buoyant, reflecting continued economic expansion in the industrial countries and the high level of growth in regional trading partners. In the baseline scenario, the current stance of financial policies is also assumed to be maintained in 1995. The alternative scenario assumes a t3rther tightening of monetary and fiscal policies in 1995-along with some appreciation of the ringgit. In the baseline scenario, as domestic demand growth exceeds the underlying growth potential of the economy, the degree of resource utilization would continue to intensify. In view of the current high rates of capacity utilization and tightness in the labor market, excess demand would place increasing upward pressure on prices and wages. The openness of the economy would limit the extent to which domestically traded goods prices may deviate from world prices. Consequently, an important part of the adjustment would occur through declining profit margins and a reduction in international competitiveness, leading to higher imports and a significant deterioration in the external current account balance. Over the medium term, higher inflation and declining external competitiveness would serve to reduce domestic demand growth in line with the underlying expansion in domestic supply. The baseline scenario assumes that financial policies would be tightened in 1996 in response to higher inflation and a marked weakening in the external balance. As a result, inflation would be contained and eventually decline to below 4 percent, and the external current account deficit would narrow to about 5 percent. The alternative scenario assumes an earlier and more timely tightening of financial policies in order to reduce excess demand pressures and forestall overheating of the economy. Achieving the desired adjustment in demand would facilitate an orderly moderation in inflationary pressures and a reduction in external imbalance. Moreover, by stemming intlationary pressures early in the adjustment process, this course of action would have less disruptive consequences for growth and result in a stronger external position over the medium term.

The thrust of the staff appraisal has not changed as a result of this new information. The economy expanded by 9.6 percent, on an annual basis, in the first half of 1995, up from 8.5 percent growth over the corresponding period in 1994. Led by stronger growth in manufacturing, construction, and mining, real GDP growth in 1995 is now likely to exceed the authorities’ initial projection of 8.5-8.9 percent annual growth. CPI inflation increased from 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 1995 to 3.7 percent in the second quarter and is likely to remain around 4 percent for the year as a whole. Producer prices also accelerated in the first half of the year, reflecting rising local production costs. PPI inflation averaged 7.2 percent in the first half of 1995, compared to 3.3 percent in 1994. With respect to liquidity conditions, following a sharp deceleration in the first quarter, growth in monetary aggregates rebounded in the second quarter of 1995. In particular, broad money (M3) grew by 15.2 percent in the year to June 1995, led by a 28 percent expansion of credit to the private sector. Interest rates, after remaining relatively flat in the second quarter of 1995, have more recently resumed their gradual upward trend and, at 6 percent, are currently about 80 basis points higher than at end-1994. As regards the public sector, total expenditure by the Federal Government increased sharply in the second quarter of 1995, largely reflecting the increased pace of project implementation and development expenditure in the final year of the Sixth Malaysia Plan (1991-95). However, tax revenues remained very buoyant in the first half of 1995. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2- federal government budget remained in surplus on a cash flow basis, albeit slightly smaller than in the first half of 1994. On the external side, the trade deficit widened sharply to USS2.7 billion during the first seven months of 1995, compared with a deficit of US$O.2 billion during the same period in 1994. Export growth remained vigorous during the first half of the year (22 percent). However, imports grew even more rapidly (28 percent), reflecting strong growth in investment and consumption, including imports of “lumpy” capital goods, such as aircraft Apart from brief volatility in the immediate wake of the Mexico crisis, short-term capital inflows appear to have been generally stable during the first half of 1995, and net FDI inflows have remained strong. Following a decline in the first quarter, gross official reserves recovered to US$27.7 billion in July 1995, about US$l billion higher than the level at end- 1994. In foreign exchange markets, the ringgit depreciated in nominal effective terms during the first half of 1995 while strengthening against the U.S. dollar. Since midyear, the trends have reversed, with the ringgit weakening against the U.S. dollar, while recovering in nominal effective terms. As of June 1995, the real effective exchange rate had depreciated by 1.5 percent since December 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3- Table 1.
