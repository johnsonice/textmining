The staff team comprised Ms. Tseng (Head), Messrs. Gordon, Duenwald and Zebregs (all APD), Dorsey (PDR), Laurens (MAE), Richardson (FAD), and Mrs. Cormier (Assistant, APD), and Messrs. Otani and Heytens (Resident Representative Office). Mr. Wei and Ms. Jin (OED) participated in the discussions. Mr. Sugisaki joined the team during May 27-30. The Managing Director visited China during June l-2,2000. The team met with Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, People’s Bank of China Governor Dai Xianglong, Vice Minister of Finance Jin Liqun, Gansu Province Party Secretary Sun Ying and Deputy Governor Wu Bilian, other senior officials, representatives of the banking, business, and diplomatic communities, and the World Bank Resident Mission in China. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on July 23, 1999, Executive Directors noted that China had weathered the Asian crisis much better than most countries in the region. This resulted from a timely easing of macroeconomic policies as well as China’s relatively strong external position, a prudent approach to capital account liberalization, and further advances in structural reforms. Nevertheless, economic strains were clearly showing and, in their view, sustained growth and employment opportunities could only come through accelerated structural reforms, particularly in the financial and enterprise sectors; these would need to be supported by an adequate social safety net and measures to strengthen the fiscal position over the medium term. While the policy of maintaining a stable exchange rate had served China well, many Directors believed that greater flexibility would be required in the future. While much progress has been made in recent years, China’s economic statistics remain weak in many areas, including the national accounts, the fiscal sector, the balance of payments and foreign debt and reserves. STA is currently providing comprehensive technical assistance. China has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3 and 4 of the Articles of Agreement; exchange controls continue to apply to most capital account transactions. Two exchange restrictions identified last year, and temporarily approved by the Executive Board, were eliminated by December 3 1, 1999 as scheduled, and there are no other measures currently in force which have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. The principal author of the staff report is Mr. James Gordon. 1 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2- Contents Page List of Abbreviations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..I.......... 4 I.

I~RoDuC~~N 1. China has made remarkable progress during two decades of economic reform. The period since 1978 has witnessed profound changes to what had been a centrally planned and autarkic economy. Important among these are the development of a substantial nonstate sector,’ and, as evidenced by rising exports and capital inflows, the opening up of the economy to the outside world, Aided by relatively radical reforms of agriculture, rural industry and foreign direct investment, GDP growth has averaged over 9 percent, and more than 200 million people have been lifted out of absolute poverty.2 2. The pace of reform in the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the financial sector was initially more gradual. As a result, surplus labor, excess capacity, and high inventories developed in the SOEs, progressively worsening their financial positions. This, in turn, led to a steady rise in nonperforming loans at the state commercial banks (SCBs), amounting to 25 percent of loans by official estimates, with market estimates considerably higher. 3. From the mid-lWOs, it became clear that reforms of SOEs and SCBs could no longer be delayed, but the authorities’ concerns about social stability have influenced the speed of reforms in these areas. Early initiatives focussed on moving small enterprises out of the state sector, commercialization of large enterprises, and shifting the burden of policy lending away from the SCBs (Box 1). Following the 15* Party Congress in September 1997, SOE reforms were expanded and accelerated. However, as restructuring got under way, SOEs laid off a significant number of workers, particularly in the rust belt provinces in the northeast, adding to regional income disparities, and putting serious strains on an inadequate and underfunded social safety net. 4. Although there had been concerns that the reform process might be put on hold with the onset of the Asian crisis and the corresponding pressures on growth and employment, the momentum of reform was maintained. SOEs in key sectors were restructured and 11 ‘/z million workers were laid off in 1998-99. Moreover, from late 1997, as lessons began to emerge from the unfolding Asian crisis, financial sector reforms were accelerated, including through reform of the central bank structure, improvements to the ‘The nonstate sector (including urban collectives and township and village enterprises) is estimated to account for three-fourths of industrial output, 50-60 percent of GDP and about 60 percent of nonagricultural employment. 2Based on the authorities’ poverty line. The reduction in the number of poor is considerably larger based on the World Bank’s higher poverty line of “one dollar per day.” 3At end-1997,30-35 million workers, out of total SOE employment of 72% million, were believed to be redundant.

State Enterprise and Financial Sector Reform in China In comparison to other aspects of China’s structural reform agenda- such as agriculture, rural industry, and foreign direct investment-restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the financial sector has been gradual. In the last several years, owing to widespread loss-making by the SOEs and the associated mounting of nonperfonning loans (NPLs) at the banks, state enterprise and financial sector reforms have moved to the top of the authorities’ policy agenda. Notwithstanding the achievements to date, however, much more needs to be done to strengthen the performance and financial health of SOEs and the banks, and thereby improve the efficiency of capital allocation in the Chinese economy. Indeed, China’s prospective entry into the WTO has imparted a greater sense of urgency to this process. The problems in the financial and SOE sectors, and thus their resolution, are closely intertwined. The financial performance of state enterprises has historically been very weak, reflecting macroeconomic and industry-specific factors, as well as SOE-specific factors, including weak management, overstaffing, high debt, outdated products and technologies, an excessive social welfare burden, and high tax rates. The losses incurred by SOEs have required heavy subsidization by the :state. In the early part of the reform era, this subsidization occurred via direct allocations from the central budget, but thereafter took the form of loans extended by the state-owned banks, whose NPLs correspondingly increased. Steps have already been taken to restructure the SOEs. The initial focus of enterprise reform was selling small enterprises and commercializing larger ones (under the principle of “seize the big and release the small”). The pressures for reform have increased over the last two years, following Premier Zhu’s pledge to return most large- and medium-sized enterprises to profitability by 200 I. Some progress has been made in hardening budget constraints and profitability has been improved by the anti-smuggling campaign, lower interest rates, a reduced social welfare burden, and ongoing efforts to reduce excess capacity in key sectors. Nonetheless, the authorities recognize that the SOE reform process will take a decade to complete. Financial sector reforms have also been initiated through establishing policy banks to relieve the four state commercial banks (SCBs) of their responsibility for policy lending, while taking steps to commercialize them and hold them accountable for their lending decisions. In the last two years-partly in response to the lessons from the Asian crisis-there has been a flurry of reforms, including restructuring the PBC branch network (so as to limit the access of local government to central bank credit); recapitalizing the SCBs; improving the regulatory and supervisory framework; abolishing t.he credit plan; and closing a number of small insolvent financial institutions. Complementing these steps have been the SCBs’ own internal efforts at reform, including the revamping of loan approval procedures, implementation of more incentive-based remuneration systems, and branch rationalization. The most recent financial sector reform initiative is the establishment last year of four asset management companies (AMCs) to take over the nonperforming loans of the SCBs (Box 6). The SCBs, for their part, are now expected to focus on commercial lending activities so as to minimize the risk of new NPLs. The remaining agenda for SOE and financial sector reform is a challenging one. Extensive reforms to upgrade operational efficiency and product quality, to harden budget constraints, and to improve corporate governance in the SOEs are needed in the years ahead. Moreover, efforts to reduce the enterprises’ social welfare burden should continue, which will necessitate the establishment of a comprehensive social security system, and, consequently, fiscal reforms. Similarly, bank rehabilitation will require far reaching reforms, including the operational restructuring of the SCBs, the elimination of policy lending and the development of a credit culture. Thus, reforms of the SOEs are intertwined with reforms of the financial sector and the fiscal system.

China’s prospective entry into the WTO is a potential watershed for reform. WTO accession, which draws closer in light of the bilateral agreements reached with the United States in November 1999 and the European Union in May 2000, promises to increase foreign direct investment, remove protection from inefficient industries, and spur the development of the legal and regulatory framework necessary for a market economy (Box 2). WTO membership will also give rise to major short-term challenges, in particular, possibly higher unemployment and greater income disparities. As the authorities well recognize, a further acceleration of reform-accompanied by a strengthening of the social safety net and narrowing regional disparities-has therefore become even more urgent. II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS 6. The Asian crisis accentuated an economic slowdown that was already in train following the boom of the early 1990s (Table 1 and Chart 1). The fall in demand for exports (Text Chart) was compounded by weakening domestic consumption due “. -7 to uncertainties about IO restructuring and stagnant I, rural incomes, leading to a 10. sharp slowdown in activity. , By 1998, many industrial and consumer products were in substantial excess supply, .5 ---- - __-. and deflationary pressures -,* P.nnrr dcm.“d -A- expon, had emerged. Moreover, II Pro,c~,la~r for 2000: p.raer demand *.t. dcrwcd hrn WEO. growing concerns about the sustainability of the policy of maintaining a stable renminbi led to a surge in capital outflows, and the balance of payments surplus dropped sharply. 7. In response, the authorities acted promptly to support activity and reduce external vulnerabilities. An easing of fiscal and monetary policies (Chart 2) was supported by measures to encourage exports, and a vigorous campaign to address rampant smuggling. In addition, the authorities intensified enforcement of exchange and capital regulations in response to evidence of widespread evasion4 4The main measures included strengthening enforcement of documentation requirements for all authorized transactions; and new and reinforced measures to control capital account transactions.

The Impact of WTO Accession China has reached bilateral agreements on the terms of its entry to the WTO with most of the trade partners participating in accession negotiations, including the United States and the European Union, and it is possible that WTO accession could takeplace in 2000. To complete the process of WTO accession, China needs to conclude a fm more bilateral agreements. finish multilateral negotiations consolidating these bilateral agreements into a singleprotocoi of accession, and mod@ its laws and regulations to be consistent with its obligations under the WTO and the protocol of accession. The staffhas made a preliminary assessment of the impact of WTO accession on China based on the bilateral agreement with the United States, which is the only one to have been made public and is generally acknowledged to be the core o,f China ‘s WTO commitments. Main elements of the agreement . China will reduce tariffs on nonagricultural products (which account for 95 percent of total imports) from about 17 percent to 9.4 percent by 2005, and lower tariffs on agricultural products to 17 percent by January 2004; eliminate quotas and non-tariff restrictions on industrial products (by 2005); introduce a tariff rate quota system in agriculture; and provide full trading and distribution rights to foreign firms. . China will significantly expand market access in the services sector, including through eliminating geographic and other restrictions in most key sectors (by 2005); increasing foreign ownership limits in telecommunications (50 percent by 2002), life insurance (50 percent on accession), and securities (49 percent by 2003); and giving fir11 national treatment to foreign banks (within 5 years). Some phase-in periods were reportedly accelerated in the EU negotiations. . The United States will eliminate quotas on China’s textile imports under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (previously known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement) by 2005, subject to anti-surge provisions (yet to be specified) through 2008, and give China PNTR status. Potential economic impact of accession In the immediate future, the agreement will increase competitive pressures on a number of sectors, including agriculture, automobiles, and certain capital intensive producers in China (including telecommunications); offsetting this, however, foreign direct investment in the services sector is likely to increase significantly. As the effects of increased competition feed through into efficiency gains, total factor productivity growth should rise, reversing the decline witnessed in recent years, and from 2005, China’s textile sector will benefit significantly from the elimination of quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.

With the affected sectors accounting for only a small portion of output and trade, the initial adverse impact on GDP growth and the external current account should be small. Indeed, the structure of China’s trade suggests that WTO accession is likely to affect only about 40 percent of present trade flows, since the remaining 60 percent is processing trade, which is largely exempt from tariffs. Nevertheless, between 2000 and 2004, the external current account is likely to weaken relative to the baseline projection, but rebound in 2005 :as the effects of quota elimination under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing are felt. Any deterioration in the external current account should be largely offset by higher foreign direct investment-especially in the services sector-so that the balance of payments may not be greatly affected. While output growth is expected to fall only slightly relative to baseline, labor market pressures-especially in the iabor intensive agricultural sector- and income distribution problems could increase in the short run, underscoring the need to strengthen the social safety net and to develop rural and inland regions. Some academic studies estimate that an additional 2 percent of the workforce-comprising I3 million workers in rural areas and about 1% million workers in urban areas-will need to be reemployed in other sectors over the next five years. Nevertheless, employment growth should pick up eventually, as the positive effects of trade liberalization are felt. Additional challenges will come from the likely widening in rural/urban and coastal/western income disparities.

The authorities injected substantial fiscal stimulus in 1998 and 1999. A fiscal package (amounting to 2% percent of GDP of infiastructural spending) was introduced in 1998. By mid-1999, its effects had begun to recede, and with private demand remaining weak, an additional expenditure package was announced in August 1999. This package included */3 percent of GDP of infrastructure expenditure, and L/z percent of GDP in higher civil service wages and social safety net outlays (including transfers to poorer provinces to provide basic living allowances, unemployment benefits, and pensions to laid-off and retired SOE workers). The impact of this spending on the budget was partially offset by strong revenue performance, especially higher collection of trade taxes (related to the anti- smuggling campaign). The overall budgetary deficit is estimated at 4 percent of GDP in 1999, compared to 3 percent of GDP in 1998 (Table 2). 9. Monetary conditions were progressively eased. With deflation proving persistent, the monetary stance has been repeatedly loosened, most recently via cuts in interest rates in June 1999-bringing them well below corresponding U.S. dollar rates (Chart 3)-and a reduction in reserve requirements in November 1999. Banks have continued to hold substantial excess reserves, reflecting weaknesses in the payments system and the interbank market. Broad money grew by 14% percent through December 1999, within the target of 14-15 percent, but has edged down in 2000 (Table 3). Ml growth has been significantly higher, due to a combination of factors, including pre-Y2K injections of liquidity, and the impact of a 20 percent withholding tax on deposit interest introduced in November 1999 to encourage consumption. Lending grew by 15% percent in 1999 (after adjusting for transfers to the AMCs), and there are tentative signs that credit to the nonstate sector is increasing.5 10. Since mid-1999, the macroeconomic situation has improved considerably. As the regional recovery gained pace (Chart 4), China’s exports rebounded sharply, and market fears about devaluation receded, as evidenced, for example, by the declining discount in the nondeliverable forward (NDF) market. Export performance was also helped by higher VAT rebates and improving competitiveness (with domestic deflation and strengthening partner currencies causing the real effective exchange rate to depreciate below its pre-crisis level- Chart 5). Moreover, signs of a recovery in private consumption appeared from the beginning of 2000, including a pickup in retail sale. There were also intermittent signs of some easing of deflationary pressures, although the extent to which this reflected one-time increases in vegetable and government-guided services prices is difficult to ascertain. For 1999 as a whole, real GDP rose by 7.1 percent, reflecting continued rapid growth in govemment demand as well as a small positive contribution from net exports (Text Table). ‘A sample survey covering 10 large cities conducted by the PBC showed that the nonstate sector accounted for 46 p&-cent of total bank loans outstanding at end-1999, with the strongest growth area being consumer credit, particularly loans for housing, education, and consumer durables.

The balance of payments strengthened modestly, particularly in the second half of 1999 (Table 4). The current account surplus halved to 1% percent of GDP, with the increased export growth more than offset by much higher imports and a widening of the invisibles deficit. The sharp rise in imports appears primarily due to better recording on account of the anti-smuggling campaign, while the wider invisibles deficit reflects increased payments for business services and larger investment income outflows. The weaker current account was compensated for by a strengthening of the capital account (including errors and omissions), which also permitted international reserves to rise to $158 billion by end-l 999 (over four times short-term debt). Given the continued weaknesses in the balance of payments statistics, it is not possible to understand fully the reasons for the improvement in the capital account, which occurred despite lower foreign direct investment inflows and a reduction in international bank exposure to China (according to BIS data). Nevertheless, the strengthening of the capital account is consistent with the intensified enforcement of exchange and capital regulations, the success of the anti-smuggling drive, and declining devaluation concerns. External debt-adjusted to take account of the discrepancy with BIS data-is estimated to have declined in 1999 (Table 5). 12. Unemployment remained a serious concern. Based on official data, urban unemployment+omprising the registered unemployed and xiagang workers6 who have not yet found employment-was about 7 percent (Box 3). Many observers, however, believe the unemployment rate to be much higher, particularly in cities with high SOE concentrations; in some of these areas, increased incidents of worker discontent have also been reported. In addition, official data on unemployment do not cover rural areas, which account for about 70 percent of the labor force, and it is estimated that about 150 million, or about 30 percent 6Xiagang are workers laid off as part of the SOE reforms, who keep a link to their enterprises but are free to work elsewhere. The authorities indicated that most xiagang workers who have been reemployed have found jobs in the nonstate (particularly the services) sector.

Labor Market Pressures and the Role of the Nonstate Sector Reform of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector has moved to the top of the government’s structural .eform agenda in recent years, bringing with it unprecedented pressures in the labor market. Reforms lave been gradual, aiming to strike a balance between improving enterprise efficiency and minimizing the social dislocations. Nevertheless, the recent acceleration in SOE restructuring has been accompanied by a narked increase in the number of layoffs (xiagung), reflecting the recognition that SOE financial performance :an only be improved with a reduction in the SOE labor surplus. In 1998,5.9 million workers were laid off Yom SOEs, and in 1999,5.6 million were laid off. Most of the laid-off workers found work, mainly outside the Itate sector. As a result, the urban unemployment rate-including the xiugang workers and the registered memployed-has remained at about 6% percent.

Employment creation during the reform period has occurred mostly in the nonstate sector. Indeed, the ieclining share of the state sector in output and employment, and corresponding rise in the nonstate sector’s Ihare, is one of the most visible signs of China’s transition toward a market economy. In 1980, SOEs accounted br 50 percent of total nonagricultural employmentl, but by 1998 this proportion had fallen to about 20 percent. Correspondingly, the share of the nonstate sector-which includes collectives, TVEs, and private firms-in otal nonagricultural employment rose from about 40 percent to almost 60 percent during the same period. Within the nonstate sector, the most rapid expansion in employment shares-particularly after 199O-occurred n private firms, a category which includes foreign-funded enterprises, joint ventures, and individual businesses.

The authorities have recently strengthened their efforts to foster the development of the nonstate sector, realizing the sector’s potential to absorb the rapidly rising number of unemployed. At the 1 51h Party Congress in 1997, the government elevated the role of the private sector to one of parity with the state sector, a nove that was subsequently enshrined in China’s Constitution by a new amendment in 1999. More recently, thf government has sought to improve access to credit for nonstate firms by setting up credit guarantee schemes for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in 70 cities, and by abolishing the quota system for new stock narket listings. In addition, the state commercial banks have established SME departments to improve their services to SMEs. These measures need to be suppllemented by further efforts to encourage private sector development, including improving private firms’ access to capital (including through stock market listing), reducing sectoral barriers to entry, and strengthening private property rights.

A “floating population” (estimated at 60-80 million) has moved from the rural areas to cities in search of work. 13. Asset prices have been on an upward trend, partly as a result of offMa measures. The equity markets, which are still relatively small, rose sharply in mid-1999 (Chart 6) reflecting market-boosting measures that included limiting the supply of new issues and the expectation that new investors such as insurers would be permitted to buy equities. After a brief correction, “A” markets (reserved for domestic residents) resumed their upward trend in early 2000, primarily as a consequence of robust demand for technology stocks. The improving economic outlook and continuing efforts by the authorities to support the markets have sustained the rally, which has spread to the foreign currency “B” markets (legally open only to foreign investors) in recent weeks. Property prices have also recovered somewhat in major urban areas, although substantial excess supply (particularly of commercial space) remains in certain areas. III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS 14. While labor market pressures remain serious and a continued favorable external environment depends importantly on developments in the United States and Japan, China’s macroeconomic outlook is more favorable now than it has been for some time. Real GDP growth surged to over 8 percent (year- China: Quarterly Indicators, 1999-2000 on-year) in the first (Year on year percentftge change) quarter of 2000 (Text Table), partly reflecting special factors, such as Y2K, the leap year, and unusually long holidays which served to boost consumption. Growth is expected to slow somewhat in the second half of the year as the effects of the fiscal packages recede; real GDP is nevertheless projected to increase by 7% percent in 2000.

The current account surplus is expected to be unchanged at about 1% percent of GDP, with rising exports counterbalanced by higher imports and services payments. The capital account is difficult to project, but recent developments, including the issuance of large overseas IPOs (and plans for a number of others), suggest that the balance of payments should remain in surplus. The staffs projections are broadly similar to the consensus (see below). China: Projections for 2000 GDP Growth (percent) Inflation (percent) Current Account (US$bn.) Consensus l/2/ 7.5 (0.3) 0.8 (0.4) 14.2 (6.1) l! June 2000. 2/ Standard deviation in parentheses. 16. The medium-term outlook is influenced by two inter-related factors: China’s prospective entry into the WTO and the pace of structural reforms. Increased foreign competition and accelerated structural reform are likely to cause GDP growth to edge down in the near term (to 7 percent by 2002), before picking up thereafter as efficiency im (Table 6). Inflation is expected to remain subdued due to continued excess capacity. P roves Trade liberalization and rising foreign direct investment, particularly in services, should boost imports, leading to a current account deficit of about 1 percent of GDP by 2004. However, the increase in foreign direct investment, combined with a pickup in portfolio inflows, should be sufficient to maintain a relatively strong balance of payments position. From 2005, both exports and growth will benefit from the elimination of quotas administered under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (previously known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement), which is expected to result in a large increase in China’s share of the world apparel and textile markets. 17. The main risks to the outlook remain on the structural side. The financial situation of banks and enterprises remains very weak despite recent reforms, and unless corrective action is taken, the fiscal situation may not be sustainable over the medium term, especially given the need to strengthen the social safety net and address regional disparities. These risks are exacerbated by transparency problems and statistical weaknesses, which increase the margin of error in assessments and the potential seriousness of any shocks. ‘Output is projected to remain slightly below potential until 2003, even after allowing for lower growth of potential output on account of lower rates of investment and a deceleration in total factor productivity growth (see Box 4).

China has been one of the fastest growing countries in tbe world over the past two decades.’ Annual growth has averaged 9% percent since 1980, and is impressive even by East-AsiEn standards. China’s exceptional growth performance has been spurred by market-oriented reforms introduced since the late 1970s that have also resulted in sizable productivity gains. However, annual GDP growth has declined steadily since 1993 to just over 7 percent in 1999, giving rise to a debate on the extent to which China’s impressive track record can be sustained in the future. While most analysts believe that some slowdown is inevitable-a view shared by the Chinese authorities themselves, who are projecting average annual growth of 7 percent in the new five-year development plan (2001-2005~it is difficult to assess China’s potential growth over the medium-term given the maior structural changes underway. the scale of China’s economv. and the comolexities of its erowth dynamics. Nevertheless, it is clear that criticaireforms in ;he SOE and financial sector m&t be pushed &bead to sustai continued rapid growth. Estimates of potential output growth using the Hod&k-Prescott (HP) filter and production function techniqoes show that the trend growth of China’s potential output peaked in the mid-199Os, but has declined since then.

Looking ahead, China’s growth prospects will continue lto depend critically on structural reforms. The next steps in the process, however, are expected to cause somewhat more disruption in the short term than the earlier reforms, as they will involve more labor shedding by SOEs and the shutting down of nonviable enterprises and outdated productive capacity. The average rate of investment during 2000-05 is, therefore, likely to decline relative to the 1990s as excess capacity is scrapped and the effective rate of depreciation of the capital stock inc:reases. Since part of the impact of past reforms on TFP growth was only temporary and reflected one-time level effects (such as the reallocation of labor from agriculture to industry), the deceleration in TFP growth is also likely to continue in the period ahead. An intensification of SOE and financial sector reforms will therefore be required to halt the declining trend over the medium term. While the effects of these future reforms are difficult to quantify, if they push ahead at a reasonable pace, potential output should be able to grow at about 7% percent on average over the medium term. ‘There is considerable debate on the accuracy of Chinese GDP data, however, and some observers believe growth rates are overstated by as much as 2 percentage points.

The authorities are focusing on achieving high quality growth, which requires further progress in addressing the intertwined problems in the state enterprise and financial sectors. They view WTO membership as presenting opportunities and challenges, which they intend to seize to speed up reforms so as to prepare domestic enterprises and banks for global competition. At the same time, the authorities attach considerable importance to strengthening the social safety net and addressing regional disparities so as to share more broadly the benefits of reforms and opening up to the outside world. In addition, nonstate activity, which has the greatest potential to create employment, will also be supported. With broad agreement between the staff and the authorities on the short-term macroeconomic outlook and policies, the discussions focused on exchange rate policy and key issues in structural reforms. A. Exchange Rate Policy and External Vulnerability 19. The staffs view was that, while the policy of maintaining the stability of the renminbi served the region (and China) well during the Asian crisis, conditions for a shift to a more flexible arrangement have improved.’ This is because: l The balance of payments position has strengthened, and the real effective exchange rate is now below its pre-crisis level. While calculations of “equilibrium” exchange rates are subject to wide margins of error, the staff believes that the renminbi is not substantially overvalued on the basis of economic fundamentals; also market expectations of devaluation have dissipated. 0 The adverse external effects are likely to be small, given the strong regional recovery and the limited likelihood of depreciation; also, a move to greater flexibility is widely expected by markets. Some initial turbulence is possible in Hong Kong SAR but this should be manageable.g ‘China operates a dejure managed floating rate arrangement with the daily movement of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar limited to + 0.3 percent around a reference rate. ‘Since market participants generally see Hong Kong SAR as a proxy for China risks, and because there will be concerns that a renminbi adjustment will affect Hong Kong SAR financial institutions, there may be a brief period of uncertainty in Hong Kong SAR markets following a change in China’s exchange rate policy. However, the staffs assessment is that Hong Kong SAR should be able to withstand such developments, given its high level of reserves, the recent strengthening of the currency board system, and the Hong Kong SAR authorities’ demonstrated ability to deal with similar situations over the past two years. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - a A more flexible arrangement would facilitate adjustment to reforms engendered by WTO accession and other ongoing structural changes. a A more flexible exchange rate would allow better management of continued volatility in the U.S. dollar/yen exchange rate, and better equip China to contend with the recent proliferation of floating exchange rate regimes in the rest of the world, especially in Asia. 20. The staff suggested that current conditions allow for an early move to greater flexibility. This could take the form of a more flexible implementation of the current arrangement, involving the widening of the existing band around a reference rate based on a basket of currencies, rather than just the U.S. dollar. This would smooth cross-currency fluctuations and provide a reasonably stable environment for exporters and importers. The staff considered that current operational arrangements were adequate to support such a move in the near term. Over time, greater flexibility should be accompanied by measures to develop the foreign exchange market and strengthen the regulatory framework, including the establishment of a forward market, greater freedom for enterprises in handling foreign exchange, and the setting of specific limits on banks’ net open foreign exchange positions. 21. The authorities agreed to give further consideration to the staffs advice. They also agreed that conditions for moving to greater flexibility had improved, but preferred to proceed gradually so as to be sure that the renewed strength in the external position was durable. Since late 1997, the renminbi has traded in a range of Y 8.277-Y 8.280/US$-much narrower than the permitted + 0.3 percent. In recent months, however, the exchange rate has increasingly closed outside the band, usually on the appreciated side. Markets have shown little reaction to these movements, other than to wonder whether the authorities were testing the water for a move to a wider trading band. 22. China’s external vulnerability improved during 1999 on the basis of most available indicators. The ratios of external debt to GDP, and to exports, decreased, and the ratio of reserves to short-term debt rose sharply as a modest increase in reserves coincided with a sharp drop in measured short-term debt (Table 5 and Chart 7). Although the ratio of reserves to imports fell during 1999, this appears primarily attributable to the success of the anti-smuggling campaign in raising measured imports. Some of the factors underlying the decline in vulnerability might appear to be negative, notably the decline in the access of nonsovereign Chinese borrowers to foreign credit, but that China has been able to maintain and even increase international reserves in such an environment underscores the overall reduction in risk. 23. The staff discussed with the authorities the management of international reserves. As in the past, the staff underscored the need for the authorities to provide a periodic breakdown of the composition of international reserves so as to allow the staff to improve its assessment of vulnerability. While details about the composition of reserves were not provided, the authorities stressed that foreign exchange reserves were managed prudently, guided by the principles of safety, liquidity, and profit. They noted that reserves _ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public200 153 105 58 10 - 23 - Chart 7 China EXTERNAL DEBT AND RESERVES INDICATORS, 19952000 1200 External debt ($bn) 1/ 0 -short-term debt q medium- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . r .*... .*... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . lisss nd long-term debt’ ’ ’ ’ l l B.....

B. Macroeconomic Policies 24. The staff broadly supported the stance of macroeconomic policies. The 2000 budget is estimated to reduce the overall deficit to 3% percent of GDP, implying a slight withdrawal of stimulus, which appeared appropriate in light of the pickup in growth and the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation (Box 5). For now, the authorities did not have any plans for a supplementary fiscal stimulus package (as in the past two years). Nevertheless, with the recovery still not well-entrenched, the authorities stated that fiscal policy will remain proactive, and did not explicitly rule out the possibility of a supplementary fiscal package later this year. The staff agreed that another package did not seem necessary on the basis of the current macroeconomic projections. 25. The staff noted a number of positive features of the 2000 budget, including the emphasis on infrastructure and the social safety net, and the intensified efforts to monitor the efficiency of investment projects. In addition, the budget incorporates a continuation of the improvement in revenues, which rose by over 1 percent of GDP in 1999 largely as a result of the anti-smuggling efforts. The authorities consider the higher revenue levels to be sustainable, and that further revenue gains are possible given the scope to improve enforcement and compliance in other areas of taxation. Furthermore, the budget presentation is improved by the inclusion, for the first tfime, of interest on government debt. However, the staff urged further improvements to fiscal transparency by including other expenditures presently excluded from the budget-namely, spending and interest related to the fiscal stimulus bonds on-lent to local governments. The authorities indicated that there are plans to include such spending by local governments in the budget in the future. 26. Monetary policy will remain accommodative to support the recovery. The authorities have set M2 growth targets for 2000 of 14-15 percent, somewhat above actual growth through May (12.7 percent), and sufficient to allow a continued trend decline in velocity. While the differential between domestic and U.S. interest rates is now substantial, the impact on the capital account so far has been limited, in contrast to the staffs earlier expectations, in part reflecting the effectiveness of capital controls. Nonetheless, the authorities agreed that the situation needed to be monitored closely. They also noted that rates on foreign currency deposits had been raised twice in the past year, most recently at the end of May 2000. 27. The authorities indicated that they intend to further liberalize interest rates. At present, lending rates are allowed limited flexibility, while deposit rates are fixed. The authorities plan to further widen margins on lending rates, while continuing to keep deposit rates fixed in the near term. They also plan to liberalize interest rates on foreign currency lending and deposits. The staff observed that more flexible interest rates would improve the allocations of savings and permit greater reliance on indirect monetary instruments. It would also allow better pricing of risk, which is needed to support increased lending to new Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - 1 The authorities recognize that medium-term fiscal sustainability continues to merit special attention given ( Zhina’s substantial off-budget liabilities. Table 8 presents two illustrative medium-term fiscal scenarios. 1 The central message is that quasi-fiscal spending through the banking system has given rise to substantial C :ontingent liabilities which will need to be settled over the coming years. Also, China faces significant S ipending needs for social and physical infrastructure which the budget will need to finance. Therefore, 1 mless the flow of new quasi-fiscal lending is brought under control, and additional budgetary measures e u-e undertaken, China’s government debt stock is likely to grow unsustainably. r Macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions: The macroeconomic assumptions which underlie these S cenarios are consistent with those of Table 6. The interest rate on treasury bills is assumed to remain at t he average real level of 1998-99 (excluding long-term recapitalization bonds) of just under 6 percent, \ which is below the real GDP growth rate. About 20 percent of the stock of banking system credit to the e :conomy at end-1999 is assumed by staff to be nonrecoverable NPLs, and de facto, a part of government ( lebt. (Market estimates of nonrecoverable NPLs fall in the range of 15 to 40 percent.) It is further assumed t hat the growth rate of credit to the economy slows to that of nominal GDP by 2004. In both scenarios, r ‘evenue is assumed to remain at 14.2 percent of GDP, which is the highest level achieved since the 1994 t ax reform. Finally, in both scenarios it is assumed that new spending priorities for health, education, L memployment, and physical infrastructure will be needed over this horizon, rising to almost 3 percent of ( ;DP per annum by 2006. 1 c 1 3aseline scenario: On the assumption that new quasi-fiscal spending through the banking system is !O percent of the flow of credit to the economy, and that no other measures are taken by the authorities, China: Medium-Term Government Debt Dynamics -the stock of government debt (including-the quasi-fiscal part) will rise from just under 50 percent of GDP at end- 2000 to over 90 percent of GDP by 2008. Note that interest costs rise to almost 40 percent of budgetary revenue over this period. Adjustment scenario: Fiscal sustainability in these circumstances will involve considerable fiscal adjustment. The adjustment scenario presented in Table 8 assumes that-as a result of successful structural reforms-the flow of new non-recoverable lending is reduced gradually from 20 percent to 2.5 percent of the total over this horizon. On top of that effort, additional fiscal measures-either on the revenue or the expenditure side, but rising to 3.4 percent of GDP-are required to stabilize the debt stock d about 65 percent of GDP. l%ese scenarios are illustrative, given the high degree of uncertainty as to the underlying data and as td iyhat are reasonable assumptions about parameter values. If, for instance, the real interest rate were to be 3ne percentage point higher over the medium term, then, without adjustment, the debt/GDP ratio would be 35 percent in 2008, or 3 percentage points higher than in the baseline; in this case, an extra fiscal adjustment of 0.3-O-4 percent of GDP would be needed to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio at about 65 percent. Similarly, if the stock of non-recoverable bad loans at end-1999 is 30 percent-rather than 20 percent-of banking system credit to the economy, the baseline debt stock rises to over 100 percent of GDP by 2008, and the fiscal adjustment needed to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio at 65 percent is higher by over 0.6 percent of GDP.

Although the formal credit plan was abolished in 1998, the PBC continues to exert credit guidance. For example, the PBC encourages banks to lend to preferred projects (infrastructure, technological renovation, SMEs, etc.) and discourages lending to industries with excess capacity, and enterprises that lack marketable products, make chronic losses, or face insolvency. While some broad credit guidance is probably inevitable at the present stage of China’s economic transition and reforms, the staff pointed to the importance of allowing SCBs to freely decide on whether to make specific loans based on their own credit evaluation. The authorities agreed, noting the ongoing efforts to strengthen the banks’ internal controls and the establishment of the credit responsibility system (see paragraph 37 below). C. Structural Reforms State-owned enterprise reform 29. SOE performance has shown some improvement in the period since early 1998 when Premier Zhu announced the three-year goal of revitalizing the large- and medium-sized SOEs (Table 7). Aggregate profits increased by almost 80 percent to Y 100 billion in 1999, with most sectors now showing a profit. Of course, SOE profits are a function of tax, pricing, and other government policies, and would have been boosted in 1999 by lower interest rates and the anti-smuggling campaign. Nevertheless, while serious problems remain, some efficiency gains have been achieved through layoffs and reductions in excess capacity in important sectors such as textiles, coal, and metallurgy. 30. While progress has been made in SOE reform, much remains to be done. The authorities pointed to the broad strategy outlined by the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee in September 1999 to reform SOE operations, ownership, and management structures. The Plenum noted that the key to reducing SOE losses was to reduce their debt and social burdens, including through debt-equity swaps with AMCs. It also explicitly recognized that the SOEs would need to continue to lay off redundant workers. While the “pillar” role of the state sector in the economy was upheld, development of the private sector was to be encouraged. Moreover, diversified forms of ownership of SOEs would be vigorously explored, including through increased stock issuance and sales of state shares. Emphasis is also being given to improve market-oriented incentives for management (including through stock options) and corporate governance (by strengthening the role of the board of supervisors). The authorities also noted that greater recourse was being made to bankruptcies (although these remained on a small scale). “Interest rate liberalization is discussed in more detail in the forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

A focus of the discussions was on the AMCs which the authorities envisage as playing an important role in enterprise and financial reforms (Box 6). Since their establishment in 1999, AMCs have been taking over nonperforming loans (NPLs) from SCBs. Y 1.4 trillion of NPLs (17 percent of GDP) are to be transferred to the AMCs. This represents about half of the authorities’ estimate of NPLs (25 percent of loans, although market estimates range up to twice as high). The authorities emphasized that the transfer was intended to deal with the NPL stock problem left over as a legacy of central planning, and would not be repeated to avoid moral hazard. Over 90 percent of the transfers will be completed by end-June 2000. About Y 450 billion of the NPL transfer involve debt-equity swaps, and over 80 percent of the agreements for debt-equity swaps between SOEs and AMCs are expected to have been signed by midyear. 32. The authorities explained that the AMCs are intended not only to reduce the debt burden of SOEs, but also to restructure their operations. The staff agreed that the success of the AMC strategy will depend squarely on the AMCs being able to restructure the enterprises in which they become stakeholders, otherwise the AMC strategy would do nothing to prevent new NPLs from recurring (the “flow” problem). The staff observed that AMC activities to date have essentially been book-keeping and that a framework was not yet in place for the AMCs to have a meaningful impact on restructuring SOEs. The mission also expressed concern that debt-equity swaps not be granted to enterprises that do not intend to restructure merely to achieve the three-year target on reducing the number of loss-making enterprises. 33. The staff expressed the view that more work was needed to flesh out a framework for AMCs to play an effective role in enterprise restructuring. In this context, the staff urged that particular attention be given to the need to: l Provide the AMCs with sufficient powers to restructure the operations of SOEs (including the ability to replace managers), while developing asset resolution procedures; l Revise the bankruptcy law (to enhance creditor rights) and establish transparent procedures for the valuation and disposal of state assets (to facilitate sales of assets at market prices); 0 Ensure that the AMCs have the necessary skills and resources to discharge their responsibilities (including recourse to foreign expertise as required); l Ensure that the AMCs’ financial positions are soundly based, including that their capital is fully paid, and that they have sufficient cash flow to service the bonds they provide in exchange for NPLs; and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - Box 6. Asset Management Companies (AMCs) The AMC Initiative An important element of the restructuring of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the four state commercial banks (SCBs) is the setting up of asset management companies (AMCs). AMCs were established in 1999 for each of the four SCBs: Cinda AMC (for China Construction Bank), Huarong AMC (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China), Dongfang AMC (Bank of China), and Great Wall AMC (Agricultural Bank of China). Although paired with the SCBs, the AMCs are meant to be independent financial institutions, each endowed with an initial capital of Y 10 billion provided by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and supervised by the People’s Bank of China (PBC). Their life is expected to be IO years. The AMCs will buy at book value the following NPLs from SCBs: (i) loans with no prospect of recovery as of September 1999; (ii) NPLs from lending made before end-1995, and all loans which at end-1998 were recorded as “idle” by the banks (i.e., paat due over one year); (iii) loans extended before 1995 that will be converted to equity with State Council approval; (iv) interest receivable on the loans to be transferred (provided it is recorded in the balance sheet); and (v) part of the NPLs of the China Development Bank (a policy bank established in 1994). In exchange, the banks will receive long-term bonds (which have not been issued) or will be released from repaying corresponding PBC refinance credit. With regard to the former, the MOF has agreed that the government will cover the cost of the residual debt, although so far the govermnent has not explicitly guaranteed the bonds to limit moral hazard. The question of whether AMCs can sell stakes in SOEs to subsequent investors appears to be unresolved, although the AMCs are expected to be able to liquidate or negotiate a restructuring of the borrowers’ debts. The final cost of the operation for the government will depend on the expertise of the AMCs, their success in turning around SOEs, and the discretion they have in disposing of assets. Once freed from the burden of NPLs, the SCBs would be expected to focus on commercial lending and to bear till responsibility for the consequences of their lending decisions. The Debt-Equity Swap Scheme In addition to the formal NPL transfer process described above, the AMCs are also expected to take the lead in the debt-equity swap scheme initiated by the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) whereby loans of the SCBs-currently prohibited from holding equity-to selected SOEs would be converted into equity and transferred to the AM&. The scheme is intended to reduce the gearing of SOEs and relieve the SCBs from the burden of NPLs. In the short run it will facilitate achieving the three-year target to reduce the number of loss-making enterprises. Many of the same SOEs that are receiving debt-equity swaps are also being provided access to subsidized technological renovation loans and other preferential treatment. To ensure the effectiveness of the scheme, only SOEs with marketable products, advanced technology, and good managerial expertise are eligible. Among the 16,800 large- and medium-sized SO:Es which were potential candidates, 3,000 enterprises applied and the SETC recommended 60 1 of them for the scheme. It is up to the AM&, which will hold the equity at least in the initial stage, to make the final decision. However, the joint involvement of the SETC also allows the government to use the scheme as an instrument of industrial and financial policy. Progress in Implementation and Outstanding Issues The legal framework for the operations of the AMCs has yet to be fmlized. Currently AMC operations are governed by the provisions in their charters and the State Council circular that established them, These various documents drafted by the PBC set out general parameters but are not particularly detailed. Separately, the National People’s Congress has begun drafting (with AsDB technical assistance) an AMC law. Detailed regulations governing AMC operations were prepared by the PBC and submitted to the State Council for approval early this year. They were recently sent to other government agencies for comments, and are expected to be finalized and issued shortly. The combination of the NPL transfers and the debt-equity swap initiative will result in a transfer of Y 1.4 trillion of loans (17 percent of GDP) to the AMCs, of which about Y 1.3 trillion are nonperforming. The transaction will release the SCBs from about half of the authorities’ estimate of NPLs (which is 25 percent of loans). About Y 450 billion of the transfer involve debt-equity swaps, and over 80 percent of the agreements for debt- equity swaps between SOEs and AMCs are expected to have been signed by mid-2000. While the AMC initiative will help the SCBs reach the 8 percent minimum capital adequacy ratio, there may be a need for additional recapitalization measures, in particular the issuance of Tier 2 capital instruments. Additional needs for capital will also arise when rules for loan classification and provisioning in line with best international practices are implemented. The AM&’ operations will be financed by a transfer of PBC refinancing on the assets being transferred-Y 573 billion-and by the issuance of bonds-Y 820 billion. Most of the transfer of assets to the AMCs is expected to be completed by end-June 2000. So far, the AMCs have mostly focused on asset transfer rather than asset disposal and resolution techniques. (Cinda, however, has collected Y 2 billion from asset sales thus far.) Two main issues remain to be resolved for the AMC initiative to be successful: (i) the discretion the AMCs will have in effecting change in the SOEs in which they become creditors or shareholders. Unless the AMCs (or the investors to whom they sell the loans) are given sufficient powers, they will not be. in a position to restructure and turn around the SOEs; and (ii) the constraint on the range of AMC activities posed by the shortage of personnel with experience in investment banking. The AMCs will need to develop a range of financial skills which are in short supply. The AMC and debt-equity swap initiatives carry important implications for the future ownership pattern, financial performance and governance of the state sector. However, it is too early to say whether the initiative will yield all the expected benefits.

The authorities acknowledged that much work remains to be done to ensure that SOEs in the AMC program are meaningfully restructured. Indeed, it remains to be decided whether AMC-owned or controlled companies will be treated differently from other state enterprises. If there is to be no difference, responsibility for strategic decisions such as replacing management will rest solely with the state planners rather than the AMCs and restructuring may be rather limited. Resolution of this issue will require reconciliation of the varying interests of the Party, central and local governments, enterprises, and workers.” With regard to compensation, the authorities recognize the need for an incentive structure to attract and retain skilled personnel, but are leery about AMC personnel being seen to profit from foreclosing on distressed state enterprises. Instead, the continued ambiguity about whether AMC-bonds were explicitly government guaranteed was seen by the authorities as a way to reduce moral hazard and create an incentive for the AMCs to limit their ultimate losses. Financial sector reform 35. Despite recent reforms, the financial system in China continues to face serious structural problems. Thus far, support for financial sector restructuring has amounted to about 20 percent of china: Support for Financial Sector Rmhctwing through Public Funds, 1998-2000 I/ GDP (Text table).

The debt-equity swap agreements do not appear to provide for such sales; by contrast, they do include provisions for SOEs to buy back their shares from the AMCS. 12The authorities indicated that the quality of new lending would be improved by the shift toward consumer lending (which typically has much lower NPL rates).

The authorities fully recognize the problems faced by the SCBs and that the SCBs will still have substantial NPLs even after the AMC transfers are completed. Nevertheless, the authorities expect that the combined impact on the SCBs of the operations of the AMCs, the recapitalization exercise completed in 1998, and the SCB’s own internal restructuring efforts, will be sufficient to achieve capital adequacy ratios (CARS) of at least 8 percent by 2001 (according to the authorities’ methodology). They also recognize that the implementation of strengthened rules for loan classification and provisioning in line with international practice will require additional capital if the banks are to meet the 8 percent minimum CAR. The SCBs may issue subordinated debt if needed for this purpose. 37. Together with SOE reforms, the authorities are taking further steps to strengthen the operations of SCBs to reduce the flow of NPLs. In 1999, a work conference on financial sector reforms was held with provincial governors and Party secretaries where they were firmly told not to interfere with banks’ lending decisions. Banks are also making efforts to strengthen internal controls and credit/risk management (under the credit responsibility system). The authorities saw the WTO agreement (which requires giving full national treatment to foreign banks within five years and which carries the potential for deposits and high-quality renminbi borrowers to shift to foreign institutions) as providing impetus to domestic commercial banks to accelerate their restructuring efforts. 38. The authorities are well aware that the near-term financial risks lie with the smaller financial institutions. In the mid--1990s, it became apparent that the financial situation of the rural credit funds (RCFs), with total assets of Y 190 billion (2 percent of total deposits), had been seriously undermined, including by speculative activities. The restructuring plan involves the liquidation of insolvent RCFs, and the merger of solvent ones with the rural credit cooperatives (RCCs). Depositors will be repaid by instalhnent over a period of 3-5 years. Restructuring plans for the RCCs, which had deposits of Y 1.3 trillion (i.e., 12 percent of total deposits) at the end of 1999, involve a consolidation of these institutions by merger at the city and provincial levels, and a strengthening of supervision. At some point, the RCCs’ NPL problem will also need to be addressed. Restructuring plans for the trust and investment companies (TICS) involve closing insolvent ones and merging solvent ones, and narrowing their business scope to trust business and investment banking (i.e., excluding any deposit taking or external borrowing).

The staff encouraged the authorities to give consideration to early participation in the IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), with a view to identifying the vulnerabilities in the financial system and the development priorities. However, the authorities’ preferred approach was to first self-assess China’s compliance with Basle Core Principles, and then to learn more about what the FSAP process entailed. This preparatory work would allow China to be a more effective participant in an eventual FSAP, perhaps in three years’ time. Private sector and financial market development 40. An important element in the authorities’ strategy to ensure strong growth and create employment will be further development of nonstate sector activity. Despite a variety of constraints, this remains the most dynamic sector of the economy, particularly in terms of job creation. The authorities planned to accelerate their recent efforts to stimulate nonstate activity, including through liberalizing entry in key sectors, and encouraging state banks to lend to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Other recent initiatives include the abolition of the quota system on new stock market listings and the proposal to create a separate board for SMEs on the stock exchange. The authorities’ plans to allow greater flexibility in lending rates will also facilitate better pricing of risk among nonstate borrowers. 41. Progress has also been made in reforming the housing system and, thus far, about 70 percent of public housing has been sold to former tenants. The new system, which allocates housing benefits via monetary subsidies instead of in kind, is aimed at creating a well-functioning housing market (which should also spur demand for housing services such as maintenance and repair), while releasing enterprises from the task of providing housing to their employees. As part of the new system, housing provident&rids (HPFs) have been set up to provide housing loans to contributors at rates below the official mortgage rate. The HPFs are funded through joint contributions from employees and their employers, and total funding at end-April 2000 amounted to Y 178 billion. Employees can withdraw their contributions to buy a house or upon retirement. 42. The staff welcomed the renewed emphasis on developing the stock market. In light of market concerns about artificial steps to boost share prices, the authorities stated that they are committed to developing the stock market according to market principles. Sound market development would also be promoted by strengthening the regulatory framework, including through training of supervisory staff, increasing the transparency of listed companies’ tinancial accounts, and raising accounting and auditing standards. More generally, a sound legal and regulatory framework and transparency in economic management and information would be essential to good governance in a market economy.

The authorities attach considerable importance to strengthening the social safety net so as to protect workers adversely affected by reform. The goal is to shift responsibility for social services (e.g., health care, education, housing, pensions, and unemployment insurance) from the SOEs to local or prbvincial governments (by creating social pools). This not only widens coverage of the social safety net by ensuring delivery of benefits to workers from SOEs in financial; distress, but also supports SOE reforms by reducing nonwage costs and allowing SOEs to focus on their core business. The authorities are attempting to offset the increased burden on government budgets through expansion of the contributions base of the social pools to private and foreign-funded enterprises (which tend to have higher wages, younger workers, and less surplus labor). 44. The focus is on making further progress with pooling social safety net funds. Experiments with transferring laid-off workers from enterprise reemployment centers to government unemployment insurance programs are underway. l3 Ultimately, extension of unemployment insurance pooling to the provincial and possibly to the national levels may also be necessary to offset financing shortfalls in regions that are particularly hard hit. Efforts are also underway to complete the pooling of pensions at the provincial levels. 45. The social security system at present does not include an explicit mechanism for equalization transfers between provinces. This implies very high tax rates in poor regions with low payroll tax bases and large social safety needs. In response to the staffs concern that such areas might not be able to afford to restructure SOEs, the authorities explained that discretionary transfers from the budget were used to ease the burden on poorer regions. 46. Regional income inequality has become a significant problem. To narrow regional disparities, which have widened during the reform period, the authorities have intensified efforts to promote the development of the relatively poor western and central regions of China, focusing on infiastructural investment, technological upgrading, and training and education. The “Develop the West” initiati.ve also emphasizes projects that protect and restore the environment, a particular concern in the interior provinces. l4 47. China’s political leadership clearly recognizes that addressing corruption is a top priority. The authorities have been vigorously prosecuting officials accused of %OEs undergoing reforms are required to set up reemployment centers to aid the transition for xiugang workers. These centers provide income support based on prevailing wages in the region and retraining for a period of three years, after which xiugang workers who have not found employment must move to the registered unemployed pool. 14About two-thirds of the expenditure under the fiscal stimulus package in 1998 and 1999 have been targeted at the poorer central and western provinces. The question of whether regions in China are converging is addressed in the forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

Improved governance is an important complement to SOE restructuring, since progress in this area has the potential to make the public more accepting of difficult reforms. D. Medium-Term Fiscal Issues 48. Medium-term fiscal sustainability remains a concern. While China’s measured budget deficit and government debt appear relatively modest, the fiscal position is much weaker once account is taken of the need to rectify losses in the banking system resulting from past quasi-fiscal activities. An assessment of fiscal sustainability should also consider the additional budgetary expenditures that will be necessary in the future for social sector reforms, infrastructure, and the environment (assessed by the World Bank at up to 5 percent of GDP annually). The staffs illustrative medium-term fiscal scenario suggests that, without significant adjustment, government debt could rise explosively above 90 percent of GDP by 2008, with interest expenditure increasing to 40 percent of budget revenue (Box 5 and Table 8). By contrast, stabilizing the debt-GDP ratio at its current level will require a fiscal adjustment of 3% percentage points of GDP over the next decade, as well as the curtailment of new quasi-fiscal losses. 49. The authorities stated that the staffs work on medium-term fiscal sustainability had appropriately highlighted the contingent liabilities China faced in the future. However, they viewed the existing stock of contingent liabilities (which includes NPLs in the banking system and pension and welfare liabilities of distressed state enterprises) as a legacy of central planning that will diminish in relative size as the economy grows. The more important concern is to prevent the growth of new contingent liabilities and reduce the costs of settling old ones. This is being done by limiting the flow of NPLs through SOE and financial sector reforms and through determined efforts to collect NPLs by the AMCs. 50. Ensuring fiscal sustainability will also require limiting the budget deficit. The authorities pointed to the recent gains in revenue as a positive development in this regard. However, given the need for additional expenditure, the staff noted that further revenue mobilization would be necessary, both through improved administration (monitoring, enforcement, and auditing) and policy measures (including reduction in the scope and rationalization of tax preferences, broadening the VAT and enterprise income tax bases, and increasing excise taxes). In this context, the staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to replace a number of off-budget fees and charges levied by local governments with a national fuel tax that will be part of the state budget. Moreover, there is substantial scope for expenditure savings (particularly given the waste and fraud that occurs under the present budgetary system).” In this context, the staff welcomed the authorities’ current plans (being “The World Bank is initiating a provincial public expenditure review to facilitate these down-sizing efforts. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-. 34 - formulated with technical assistance from FAD) to introduce a treasury single account and reform budget management. 51. Staff highlighted the need to review the system of inter-governmental fiscal relations (Box 7). Present arrangements provide inadequate inter-governmental equalization transfers and lead to pension and other arrears. In addition, the current system is replete with off-budget and illegal activities, such as unauthorized taxation (levying of ad hoc fees) and state enterprises (including TICS) borrowing on behalf of local governments. The system also exacerbates medium-term fiscal sustainability concerns, because the central government is responsible for servicing all debt yet only collects a little over half of general government revenues. The staff recommended an early reevaluation of intergovernmental fiscal relations, particularly the adoption of a more rules-based intergovernmental transfer mechanism- which could be facilitated through technical assistance from the Fund and the World Bank. The authorities noted that an obstacle to a more rules-based approach was a large backlog of discretionary promises to the provinces that still need to be settled, including from the 1994 reforms of the intergovernmental fiscal relations. E. Capital Account and Statistical Issues 52. China’s capital account remains relatively closed, with most transactions subject to government approval. Existing capital controls proved porous during the Asian crisis, with substantial illegal outflows occurring, apparently from improperly documented current and capital account transactions. In response, a number of measures were introduced to strengthen and reinforce the system of exchange controls (while preserving current account convertibility). l6 The authorities noted foreign direct investment was fairly liberal, and that the main capital account restrictions were on foreign borrowing by domestic enterprises, and foreign purchases of stocks in domestic equity markets. While their longer-term objective remains complete liberalization of the capital account, this would be attempted gradually as the financial sector and regulatory system are strengthened. The staff supported this prudent approach. 53. Despite recent progress, China’s economic statistics continue to suffer from serious weaknesses, significantly complicating economic analysis and surveillance. The staff therefore again urged the authorities to develop time-specific action plans to address these deficiencies, which would be facilitated by continued technical assistance. In addition, while data provision to the Fund is now somewhat better, further action is needed, particularly more frequent (such as monthly) reporting of external debt and fiscal data, as well as periodic quantitative information on the composition of international reserves. The authorities explained that changes in China’s economic structure, and as a result, in coverage, had caused difficult problems for statistical compilation. Nevertheless, in light of impending 16LEG is currently pursuing some unresolved questions pertaining to the making of payments for certain foreign loan agreements on a bilateral basis with the authorities.

A major reform of fiscal federal relations was carried out in 1994, particularly to address the low central government share in overall tax revenue. In addition to concentrating greater revenue flows in central government, the 1994 reform also served to modemize the tax system (including through introduction of the VAT). At the same time, central government transfers to local governments nearly tripled, rising to more than 4 percent of GDP. However, both on-budget and extrabudgetary revenues fell sharply following the reform, perhaps because revenue was driven outside the recording system entirely. In total, combined budgetary and extrabudgetary revenue fell by almost 50 percent from the level of the early 199Os, and has only slowly recovered since 1994.

J Problems and issues. While the revenue decline of the mid-l 990s reflects a number of factors, including those common to many transition countries, adverse incentives in the fiscal federal system appear to have played an important role. Transfers are inadequate and not based on expenditure necessities, and provinces have very little revenue raising authority, so they have strong incentives to keep flows outside the budget (often in the public enterprise sector). Moreover, despite considerable changes in the role of the state in the Chinese economy, expenditure assignments have not been fundamentally reassessed since 1994. Implications for macroeconomic policy. It has been suggested that the Chinese fiscal federal system is conducive to rapid economic growth on the grounds that local governments, which are often equity holders in profitable ventures, have an incentive to refrain from predatory taxation.’ At the same time, the prohibition on their borrowing capacity is thought to preserve macroeconomic stability. Similarly, in this view the center has been precluded from confiscatory taxation and intervention by its limited share in overall revenues and the counterweight of powerful local interests. However, there are a number of difficulties with these arguments, not least that there is evidence to suggest that local governments may simply have shifted predatory activities off budget. Indeed, partly as a result of unfunded spending mandates and expenditure pressures resulting from urbanization and the growth of the non-SOE sector, local governments in China-which are responsible for the bulk of health, education, agriculture and infrastructure spending-have strong incentives to conceal own revenue. This has taken the form of “fees and charges” which are fiscal in nature, the undercollection of central revenues, and also quasi-fiscal activities through the banking sector (witness the GITIC episode) and local public enterprises. Similarly, the macroeconomic effect of central government initiatives-like the fiscal stimulus program of 199%99-may have been reduced due to moral hazard problems (as local governments refrain from capital investments in the expectation that the center will finance them in the end). Finally, the social security system suffers from extreme horizontal imbalance, both within and across provinces, and China’s high degree of fiscal decentralization makes it difficult to put in place pooling arrangements. Directions for reform. Fiscal decentralization has been seen to make macroeconomic management more difficult in a variety of countries, including Brazil and Argentina. To avoid similar problems in China, a comprehensive reform of the fiscal federal system should emphasize clear delineation of revenue bases and expenditure responsibilities, and seek to clarify the role of local contingent liabilities which may have arisen outside the budget. The transfer system will need to be revised to reflect local revenue capacity and expenditure needs, and local authorities will need to be given greater freedom to set tax policy in accordance with local conditions. Ultimately, reducing vulnerabilities in this area will necessitate significant progress in treasury and budget management reforms as well. ‘Qian, Y. and G.

The authorities have agreed for the first time to issue a Public Information Notice (PIN) following the 2000 Article IV Board discussion. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 55. Over the past two and a half yea.rs, aided by skillful macroeconomic management, China has successfully weathered the Asian crisis while continuing to press ahead with structurai reforms. The external environment is now’considerably brighter and there are signs of a recovery in private demand and some easing of deflationary pressures, While the unemployment situation remains a serious concern, China has a window of opportunity to accelerate reforms in the most favorable macroeconomic environment it has experienced for some time. 56. China’s impending membership in the WTO-a historic step forward in its opening to the outside world-will bring opportunities and challenges. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to accelerate reforms so as to prepare domestic enterprises and banks for global competition; this will help ensure sustained high quality growth over the medium term. The authorities are appropriately focused on strengthening the social safety net and narrowing regional disparities in order to protect those adversely affected by reforms and share broadly the benefits of globalization. 57. While China’s exchange rate policy served both China and the region well during the Asian crisis, the staff is of the view that greater exchange rate flexibility has become appropriate to facilitate adjustment to the WTO and other ongoing structural changes. Present conditions would allow for an exit from a position of strength, and such an opportunity should not be missed. The external position has strengthened, the renminbi does not appear to be out of line in terms of fundamentals, and the adverse effects of such a move are likely to be small. The staff recommends a more flexible implementation of the current arrangements involving the widening of the trading band around a reference rate based on a basket of currencies. While current operational arrangements are adequate for a move to greater flexibility in the near term, there is a need over time for measures to strengthen the foreign exchange market and the regulatory framework. 58. The staff broadly supports the present stance of macroeconomic policies. On the fiscal side, the slight withdrawal of stimulus implied by this year’s budget is justified given the improving economic outlook and considerations about medium-term fiscal sustainability. The staff also welcomes the strengthened :revenue effort and the preparations being made to improve budgetary management and intro’duce the fuel tax. In addition, the more comprehensive treatment of expenditure in the 2000 budget has added to fiscal transparency, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - although there is scope for further widening the coverage of the budget, such as including spending and interest related to fiscal stimulus bonds on-lent to local governments. 59. Monetary conditions are appropriately accommodative. The large and rising differential between domestic and U.S. interest rates has not-as the staff had previously feared-resulted in overt pressures on the capital account, but the situation needs to be monitored closely. The authorities are also encouraged to move ahead with the liberalization of interest rates, which promises to improve the efficiency of the financial system. 60. While the AMCs’ activities to date have largely been book-keeping transactions, they are expected to take a central role in SOE and financial reforms in the coming year. A key element to the success of the AMC strategy will be to ensure restructuring of the enterprises in which the AMCs become stakeholders. The staff is also concerned that debt- equity swaps may be granted to enterprises that do not intend to restructure solely to achieve the three-year target for reducing loss-making SOEs. The authorities need to move quickly to put in place a framework for an effective role for AMCs in enterprise restructuring. 61. A number of issues must be resolved if the AMCs are to contribute meaningfully to SOE and financial sector reforms. The top priority is to equip the AMCs with the powers to restructure SOEs. It will also be important to develop asset resolution procedures (including revising the bankruptcy law), and to provide AMCs with the skills and incentives to discharge their responsibilities, and ensure that their financial positions are soundly based. 62. Progress has been made in SOE reforms, although much remains to be done. The staff is encouraged by the progress in sector-specific restructuring programs, the greater recourse being made to bankruptcy procedures, and the steps being taken to strengthen management incentives and corporate governance. The staff also welcomes the authorities’ intention to reduce the role of the state in the economy, including through increased stock issuance and sales of state shares. 63. Further measures are needed to strengthen the financial sector. While the loan transfer to the AMCs will strengthen bank balance sheets, commercial lending practices need to be developed so as to prevent the emergence of new NPLs. In this context, limiting political guidance of lending decisions, strengthening internal controls within banks, retraining commercial bank staff, improving legal and accounting standards, and liberalizing interest rates will be key. In addition, there is a need to further develop the PBC’s supervisory capacity and improve the prudential and regulatory framework. In this context, the staff urges the authorities to move quickly to implement international loan classification standards, followed by a firm timetable for the implementation of strengthened provisioning standards. The staff welcomes the agreement in the context of the WTO to extend full national treatment to foreign banks within 5 years, since this will spur reform and enhance competition in the banking system. 64. The financial position of smaller (particularly nonbank) financial institutions remains a concern. The authorities’ current efforts to consolidate nonbank financial Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38 - institutions are to be commended, although the NPL problem in the RCCs still needs to be addressed. 65. The authorities are encouraged to participate as early as possible in the FSAP, with a view to identifying both the vulnerabilities in the financial system and the priorities for future development. 66. The stock market has an important role to play in reducing leverage in the economy, diversifying ownership, and improving corporate governance. The staff is encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to developing the stock market according to market principles. In this context, it will be important to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework, increase the transparency and quality of listed companies’ financial statements, and raise accounting and auditing standards. 67. Measures must be taken to protect those adversely affected by reforms. The staff welcome the authorities’ ongoing efforts to strengthen the social safety net, encourage private sector development, develop rural ,industries, advance housing reform, and improve governance. Shifting responsibility for social services from the SOEs to the government will increase both the coverage of the safety net and assist SOEs in their restructuring. 68. The authorities’ efforts to address regional disparities, including the campaign to “Develop the West,” are timely. China’s growth over the past two decades has been unevenly shared, and the development of the central and western provinces has lagged behind the coastal regions. Investments in infrastructure and training and education in the interior provinces can help to narrow this disparity. The authorities are appropriately concerned that new investments in the interior protect the already fragile environment. 69. Medium-term fiscal sustainability remains a concern. The fiscal position is potentially unsustainable once account is taken of contingent liabilities in the financial sector, as well as necessary future outlays for social security, infrastructure, and the environment. The risks will intensify without strict efforts to control the budget deficit and to reduce the flow of new bad loans through the banks. The staff therefore urges the authorities to lay the groundwork for medium-term fiscal consolidation through expenditure savings and further revenue mobilization. The system of fiscal. federalism provides insufficient inter-regional equalization transfers and, by leaving an inadequate share of fungible resources at the disposal of central government, exacerbates medium-term fiscal sustainability concerns. The staff considers an early reevaluation of the fiscal federal system to be highly desirable. 70. Despite recent progress, China’s economic statistics continue to suffer from serious weaknesses, significantly complicating economic analysis and surveillance. The staff have identified key problems with the GDP, fiscal, monetary, balance of payments and foreign debt and reserve data. There is a need to develop time-specific action plans to address these deficiencies, which will be facilitated by continued technical assistance. In addition, while data provision to the Fund has improved recently--especially on the balance of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - payments and budgetary side-further action is needed to permit effective surveillance during the year. 71. The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to issue a Public Information Notice (PIN) following the Article IV Executive Board discussion. 72. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard la-month cycle.

The authorities have sought to improve economic statistics with extensive technical assistance from the Fund and other international and bilateral institutions. Nevertheless, weaknesses in the quality of the data, including coverage, frequency and timeliness, remain very serious and continue to hamper the staffs ability to formulate a consistent view of macroeconomic developments. The main statistical issues and weaknesses are: Real sector 2. Data on the expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis; nor are deflators for the expenditure components---either on a quarterly or annual basis. The data are produced in cumulative form, with minimal revisions of previous data, making it difficult to assess quarterly developments accurately or to make seasonal adjustments. Constant price measures of GDP are also suspect because of deficiencies with the price indices used for deflating and their application. Nevertheless, the National Bureau of Statistics has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national accounts data, including quarterly estimates of GDP by industry and estimates of GDP by type of expenditure. Further improvements are intended, including the adoption of the 1993 System of National Accounts, further development of income and expenditure data, and improvements to quarterly GDP estimates. However, no dates have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of the nonstate sector, present new problems for data compilation. The ability to change data collections is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system. Extensive technical assistance has been provided from multilateral and bilateral sources. 3. Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment data also have a shifting base that does not allow a consistent time series. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series. Retail sales and fixed investment data are published only in nominal, not real, terms. 4. The consumer price index is not produced in a time series format, as there are only comparisons with one month and one year earlier on shifting bases. Technical assistance missions in September 1991, April 1995, and June 1997 dealt with the concepts and methodology of internationally used index formulae. The authorities have received technical assistance and training on price index methodology under a cooperative program with Statistics Canada. A technical assistance mission in August 1999 reviewed the methodology to compile fixed-base price indices in test projects in four provinces and found that only in one province the index was adequate. The NBS has announced that a fixed base CPI will be introduced in 2000, but the Fund is not aware of the technical details.

The fiscal data reported for surveillance are seriously deficient in a number of respects, but have improved somewhat in 1998-99. Selected key items are provided only with substantial delays (including a breakdown of debt service), and definitional and coverage problems make it difficult to assess the fiscal situation. For example, some of the recent fiscal stimulus program was not recorded by the budget; the interest on the bonds issued to finance the stimulus program, and on the banking sector recapitalization bonds, was excluded from the budget as well. Moreover, expenditures (including onlending) associated with external aid are not recorded in the budget. The data also exclude any reporting on quasi- fiscal operations undertaken by the banking system through policy lending by state commercial banks and policy banks to SOEs. Finally, information on the extent of enterprise debt that is guaranteed by the government is also not available at this time. Monetary accounis 6. In June 1997, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) began reporting revised monetary data to the Fund on the basis of the All-Accounts Reporting System. Some improvements have been made for the revised monetary data in classification of accounts of the monetary authorities and the banking institutions. Although efforts are under-way, advances are still needed in the compilation and reporting of monetary data inclusive of foreign-currency- denominated accounts of residents and accounts of the branches of foreign banks, 7. Detailed breakdowns of bank credit extended by industry (e.g., manufacturing, property, etc.), and by borrower (e.g., the various elements of the state and nonstate sectors) are very important for economic policymakers, and are available in many countries. The staff continues to encourage the authorities to prepare information of this nature for analytical purposes. 8. Due to the restructuring of the banking sector new statistical issues have arisen, such as how to record the transfer of nonperforming loans to the asset management companies, and how to classify these companies in the banking survey. An STA mission in June/July 2000 worked with the authorities to address these issues. Balance of payments 9. Until 1996, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) compiled China’s balance of payments statistics based largely on information collected from various government agencies. To compile timely, accurate, and comprehensive balance of payments data, SAFE in January 1996 launched an “international transactions reporting system” (ITRS) which started producing data of sufficient quality within one year. This system utilizes information on foreign exchange transactions conducted by banks to derive data on China’s international transactions. To supplement the ITRS, since early 1997 SAFE has used four periodic surveys to collect data on financial flows pertaining to travel, to gather balance Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - ANNEX I sheet information from financial institutions, and to obtain data on portfolio investment and direct investment. 10. The new system has significantly improved the coverage and timeliness of China’s balance of payments accounts. Currently, lthe data are compiled in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPMS), and they are disseminated on an annual basis within six months of the close of the reference period. It appears that the authorities are now close to being able to publish quarterly estimates of the balance of payments. Within the current account, component detail is available on goods, services, income, and transfers. Data on the financial account are also available with significant component detail according to types of flows, but little sectoral data are available for capital account transactions. At present, the authorities do not compile international investment position statistics, but they have expressed their intention to prepare such a statement in the near future. Given that significant parts of the required data for that purpose seem to be available at SAFE and some complementary data might be obtained from external sources, the compilation of international investment position statements for 1998 and 1999-although with some gaps- should be possible in the near future. The Chinese data are being compiled in U.S. dollars. 11. As described above, it is apparent that the Chinese balance of payments compilation system is still under development. A mission from STA visited China between April 3-14, 2000 to provide, inter alia, a review of the progress made in strengthening the system to derive reliable estimates, reducing the net errors and omissions, producing more timely, higher frequency data, and constructing an international investment position statement. The mission found that the coverage of direct investment transactions remains a particularly problematic issue in the Chinese balance of payments and international investment position statistics. The data received from MOFTEC which represent the main data source for these transactions apparently do not cover investments in the form of services, reinvested earnings, and disinvestments. The direct investment survey developed by SAFE on the other hand has not performed sufficiently well to allow the use of any of the data collected. Another issue that has to be addressed urgently by the authorities is to extend verification and auditing programs to reduce the measurement errors and ensure the long term performance of the ITRS. For this purpose regular training programs for staff in the province offices of SAFE will be required. 12. In relation to the work of the Fund Task Force on External Debt and Reserves, a Fund mission visited China during April 27-May 4, 1998 to discuss with the authorities the coverage, timeliness, and periodicity of China’s data on official reserves, reserves-related liabilities, as well as those on other external assets and liabilities, financial derivative activities, and other contingent and potential liabilities. Qualitative information on reserves was provided in the context of this mission although it was not possible to update that information after 1998. Data on external debt are apparently compiled monthly but published only on an annual basis; these monthly data have not been provided to Fund staff on a regular basis (although a late 1999 mission was provided with mid- 1999 data). The 1999 Article IV mission found that, despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there is an urgent need to strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation, while introducing - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-51- ANNEX I additional transparency in data dissemination. On the compilation of external debt data, the mission recommended that better use be made of existing domestic data sources, that domestic data sources (from the banking and corporate sectors) be strengthened, and that full use be made of available external sources (especially BIS and OECD). 13. The multi-sector mission also followed up on issues relating to external debt data. In an effort to strengthen external debt statistics, the SAFE continues to review the concepts, definitions, classifications, and coverage of the BIS, OECD, and World Bank databases and make the necessary adjustments to enhance the usefulness of the existing official data. The SAFE also plans to redesign the debt registration form, upgrade computer software and training, and implement an improved external debt compilation system. Data reporting to STA for publications 14. In June 1999, the PBC resumed reporting monthly monetary data and has agreed to their publication in IFS. These improvements in reporting notwithstanding a number of breaks remain in the series, and comparable historical data are not available. 15. Since 1994, China’s Ministry of Finance (MOF) has regularly reported annual GFS data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The GFS database currently includes data on the central government budget for 1990-97, and on provincial and local governments for 1995- 97. However, the data still exclude social security and most extrabudgetary operations. In GFS terms, the revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue and grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of expenditure is by function only and lacks an economic classification. The MOF also reports annual GFS data for publication in IFS. Data, through 1998, relate to revenue, expenditure, and the deficit/surplus of the central provinces, counties, and municipal governments’ budgets. These data are provided with substantial delays. The latest published data are forward estimates for 1999. 16. Reporting of data to STA for IFS has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag. Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the timeliness of consumer price, industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS has improved substantially. However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no data published on producer prices, wages, and trade volumes and prices/unit values. Data dissemination to the public 17. The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly improved the timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and the main real sector indicators. However, public access to data remains considerably below international standards. The monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series nor the disaggregation necessary for analysis. Moreover, several important time series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not released in a systematic and timely manner.

Under the new exchange system, domestic enterprises are required to sell their foreign exchange to designated banks and can freely purchase foreign exchange from banks for trade and trade- related transactions with the necessary import documentation. A managed float system was adopted on January 1, 1994 under which the PBC intervenes through the purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the interbank market to limit intraday volatility of the exchange rate. On June 28,200O the exchange rate was Y 8.3 per U.S. dollar.

There are repatriation and surrender requirements on proceeds from exports and from invisible transactions and current transfers. As of October 15, 1997, qualifying domestic enterprises are allowed to retain 15 percent of the value of their foreign trade (exports plus imports) of the previous year. Qualifying enterprises are foreign trade companies with a trade volume greater than $30 million and with registered capital greater than Y 10 million, and enterprises with foreign trade rights whose volume of trade exceeds $10 million and registered capital exceeds Y 30 million. Foreign-funded enterprises (FFEs) may retain their export earnings provided these earnings do not exceed the maximum amount allowed for a foreign exchange surrender account as prescribed by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE); otherwise, if any, must be sold to authorized banks or to the market. Importers must provide valid proof and commercial bills to obtain foreign exchange. Two exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction, which were identified during 1999 and temporarily approved by the Executive Board, were eliminated by December 3 1, 1999, as scheduled, and there are no other measures currently in force which have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. From the second half of 1998, following substantial problems arising from improperly documented current account transactions and concealed capital flight in a context of mounting anticipations of a devaluation of the national currency, a broad range of new requirements have been implemented to expand the scope of documentation required for most forms of current transactions and require prior verification of the underlying transactions in some instances (e.g., the customs service must certify the value of imports before banks can provide foreign exchange for payment). Regulations were also introduced reducing the scope for domestically-funded entities to conduct businesS with foreign banks operating in China. Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. In general, a capital account transaction requires the approval of the SAFE. Equity purchases in China by nonresidents are limited to special shares (“B” shares). Nonresidents are not permitted to issue capital or money market securities in the domestic market. Purchases abroad of capital and money market instruments by residents are restricted to a few financial institutions and enterprises, as are foreign stock and bond issues, which also require prior approval. From the second half of 1998, additional measures have been introduced to prohibit the purchase of foreign exchange for prepayment of foreign debt and expand the range of transactions subject to registration as foreign debt to include, inter alia, payment terms for imports beyond 90 days. An annual foreign borrowing plan sets mandatory ceilings for all medium- and long-term borrowing by government departments and enterprises (except FFEs which are subject to individual limits negotiated in the investment approval process). External borrowing regulations were revised effective January 1, 1998.

For short-term borrowing by financial institutions (less than a year), the amount of borrowing is subject to an overall limit determined by SAFE on an annual basis (there are also enterprise-specific limits); financial institutions can conduct business within this limit without explicit approval, but must register the borrowing with the SAFE. For medium- and long-term loans, approval will be subject to a limit determined by the State Development and YPlanning Commission, while the terms of the issue will be examined by SAFE, New regulations on guarantees by residents to nonresidents went into effect in January 1998, with the following key features. First, the concept of guarantees provided by authorized domestic institutions has been redefined and clarified. Under the new definition, guarantees consist of collateral and pledges in addition to what were commonly known as guarantees. Second, the approval process has changed: banks do not need approval to issue guarantees, but must register them with SAFE. All other guarantees have to be approved by and registered with SAFE. Third, both domestic and foreign-currency-denominated guarantees are now covered by the regulations. Fourth, the approval process for guarantees has been clarified, and is now based on prospective guarantors’ profits, assets to liabilities, and asset- quality-ratio requirements. China also maintains controls on FDI, although it has generally pursued an “open door” policy toward inward FDI. In the case of outward FDI, foreign exchange is provided after a SAFE review of sources of foreign exchan,ge f?.mds and an assessment of the investment risk involved, approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Cooperation (MOFTEC), and registration with SAFE. In the case of inward direct investment, nonresidents can invest in China subject to meeting certain regulations and MOFTEC approval. For environmental, security, and other reasons, inward direct investment in some industries is prohibited. With regard to derivative transactions, domestic financial institutions and domestic firms cannot enter such transactions for speculation. However, transactions designed to hedge interest rate or exchange rate risk are possible. All transactions involving derivative instruments under foreign debt items must be registered with SAFE. Transactions undertaken by FFEs do not need to be registered. With respect to the development of a forward foreign exchange market for the renminbi, the Bank of China has been permitted, as part of a pilot project, to offer forward transactions involving the renminbi, but the market remains small and proof of an underlying current transaction is required for access to forward cover. The longest maturity is four months. VIII. Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation took place during May 4-18, 1999.

Lending to date now totals almost $34 billion for more than 220 projects. Combined IBRD/IDA lending in FY 1999 was $2.1 billion for 19 projects. FY 1999 was the last year of China’s eligibility to benefit from concessional IDA credits. Lending in FY 2000-all on IBRD terms-is expected to total about $1.9 billion, Given the increasing availability of domestic financing and shift of the government’s development focus to China’s central and western areas, the focus of the World Bank’s assistance program is now shifting to the poorer and institutionally weaker inland provinces. As a consequence, the amount of lending per project has been scaled back to suit the actual financial needs of those provinces, leading to a lower lending level as compared with the $2.6 billion lent in FY 1998. About half of the I9 projects approved in FY 1999 directly supported poverty alleviation and social objectives; the rest supported infrastructure development, mostly in the interior. Projects in FY 2000 would improve the urban environment, both in coastal and inland areas, address important issues in managing water resources, including flood prevention, assist small farmers, and develop transport infrastructure in the interior and in one of the poorest areas in the country. Over the next three years, total lending could be in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, as country needs dictate. Much of this fmancing is expected to involve support for infrastructure development and water conservation programs concentrated in the interior provinces, as well as for urban and environmental projects largely in the more developed eastern areas. Given the cessation of China’s eligibility for concessional IDA financing, the Bank has been working with the government and various bilateral partners-who offer grants or low-interest loans-to identify a suitable approach for continued financial assistance for social and direct poverty alleviation programs. The blending of resources serves to soften the overall lending terms. The Bank’s collaboration with one bilateral agency appears very likely, and discussions with other partners continue. A summary of Bank commitments and disbursement to China is given in Table 1. Details of the sectoral breakdown of past lending can be found in Table 2. Increasingly, the government has called on the Bank to provide nonlending services, particularly involving collaborative studies with them on policy issues and participation in technical assistance activities. Among the main outputs recently completed was a volume of economic and technical sector papers on some 20 subjects, which the government requested in conjunction with preparation of the next Tenth Five-year Plan. Policy notes have also been prepared on various aspects of fiscal, financial, corporate and public sector reform as well as on economic trends. In addition, new studies will be undertaken in connection with China’s accession to the WTO. In FY 1999, in addition to a variety of ad hoc policy notes on issues of immediate concern to the government, the Bank produced a country economic report that elaborated on China’s success in avoiding the effects of the Asian financial crisis and policy options for the future, an exhaustive rural development study exploring important sectoral ‘Prepared by World Bank staff.

Seminarsand workshops figure prominently in the program, often in collaboration with other international institutions and leading universities. Representation: The People’s Republic of China assumed China’s representation in the World Bank on May 15, 1980. Capital Subscription: China holds 4,479 million shares or 2.87 percent of the total authorized capital of the IBID. Currently, China is fully subscribed. Technical Assistance: A technical assistance loan to the People’s Bank of China to enhance the central bank’s supervision, research, and clearing capabilities was approved in FY 1993. A second technical assistance project, approved in the same year, is financing reform- supportive studies and economic research, the strengthening of core agencies responsible for macroeconomic management and local training institutions, and preinvestment support. Technical assistance for economic law reform was approved in FY 1995. Fiscal technical assistance, also approved in FY 1995, supports the implementation of recent fiscal reforms by developing and establishing a new National Tax Administration, and by developing an intergovernmental grants scheme and improved budgetary practices. In FY 1999, technical assistance projects were approved for reform of accounting, pension and enterprise systems. Further technical assistance support for economic research and preinvestment was also provided in FY 1999. Resident Mission: A resident IBRD office in Beijing has been in operation since October 1985. In October 1997, responsibility for managing the Bank’s total program for China was decentralized to the Beijing office. International Finance Corporation (IFC): IFC commitments held as of February 29,200O total about $264 million in loans and $88 million in equity, of which $186 million of the loans and $83 million of the equity are disbursed. This does not include $407 million in loan commitments held for participants, of which $309 million is disbursed. A resident IFC office in Beijing has been in operation since 1992. Recently, a joint IFUWorld Bank regional office for private sector development was established in Hong Kong SAR, and management of this program will be decentralized to the Hong Kong SAR office in July 2000. .

These three broad objectives will help maximize employment generation, further eliminate factor market distortions, and address market failures of rapid growth by spreading the benefits of growth more evenly, and minimizing environmental degradation, In line with the Government’s priority to stimulate the development of the Western Region through allocating an increased share of Government sources and the AsDB’s overarching objective of poverty reduction, the 200 l-2003 country assistance program will emphasize investment in basic infrastructure and agricultural development in the Western Region and less developed areas in the Central Region. In addition, support for projects addressing environment protection and urban poverty reduction in the Coastal Region and relatively developed areas in the Central Region will be continued. Since China became a member of the AsDB in 1986,79 project loans totaling $9,425.2 mil- lion (see Table 1) have been approved as of December 3 1, 1999. In addition, the AsDB has approved one line of equity for $3 million, four equity investments totaling $44.3 million, three loans of $116.5 million to the private sector without government guarantee, and 328 technical assistance projects amounting to $166.6 million. The 2000 lending program was at $962million for 6 projects. The loan projects included: West Henan Agricultural Development ($ 64 million); Wind Power Development Project ($58 million); Guizhou and Chongqing II Roads Development ($320 million); Hefei-Xi’an Railways ($300 million); Mudanjiang Water Supply ($90 million); and Tianjin Wastewater Treatment and Water Resources Protection ($130 million). In addition, the technical assistance program for 2000 included 21 projects totaling $13.7 million. The lending program mix will reflect the recommendation made in the AsDB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy which calls for increasing public sector lending to poverty interventions. “Poverty intervention” and “core poverty intervention” projects account for more than 50 percent in terms of number and loan amounts in the 2001-2003 lending program. The AsDB’s proposed program in the next few years will address two other major issues: growing income disparities and environmental degradation. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that environmental issues are addressed and that the project beneficiaries include the poor. Increased attention will be given to the less developed inland provinces; about 70 percent of the proposed projects in AsDB’s operational program for 1997-2001 are located in inland provinces compared with 40 percent during the 1987-96 period. The strategic thrust of projects in AsDB’s major project areas has now shifted to the inland provinces. ‘Prepared by the staff of the Asian Development Bank.

Three key themes in the 2001-2003 TA program are poverty reduction, improved environmental management and improved governance. AsDB will continue to support for the development of the capital markets, the use of equity investments to mobilize international funds for investment in China, and arranging for cofinancing with commercial banks. Overall, China has demonstrated a strong project implementation capability. The good performance reflects the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the design, implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening process for development projects, particularly those proposed for external assistance. Loan disbursement and contract award performance is good (see Table 2). Of the 79 loan projects approved as of December 3 1, 1999,26 are fully disbursed and closed and 53 remained active as of end 1999. The establishment of the PRC Resident Mission (PRCRM) in Beijing on 16 June 2000 will foster closer intereactions with stakeholders, including government officials, NGOs, private sector and other donors, and enhance AsDB’s local knowledge. AsDB’s presence in Beijing will increase development impact and contribute to improving portfolio management and project administration. AsDB is playing a leading role in two ongoing regional programs that include PRC, the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and the Central Asia Region. Through Yunnan Province, PRC is an active participant in AsDB-supported regional program to promote economic cooperation in GMS. One project in the transport sector with important subregional linkages, the Southern Yunnan Road Development Project, was approved in 1999. This Project was prepared under a regional technical assistance (RETA No. 5728: Chiang Rai-Kunming Road Improvement). AsDB is also pursuing cooperation in the Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in PRC. A series of RETAs are helping the countries identify and prioritize development projects that increase and diversify trade and other economic activities in three sectors: (i) energy, (ii) transport and communications, and (iii) regional payments and trade. Two projects in the transport sector with important subregional linkages include: (i) Kashgar-Torugart Railway Project, and (ii) Rail Crossing Improvements at the Druzba-Ala Pass (Kazakhstan-PRC Border). In the energy sector, one possible project has been identified: Facilitation of Kyrgyz Electricity Exports to PRC, which has been studied under RETA No. 5663: Kyrgyz Republic and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Power Development Study.
