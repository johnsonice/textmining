EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since late 1997, a new reform-minded government has been implementing a reform program aimed at correcting several years of weak economic management which resulted in a crisis marked by mounting arrears and a virtual breakdown in financial intermediation. Good progress was made in 1998 toward regaining the confidence of creditors through paying down arrears and remaining current on debt-service obligations, albeit at a below-market interest rate on domestic debt, even in the face of a decline in revenues. Progress was also made in some areas of structural reform, notably the forestry sector, customs administration, government accounting, civil service reform, and in laying the groundwork for privatization. However, insufficient progress was made in strengthening inland revenue and nontax revenue collections, and in land reform, Notwithstanding the strong adjustment efforts initiated by the authorities, the macroeconomic outturn in 1998 was mixed, largely because of adverse external circumstances. Real GDP is estimated to have declined by about 6-7 percent in 1998 mainly owing to the sharp decline in logging, while the current account balance (including grants) swung from a deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 1997 to a surplus of about 5% percent of GDP in 1998. Together with larger official inflows, this resulted in an increase in gross official reserves to US$48% million at end-1998 (about 2% months of imports). The policy discussions focused on measures necessary to consolidate the gains made in 1998 and push ahead with the structural reform program. Specifically, the mission discussed measures to restore order to the public finances, primarily through revenue enhancement, and normalize the financial intermediation process including by paying market-determined interest rates on government securities. . To resuscitate the market for government securities, the authorities have recently negotiated a debt-restructuring plan which should ensure affordability to the budget, lead to market-determined interest rates, lower bank intermediation costs, and restore the ability of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) to actively manage liquidity to achieve its monetary policy targets. . The authorities also plan to give emphasis to structural reforms in the forestry and financial sectors, privatization, and the land tenure system in order to generate a sustainable private sector growth response.

The mid-1990s were characterized by rapid growth, driven by an unsustainable boom in logging. During this period, the external current account shifted from large deficits to surpluses, and official reserves rose to US$32 million (1% months of imports) by end- 1996 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Indiscriminate exploitation of forest resources at close to three times, the estimated sustainable rate reduced incentives to diversify the productive base of the economy. At the same time, profligate tax and fee exemptions, generous public wage increases, and weak governance led to large overall budget deficits. This exhausted the scope for voluntary financing from the commercial banks and the National Provident Fund (NPF) and eventually, the statutory limit for government borrowing from the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) was breached. Subsequently, deficits were financed through a buildup in domestic and external arrears. The suspension of debt-service payments to holders of government securities led to the effective closure of the treasury bill market, severely undermining monetary management and-as interest rate spreads widened-the financial intermediation process (Chart 2). 2. The dangers of this policy course became obvious with the onset of the Asian crisis in mid-1997. The log export boom ended abruptly, real GDP contracted in 1997, notwithstanding investment related to the Gold Ridge mine, and the external current account (including grants) shifted to a deficit equivalent to 10 percent of GDP, necessitating a 20 percent devaluation in December (Chart 3). The new reform-minded Solomon Islands Alliance for Change (SIAC) government took office in September 1997 in the midst of a full- .blown financial crisis with a virtual breakdown in financial intermediation, and arrears estimated at SI$l92 million (13 percent of GDP) at end- 1997 (Table 2). 3. With public finances in disarray and faced with a severely deteriorated external environment and declining reserves, the government announced a Policy and Structural Reform Program (PSRP). The main short-term goals of the PSRP were to strengthen the government finances and reduce the size of the public sector. At the conclusion of the 1998 Article IV consultation, Directors emphasized the importance of stabilization measures, including strong fiscal adjustment, a reduction of arrears, increases in interest rates, the restoration of an’orderly financial intermediation process, and structural measures to rationalize the forestry sector and enhance revenues. Directors stressed, however, that the authorities should also move quickly to implement far-reaching structural reforms to encourage private investment and promote an improvement in living standards. Progress in 1998 against the recommendations made during the last consultation was generally good (Table 3)--arrears were reduced, current debt-service obligations were met, forestry reforms were launched, significant fiscal adjustment took place, albeit mainly through expenditure compression as revenues fell short of targets. However, little progress was made in achieving positive real interest rates or reactivating the treasury bill market.

Policy efforts in 1998 were focused on achieving broad balance in the central government finances primarily through improving revenue collection and civil service retrenchment. In addition, the government committed to eliminating interest arrears in two years and rescheduled all maturing treasury securities into 9 1 -day treasury bills at a below- market interest rate of 6 percent.’ Also, in April 1998, outstanding government arrears to the NPF-about SI$38 million-were securitized. 5. In the event, a small fiscal surplus is estimated for 1998: compared with a deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 1997, mainly on account of a compression in nonwage recurrent expenditure (Table 4). Total revenues fell short of the budget by SI$20 million (1% percent of estimated 1998 GDP) mainly on account of the shortfall in customs collections due to the sharp decline in trade (Table 5), the failure to implement planned increases in import duties and excises on alcohol and tobacco, and continued poor collection efforts. On the expenditure side, the wage bill is estimated to have exceeded the budget by about SI$6% million due to the delay in the civil service retrenchment program. Notwithstanding lower-than-planned interest payments, expenditures on goods and services fell short of the budget by more than 1 percent of estimated 1998 GDP. The government met its debt service and arrears clearance commitments by end-year, although cash flow constraints led to some within-year accumulation of arrears to the NPF (SI$20 million), which were cleared using the proceeds of the first tranche of an AsDB loan (uS$15 million), disbursed in November 1998. 6. Monetary policy was tightened somewhat through increases in interest rates on CBS1 securities (Bokolo bills) and call deposits at the CBSI. Although these actions resulted in a moderate increase in bank deposit rates, real rates remained significantly negative (on the order of minus 5 percent for deposits up to six months). Despite the decline in activity, private sector credit grew by 25 percent in 1998 (Table 6) as companies advanced debt-service and import payments early in the year, apparently in anticipation of a further exchange rate devaluation. Also, several large pyramid schemes (some with as many as 40,000 investors or 10 percent of the population) arose in late 1998, all of which have since collapsed.3 Following the devaluation in December 1997, the authorities adopted a U.S. dollar peg, which resulted in substantial nominal effective appreciation of the S.I. dollar ‘Yields on treasury bills were between 12 and 13 percent at the time they ceased to be serviced in 1996. *Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fiscal accounts as no data are available on government expenditure which is estimated as a residual from revenues and financing. 3The impact on the banking system is reported to have been small, but there could have been substantial adverse effects on rural credit unions.

In August, however, the CBS1 reverted to pegging to a basket of trading partner currencies while effecting a small depreciation vis-a-vis the US. dollar. 7. With respect to structural reforms, progress was made in forestry, customs administration, government accounting, civil service reform, and privatization. In the forestry sector, the reforms were aimed at establishing a framework to achieve sustainable forestry and generate more revenue (Box 1). In customs administration, the authorities have’ launched a reform initiative, with the assistance of AusAID, under which the staffing of the customs department has been increased, surveillance strengthened and documentary processes improved (Box 2). Important progress was also made in reconstructing the government accounts, including by putting in place changes in the accounting, control and payment systems that have succeeded in imparting greater transparency and reducing the scope for abuse of the system. A start was made on the privatization program, with agreement reached on the terms of sale of Solomon Islands Plantations Limited (SIPL). By contrast, very little headway was made in strengthening inland revenues-in part due to delays in the delivery of technical assistance-and nontax revenues-due to the lack of progress by the Revenue Enhancement Group in designing and implementing revenue raising measures. 8. Notwithstanding the efforts to improve the economic policy environment, macroeconomic performance was mixed in 1998, largely because of adverse external factors. Real GDP fell by an estimated 6-7 percent, mainly on account of the decline in logging and related activities. Inflation (12-month basis), which had been running at 7 to 8 percent prior to the December 1997 devaluation, peaked at 15 percent in October 1998 before subsiding to about 10 percent by December. The higher inflation during 1998 reflected mainly the passthrough of the devaluation. Consequently, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by only 7 percent through end- 1998, returning roughly to the end- 1996 level. Preliminary information on the external accounts suggests that the current account balance (including grants) swung from a deficit of about 10 percent of GDP in 1997 to a surplus of about 5% percent of GDP in 1998, as the slowdown in exports was more than offset by compression in imports of goods and services.4 With this shift and increased official inflows, gross official reserves rose to US$48% million at end-1998 (about 2% months of imports). 4Extemal sector analysis is hampered by weaknesses in the compilation of the balance of payments, which recorded large negative errors and omissions in 1997 and 1998.

Solomon Islands-Forestry Sector Reforms Two important and interrelated problems face the forestry sector in the Solomon Islands: l several years of unsustainably high logging rates and destruct&e harvesting practices which have nearly depleted the forestry resources of the economy; 9 indiscriminate tax breaks and poor governance and enforcement resulting in low revenues and rents from this national resource. With the logging rate in the mid- 1990s rising to over 2 times the estimated sustainable cut of 300,000 cubic meters per year, it has been estimated that forestry resources will be largely depleted in the next 1 O-l 5 years. Faced with this alarming prospect, the authorities intend to use the window of opportunity presented by the decline in demand for logs from the main East Asian importers to implement urgent reforms in the sector. To this end, the steps that have already been taken include: l limiting the proliferation of logging and milling licenses by suspending the authority of the area councils to grant licenses; l canceling inoperative logging licenses; 9 drafting of a new Forestry Act whose primary aim is to ensure that the rate of timber harvesting is sustainable. The Act is to be presented to parliament in May 1999. The Act (a) rationalizes the ownership of forest rights and of customary (traditionally-owned) land-under the previous laws the forestry resources were treated as being separate from the land on which they grew which made it difficult to hold loggers accountable for abuses or disputes; (b) provides incentives for local participation in the industry; and (c) encourages sustainable management of forestry resources; l introducing a mandatory code of logging practices, including reforestation requirements; l initiating a three-year forestry management project funded by AusAID with an important first step-namely the hiring and installing of a new Commissioner of Forests-already taken; l changing the tax regime so that export duties are determined on the basis of a gazetted schedule of reference prices rather than on the sale price indicated by the seller, thus reducing the scope for transfer pricing; l completing a study of forestry taxation (funded by the World Bank) in March 1999. Steps that remain to be taken include: l Full implementation of the forestry management project, now expected by mid- 1999, which will include the hiring and training of field officers to monitor forestry practices, the classification of logs for exports, and training loggers in sustainable forestry practices. l Implementation of reforms in forestry taxation based on the recommendations of the forestry taxation study, particularly the recommendation of a floor on export taxes to ensure that logging does not occur at prices below the cost of production. 9. Available information points to an improvement in economic conditions in 1999. With a full year of output from the Gold Ridge mine and some pickup in logging as export markets recover, real GDP growth is estimated to recover to about 2-3 percent in 1999. Contingent on appropriate macroeconomic policies, including the continuation of a public sector wage freeze, an agreement reached with the private sector to moderate wage increases, and the completion of the pass-through of the recent devaluation, inflation is expected to decline from an average of 12 percent in 1998 to 7-8 percent in 1999. Given the expectation of a continued current account surplus and strong official inflows in 1999, reserves are expected to rise to US$68% million (about 3% months of imports).

Solomon Islands-Customs Reform Plan The importance of customs and excise collections in Solomon Islands can be gauged by the fact that historically about half of fiscal revenues have been collected by the customs department (which collects both customs duties and excise taxes), although with the decline in log export duties in 1998, that ratio declined to under 40 percent. There is significant scope for improving customs administration including by preventing misclassification, undervaluation, and smuggling. To this end, the following customs action plan was ’ developed in consultation with AusAID. l! The plan’s main elements include: . Increasing the staffing of the customs department; . Increasing cargo examinations; . Stepping up waterfront and airport surveillance and intervention, including by police and other agencies; . Computerizing data entry at the point of import and export in order to strengthen control procedures and to provide a more accurate and timely database for analysis; . increasing coordination among agencies responsible for revenue collection; . Designing and implementing documentary processes which will facilitate the production of an audit trail and the implementation of strengthened control procedures in order to reduce internal fraud; . Legislative changes to increase penalties for evasion. In addition, the government intends to review tariff rates with a view to simplifying and rationalizing the tariff structure. l! Two AusAID advisors are working with the Customs Department on an interim basis until a full three- ,year institution strengthening project can be initiated in mid- 1999. IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 10. The policy discussions focused on the measures necessary to consolidate the gains made in 1998 by completing the process of normaliziug the public finances and pushing ahead with the government’s structural reform program, with a view to reducing the inherent vulnerability of the economy and aliowing the private sector to become the engine of growth. To this end, the authorities have developed a macroeconomic policy framework for 1999 which relies on (i) a continued tight fiscal policy to enable the full restoration in market confidence in public finance management; (ii) a restrained monetary policy to reduce inflation to 7-8 percent in 1999 while permitting adequate private sector credit growth; and (iii) structural reforms aimed at normalizing the financial intermediation process, promoting sustainable forestry, increasing private sector participation, and improving key economic statistics. Over the medium-term, the pursuit of these macroeconomic policies and structural reforms would allow real GDP growth to rise to a sustainable rate of 4-5 percent, thereby achieving positive per capita growth; inflation to come down to 3!&4 percent; and reserves to rise to the equivalent of about 4 months of imports (Table 7).

The policy discussions were undertaken against the background of a SAC which the World Bank is designing to support the government’s reforms in the financial and forestry sectors, and in improving the delivery of health, education and social services. The Fund Board’s assessment of the Solomon Islands’ macroeconomic policy framework will be taken into account in the World Bank’s consideration of the government’s request for a SAC. A favorable assessment by the Fund of the macroeconomic framework is also a condition for the SAC’s second tranche release. The form of such an assessment-either through the next Article IV consultation planned for early 2000 or under a Fund arrangement-will be determined in the light of circumstances at the time. The assessment will be based on the member’s broad adherence to the indicative targets laid out in Table 8, the implementation of policies conducive to the achievement of the government’s objectives, and its readiness to pursue appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies in the period ahead. A summary of the mission’s main policy recommendations to achieve the authorities’ objectives for 1999, which are described in the remainder of the report, is contained in Annex I. A. Fiscal Policy 12. The authorities stated that strengthening the public finances will remain the centerpiece of their macroeconomic stabilization strategy. The mission noted that the recurrent expenditure-based fiscal adjustment in 1998 was neither desirable nor sustainable in the medium-term, given the country’s urgent maintenance and development needs; the focus of further fiscal adjustment should therefore be on revenues. To this end, the authorities have adjusted the 1999 budget to keep revenues broadly unchanged as a ratio to GDP from 1998, primarily through strengthened collections of customs and inland revenues, including the rigorous implementation of the interim customs action plan (Table 4). 13. The additional revenue arising from the stronger collection efforts will permit higher expenditures than budgeted on certain high priority items while containing the overall deficit. Higher expenditure on wages and salaries will be associated, in part, with the implementation of the retrenchment exercise which, when completed in April 1999, will reduce the administrative civil service (excluding teachers, health workers, and police) by some 13 percent, and is expected to yield savings of l-l % percent of GDP annually (Box 3). The proposed fiscal plan also involves higher interest payments on outstanding domestic debt associated with fully normalizing the relationship with the financial system and resuscitating an active treasury bill market (see paragraph 16). The authorities agreed that the improved revenue collections should nevertheless limit the overall deficit to SI$lO million or about % percent of GDP in 1999, compared with the original, planned deficit of 1 percent. The authorities recognize that expenditures will remain relatively tight for the second consecutive year in 1999, but believe this restraint is necessary to fully restore confidence in public finance management. Other aspects of the fiscal policy framework for 1999 agreed with the authorities include: (i) no recourse to domestic borrowing in 1999; (ii) all foreign borrowing to be on concessional terms; (iii) the virtual elimination of arrears by end- 1999, including completion of interest arrears clearance as scheduled; and (iv) no new arrears to be incurred Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- during the year.5 In particular, the authorities have indicated that they would remain current on payments to the NPF.6 Box 3. Solomon Islands-Major Elements of the Civil Service Reform Reduction of the civil service payroll has been a key feature of the government’s fiscal adjustment , strategy, and is expected to lead to a more efficient public service. The civil service “rightsizing”, initially planned for 1998, was delayed, in part because of resistance from unions. However, momentum resumed towards the end of the year, and, with assistance from the AsDB and New Zealand, the rightsizing was largely completed by early March 1999, with the last few retrenchments, expected to take place by end- April. The restructuring was carried out by first identifying posts for elimination in each ministry, which entailed merging or eliminating functions, Retrenchments then took place in phases with the senior positions being eliminated first (with most incumbents rehired, albeit at lower grades), followed by the retrenchment of mid-level and then low-level staff, In the end, the civil service was reduced by a net figure of 447, or 13 percent of the nonpriority civil service (i.e., excluding teachers and police, who were protected from the retrenchments). An additional 103 posts which had been vacant, were abolished. It is estimated that the cost- savings from the retrenchment .exercise would amount to about S1$20-25 million per year (l-l% percent of GDP). The government sought to cushion the social impact of the retrenchments by the establishment of a transition services unit which provided job retraining and other services designed to help civil servants to find employment in the private sector or start small businesses. The retrenchment packages provided an elementary social safety net in the form of waivers of school fees for one year, and the extension of rights to remain in government housing for an additional three months. The retrenchment allowances were funded by the AsDB, and additional funds may be used to provide performance bonus incentives. The rightsizing is the first phase of a larger public sector reform effort. The second phase will involve a detailed review of every aspect of ministerial functions and service delivery, and will establish performance measures to facilitate ongoing measurement of service and individual performance levels. The third phase will include improving the human resource function, providing training tailored to.the needs of the public service, output-based budgeting, and stronger links between budgeting, planning, and accounting. 14. The mission recommended that contingency plans be formulated to safeguard the planned fiscal outcome. The main downside risks were seen to be on the revenue and financing side, including the possible reversal of the favorable ruling on the tax treatment of dividends which resulted in additional revenue of SI$l9 million in 1998. Accordingly, the authorities will maintain 10 percent of planned expenditure in reserve across the board, and will formulate contingency measures, including raising taxes on petroleum, tobacco, and SThe authorities intend to normalize the situation with two external creditors whose claims are in dispute, through either a cancellation or a rescheduling of the obligations. 6The mission also recommended that the NPF act be amended to require that contributions are made concurrently with wage payments.

Also, bilateral technical assistance is being provided to design measures to improve the revenue yield from sales and excise taxes, in time for the 2000 budget, and the work of the Revenue Enhancement Group in strengthening nontax revenues, which have historically underperformed relative to targets, is being expedited. 15. Over the medium-term, the authorities agreed that once the urgent need to restore order to the public finances has been fulfilled, fiscal policy would aim to increase public sector saving to finance development needs in the context of declining grant assistance. This objective would be achieved through the maintenance of a broadly unchanged revenue-to-GDP ratio and further reductions in current spending, made possible by lower interest payments on public debt and a smaller civil service. The targeted increase in public sector saving on the order of 2% percent of GDP would partially offset the projected decline in grants. This outcome would still allow for higher development spending while keeping the overall deficit to about 3 percent of GDP and reducing public debt to a sustainable level of about 45 percent of GDP. B. Domestic Debt Restructuring and Resuscitating the Treasury Bill Market 16. Following extensive negotiations, the authorities reached an agreement with the major holders of treasury bills in March 1999 to restructure government debt and reactivate the market for treasury bills (Box 4). The restructuring agreement has three key aims: affordability to the government; market determination of interest rates; and restoration of the CBSI’s ability to actively manage liquidity. Under the agreement, the existing short- term treasury bills are to be rescheduled into longer-term bonds, at fixed or variable rates, the latter linked initially to commercial bank deposit rates and subsequently to treasury bill rates once auctions are launched and a yield curve is established.7 In addition, the minimum liquid asset ratio (MLARj-which had earlier been raised to the statutory limit of 40 percent to use banks as a captive source of government financing-will be redefined to exclude treasury bills and bonds and lowered to 7% percent at the same time that the auctions are launched. The reduction in the MLAR is expected to have little liquidity impact-the restructured government bonds will effectively be “sterilized” and any remaining free liquidity is seen as necessary to encourage banks to participate in the treasury bill auctions. As the restructured bonds are retired at maturity, the CBS1 is expected to be able to absorb the associated liquidity through open-market operations. 7The debt restructuring is expected to be completed by end-April 1999, and the authorities are preparing to launch treasury bill auctions in May, with technical assistance from the Fund.

Solomon Islands-Key Elements of the Government Debt-Restructuring Plan The main objectives underlying the debt-restructuring plan are: l Ensure affordability to the government by smoothing debt-service payments. l Restore a clear and close connection between interest rates on government securities and the demand and supply of other financial assets. l Reduce other distortions, such as the MLAR that has been used to finance excessive government borrowing. The main elements of the plan are: l Holders of treasury bills will be offered the option of converting their bills into :&ructuring bonds of 2- to 1 O-year maturities, at fixed rates ranging from 7% percent to 10 percent, or at variable rates determined as a premium above the average 6-month deposit rate offered by the three commercial banks, currently about 5 percent. The premium would range from 1% percent to 2% percent above the 6-month deposit rate depending on the maturity of the bond. In addition, the authorities have offered the banks a bonus of 15 basis points for bonds of all maturities if they are taken up before April 23,1999, and an additional bonus if 75 percent of treasury bill holdings are converted to fixed rate bonds. Once a yield curve has been established, the authorities intend to link interest rates on the variable rate bonds to treasury bill rates. l If holders elect to retain the short-term treasury bills, the government will continue to roll these over at the current interest rates of 6 percent, unless a decrease is warranted by market conditions. l The MLAR will be lowered from 40 percent to 7% percent and will be redefined to exclude the restructuring bonds and treasury bills. * The CBS1 advances, to the government, which had been frozen at about SI$75 million, will be converted to short-term treasury bills, with the interest rate to be determined through an auction process. The authorities have reiterated their commitment that the government will not borrow from the CBS1 in 1999. l Bokolo bills will be phased out with the auction of treasury bills, and the new securities will become the main instrument for managing liquidity in the banking system. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 17. Persistent high inflation in the Solomon Islands has resulted largely from the expansionary fiscal policy of the past, a generally passive monetary policy and structural problems which dampen domestic competition8 Exchange rate management geared to a real effective exchange rate target may also have contributed to inflation, because of the absence of an effective nominal anchor. While the current level of competitiveness remains adequate, the mission noted that pegging the currency to a basket of trading partner currencies will only be successful if fiscal and monetary policies are geared toward bringing inflation down toward the trading partner levels. The authorities agreed that monetary policy should aim to bring inflation down to 7-8 percent in 1999, with a medium-term inflation target of 3-4 percent, and that the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBS1 would be used as the intermediate target to guide monetary policy with a view to achieving a significant deceleration in the growth in credit in 1999. An indicative monetary program with benchmarks on the net international reserves (NIR) and the NDA of the CBS1 was developed 81n addition, it is likely that there are serious shortcomings in the measurement of inflation.

Institutional strengthening to improve the availability of accurate and timely , information on key macroeconomic variables is critical to sound macroeconomic management.’ The authorities intend to give this reform program the highest priority until a fully restored fiscal accounting and budget control system is firmly in place and domestic capacity is built up to operate this system. Given the difficulties experienced by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in performing its functions, the authorities noted that, as a first step, the responsibilities for compiling the national income accounts would be transferred to the CBS1 and that technical assistance would be requested to improve the central bank’s production of macroeconomic statistics. To improve the efficiency of the NSO, the authorities intend to set monitorable “output” targets for iis activities and review its organizational structure. 19. In the forestry sector, the mission noted that the recent changes to the tax system, whereby the basis of duty determination had been shifted to official reference prices rather than the price declared by the seller, are intended to prevent abuse. However, given the considerable scope for leakages through misclassification of logs, and the absence of pre-shipment inspection services, the authorities intend to monitor log exports more closely pending full implementation of the AusAID-funded Forestry Management Project. The authorities will also undertake a thorough review of the forestry taxation regime, in light of the recently completed study funded by the World Bank, with a view both to raising additional revenues and to using the tax regime to reduce logging to sustainable levels. 20. On privatization, the mission noted that the incipient sale of the government’s share of SIPL is a promising start. The authorities are taking steps to resolve the outstanding issues with respect to Telekom with a view to proceeding with iis sale as early as possible. More generally, the authorities recognize the need to persevere with privatization efforts, in part to ensure timely disbursement of AsDB funds, while also focussing attention on reforms relevant to privatization, such as regulation of the power and shipping sectors. 21. On financial sector reforms, the government recognized the urgent need to strengthen the CBSI’s supervision capability so that it can take on the responsibilities accorded to it under the new Financial Institutions Act. Given that two of the three commercial banks are branches of Australian banks and the third is a subsidiary of the Bank of Hawaii, the immediate need for enhanced CBS1 supervision relates to the Development 9A summary of the ke y statistical issues and problems is contained in Annex II.

A review of, and measures to strengthen, the corporate governance structures of the NPF is also to be undertaken. Finally, the authorities agreed that the window of opportunity presented by the recent collapse of the pyramid schemes would be used to take strong preemptive actions, to prevent their recurrence, including through public awareness campaigns, and strengthened legislation to enable punitive action against such schemes in the future. 22. The current land tenure system is a major obstacle to private investment. The government intends to give priority to early reforms in this area that would allow for greater domestic and foreign private sector investment to stimulate economic diversification. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 23. Since late 1997, the new SIAC government has been implementing a reform program designed to correct several years of weak economic and tinancial management which, compounded by the recent events in Asia, resulted in a deep financial crisis. Progress has been made in regularizing the public finances, improving the relationship between the government and its creditors through a reduction in arrears together with efforts to remain current on debt-service obligations, increasing interest rates, and rationalizing the forestry sector. 24. The staff welcomes the efforts that the government made last year to redress Solomon Islands’ macroeconomic imbalances. Especially commendable was the government’s resolve to stay the course with arrears reduction and debt-service payments in 1998 despite cash flow constraints and a weaker-than-anticipated economic environment. 25. The planned tight fiscal policy stance for the second consecutive year in 1999, ’ together with the commitment to raise revenue targets so as to keep revenues unchanged as a share of GDP, remain current on debt-service and arrears payments, and avoid recourse to domestic borrowing, is appropriate to fully restore confidence in the management of public “The DBSI accounts for less than 1 percent of the assets of the financial system (including the NPF) and is estimated to have nonperfonning loans equivalent to 20 percent of total loans outstanding. The DBSI does not compute risk-weighted capital ratios, but has an unweighted capital asset ratio of about 24 percent. A 5 percent general provision is maintained. “The World Bank is arranging technical assistance to strengthen the CBSI’s supervision capacity.

In this connection, the completion of the government’s retrenchment exercise and- - implementation of the customs reform plan are particularly important. 26. The staff also welcomes the government’s plans to reactivate the treasury bill market which will serve to restore the ability of the central bank to actively use monetary policy to reduce inflation, restrain private sector credit growth and support the , current level of external competitiveness, which the staff considers to be adequate at the present time. The recent conclusion of negotiations on a debt-restructuring arrangement that ensures affordability to the budget and reestablishes market-related interest rates on treasury securities is a key step toward these ends. The staff also supports the reduction and redefinition of the minimum liquid asset ratio to prevent its abuse as a captive source of government financing and to reduce the “tax” on financial intermediation, but urges the authorities to be vigilant in monitoring the liquidity situation so as not to jeopardize their monetary policy objectives. The indicative monetary program will serve as a guide to liquidity management through the treasury bill auctions. 27. Notwithstanding these policy improvements, the period immediately ahead is likely to continue to be difficult and fraught with challenges. In particular, there are several downside risks to government revenues and therefore, there is a clear need for heightened vigilance. In this regard, the staff strongly supports the authorities’ decision to maintain the expenditure reserve fund. In contrast, the failure to make progress on inland and nontax revenues is a matter of concern. Accordingly, the authorities’ decision to place the highest priority on accelerating their work in this area is welcome. Equally critical is the preparation of concrete plans for contingency revenue measures that can be implemented during the coming year, should revenues fall short of targets. 28. Another important challenge will be to build on the process of reducing Solomon Islands’ vulnerability to shocks and to promote economic diversification by achieving a critical mass of structural reforms. The priority that has been given to forestry sector reforms is particularly important, and the staff urge 3 strong implementation so as to prevent a recurrence of the unsustainable logging practices of the past, as log prices recover. The staff also welcomes the government’s emphasis on privatization and land tenure reform, aimed at clearing impediments to greater private sector participation in the economic development. The authorities’ enhanced commitment to improving statistics needs to be followed up by specific actions, and the staff would urge the government to devote the necessary resources to the task so as to reap the full benefit of the technical assistance that is being provided by various bilateral and multilateral donors. 29. Based on the efforts made in 1998 and plans articulated for 1999, the staff is of the view that the Solomon Islands government is making a major effort to address the macroeconomic imbalances that have weakened the country’s economic performance. To this end, the authorities have put in place a macroeconomic and structural policy framework for 1999 and the medium-term which in the staffs judgment, if fully and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- vigorously implemented, will serve to enhance policy credibility and bring further gains in - - economic performance and living standards. 30. The staff recommends that the Solomon Islands remain on the 24-month consultation cycle. The next Article IV consultation is expected to be concluded in early 2000.

It will be extended and replaced by strict procedures under new legislation, to be introduced in March 1999. See above. The cancellation of imperative and non-operating licenses is underway, while the introduction of new forestry legislation, expected in May 1999, will lay the groundwork for bringing logging back towards sustainable levels. l/ The timber control unit has been renamed the “forestry management unit,” and has had its mandate broadened.

Government finance data are ’ extremely poor. The CBS1 publishes data on the real, external, and monetary sectors in its Quarterly Review, as well as in its AnnuaZ Report. It recently began including fiscal data, although these cannot be easily reconciled with fiscal data obtained from other government sources, notably the ministry of finance. There is a Solomon Islands country page in IFS, but reporting is uneven. The last Article IV mission raised this issue with the authorities, who agreed to try to report data to the Fund on a more complete and timely basis. As a result, the timeliness of reporting monetary data has improved considerably. In recent years, the Solomon Islands has received numerous technical assistance missions from both the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), primarily in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments statistics.’ The technical assistance has identified the critical needs for improved resourcing in all areas of data collection and compilation; improved coordination between producers and users of statistics; and improved record keeping and development of compu- terized procedures in all areas of government. However, the statistical authorities note that, in the absence of a greater commitment of budgetary resources, implementation of technical assistance recommendations will remain problematic. Real sector Estimates of real GDP are available on a production basis only, and are produced with signi- ficant lags, with the most recent official data being for 1994. Moreover, the data are mostly employment-based and fail to account for productivity changes. The government does not provide estimates or projections for GDP. However, it is currently considering shifting the . functions of producing GDP statistics to the CBS1 from the NSO. Data on production of major export commodities are reported with a lag of one year, while data on employment and wages are produced with lags in excess of two years, and are quite limited in coverage. Monthly price data are produced with a relatively short lag (less than a month), but are based only on prices in the Honiara area. ‘The Solomon Islands has also received such assistance from the Asian Development Bank and other regional organizations.

The latest data published in the February 1999 issue of IFS for the accounts of the monetary authorities were for December 1998, and for the deposit money banks and nonbank financial institutions for November 1998. However, in the case of the other banking institutions, the latest data were for December 1997. Public finance The quality of the budgetary data is very weak. Data are not available in a format conducive to proper economic analysis; a system of classification based on meaningful economic or functional categories does not exist. The available data suffer from problems associated with infrequent, inconsistent, delayed, and incorrect postings. The quality of expenditure data suffers particularly fi-om these problems, with no data at all available for 1998, and there are also inconsistencies between the revenue data reported by Customs and Inland Revenue, the ministry of finance, and the central bank. Government finance statistics have not been ,reported to STA since 199 1. External sector Quarterly balance-of-payments data are estimated by the CBS1 on the basis of foreign exchange transactions reported through the banking system, and are available with a 3-month lag. However, in the absence of supplementary surveys (e.g., on foreign direct investment), such data are deficient in both detail and coverage, and are still reported in a format based on the fourth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The government external debt position is recorded on a timely basis, and is adjusted for exchange rate valuation effects. However, the data on private external debt are not reliable and data on government debt are not always consistent with balance-of-payments data on official capital flows. A technical assistance mission which reviewed the balance-of-payments statistics in June 1998 additionally identified coverage deficiencies in the identification of external debt, particularly external payments arrears, both official and private; the lack of statistics on foreign direct investment; and inaccuracies in the identification of services transactions, official grants and transfers, and other private capital flows. In addition, external debt data are not published in detail on a regular basis. The most recent balance-of-payments data reported to STA are for 1997.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: Since August 1998, the exchange rate for the Solomon Islands dollar has been determined on the basis of a relationship between the Solomon Islands dollar and a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon Islands’ major trading partners, with the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. Without cabinet approval, the central bank may make discretionary adjustments in the exchange value of the Solomon Islands dollar each month within margins of 0.5 percent above or below the middle rate prevailing at the end of the previous month. On December 15, 1997, the Solomon Islands dollar was devalued by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar. The Solomon Islands continues to impose exchange restrictions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolution 757, and which were notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - fw-NEx III VIII.

The World Bank has had a modest lending program in the Solomon Islands, with a focus on agricultural development, basic infrastructure, institution building, and human resource development. To date, the Solomon Islands has received six credits totaling US$3 1.8 million (net of cancellations). 2. Three of the projects completed were implemented in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank under a previous cofinancing arrangement between the banks. These projects provided assistance to the Development Bank of the Solomon Islands, contributed to the upgrading and maintenance of roads, and assisted the government in establishing agriculture infrastructure to support the needs of the rural community. The other three projects were targeted at upgrading basic education, including expansion of facilities and improving the quality of the education sector. Scope exists for future bank lending in human resource development and in the forestry sector (especially in the context of a structural adjustment program)* 3. Country reports on the Solomon Islands have been prepared as part of the Bank’s Pacific regional studies on energy, post-secondary education, and transportation. In 1996, the Bank completed a report entitled “Pacific Island Economies: Building a Resilient Economic Base for the Twenty-First Century,” which covered the Solomon Islands. In 1998, the Bank completed a report entitled “Enhancing the Role of Government in the Pacific Island Economies.” The report discusses how the development agenda of the Solomon Islands and other Pacific Island economies could be enhanced by improving the effectivetiess of govemment activities through reducing the scope of government, improving spending patterns, and having in place efficient budgetary processes. 4. Following Solomon Islands’ ongoing financial difficulties, the government recently requested assistance from the World Bank. A mission visited the country in November 1997 to conduct a rapid assessment of the economic and financial situation, and the government’s proposed Policy and Structural Reform Program (PSRP). This mission was followed up by another in March 1998 to prepare a proposed Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC, amounting to US$ 10 million) and one in November 1998 to pre-appraise the proposed operation. The focus of the SAC will be on reforms to strengthen the financial sector, promote sustainable forest management and private sector development, and improve the delivery of health, education, and social services.

The Asian Development Bank started its operations in the Solomon Islands in 1974 and has so far provided 16 concessional loans from the Asian Development Fund and 42 technical assistance (TA) grants totaling US$8.96 million. The loan projects have been in the agriculture and fisheries, transportation, finance, power, water supply and sanitation, and port projects and on the institutional development of government ministries and public agencies, particularly the executing agencies of Bank-financed projects. 2. During 199&97, no new operations were initiated by the Bank because of the govemment’s arrears on debt repayments. In 1998, with the clearance of overdue loan payments to the Bank, lending and TA operations in the Solomon Islands resumed. In August 1998, the Bank approved a US$25 million policy-based program loan to support the government’s Public Sector Reform Program. The program loan finances major adjustment costs associated with the reform program, particularly the clearance of government arrears to external and domestic creditors, and separation payments for civil servants to be retrenched. The first tranche of the loan equal to US$15 million was disbursed in November 1998. The Bank also approved a US$l million technical assistance (TA) loan to enable the govemment to obtain expert advice on the privatization of its public enterprises. In 1998, the Bank also provided US$900,0.00 in TA grants for policy formulation and implementation. 3. Bank operations in the Solomon Islands are basically guided by the Operational Strategy for Pacific Island Developing Member Countries, which was approved and adopted in 1995. Project processing is undertaken by the Pacific Operations Division (POHQ) in the Bank’s headquarters in Manila, while project implementation is undertaken by the South Pacific Regional Mission (SPRM) located in Port Vila, Vanuatu. POHQ and SPRM are the two operational units under the Bank’s Office of Pacific Operations.
