Low world prices for gold and cotton, the poor 1998 cotton harvest, the weak export performance owing to the economic crises in Asia and Russia, the slow progress on structural reform, and an over-valued exchange rate have put pressure on the balance of payments and increased inflationary pressures in the economy. Nevertheless, positive economic growth has been maintained. The authorities responded to the unfavorable external environment by a further administrative tightening of access to foreign exchange, other import controls, and increased foreign borrowing at high costs. Macroeconomic policies were characterized by a fairly tight fiscal stance (excluding quasi-fiscal activities for which no precise information is available) but relatively easy monetary conditions, while the authorities resisted major adjustments to the official and commercial bank exchange rates. As a result, the spread between these rates and the curb market exchange rate widened dramatically. Modest progress was made in structural reform. Key Policies Issues In view of the deteriorating economic situation, it is the authorities’ intention to change policy course next year, including to introduce current account convertibility for the sum by the end of 2000. However, a detailed program of policy measures is still to be elaborated. The staff representatives emphasized that such a program would need to address, in addition to the establishment of a unified exchange rate, liberalization of the foreign exchange and trade system, price liberalization, and structural reforms in the agricultural, enterprise and banking sectors. As regards macroeconomic policies for 2000, it is important that monetary policy, while taking into account the direct price effects from the envisaged exchange rate unification, be kept appropriately tight to set the stage for rapid disinflation once the necessary relative price adjustments have taken place. It will also be important to adopt an appropriately tight fiscal stance. While some redistribution of real income will be inevitable as a consequence of exchange rate unification, budgetary measures will be needed to mitigate the resulting social and other consequences. Such assistance should be carefully targeted. While the authorities envisage Fund assistance for their program for 2000, the staff representatives explained that use of Fund resources would only be possible after a monitoring period which is needed to establish a track record of satisfactory policy implementation.

A mission’ visited Tashkent during October 25November 8,1999 to conduct the 1999 Article IV consultation discussions? The mission met with Mr. Hamidov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Macroeconomics and Statistics, Ms. Saidova, Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Azimov, Minister of Finance, Mr. Ganiev, Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, Mr. Golishev, State Advisor to the President, Mr. Mulladjanov, Chairman of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan, and other senior officials, as well as members of the diplomatic and business community. 2. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on September 4,1998 (EBlW98/94). At that time, Executive Directors noted that Uzbekistan had suffered a milder cumulative contraction of GDP than other CIS countries in the years following 1991, in large measure benefiting from favorable initial conditions. While welcoming the restoration of growth in 1996 and its continuation in 1997, Executive Directors expressed concern that the slow pace of reforms would undermine medium-term growth prospects. Executive Directors expressed regret at the lack of progress toward exchange rate unification, exchange and trade liberalization, and agricultural reform. They expressed the view that the use of trade and exchange restrictions in support of an inward-oriented development strategy was problematic. Executive Directors urged the authorities to strengthen their cooperation with the Fund and to supply more comprehensive, reliable, and timely data. 3. Although Uzbekistan continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, it maintains the following exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (i) foreign exchange rationing implemented through the identification of low priority goods, not eligible to receive foreign exchange from either one of the two official markets, the identification of eligible goods and importers and assignment of foreign exchange quotas, and delays in central bank approval of applications for foreign exchange; (ii) a multiple currency practice arising from the contemporaneous application of the official exchange rate (based, inter alia, on the preceding week’s auction exchange rate) and the current auction rate; (iii) a multiple currency practice arising from the segmentation of the exchange market, resulting in deviations in commercial ’ The staff team comprised Messrs. Hansen (Head), Christiansen, Sun, and Prokopenlco (EP) (all EU2), Mr. Kanai (PDR), Mr. Sundgren (Consultant), Mr. Chemov (Interpreter, BLS), Ms. Manapsal (assistant, EU2), and Mr. Alam (IBRD).

IL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS A. Political Developments 4. Parliamentary elections were held on December 5 and 19,1999. Independent candidates backed by regional governments gained wide popular support. The former communist party lost seats, but remained the largest faction, while the Fidokolor (Self- sacrificers) Party, which is explicitly endorsed by the president, became the second largest faction in parliament. However, the election programs of Uzbekistan’s parliamentary candidates and political parties show little difference and none of them opposes the government’s policies. Presidential elections are scheduled for January 9,200O. Terrorist activity, which according to the authorities has been committed or inspired by Islamic fundamentalists, has increased significantly in 1999 and has been a major preoccupation of the authorities. B. Economic Developments 5. The external and internal imbalances in the Uzbek economy worsened during 1998 and have deteriorated further in 1999 (Tables l-5 and Figure 1). Low world prices for gold and cotton, the poor 1998 cotton harvest, the weak export performance owing to the economic crises in Asia and Russia, the slow progress on structural reform, and an overvalued exchange rate have put pressure on the balance of payments and increased inflationary pressures in the economy. Nevertheless, it appears that the positive economic growth of the past three years (although, as discussed below, probably less than indicated by official data) has continued in 1999, mainly because of a very good wheat harvest and an increase in the cotton harvest from the record low of 1998.3 The authorities responded to the unfavorahle external environment by a further administrative tightening of access to foreign exchange, other import controls, and increased foreign borrowing at high costs.’ Fiscal policy (excluding quasi-fiscal activities) has been kept fairly tight over the past two years, but credit policy (including directed credits) was eased gradually during the second half of 1998 and has remained relatively loose during 1999. 3 Based on the (upward biased) official figures for the first three quarters of 1999, the staff representatives estimate real GDP growth of about 4 percent for the year as a whole, or somewhat lower than the official estimate of 4 l/z percent. 4 Developments in the exchange and trade system since the last Article IV consultation are described in detail in the accompanying report on Recent Economic Developments.

As a result of generous wage increases and expectations of a depreciation of the sum in the wake of the Russian crisis, inflation picked up in late 1998 and remained high in 1999. Owing to technical deficiencies in the compilation of price data, the official consumer price index has not adequately reflected the extent of price increases over the past two years. As shown in Box 1, inflation measured by alternative indicators appears to have been considerably higher than indicated by the official CPI.5 Price controls have also contributed to keeping measured inflation below underlying inflation. Inflationary pressures instead led to shortages of goods subject to price controls and a marked widening of the spread between the controlled exchange rates and the curb market rate.6 Box 1.

The sharp decline in exports in 1998 (22 percent) was accompanied by an even sharper contraction of imports (28 percent) owing to the authorities’ administrative measures.’ As a result, the current account deficit (baaed on officially recorded imports) was fairly modest (less than ‘/z percent of GDP) in 1998 compared with 4 percent of GDP in 1997. The capital account was characterized by low direct investment inflows and evidence of capital flight.* Foreign borrowing by the government directly or through commercial banks with a government guarantee rose significantly, and gross official reserves remained unchanged at about US$ 1.2 billion between end-l 997 and end- 1998. With the compression of imports in 1998, the import coverage of reserves increased from 3.7 months at end-1997 to 5.2 months at end- 1998. The balance of payments pressures continued into 1999, forcing the authorities into arranging commercial borrowing at high costs.g The decline in exports has continued in 1999 as has the compression of imports, and the current account deficit is expected to widen slightly to more than 1 percent of GDP for the year as a whole. Because of the significant amount of foreign borrowing and increased import compression, gross official reserves are expected to increase to almost US$1.3 billion by the end of the year (i.e. to nearly 6 months import coverage). However, the reserve coverage of debt service obligations is projected to decline significantly. lo 8. The stance of fiscal policy has been fairly tight over the past couple of years according to offkial data. However, the budget excludes a number of quasi-fiscal activities (most notably directed lending and the implicit taxation of exports and subsidization of imports through the distorted foreign exchange regime) for which no precise estimate is available. Furthermore, official data are not presented according to internationally accepted definitions, resulting in an under-estimation of the budget deficit. The staff has collected ’ Both export and import prices fell sharply, leading to a deterioration in the terms of trade as well as contributing to the decline in the dollar value of exports and imports. * It is possible that part of what is characterized as capital outflows constitute unrecorded imports. ’ The proceeds of one of these loans, US% 150 million, arranged through the National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity, were transferred to the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU). In the monetary accounts, this loan has for analytical purposes been imputed as a CBU liability. The loan is a trade financing facility with a maturity of 3 % years and an interest margin of 325 basis points above LIBOR. Commitment and participation/upfiont fees were 2 12.5 basis points and the risk insurance premium 350 basis points. lo Projected debt service payments for 2000 will correspond to about 70 percent of the projected end- 1999 stock of gross international reserves. The corresponding ratios were 37 percent and 46 percent, respectively, for 1997 and 1998.

According to official data, the budget deficit in relation to GDP was about 2 percent in 1998, or significantly lower than budgeted (3 percent of GDP). The better- than-expected fiscal performance was due to higher revenues, mainly profit taxes, because of higher-than-expected inflation, while expenditures were kept to the budgeted level. During the first 9 months of 1999, a similar pattern was recorded notwithstanding 20 percent and Box 2. Uzbekistan: Alternative Measures of the Fiical Balance (In percent of GDP) 1998 Actual 1.

However, non-priority expenditures have been strictly controlled, and revenues have performed better than expected partly because of higher-than-expected inflation and partly because of an increase in a number of excise tax rates. For the year as a whole, the budget deficit is expected to be less than 1 percent of GDP, i.e. significantly lower than budgeted.” The stock of tax arrears remained stable at less than 1 percent of GDP during the first 9 months of 1999.

The main source of financing for the budget is borrowing from the CBU, which according to the approved budget can amount to 1 percent of GDP. Privatization receipts, which were expected to provide a significant amount of budget financing in 1999, have been negligible. 9. Monetary policy became increasingly expansionary during 1998 and has remained loose in 1999. The CBU expanded credit rapidly during the second half of 1998, although there were clear signs that velocity was increasing in the wake of the Russian crisis (Figure 2). At the same time, the CBU restricted its sale of foreign exchange in order to meet the authorities’ target of rebuilding reserves, which had declined significantly earlier in the year. As a result, reserve money grew rapidly (Box 3). However, the money multiplier declined, mainly owing to an increase in the currency to deposit ratio, and broad money expansion was more moderate than the increase in reserve money. Credit to the economy expanded by just over 70 percent during 1998 with more than half of the loans consisting of on-lending of government-guaranteed foreign borrowing. The increase in monetary aggregates slowed down somewhat during the first three quarters of 1999 as the authorities offset part of the credit expansion through foreign exchange sales. Nevertheless, monetary policy remained fairly easy, as evidenced by the continued negative real interest rates and the large depreciation of the curb market exchange rate. Box 3.

The authorities have continued to resist major adjustments to either the official or the commercial bank exchange rates in response to the changing external environment. The official exchange rate, which is used mainly for government transactions and imports of high-priority capital goods, and the commercial bank rate were allowed to depreciate (against the U.S. dollar) by slightly more than inflation during 1998 (Figure 3). In contrast to these two administered rates, the exchange rate in the illegal curb market depreciated sharply after August 1998. At the end of July 1998, the curb market rate was nearly 90 percent higher than the official rate, whereas by the end of the year it was more than three times the official rate. During the first 9 months of 1999, the depreciation of the official rate continued to be slightly more than innation, while the commercial bank rate was allowed to depreciate by approximately double the official rate. The spread between the curb market rate and the officially controlled rates widened further during this period. While the real effective official exchange rate has appreciated significantly since the middle of 1998, the real effective indicative rate has depreciated by about 33 percent between the second quarter of 1998 and the third quarter of 1999. l3 C. Structural Reforms 11. There has been’ little genuine progress with restructuring agricultural enterprises, although most farms notionally operate as private enterprises. The World Bank agricultural project that would liberalize the policy environment on a trial basis for individual farms in several “rayons”(includiig the introduction of a new cotton procurement system) continues to experience delays, and presentation to the Bank’s Board has been postponed. These delays are attributed to the reluctance on the part of the authorities to deregulate the policy environment, especially in what was seen as a critically important year for cotton production. 12. The authorities have taken steps to speed up the privatixation of banks and enterprises, but with limited results so far. Thus, plans by the authorities to accelerate the privatization of state-owned banks have been significantly delayed, and no bank met the (admittedly unrealistic) July 1999 target for privatization. l4 The authorities are currently r3 The real effective rate is calculated using INS weights and the GDP deflator as a measure of price developments in Uzbekistan. The indicative rate is a weighted average of the official exchange rate (30 percent), the commercial bank rate (40 percent), and the curb market rate (30 percent). I4 A presidential decree of October 2, 1998 had required that government ownership be reduced to no more than 50 percent in any bank-except for the National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity, where the ceiling is 60 percent - by July 1, 1999.

Another resolution” announced the government’s intention to privatize, with the support of a World Bank loan, numerous medium and large enterprises, including 69 in which 100 percent of the shares will be made available to foreign investors. Reaction from foreign investors has been very cautious and so far none of the enterprises has been privatized. l6 III. POLICY DIKUSSIONS A. Current Issues and Program Outline for 2000 13. The authorities admitted that the economic situation is becoming worrisome, but blame this on the low world prices for cotton and gold rather than on the economic strategy followed since late 1996. They emphasized that all foreign borrowing and the use of international reserves since 1996 were for investment purposes rather than for consumption and increased Uzbekistan’ s long-term export potential and reduced the need for imports. The staff representatives pointed out, however, that the present distorted system had severe economic costs, including expanded scope for rent seeking and corruption,” and urged the authorities to change policy course. 14. The authorities confirmed that it was still their intention to introduce current account convertibility by the end of 2000 as had been announced by President Karimov. However, a final decision on the timing and the detailed measures would not be taken until after the presidential election in January 2000. Also, the authorities were not willing to discuss at this stage what kind of exchange rate regime they envisaged following exchange rate unification. The staffrepresentatives emphasized that, given the uncertainty concerning the equilibrium exchange rate, it would be advisable, at least initially, to adopt a flexible regime following unification. In preparation, the authorities have undertaken serious technical analyses of the economic consequences of the envisaged introduction of current account convertibility. The Fund’s resident representative is a member of a working group established to prepare plans for convertibility, and he has provided extensive assistance to the group. During the mission the authorities were genuinely interested in the stafPs assistance, with the result that data sharing and cooperation with the staff were much improved compared with previous missions.

As regards the introduction of current account convertibility, the authorities were of the view that this would only be possible if there were a comfortable level of international reserves and assurances, from the outset, that financial support would be provided by international financial institutions and bilateral creditors. The staff representatives explained that, in light of Uzbekistan’s track record on cooperation with the Fund, financial assistance from the Fund could only be expected after a monitoring period, during which the authorities consistently implement understandings reached with the staff. In response, the authorities said that, in this case, they would have to rethink their strategy and would likely have to slow down further the process of introducing current account convertibility. Nevertheless, the authorities were interested in the statI’s views on the measures that would be needed to achieve current account convertibility and their consequences, especially in terms of social costs. 16. The staff representatives emphasized that the program for 2000 would need to be comprehensive enough to address the basic economic distortions which had emerged over the past few years. The program would need to address, in particular, liberalization of the foreign exchange and trade system, price liberalization, and structural reforms in the agricultural, enterprise and commercial banking sectors. Fiscal and monetary policies, while taking into account the liberalization of prices and the exchange market, would have to be kept appropriately tight to set the stage for rapid disinflation once the necessary relative price adjustments had taken place. 17. In the area of exchange rate policy, the staff representatives expressed understanding for the gradual liberalization process envisaged by the authorities. Such an approach would give the authorities the opportunity to prepare the supporting measures properly. With respect to sequencing, the staff suggested that the curb market be legalized early on in the process and that private exchange booths be allowed to establish freely the cash rate for foreign exchange. The restrictions on obtaining cash for current account transactions should be loosened substantially, perhaps by allowing free conversion up to a certain annual limit per person with bona fide documentation. Similarly, commercial banks should be allowed to determine freely the rate at which they buy and sell foreign exchange, although supply and demand would initially be influenced by the surrender requirement and the system of import licenses and foreign exchange quotas, respectively. At the same time, the size of the official exchange market should be reduced significantly and be eliminated completely by the end of 2000. Other exchange and trade policy measures recommended by the sttiare described in Box 4. 18. The authorities agreed that price liberalization would be an essential component of the reform program for 2000. They pointed out that significant progress had already been made in reducing the number of monopoly products and monopoly enterprises subject to control. Further steps were planned in this direction with the aim of encouraging competition and limiting controls to a short list of goods produced by natural and other monopolies. As regards energy prices, the authorities agreed that it was important to keep them in line with world market prices at the unified exchange rate. They also agreed to increase gradually Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Box 4.

According to the government’s schedule, full cost recovery will be achieved for housing maintenance in 2001 and for heating and hot water in 2004. 19. As regards reform in agriculture, the authorities remain cautious, in particular with respect to the cotton sector. The stafFencouraged the authorities to work closely with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to speed up reform, with particular emphasis on phasing out the state order system in order to increase the amount of cotton and wheat that can be sold at world market prices. It would be equally important to allow free entry into cotton processing and marketing, both for local and international firms. 20. In the area of privatization and enterprise reforms, the authorities were disappointed that there had been slow progress in case-by-case privatization. In part this was due to the complexity of the process, but the authorities admitted that Uzbekistan’s Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- reputation among foreign investors, especially because of the existing foreign exchange and trade restrictions, had also played a role. In this context, the staffrepresentatives pointed out the need to improve the business climate for private and newly privatized enterprises, and recommended that a thorough review be made of the bureaucratic obstacles at both the central and local levels to the establishment and operation of private business. Equally important would be improved transparency of laws and regulations and of their implementation. 21. Several steps have been taken to improve bank supervision in recent years, but further measures are necessary, including greater transparency of the supervision process. The authorities agreed that special diligence needs to be shown in the period ahead because several banks could be adversely affected by the impact of exchange rate unification. As shown in Box 5, the health of the banking sector in Uzbekistan appears to be fairly sound, Box 5: Financial Sector Vulnerability In recent years, Uzbekistan has pursued a strategy of supporting selected enterprises by providing government guarantees on domestic and foreign loans. While government guarantees for loans in domestic currency (directed credit) predate the current import substituting strategy, more recently such loans have been more narrowly focused in aid of this strategic objective. Between the end of 1997 and end September 1999, the stock of government- guaranteed external debt increased by US% 1.4 billion to USS3.9 billion. Ofthis amount, USS 1.7 billion (44 percent) was channeled through commercial banks (primarily the National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity). Commercial bank lending relies heavily on government guarantees. In addition to the guarantees on external borrowing, the government guarantees about 36 percent of loans in domestic currency. In total, about two-thirds of the loans currently extended by commercial banks are guaranteed by the government. The commercial banks often cite this figure as evidence of the quality of their portfolios. OEcial statistics (see below) indicate that over 95 percent of commercial bank loans are rated as either of “good” or “standard” quality. Oovernment- guaranteed loans are automatically classified as being of good quality. The fact that the share of assets falling into these two categories increased slightly during the year in which the Russia crisis hurt many Uzbek enterprises raises some questions about the veracity of the ratings. Classification of Commercial Bank Assets in Uzbekistan (Fkreent of total assets) Classification December 31,1997 December 31,1998 Good 94.8 93.3 Standard 2.9 5.0 Sub-standard 1.8 1.3 Doubtful 0.3 0.2 Bad 0.2 0.2 The authorities are currently assessing the impact of the introduction of current account convertibility on the ability of enterprises to service their loans, but have not yet reached any conclusions. Officials of the CBU have stated that the issue of possible default on government-guaranteed loans is not a matter of concern for the commercial banks, but rather for the Ministry of Finance Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- as indicated by the low share of doubtfi.rl and bad loans. This is explained mostly by the fact that no less than two-thirds of all bank loans are government guaranteed (and explicitly or implicitly government directed) and, fi-om the point of view of commercial banks, carry no risk. However, the government guarantee may need to be activated following a significant devaluation of the official exchange rate. The authorities agreed that addressing this issue, and cleaning up the balance sheets of commercial banks, would be necessary before the government’s plans to privatize banks can be successfblly implemented. In this context, the staffrepresentatives pointed out that it would be essential to eliminate the practice of directed lending and the restrictions on cash withdrawals by individuals and enterprises. B. The Macroeconomic Outlook for 2000 22. Based on a hypothetical path for exchange rate unification next year, the mission formulated a macroeconomic framework for 2000 which it discussed with the authorities (Tables l-5).‘* The authorities took note of the framework and pledged to take it into account when they revise their macroeconomic program for 2000 early next year, but they had no substantive comments at this stage. The framework assumes that the authorities will implement a program next year along the lines described above, resulting in unification of the exchange rates by the end of 2000 with most of the adjustment taking place after mid- year. It also assumes that unification would take place at a level consistent with a small depreciation of the real effective indicative exchange rate during the year. This implies significant real depreciation of the official and commercial bank rates, but some real appreciation of the curb market rate compared with the projected end- 1999 rates (Figure 4).” As a result, prices are expected to increase by about 40 percent during 2000.20 It is expected that the adoption of the reform program will lead to some easing of the foreign exchange constraint and that the growth rate would be only moderately lower (3 percent) than that expected for 1999 (4 percent). The staff representatives emphasized the uncertainty concerning the level at which the exchange rates will unify at the end of 2000 and the need for flexibility of policies in the event that the paths toward unification and the level of the unified rate were to turn out differently than assumed. ‘* Taking into account seasonal@, macroeconomic targets were also established for the first quarter of 2000. ig Since the time of the mission, the curb market exchange rate has depreciated much more than expected. However, the calculations have not been adjusted for this deviation. 20 The pass-through of the exchange rate changes into prices is calculated based on the weights of the goods in the CPI whose prices are affected either by the official or by the curb market exchange rates.

The monetary policy framework for 2000 assumes a significant increase in velocity.21 With a small increase in net international reserves, and credit to the government of about 1 % percent of GDP (of which 1 percent from the CBU), sum-denominated credits to the rest of the economy would decline slightly in real terms during the year. However, it is expected that this decline will be more than offset by on-lending through the banking system of foreign credits. 24. A budget has already been adopted for 2000 in the August 1999 session of parliament, but it will have to be revised since it does not assume exchange rate unification. It is therefore based on inadequate macroeconomic assumptions, including 5 percent growth of real GDP and 18 percent inflation. The authorities explained that this was a notional budget determining the main parameters and that a revised budget will be presented to parliament early in 2000. The staff representatives, in cooperation with the authorities, made a preliminary revision to the budget based on the hypothetical path for exchange rate unification and the macroeconomic framework described above. As shown in Box 6, this mechanical adjustment of the budget will result in an improvement in the budget deficit in relation to GDP compared to the non-liberalization scenario. However, no allowance has been made for the compensation for the social costs of exchange rate unification or for the possible costs of temporary assistance to enterprises that would face difficulties because of the depreciation of the official exchange rate. As shown in Box 6, preliminary calculations show that such costs could amount to 1 ‘/z percent of GDP.” The staffrepresentatives emphasized the importance of strictly targeting any compensatory assistance. The World Bank intends to work closely with the authorities on social safety net issues and to help them improve the delivery of social assistance. As regards the assistance to enterprises, the authorities agreed that careM consideration will have to be given to the duration and targeting of any such assistance. Finally, they also agreed that the overriding objective should be to establish a budget that would contribute to stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, which in the staE representatives’ view would entail, after allowing for the transitory costs of unification, a deficit of no more than 3 percent of GDP (on the authorities’ definition) for 2000. This should be a feasible objective, given that many sectors and enterprises would benefit from exchange rate unification and would, either automatically or through changes in taxation, be in a 21 This assumption is based on the experience of other countries (e.g. Russia) following a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate, which would lead to a significant increase in prices and an intensification of inflationary expectations. The fiamework also takes into account the assumed gradual adjustment of the exchange rate during 2000. 2~ The full year costs of exchange rate unification would be significantly higher and compensatory measures will have to be included in the budget for 2001 as well. Also, if the depreciation (in real effective terms) of the unified exchange rate turns out to be larger than assumed, the budgetary costs for both 2000 and 2001 would be considerably larger.

Social Impact of Introduction of Current Account Convertibility Uzbekistan’s multiple exchange rate regime causes complicated inter-sectoral transfa and serious distortions. The uni6cation of exchange rates (on a market basis) wiIl undo these distortions and inter-se&oral transfers. In the short-term, reversals of inter-sectoral transfers will have a negative impact on those that are favored by the current system. Identifying these vulnerable groups and the magnitude of the short-run impact is critical for formulating policies and compensating mechanisms that will ameliorate the adjustment pains. The major negative impact of unification will be: . The elimination of explicit and implicit subsidies to consumers (currently prices of bread and flour, vegetable oil. sugar, and communal services are subsidized directly or indirectIy); and n The reduction in competitiveness of local enterprises faced with more expensive imported inputs and higher debt servicing costs, and the possible impact of this on the banking system. Assuming gradual adjustment of ati exchange rates toward a unitied exchange rate by end-2000 (according to the paths of the real exchange rates shown in Figure 4), it is estimated that the costs of unitication in 2000 will be about 1.5 percent of GDP. Taking into account the positive impact on the budget due to tbe depreciation of the oflicial exchange rate based on the existing budgetary framework, the total budgetary impact will be about 1.2 percent of GDP (see below).

C. The Medium-Term Outlook 25. The medium-term outlook was discussed with the authorities based on scenarios prepared by the staff. One scenario assumes that the policies for 2000 outlined above would be implemented and strengthened in the coming years (Active Scenario). As an expositional tool, the sttialso presented a scenario that assumes that the authorities continue to implement policies in line with the strategy followed since late 1996 (Passive Scenario). The details of the two scenarios are described in Appendix IV. 26. Both scenarios show that Uzbekistan’s balance of payments and external debt situation is becoming worrisome. However, ifthe authorities are prepared to change policy course, the external situation would become sustainable over the medium-term. The suggested policy changes included in the active scenario are expected to generate a strong supply response, chiefly in the form of increased exports of cotton and manuf&ured goods. Also, a change of policy is likely to lead to increased capital innows from both public and private sources. The debt service ratio (estimated at about 18 percent for 1999) would stabilize at about 27 percent from 2001 onward. The debt/GDP ratio (estimated to be about 28 percent at end- 1 99gZ) would reach about 72 percent by 2002, but fall gradually thereafter. The passive scenario assumes that the authorities would be able to borrow significant amounts from commercial sources (which is why positive real growth rates and relatively moderate itiation are assumed in this scenario). Under such a scenario, both the debt service and debt/GDP ratios would very soon reach unsustainable levels and severely limit Uzbekistan’s ability to borrow abroad. Instead, the authorities would need to compress imports Cnther, and it would therefore not be possible to achieve the assumed growth rates. Also, inflation would probably be much higher than indicated in the scenario. The authorities did not comment in detail on these scenarios, but they did not disagree with the main conclusions concerning the medium- term outlook. 27. The staff also discussed briefly the medium term fiscal outlook with the authorities. Fiscal revenues have remained fairly high in relation to GDP in Uzbekistan, in part due to the slow transformation of the economy, especially in the financial sector. The authorities agreed that it was of crucial importance to strengthen tax administration, pointing out that they already had taken several steps in this respect, to prevent a significant decline in revenues once the implementation of market reforms intensifies. The staff representatives observed that, based on the experience of other transition economies, some reduction in the revenues to GDP ratio accompanied by shedding of expenditure obligations would probably 23 This ratio is calculated using the official exchange rate to convert GDP into dollars. If the indicative rate is applied, the debt/GDP ratio is estimated at about 57 percent in 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - be inevitable and even desirable in order to reduce the role of government in economic activity. The authorities responded that a reduction of the role of government over the medium term was indeed their objective and that the budget for 2000 contained several measures to reduce the tax burden of enterprises and thus represented a sign&ant step toward this aim. They were fblly aware that such a policy would require a thorough review of expenditure priorities for the medium term. D. Other Issues 28. Uzbekistan’s macroeconomic statistics continue to suffer from a number of weaknesses. As described in the accompanying report on Recent Economic Developments, there have been significant problems regarding the official consumer price and national accounts statistics. Some of the technical problems with the compilation of CPI statistics were addressed during the mission and the authorities agreed to implement the recommended technical changes as soon as possible. The staff representatives also urged the authorities to implement the changes to the national accounts statistics recommended by previous technical assistance missions from STA as soon as possible. The authorities expected to make significant progress in this respect in the near future with the assistance of an expert who had recently been assigned to Uzbekistan under a World Bank technical assistance project. Commendable progress has been made in the area of monetary and balance of payments statistics although tirther improvements are needed. However, major weaknesses remain in base data and the application of proper statistical methods. Moreover, the authorities’ efforts at public dissemination of data have been lagging. In this respect, there is an urgent need to grant the statistical office greater independence in order to depoliticize the production of statistics. The authorities currently report core economic indicators to the Fund on a regular basis.24 29. Notwithstanding the difficult external situation, the authorities claimed that there were no external payments arrears. As regards the dispute with Russia concerning the settlement of technical credits extended by Russia to Uzbekistan during 1992-94, the authorities said that they were prepared to accept some, but not all, of these credits as the obligation of the government. The staff representatives urged the authorities to settle the dispute with Russia concerning these credits as soon as possible. Regarding the status of discussions on WTO accession, the authorities explained that Uzbekistan submitted its memorandum to the WTO secretariat in September 1998, which was passed on to all member countries in November 1998. Bilateral market access contacts have been initiated but little progress has been made. 30. Although Uzbekistan faces numerous environmental problems, the most pressing by far is the degradation of irrigation water and agricultural land. After years of 24 Statistical issues are described in Appendix III. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - unsustainable land and water use policies, irrigation water has become highly saline and contaminated with agricultural chemicals. Poorly designed and maintained drainage systems have caused widespread salinization of the soil and water logging. Many areas, especially those that are furthest downstream, have experienced reduced yields or become non-arable. As the amount of irrigated land has increased, the volume (and quality of water) in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers has decreased, which has reduced the flow of water to the Aral Sea. As a consequence, the area, volume and quality of the Aral Sea have decreased dramatically. 31. With respect to Y2K issues, officials at the CBU advised that two tests of the financial system’s preparedness have been completed and that some problems were discovered, particularly in the areas of report preparation and computation of interest earnings. Most commercial banks participated in the most recent test. The authorities have replaced all outdated computers and updated software in the CBU and major commercial banks and are confident there will be no major problems. An emergency plan has been prepared and was evaluated by an outside expert in December 1999. Officials at the Ministry of Finance advise that at least two Y2K compliant computers have been distributed to each department and that the remaining computers are being updated. E. Future Cooperation with the Fund 32. The authorities recognize that it would not be possible to introduce current account convertibility next year without cooperation with and support from the Fund. It is their intention to invite a mission to Tashkent during the first quarter of 2000 to discuss the authorities’ plans for the introduction of current account convertibility, which were expected to be announced following the presidential election. The stafF representatives emphasized that it would be important that such a mission take place before the program was final&d and adopted by parliament, so that the staff could get involved in the elaboration of the specific policy measures and help formulate the macroeconomic program for 2000. m. STAFF .kPPRAISAL 33. The economic imbalances in the Uzbek economy have worsened since the last Article IV consultation, and the balance of payments and external debt situation is becoming increasingly worrisome. While the authorities blame these developments on the unfavorable external environment, in particular the low world prices for cotton and gold, in the stag’s view, the economic strategy followed since late 1996, and in particular the distorted exchange rate system, is as much to blame for the unfavorable economic developments. The authorities’ strategy was directed at maintaining economic growth despite the external problems, which initially required a drawdown of reserves and later on heavy reliance on external foreign borrowing. This policy option is no longer available to the same extent as before. 34. Accordingly, the Uzbek authorities now face an important policy choice. They could continue the current strategy. However, the present distorted system has already inflicted significant macroeconomic costs and given rise to severe governance problems, including rent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - seeking and corruption. A continuation of such policies would, in the stai?‘s opinion, exacerbate the economic costs and result in either an unsustainable external debt situation or low growth and high inflation over the medium term. Instead, the staff urges the authorities to adopt a comprehensive economic reform program that addresses these basic economic distortions. In addition to the establishment of a unified exchange rate, such a program would need, in particular, to focus on liberalization of the foreign exchange and trade system, price liberalization, and structural reforms in the agricultural, enterprise and commercial banking sectors. 35. The authorities are currently leaning toward the reform option and have stated their intention to introduce current account convertibility by the end of 2000. The staff understands the reasons for the gradual liberalization process envisaged by the authorities and is prepared to accept this approach, since it will give the authorities an opportunity to prepare a full range of supporting measures properly. In view of the uncertainty concerning the level at which the exchange rates will unify at the end of 2000, policy implementation will have to be flexible during the year. For the same reason, the staff recommends that the authorities adopt a flexible exchange rate regime following unification. The conclusion of the election cycle in early 2000 presents a unique opportunity to change policy course, and the staff urges the authorities to announce an ambitious and bold liberalization program as soon as feasible following the presidential election. 36. The authorities have undertaken serious technical economic analyses of the likely economic consequences of the envisaged introduction of current account convertibility. The staff was impressed by their efforts and welcomes, in particular, the inclusion of the Fund’s resident representative in this task, as well as the sharing of data and cooperation with the staff on these issues during the mission. Unfortunately, the authorities were prepared to discuss only in broad terms the policies planned for next year. Thus, if the authorities envisage close cooperation with and support from the Fund, it is important that the Fund staffgets involved in the elaboration of the specific policy measures and help formulate the macroeconomic program before they are fmalized and adopted by the government and parliament. 37. The authorities believe that it would not be possible to introduce current account convertibility without a comfortable level of international reserves and assurances from the outset that financial support would be provided by international financial institutions and bilateral creditors. The stti understands the concerns that motivate this position. However, rather than the availability of financing, the key to generating confidence among economic agents that the authorities are seriously committed to the introduction of convertibility would be, in the staffs view, that the government early on announce a timetable of measures and implement them consistently and forcefUlly. Also, it feels that the authorities’ track record on cooperation with the Fund would only just@ the use of Fund resources after a monitoring period during which the authorities consistently implement understandings reached with the staE Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - 38. As regards macroeconomic policies, it is crucially important that monetary policy for 2000, while taking into account the direct price effects from the envisaged exchange rate unification, be kept appropriately tight to set the stage for rapid disinflation once the necessary relative price adjustments have taken place. It will also be important to adopt an appropriately tight fiscal stance. While some redistribution of real income will be inevitable as a consequence of exchange rate unification and budgetary measures will be needed to mitigate the resulting social and other consequences, it would be important that the social assistance be carefully targeted and that any assistance granted to enterprises be strictly limited and timebound. 39. In the area of structural reform, the authorities have taken a number of initiatives since the last Article IV consultation, particularly regarding commercial bank and case-by-case enterprise privatization. However, the results have been disappointing for various reasons, including the difficult business climate in Uzbekistan, in particular caused by the distorted foreign exchange regime. The stafTrecommends that, in addition to the introduction of current account convertibility, steps be taken to remove the bureaucratic obstacles both at the central and local levels to the establishment and operation of private business and to improve the transparency of laws and regulations and of their implementation. As regards reforms in agriculture, the staff attaches particular importance to the phasing out of the state order system for cotton and wheat and the establishment of free entry into cotton processing and marketing, both for local and international firms. 40. The staff welcomes the measures that have been taken in recent years to improve bank supervision. However, fbrther measures will be necessary, including greater transparency of the supervision process. According to official data, the health of the banking sector in Uzbekistan is fairly sound, but this is the case mainly because a large part of loans extended by banks are government guaranteed and therefore considered to carry no risk. Many of these guarantees may have to be activated following exchange rate unification. While the staE agrees with central bank officials that this issue from a formal point of view is a matter of concern for the Ministry of Finance rather than the banking system, it would recommend that the authorities take a broader policy approach and show special diligence in bank supervision in the period ahead and carefblly analyze the soundness of banks in the context of the new exchange rate environment. It will be essential that, as part of the process of cleaning up the banks’ balance sheets, the practice of directed lending and the restrictions on cash withdrawals by individuals and enterprises be eliminated and the government’s practice of providing guarantees for commercial loans be strictly limited. 41. Uzbekistan maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval under Article VIII, as described in paragraph 3 above. In the absence of a clear timetable for their removal, the staff does not recommend their approval and would urge their speedy elimination. 42.

Exchange rate arrangements The national currency, the sum, was introduced on July 1, 1994 to replace the transitional sum coupon issued in late-1993. The conversion rate was 1,000 sum coupons to 1 sum and the initial auction-based official exchange rate was sum 6.94 per U.S. dollar. Through 1996, the official exchange rate was the auction exchange rate as determined by auctions of U.S. dollars held twice a week (daily since March 1997). Effective January 1, 1997, a system of multiple exchange rates was formally introduced. The oflicial exchange rate is set as the weighted average of the U.S. dollar auction rates from the previous week plus a discretionary adjustment in practice this exchange rate deviates only slightly from the auction rate. Official exchange rates for 30 other currencies and the SDR are established through U.S. dollar cross rates and are applied to offtcial transactions and used as accounting rates by the central bank. Until June 30, 1998, the central bank formally limited the margin at which foreign exchange bought at the official exchange rate could be sold on the official commercial bank and cash markets to 12 percent. As of July 1, 1998 the commercial bank exchange rate was officially delinked and the spread allowed to increase. As of end-August 1999, the spread was about 3 1 percent. On January 1, 1999 a 5 percent tax on foreign exchange purchases at the commercial bank market was introduced. Presently, all proceeds from so-called strategic exports (mainly cotton and minerals, accounting for about two thirds of total exports) must be surrendered to the central bank at the auction rate. In addition, 50 percent of (increased from 30 percent as of January 1, 1999) all other export proceeds must be sold to commercial banks at the commercial bank exchange rate. The central bank sells foreign exchange at the auction rate for imports of certain capital goods, raw materials, government purchases, and servicing of official or government-guaranteed external debt. In addition, it sells foreign exchange to commercial banks at the exchange rate established in that market, Commercial banks are allowed to sell foreign exchange to their customers only within a quota established by the Republican Monetary Policy Commission and only for certain imports of priority consumer and capital goods and services, These restrictions have lead to the emergence of an illegal parallel market for both cash and non-cash foreign exchange. The authorities continue to control administratively both the auction and the commercial bank exchange rate. The official exchange rate was depreciated by 46 percent during 1997,37 percent in 1998 and 23 in the first nine months of 1999. The spread between the official/auction and commercial bank market rates began to widen after July 1998. As a result, the depreciation of the commercial bank rate was 45 percent in 1998 and 40 percent in the first nine months of 1999. The premium for cash foreign exchange on the parallel market was about 100 percent over the auction rate until July 1998, but has increased significantly as the result of increased restriction on access to foreign exchange and was 400 percent as of end September 1999. The premium on the non-cash parallel market is somewhat higher.

Technical assistance Technical assistance and training have been provided by the Fund (MAE, FAD, STA, LEG, INS) to Uzbekistan in a number of areas. Bilateral donors and other international agencies, including the World Bank, the European Union, and the OECD, also have provided considerable technical assistance. Technical experts from a number of countries have accompanied Fund staff on technical assistance missions. The Fund intensified its program of technical assistance to Uzbekistan in 1994-97. However, in the past two years fewer requests for technical assistance have been received by the authorities. Additional technical assistance is needed in many areas, and follow-up technical assistance is envisaged on money and banking statistics, balance of payments statistics, and national accounts and price statistics.

Uzbekistan became a member of the IBRD and the IDA in September 1992, of the IFC in October 1993 and of the MIGA in November 1993. 2. In March 1998, the Executive Board discussed a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The current operational program reflects the intermediate scenario described in the CAS whereby the Bank would commit a relatively modest amount of financial resources (IJS%300- 350 million in ten investment operations) over FY 1998-2000. The Bank’s strategy under this scenario is to create incentives for deeper structural reforms through selected investment operations, in parallel with a continuing policy dialogue. The implementation of this scenario has, however, fallen short of expectations due to delays in project preparation including outstanding Government actions, and it is expected that only 6-7 projects totaling US$2 13- 228 million will have been approved for FY 1998-2000. 3. The triggers for a low-case scenario would be the disintegration of macroeconomic stability and lack of agreement on key policy interventions. Under this scenario, the World Bank would provide only a few nonlending services and operations focusing on poverty reduction and environmental problems. 4. Shifting to a high-case scenario would require implementation of broad-based policy reforms, including significant improvement in macroeconomic stabilization (as evidenced by a new IMF arrangement) and a strong structural reform program. Commitments under this scenario could increase to USSSOO-900 million, including up to three adjustment operations in support of the private sector, the financial sector, and agriculture. 5. As of August 3 1,1999 nine projects had been approved by the Bank for Uzbekistan. These are: the Institution Building Technical Assistance Loan (US$21 million, approved October 1993); the Rehabilitation Loan (US%160 million, approved March 1995 and was fully disbursed and closed in June 1996, but performance was rated unsatisfactory); the Cotton Subsector Improvement Loan (US$66 million, approved May 1995); the Pilot Water Supply Loan’ (US$5 million, approved September 1996); the Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project @X$75 million, approved August 1997); Tashkent Solid Waste (US$24 million, approved May 1998); Enterprise Institution Building Loan &IS%28 million, approved June 1998); the Health Project (uSS30 million, approved September 1998); and the Financial Institution Building Loan (US%25 million, approved May 1999). ’ This loan was subsequently subsumed under the Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project, and is now closed. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4l- 6. Disbursements for the nine projects as of November 30, 1999 totaled about US$223 million. Preparation of projects is ongoing in urban transport, agricultural enterprise restructuring, micro-credit and social investment, water supply, drainage, and pumping station rehabilitation. 7. The Bank’s nonlending activities in the past have taken the form of a Country Economic Memorandum (1993) and thematic economic and sector work focusing on subsidies and transfers (1994), social protection (1994), intergovernmental finance (1995), the financial sector (1997), and public expenditures (1998). Recently (1999) a Social and Structural Policy Review was completed. The Bank is currently helping the Government estimate the social costs of foreign exchange liberalization and develop a set of social interventions to mitigate these costs for the poorest and the most vulnerable groups in the population. The Bank is also advising the Government on competition policy reforms and has recently submitted to the Government a Policy Note on the subject. In addition, the Bank is supporting the strengthening of the statistical system, development of capacity for economic policy analysis, and institutional capacity-building for pension reforms through grants from the Institutional Development Fund.” Since 1997, the World Bank has been financing a technical assistance project at the CBU with the objective to improve banking supervision and commercial bank accounting. 8. The International Finance Corporation has invested in a joint venture bank to serve as a model for other financial institutions in Uzbekistan, in the second-stage development of the Amantaytau gold mine, and in a joint-venture leasing company. It is financing, together with Case Corporation from the United States, three interrelated projects for the manufacturing of agricultural equipment. Other IFC investments are in pharmaceuticals, furniture manufacturing, and packaging industries. At present, IFC is pursuing investment opportunities in the financial sector (setting-up of onlending facilities through local commercial banks targeting small and medium enterprises and export-oriented enterprises in the private sector), agriculture-related enterprises (a ginning operation), and consulting services (to establish an Executive Training Center to provide training courses and workshops for Uzbek managers in fields such as marketing, general management and accounting). In September 1996, IFC included Uzbekistan in its new Extended Reach Program, permitting IFC to fund projects as small as US$200,000, thereby assisting the development of small and medium enterprises. A number of projects have been identified and are being processed. MIGA has issued guarantee contracts in Uzbekistan in the amount of US$20 million, none however covering currency transfer risk.

In the area of national accounts, the Uzbek statistical authorities have made some progress in developing statistics that are compatible with SNA standards, with technical assistance provided by the OECD and the Fund and following the guidelines of the CIS statistical committee. 2. A number of deficiencies were identified by a STA mission that visited in February 1998. These include an overestimation of real GDP growth rates in past years due to a number of factors, including (i) the inconsistent treatment of informal sector activities over time; (ii) inappropriate procedures for dealing with the increased share of high value commodities with low trade margins in organ&d retail turnover;’ and (iii) the use of the downward biased consumer price index as a deflator for trade activities and subsidies. While the staff has made an independent estimate for the 1997 results, the data base is insufficient to prepare estimates for the preceding years. For 1998, adjustments to official data are still under discussion. Serious problems also persist at the level of primary data, which continue to be collected and processed following statistical methodologies of the former centrally planned economy. 3. Another STA mission identified a significant downward bias in the consumer price index owing to an incorrect methodological treatment of prices of all goods that are temporarily unavailable, including seasonal products. In 1997, this resulted in a major difference between official and Fund staff estimates for food price increases in the capital, Tashkent, although both sets of calculations were based on identical raw data supplied by the authorities. STA has recommended that the authorities recalculate the consumer price index from January 1997 using the correct methodology. The authorities appear to have started using an improved CPI methodology effective May 1998, but have resisted recalculating past inflation data. Since January 1999, however, differences between the offkial estimates of food price increases and those prepared by fi,md staff have again increased. 4. Further deficiencies have been identified in the methodology used to compute sectoral deflators, while no price indices for imports, exports, and investment exist. Although the authorities have made substantial progress in constructing a producer price index, the enterprise and product coverage should be expanded. ’ The Uzbek statistical authorities estimate output of retail trade in constant prices by using a volume index for total retail turnover rather than disaggregatecl retail turnover volume indices. This method does not take account of changes in the commodity structure of trade. As the share of high-value commodities with low trade margins (automobiles) increases, it results in an overstatement of growth in retail trade.

Regarding data on external trade, exports of cotton and other bulk exports are valued on a c.i.f basis rather than Eo.b., and no adjustments are made to capture informal cross-border trade and shuttle trade. Also, two parallel systems-based on customs declarations and on enterprise surveys-exist for compiling trade data. STA has recommended that the customs data be used for compiling merchandise trade statistics and that the enterprise reports be continued for collecting data on trade in services only. Government Finance 6. Detailed data on revenues and expenditures of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds are compiled by the Ministry of Finance monthly, and they are available after a processing time of about three weeks. Between missions, however, it is difficult to obtain these detailed figures. Only broad categories for revenue and expenditures of the state budget and the balance of major extrabudgetary funds are provided on a routine basis, 7. When available, detailed data on the components of state-budget expenditure are organized according to the largely functional classification. An economic classification of expenditure data is available only annually, and the quality of these data is inadequate. Detailed data on revenue and expenditure of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds often include items that should be classified as financing (e.g., credit repayments). The Ministry of Finance has started to provide occasionally data on tax and expenditure arrears. The authorities have also started to provide information on total proceeds from privatization operations. The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund for an expenditure review, but FAD has postponed indefinitely such a mission because of a lack of data provision and receptiveness to Fund advice. FAD has withdrawn prematurely a resident advisor who was to help in the establishment of a Treasury at the Ministry of Finance because of a lack of support by the authorities for his work. One of the benefits of the Treasury would have been an improvement in the compilation of government finance statistics. 8. Uzbekistan does not yet report the government finance statistics to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA). As of now, a country page in the International Finance Statistics (IFS) or Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) could not be prepared as adequate government finance data are not yet routinely reported to STA. Money and Banking 9. In March 1997, the authorities introduced a new chart of accounts for the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) and commercial banks. A money and banking statistics mission in March-April 1997 assisted the CBU in developing procedures for compiling monetary statistics based on the new charts of accounts and in improving the account classifications in the old chart of accounts for use in revising historical data. The STA mission in ApriliMay 1998 provided further assistance to the CBU in recommending improvements in the procedures for compiling monetary statistics. Another STA mission in November made progress in resolving issues linked to the preparation of monetary and financial statistics for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-44- eventual inclusion in a proposed Uzbekistan page in IFS. A follow-up mission on money and banking statistics is scheduled for early 2000. Balance of Payments 10. The quality of balance of payments data remains inadequate. A STA mission that visited in February 1998, identified a number of serious deficiencies, the correction of which could be expected to lower the net errors and omissions. These relate mainly to exports of cotton, shuttle trade, transportation, direct investment and commercial and central bank transactions. For instance, trade data are revised frequently and substantially, and data on services transactions and foreign direct investment are partial or inconsistently compiled. For foreign direct investment, for example, official estimates for 1997 range from as low as USS60 million to well over US%1 billion. The authorities have implemented some of the recommendations of the mission as regards the collection of primary data outside traditional channels. They are also in the process of developing more detailed balance of payments statistics. Uzbekistan does not report any balance of payments data to STA. The authorities have expressed interest in fbrther technical assistance fi-om the Fund.

Two possible medium term outcomes are presented in a passive scenario (Table 6 and Figure 5) and an active scenario (Table 7 and Figure 5). The passive scenario assumes that the authorities continue with the strategy followed since late 1996. The active scenario assumes that the authorities implement significant policy reforms, including the introduction of current account convertibility at end-2000. The scenarios focus primarily on how policies under the two alternatives affect the behavior of GDP growth, exports, imports and foreign borrowing. This allows an assessment of the sustainability of external debt levels under the two scenarios. 2. Each scenario begins by specifying a growth path for GDP. Assumptions about import elasticities allow an estimate of imports necessary to support GDP growth. The level of exports is based on Ml?, World Bank and official projections for the prices of cotton, gold and energy, domestic supply response, and demand conditions in major export markets. Assumptions are also made concerning the inflow of foreign direct investment as well as multilateral and bilateral inflows. The targeted level of gross international reserves is assumed to be the equivalent of 5 months of imports in 2000 but gradually declines to 4 months by 2004. Commercial borrowing is assumed to fill the remaining financing gap. 3. The passive scenario assumes GDP growth of 3 percent per annum for 2000-2004, annual inflation of 35 percent, gold and cotton production constant at present levels, and that the official and indicative real exchange rates remain constant.’ On the capital account, foreign direct investment increases by 3 percent per year, net outflows under “other capital” continue at their 1999 level, and capital inflows from multilateral and bilateral sources total US$200 million and US$lOO million annually, respectively. The cost of commercial borrowing is assumed to be higher than for bilateral or multilateral borrowing. 4. In the passive scenario, the modest growth of exports, combined with low growth and small inflows of foreign direct investment or multilateral assistance, leads to a significantly increased need for external borrowing on commercial terms. (This occurs despite the continued compression of imports.) Under this scenario, the debt service ratio would rise to 58 percent in 2004, which is clearly unsustainable and would be unlikely to unfold.2 The authorities would need to compress imports even more severely than at present and/or draw down reserves. This would result in a combination of much lower growth and higher inflation than assumed in the scenario. ’ The indicative exchange rate is calculated as a weighted average of the official rate (30 percent), the commercial bank rate (40 percent), and the curb market rate (30 percent). 2 The debt to GDP ratio (measured at the indicative exchange rate) would increase from 57 percent in 1999 to 86 l/2 percent in 2004.

The active scenario assumes that real GDP growth increases during the projection period as the impact of the reforms begins to affect the economy.3 Inflation increases significantly in 2000 (45 percent on average) as the exchange rate is liberalized and prices of key consumer commodities (e.g., wheat, sugar and vegetable oil) are no longer subsidized by an over-valued official exchange rate. In subsequent years, however, inflation declines gradually to 9 percent in 2004. It is assumed that the real exchange rate is constant after unification at the end of 2000. Gold production is assumed to remain constant, while cotton production is assumed to rise to 4 million tons in 2002 in response to higher prices and remain at that level through 2004. The active scenario also assumes that foreign direct investment grows by 15-20 percent each year and that net outflows under “other capital” decline gradually over the period. Annual capital inflows from multilateral sources are assumed to increase from US!!400 million in 2000 to US$600 million in 2004 and annual inflows from bilateral sources increase by US$200 million between 2000 and 2004, respectively.4 The higher growth rates for real GDP assumed in the active scenario require higher levels of imports, but this is partly offset by increased exports due to the supply response and improved competitiveness. With the improved economic outlook the need for commercial borrowing and interest costs are lower under the active scenario than under the passive scenario. This difference is reflected in the debt service ratio, which will be only 27 percent in 2004 under the active scenario compared to 58 percent in the passive scenario. The debt to GDP ratio would reach 72 percent by 2002 under the active scenario, but fall gradually thereafter. Nevertheless, both the debt service and debt to GDP ratios remain uncomfortably high, and the authorities should seriously consider a significant reduction in their commercial borrowing. 3 Such reform measures include: (i) unification of exchange rates in 2000 and the accompanying gradual liberalization of access to foreign exchange and of the import licensing and quota system; (ii) deepening of agricultural reforms such as gradually reducing the state order system and encouraging entry and competition in the marketing of cotton and other commodities; and (iii) improvement of business climate and acceleration of enterprise reform and privatization. 4 Possible Fund purchases are not specified. To the extent that such purchases would become available (under the active policy scenario) the need for commercial bank borrowing would be reduced correspondingly. However, the signaling effect of an IMF program is taken into account in the assumed capital inflows from multilateral and bilateral sources.
