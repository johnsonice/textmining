Inflation has risen with food and energy prices, but core inflation remains subdued. In contrast to some Eastern European countries, Bulgaria did not experience core deflation during the crisis. More recently, HICP inflation accelerated in the latter part of 2010 reflecting increases in global commodity prices (Figure 3). Core inflation, also begun to pick-up from low levels. However, pressures are easing. Headline HICP inflation eased to 3.3 percent y/y in April 2011, as the effect of last year’s excise increase unwound.   5.      Unemployment doubled over the course of the downturn and remains high (Figure 4). Registered unemployment peaked at 10.3 percent in 2010, although labor force data suggest it continued to rise to about 12 percent in Q1 2011. The increase was sharpest amongst the young, where Bulgaria experienced one of the largest increases outside the Baltics. Job destruction was most severe in manufacturing, services and construction. Sharp employment reduction contributed to a 6.4 percent increase in output per worker in 2010.  6.      Prompt and sizeable fiscal adjustment helped contain the budgetary impact of the downturn. The crisis triggered a sharp decline in government revenues (Figure 5). While Bulgaria was able draw on its fiscal buffer (accumulated from past fiscal surpluses) to cushion the shock, after years of rapid growth, expenditures needed to adjust to lower revenue levels. In 2010, expenditure-led adjustment—including substantial reductions in public sector employment and capital outlays, and a wage and pension bill freeze—contained the 2010 deficit (ESA95 basis) to 3.2 percent of GDP (target of 3.8 percent of GDP).

A pension reform that raised the contribution rate, increased service period and the retirement age was also passed with the social partners’ support. The deficit was largely financed by drawdown of the fiscal reserve, which by end-2010 was almost half its pre-crisis level, and public debt remained low at 16.2 percent of GDP.  7.      Prudent regulatory policies allowed the banking system to weather the crisis well (Figure 6). On average profits remain positive and all banks have a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of over 12 percent (system average 17.7 percent at end-March). As in other countries, nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen, reaching 12.9 percent by end-March 2011. Having entered the crisis with conservative regulatory standards and high capital levels, the BNB reduced risk weights on bank capital for retail exposures and mortgages to the EU minimum which helped boost the CAR in 2010. It also relaxed its loan classification and provisioning requirement rules to reduce pressure on banks and encouraged banks to retain profits. Nevertheless, the ratio of provisions to loans of about 70 percent remains high by regional standards. With credit demand subdued—credit grew by a modest 1.3 percent in 2010—and retail deposits growing robustly (Figure 3), foreign-owned banks have reduced their reliance on parent funding. The system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen to 113 percent and the ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities stands at 30.6 percent.  8.      The non-bank financial sector—comprising insurance companies, pension funds, collective investment schemes, and leasing companies—continues to develop. Insurance companies and pension funds’ assets rose in 2010, but at 9.7 percent of GDP, they are one-tenth of banking sector assets. Even though the non-life insurance sector was severely hit by the financial crisis and registered losses in 2010, its solvency ratio remains high (187 percent at end-2010). 3503703904104304504701011121314152008Q32009Q12009Q32010Q12010Q3Foreign Banks’ Exposures to Emerging Europe’s and Bulgarian banks (Billion of US Dollar )BulgariaEmerging Europe excluding Bulgaria (rhs)90110130150170190Jan-08Jul-08Jan-09Jul-09Jan-10Jul-10Jan-11Commercial Bank Foreign Liabilities (Index, Jan. 2008=100)Sources: BNB; BIS; IMF staff estimates.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 19 Corrected: 6/27/11   losses. With the recovery still not firmly established and real estate prices yet to fully stabilize, restructured loans should be closely monitored to ensure appropriate provisioning and collateral valuation. As the recovery strengthens, the regulatory easing implemented in the crisis could be gradually reversed. The still conservative Bulgarian regulatory and supervisory regime will facilitate the implementation of the new Basel III requirements. 31.      Challenges posed by weaker banks are being firmly addressed. Weaker banks continue to be closely monitored via more frequent data reporting and supervisory visits. The supervisory colleges under the European Financial Stability Framework, has significantly improved co-operation and information flows. A sale of a Slovenian-owned bank was just completed, and a takeover of a mainly Irish-owned bank is in the pipeline. The recent crisis did not result in any liquidations or recourse to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). However the legal framework for bank resolution should be comprehensively reviewed to determine whether the BNB would have sufficient tools to address any potential bank resolutions.  32.      The loan-to-deposit ratio of the system has improved but remains high for some banks. Reflecting the strong growth in deposits over the past year, the ratio of liquid-assets to short-term liabilities has risen. Nevertheless, many foreign-owned banks continue to operate with comparatively high loan-to-deposit ratios. With liquidity often managed at the parent bank level, stand-alone liquidity of subsidiaries and branches, such as cash or eligible securities for BNB collateral funding, might not be sufficient compared with their potential funding needs in a severe adverse scenario. As demonstrated in 2009, the on-going support pledged by parents is crucial to address potential liquidity and capital needs. While all banks currently exhibit a CAR above 12 percent, the BNB continues to receive assurances from all parents that they would provide the capital and liquidity required to ensure banks are well-equipped to address potential needs. Moreover, in addition to reserve requirements, banks are required to have a 15 percent coverage ratio of deposits from credit institutions, retail and corporate customers by liquid assets, which also provides a buffer. Even in the event parent funding were to become limited, gross international reserves in excess of the minimum coverage required under the CBA represent 22 percent of banking system deposits, providing a further backstop.  33.      Contingency planning remains essential given regional uncertainty. The authorities are actively participating in discussions on the design of a soon-to-be issued European contingency planning framework and continuously improving their stress testing methodologies. The BNB and MOF are working together within the existing contingency Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 20 Corrected: 6/27/11   planning framework to prepare for the envisaged EU-wide changes, and are encouraged to expeditiously reach agreement on a back-stop to the financial system.  Authorities’ views 34.      The authorities see the banking system as well-equipped to deal with the vulnerabilities. The BNB’s stringent stress tests demonstrate the adequacy of existing buffers. The authorities stressed the importance of avoiding premature tightening when credit demand is weak, and especially as the regulatory regime remains very conservative by international standards. They also have an array of tools to deal with sudden liquidity risks. Banks’ required reserves with the BNB provide an important line of defense. Solvent banks can also temporarily draw on BNB liquidity subject to haircuts on eligible collateral according to the BNB Law and Ordinance No. 6. Even though such loans may not exceed the limit fixed by the CBA, reserves are currently well in excess of this floor and can offer a sizeable backstop to the banking system. Other back-stop mechanisms can also be used, including tools to take over a bank and sell it in line with the bank resolution framework. Moreover, their experience from the 1996/97 banking crisis, and with their crisis preparedness frameworks well tested by the events of 2008, the authorities are well equipped to act swiftly. Improvements to the bank resolution and contingency planning framework would be made in the context of on-going initiatives at the EU level. D.   Rebuilding Reserves and Fiscal Financing 35.      The CBA is the bridge to eventual Euro adoption. It has been a pillar of macroeconomic stability in Bulgaria since inflation stabilization in the late 1990s, offering a credible anchor to the economy as Bulgaria entered the European Union. Moreover, during the financial crisis, the economy has shown its ability to adjust rapidly under the policy limits imposed by the CBA, and confidence in the monetary regime remains high. Consequently, the CBA is the right instrument to guide policies until eventual Euro adoption. 36.      High international reserves support the CBA, and bolster its ability to sustain potential shocks. The fiscal reserve, comprising one-fifth of total external reserves, played a critical role in allowing Bulgaria to weather the recent crisis so well, underpinning confidence in the CBA. High reserve buffers provide Bulgaria extra resources to address shocks and ensures it is comfortably placed to meet the upcoming bond amortization payments (Eurobond repayments of about €1 billion in both 2013 and 2015). Recent drawdown of the FRA to finance the fiscal deficit has reduced reserve coverage to below 180 (at end-April 2011) from 200 percent of reserve money (at end-January 2010). Given the external risks, the fiscal reserve should now be preserved and rebuilt.  37.      A Eurobond issue in 2011, complemented by privatization and domestic debt issuance, would quickly rebuild fiscal reserves. A ‘Eurobond’ issue offers the greatest potential to quickly increase reserve coverage ratios at a reasonable cost given Bulgaria’s low debt, favorable spreads and sovereign ratings, and the current low interest rate environment.
