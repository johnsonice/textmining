A poor cotton harvest, albeit offset by a recovery of prices, an overvalued exchange rate, high and rising debt service payments, and slow progress on structural reforms put pressure on the balance of payments. Nevertheless, positive real GDP growth and relatively moderate consumer price inflation were recorded according to official statistics. However, alternative staff estimates suggest lower growth and much higher inflation. The authorities responded to the balance of payments pressures by a further tightening of access to foreign exchange and intensified import controls. Macroeconomic policies remained loose through September, but were subsequently tightened. The authorities took significant administrative steps in May and July to reduce the overvaluation of the exchange rates, but access to foreign exchange remained strictly controlled. Key Policy Issues The active policy dialogue on the establishment of a Fund-supported program called for by Executive Directors last year did not materialize. The authorities’ policy intentions remain vague and thus have not created the basis for serious discussions of such a program. The authorities continue to pursue an import substitution strategy that requires government intervention in resource allocation through a complicated system of foreign exchange and import controls, an overvalued exchange rate, and directed and government-guaranteed credits. Although affirming that they wanted to move towards market-oriented policies at a gradual pace, the authorities argued that they could only change their strategy and introduce current account convertibility if the international community were to provide large financial resources up front. While recognizing the political and economic risks of reform, the staff pointed out that a well-designed comprehensive export-oriented program that relied on liberalization of access to foreign exchange and market-based allocation of resources would not require a large amount of foreign financing. The implementation of such policies would enhance economic growth and improve the balance of payments and external debt profile over the medium term. The weaknesses of Uzbek macroeconomic statistics continue to hamper economic analysis. The’staff urged the authorities to improve their statistical methods and depoliticize the compilation, production and dissemination of statistics as soon as possible.

A mission visited Tashkent during November 6-20,200O to conduct the 2000 Article IV consultation discussions.’ * The mission met with Mr. Azimov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Macroeconomics and Statistics; Mr. Nurmuradov, Minister of Finance; Mr. Ganiev, Minister for Foreign Economic Relations; Mr. Golishev, State Advisor to the President; Mr. Mulladjanov, Chairman of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan; and other senior officials and members of the diplomatic and business community. 2. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on January 31,200O (SUR/OO/12). At that time, Executive Directors noted that imbalances in the Uzbek economy had worsened in part due to the adverse external environment. However, the economic policies followed by the government since late 1996, particularly the distorted exchange and trade regime, were also to blame. Executive Directors expressed concern that the distortions caused by the import-substitution strategy would undermine medium-term growth prospects. Executive Directors urged the government to adopt a comprehensive reform program, comprising liberalization of the foreign exchange and trade regime, price liberalization, and an acceleration of structural reforms in the agriculture, enterprise, and banking sectors. Executive Directors acknowledged the efforts made by the authorities to improve basic macroeconomic statistics, but stressed that much more work was needed in this area, particularly regarding price and national accounts statistics. Directors also welcomed the Uzbek authorities’ intention to cooperate with the staff in their efforts to introduce current account convertibility and encouraged the authorities and the staff to pursue their policy dialogue actively. 3. Although Uzbekistan continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, it maintains a number of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval. These are set out in Box 1. Taking account of the new restrictions that have been added since the 1999 Article IV consultation (iv-x in Box l), the overall foreign exchange system can be deemed to have become more restrictive and distorted in 2000. The mission informed the authorities that the staff would not ’ The staff team comprised Messrs. Hansen (Head), Zavoico, Sun, Jafarov, and van Selm (all EU2), Ms. Rendak (LEG), Mr. Chemov (Interpreter, TGS), and Ms. Manapsal (Assistant, EU2). Mr. Alam (IBRD) participated in meetings during the latter part of the mission.

Uzbekistan: Exchange Restrictions and Multiple Currency Practices Uzbekistan currently maintains the following exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4: (i) foreign exchange rationing implemented through the identification of low priority goods, not eligible to receive foreign exchange from either of the two official markets, the identification of eligible goods and importers and assignment of foreign exchange quotas, and delays in central bank approval of applications for foreign exchange; (ii) a multiple currency practice arising from the segmentation of the exchange market, resulting in deviations in the commercial bank rates vis-&vis the official rate’; (iii) a multiple currency practice arising from the imposition (since January 1999) of a five percent tax on the purchase of foreign exchange; (iv) a restriction arising from the prohibition on the purchase of foreign exchange by enterprises during the first six months of their operation; (v) a restriction on the making of advance payments to certain specified offshore territories and on the making of payments under contract for works (services) to such offshore territories; (vi) a restriction on the making of payments to nonresidents that are not party to import contracts; (vii) a restriction arising from the requirement that importers that wish to purchase foreign exchange to make an advance payment under an import contract must make an advance sum deposit in the amount of 100 percent of the advance payment, which is released only after the importer presents to the bank a certified original of the document confirming that the goods have actually been imported; (viii) a restriction arising from the imposition of a ceiling on the amount of interest and other payments provided for in loan contracts with nonresidents that can be paid in the fWillment of such legally valid loan contracts (a maximum of 20 percent per annum of principal outstanding); (ix) a restriction on the amount of foreign exchange which residents may purchase for the purpose of making invisible payments; and (x) a restriction arising from the stipulation that restricts the amount of foreign exchange that can be purchased by nonresident individuals to the amounts earlier exchanged for sums, I I ’ A separate multiple currency practice identified in the 1999 Article G consultation relating to the contemporaneous application of the official rate and the auction rate was on the occasion of the 2000 Article IV consultation judged to be part of the general segmentation of the exchange market. I I II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 4. The macroeconomic situation remained difficult in 2000 (Tables l-5 and Figure 1). A poor cotton harvest, low gold prices, an overvalued exchange rate, high and rising debt service payments, and slow progress on structural reforms put pressure on the balance of payments. In response, the authorities tightened access to foreign exchange and intensified import controls, leading to a fkther compression of imports. Macroeconomic policies remained loose through September.

The economy continued to operate on the basis of the explicit and implicit redistribution of resources from the energy, mineral, and state order-driven cotton and wheat sectors to favored industries (e.g., large-scale chemicals and automobiles), mainly through the mechanism of distorted exchange rates and the provision of directed credit on favorable terms. The absence of genuine structural reforms continued to hamper economic growth while the loose macroeconomic policies and the distorted exchange rate regime fueled inflation expectations. 5. The staff continues to believe that official statistics (used in Tables l-5 and Figure l), which portray an economy growing at a relatively brisk pace with moderate inflation, do not give an accurate measure of true developments. As described in Box 2, alternative staff estimates suggest that positive real GDP growth may have continued in 2000, albeit at a lower rate than indicated by official statistics, while consumer price inflation was about double the official rate. At the authorities’ request, the mission agreed to use official statistics as a basis for the discussions. However, the mission also took into account the alternative estimates in the analysis of economic developments and its policy recommendations. 6. According to official statistics, real GDP grew by 4.4 percent in 1999 and 4.2 percent, compared with a year earlier, in the first three quarters of 2000; consumer price inflation was 26 percent during 1999 and 27 percent during the year to November 2000. While economic growth in 2000 suffered from poor cotton and wheat harvests due to bad weather, this was partially offset by a satisfactory performance elsewhere in the agricultural sector. Inflation in 2000, as in the past, has largely been determined by developments in the curb market exchange rate. The appreciation in the curb market exchange rate that accompanied expectations that the foreign exchange regime would be liberalized contributed to a fall in year-on-year CPI inflation in the first half of 2000. When it became clear that such liberalization would not happen, the depreciation of the curb market rate resumed in July, which, combined with generous wage increases in August (50 percent) and loose monetary policies, resulted in an acceleration in inflation in August and thereafter. 7. The balance of payments remained under pressure throughout 2000. Exports declined only slightly in 2000, since the impact of the poor cotton harvest (which in any case will be felt mainly in 2001) was more than offset by an upswing in prices. Also, the temporary easing of restrictions on the export of fruits and vegetables in July, together with the recovery of the Russian economy and improved competitiveness from the real depreciation of the official exchange rate, helped boost sales of selected non-traditional Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- I Box 2. Uzbekistan: Alternative Measures of CPI and Real GDP I The official consumer price index and real GDP data have not adequately reflected the extent of price increases and economic growth over the past few years. The major reasons are, as mentioned in last year’s staff report, technical deficiencies in the compilation and computation of price and national accounts data and the politically sensitive nature of consumer price and real GDP statistics. Based on technical assistance recommendations from the IMF and other providers, on which there has been insufficient follow-up by the authorities, the mission reestimated consumer price and national accounts statistics for the period 1998-2000.” As indicated in the table below, the revised estimates show lower, albeit still positive, growth of real GDP and much higher consumer price inflation than official data. Also, as shown in Figure 2, the revised data correspond better to other economic indicators than official statistics.

P act on import demand of price A small surplus was registered on the capital account for the first nine months of the year-due in part to prepayments for the 2000 cotton crop-and this permitted gross international reserves to rise to US$l,360 million at end-September 2000. However, gross international reserves declined significantly in October and November and are expected to fall to about US$ 1.1 billion by the end of the year (5 % months import coverage). Also, outstanding external debt continued to climb, and the gross reserve coverage of future debt service payments deteriorated further in 2000.6 The staff was not able to obtain information on the outstanding stock of short-term debt. The authorities claim that there is no short-term government and government-guaranteed debt. 8. On the basis of official data (adjusted to IMF definitions), the stance of fiscal policy has been relatively tight over the past several years and was further tightened in 2000. However, fiscal accounts exclude quasi-fiscal activities that play a major role in the Uzbek economy but for which no precise estimates are available.7 The budget deficit for 2000 is expected to decline to about 1 percent of GDP, from about 3 percent of GDP in both 1998 and 1999. According to the authorities, this was mainly due to better-than-expected revenue performance arising from the impact of inflation on indirect taxes (which offset another year of decline in direct taxes). Increases in excise tax rates and in energy prices, together with some expenditure cuts in the social sector, also contributed to the smaller-than- expected deficit. The stock of tax arrears declined to 0.3 percent of GDP at end-September 2000, following efforts at strengthening tax administration8 The Ministry of Finance shifted its sources of financing in 2000: it repaid significant amounts of treasury bills and relied 4 The impact on traditional exports (in particular cotton and gold) of the real depreciation of the official exchange rate was minimal, since the devaluation gains were not passed on to producers. ’ Import compression was achieved through a mix of non-tariff barriers and trade and foreign exchange restrictions, including the withdrawal of a substantial number of foreign exchange licenses for importers of consumer goods. 6 Projected debt service payments in 2001 are estimated to increase to 93 percent of expected end-2000 gross reserves. The corresponding ratios were 44 percent and 75 percent in 1998 and 1999, respectively. 7 The quasi-fiscal activities include directed lending and the implicit taxation of exports and subsidization of imports and other payments abroad (mainly debt service) through the distorted foreign exchange regime. 8 The authorities claim that there were no wage and other expenditure arrears in the budget or that offsets have been used in the execution of the budget.

Monetary policy was relatively loose in 1999 and through the summer of 2000, but has since been tightened significantly. The CBU expanded credit in late 1999 and early 2000 to finance wage payments-including wage arrears-in the run-up to the January 2000 presidential election. This was followed by substantial government borrowing from the CBU during the first half of 2000 and a sharp increase in NIR related to prepayments for cotton in the third quarter. Accordingly, monetary aggregates expanded rapidly through September 2000 (Box 3), which resulted in a decline in velocity compared with the previous year (Figure 3).’ At the same time, the CBU refinance rate was progressively reduced and by midyear had become severely negative in real terms. Broad money grew somewhat less rapidly than reserve money; the modest decline in the money multiplier was largely due to an increase in the reserve-to-deposit ratio as banks found it increasingly unattractive to place excess reserves in the low-yielding treasury bills. The CBU recognized the risks posed by the rapid growth in monetary aggregates and began to tighten monetary policy in October, primarily by selling foreign exchange to mop up liquidity released through the financing of the cotton cycle. The CBU refinance rate was also raised modestly in November, but it still remains negative in real terms (when measured at an appropriate inflation rate). Box 3.

The government took significant administrative steps in May and July 2000 to reduce the overvaluation of the exchange rates. However, the exchange rate regime continues to be restrictive and the curb market remains very active. After years of different official and commercial bank exchange rates, the govemment unified the two rates at the substantially more depreciated commercial bank exchange rate on May 1, an action that entailed a step-devaluation of 55 percent. Thereafter, the authorities continued their policy of gradually depreciating the new official rate. On July 1, two new exchange rates were introduced: (i) a commercial bank exchange rate applicable to imports of consumer goods for license holders and the non-surrendered part of the receipts fi-om non-centralized exports; and (ii) a cash exchange rate to apply at exchange bureaus.” These two new exchange rates were set at the same level and close to the then prevailing curb market exchange rate (see Box 4 for further details of the exchange rate regime). The regulations stipulated that the commercial bank and exchange bureau exchange rates were to be determined by supply and demand. In fact, however, the rate has been set administratively by the CBU and marginally adjusted only once in 2000.” In the curb market, the sum appreciated modestly during the first half of 2000 as it was widely expected that access to foreign exchange would be liberalized from midyear. However, as it became clear that access to foreign exchange would remain strictly controlled, the sum began to depreciate again in the curb market after mid- July. The spread between the official exchange rate and the curb market exchange rate, which had been reduced from nearly 400 percent at end-1999 to 159 percent on July I, 2000, widened to 172 percent at end-December 2000 (Figure 4).12 11. The program of structural reform has essentially stalled. The government’s ambitious program of large-scale privatization announced in November 1998 has not resulted in any sales, mainly because the business environment remains difficult and little change is in prospect. Nevertheless, the government continues to work on a broad-based privatization program that includes major banks and enterprises in the cotton and oil and gas sectors. The government raised energy prices significantly in February and August to bring them closer to world market levels. Some restrictions on the operations of commercial banks were also relaxed, including the limit on opening more than one account by enterprises and on cash withdrawals by individuals in certain situations. The state order system for cotton and wheat remains in place. No progress has been made in establishing a treasury system. However, a lo Although all commercial banks were permitted to buy foreign exchange on the exchange bureau market, only four banks were permitted to sell foreign exchange on this market. ‘I In early November 2000, the rate for cash transactions was depreciated from sum 675/US$ buying and sum 69O/uS$ selling to sum 690/W% buying and sum 724S/US$ selling. However, the commercial bank rate was not adjusted, thus creating yet another separate administratively determined exchange rate. l2 Appendix I of the accompanying report on Recent Economic Developments gives a more detailed description and analysis of the foreign exchange regime.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Current Issues and Policy Measures Envisaged for 2001 12. The active policy dialogue on the establishment of a Fund-supported program called for by Executive Directors last year did not materialize. Instead of pursuing a policy dialogue, the authorities requested that a mission visit Uzbekistan in June 2000 with the limited purpose of providing technical assistance on assessing the social and economic consequences of exchange rate unification. On that occasion, the mission assessed positively the changes made to the foreign exchange system during the opening months of 2000, but it pointed out that additional measures would be needed to ensure successful liberalization. Only a few of the mission’s recommendations were fully implemented. 13. In the policy dialogue during the recent Article IV consultation discussions, the authorities were vague concerning future economic measures and the timetable for their implementation and thus did not create the basis for serious discussions of a Fund-supported program any time soon. The authorities’ overall strategy continues to be based on import substitution, emphasizing importation of advanced machinery and technology to produce new competitive output. To implement this strategy, they allocate resources to key sectors through foreign exchange and import controls, an overvalued exchange rate, and directed and government-guaranteed credits (from both domestic and foreign sources), in many cases at subsidized interest rates. Although affirming that they wanted to move towards market-oriented policies at a gradual pace, the authorities were reluctant to commit to specific measures in the near future. They argued that they could only change their strategy and introduce current account convertibility if the international community were to provide large financial resources up front (a “stabilization fund”). The mission pointed out that there were few, if any, cases where an import-substitution strategy had produced long-term positive results. It was, however, unsuccessful in convincing the authorities that a well-designed export-oriented liberalization program that relied on market- based allocation of resources would not require a large amount of foreign financing. It pointed out that such a strategy would enhance growth and improve the balance of payments and external debt profile over the medium term. 14. The authorities emphasixed that the steps already taken in 2000 attested to their commitment to reform, and they confirmed their intention to unify exchange rates in 2001. The mission acknowledged that some of the measures taken by the authorities so far were steps in the right direction. However, the measures fall short of what would be needed to liberalize the foreign exchange market and enable Uzbekistan to accept soon the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement, a key goal set out in President Karimov’s post-election reform program. The further measures envisaged by the authorities Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- for the immediate future, while welcome, were very modest steps toward liberalization.13 The authorities’ policy of progressively unifying exchange rates in an administrative fashion- although contributing to reducing the distorting effect of the multiple exchange rate system- did not constitute genuine liberalization, which would only occur when access was broadened to all agents requiring foreign exchange for current account payments. Furthermore, to ensure unification of all exchange rates (including the curb market rate), market forces should be allowed to freely determine exchange rates. 15. The authorities were, however, reluctant to commit themselves to a specific timetable for the unification of exchange rates. They pointed out that such a unification, with the attendant further devaluation, carried considerable political and economic risks. The troubled political situation on the southeastern border was one factor. The need to provide for an adequate social safety net for vulnerable groups and demands for financial assistance to enterprises and banks that would be hit by the devaluation were the main economic concerns. The authorities argued that the effective mitigation of these risks was their main priority and that this, as well as the need to provide financing for intervention to prevent an overshooting of the depreciation of the exchange rate, would require substantial financial assistance from the international community. The size of the assistance would need to be elaborated, but early estimates by the authorities suggested that it may be in the order of US$500- 1,500 million. The authorities asked for technical help from the Fund staff to further elaborate and identify these costs. The mission pointed out that estimates of the impact of unification had already been made at the time of the last Article IV consultation and had been updated in June and again during the current discussions. These calculations showed that the budgetary costs of liberalization would be manageable provided that the social assistance was limited to the vulnerable segments of the population and any assistance to enterprises and banks was limited and temporary (see Box 5). Exchange rate unification would mainly lead to a redistribution of resources which would now be explicitly recorded in the budget. Moreover, some of the adjustment had already taken place in 2000 through the devaluation of the legal exchange rates (especially the ones applicable to basic consumer goods). Furthermore, the international reserves of the CBU were sufficient to support a liberalization strategy and prevent an overshooting of the depreciation of the exchange rate. Nevertheless, the mission agreed to help the authorities recalculate the costs of exchange rate unification in the coming months. I3 These measures include: (i) granting permission to all banks to sell foreign exchange early next year (the number of banks permitted to sell foreign exchange was increased from 4 to 14 in early December 2000); and (ii) lifting modestly the current limit on cash foreign exchange purchases by individuals early next year and an easing of the documentation requirements.

Uzbekistan: Costs of Exchange Rate Unification for 2001 Uzbekistan’s multiple exchange rate regime results in a complicated web of inter-sectoral transfers and distortions. The liberalization of the exchange rate regime, which would result in the unification of exchange rates (on a market basis), would undo these transfers and distortions. It would have a positive impact on those that currently suffer implicit taxation and a negative impact on those favored by the existing system. The identification of the gainers and losers in this process is critical for the formulation of policies and compensating mechanisms that will ameliorate the adjustment pains. It will also help establish the approximate revenues from the gainers that could help finance official compensation payments. The major negative impact of unification will be: The elimination of explicit and implicit subsidies to consumers (currently prices of bread and iour, vegetable oil, sugar, and communal services that are subsidized directly or indirectly); and . The reduction in competitiveness of local enterprises faced with more expensive imported inputs and higher debt servicing costs, and the possible impact of this on the banking system. l! Assuming the gradual adjustment of all exchange rates toward a unified exchange rate by mid-2001 (according to the paths of the real exchange rates shown in Figure 5), it is estimated that the net costs of unification in calendar year 2001 will be about 0.4 percent of GDP-excluding support to enterprises. l!

The mission agreed that a gradual, but consistently implemented, program of reform could be a viable option for the future. However, in light of Uzbekistan’s track record on cooperation with the Fund, financial assistance could only be expected after a monitoring period. During such period, the authorities would need to implement a consistent reform package that provided for a phased liberalization of the exchange rate regime and moved the economy convincingly in a free-market direction. At the same time, fiscal and monetary policies would need to be appropriately tight to set the stage for rapid disinflation once the exchange rate stabilized. 17. With respect to the strategy needed to introduce current account convertibility, the mission emphasized that exchange rate unification in itself will not achieve this goal. It would need to be accompanied by genuine liberalization of access to foreign exchange for all current account transactions as well as a dismantling of all exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval. In this context, the mission pointed out that the recently adopted resolution “On the Program of Localizing Production of Articles and Materials with the Use of Local Raw Materials for a Period up to 2005”14 is inconsistent with such a liberalization strategy. It will intensify the import substitution strategy and will necessitate continued import and foreign exchange restrictions. The authorities denied that the resolution would have such consequences. The aim of the resolution was to expand cooperation between enterprises of various industrial sectors and encourage the efficient use of credit and foreign exchange resources. The mission also expressed concerns about the decision to channel imports of key consumer goods (e.g., sugar, vegetable oil, tea) through the recently established centralized import agency “Ozoziqovqatta ‘minot”, since such centralization of imports would impose quantitative limits on legal imports, narrow product choice, and provide further opportunities for rent seeking. The authorities, on the other hand, regarded the establishment of this agency as an important step in the liberalization of the foreign exchange regime. The current licensing system for importers of consumer goods would be abolished and enterprises would be free to tender for imports through the import agency. In their view, the centralization of imports of key consumer goods would be necessary in order to ensure smooth supply and enforce minimum quality standards. 18. The mission emphasized that, while the introduction of current account convertibility should be a central part of the economic reform agenda for 2001, the reform program should be comprehensive enough to address the fundamental distortions currently characterizing the Uzbek economy. It argued that an ambitious l4 The resolution reiterates the Uzbek authorities’ philosophy of import substitution, which is justified by a need to secure self-sufficiency and employment.

Such a program would also help reduce opportunities for rent seeking and corruption. The most important structural measure would be to phase out the state order system for cotton and wheat in order to quickly pass on the full devaluation gain to producers, which would improve incomes of farmers and thus provide them with adequate incentives to raise output and improve productivity.” In this context, the mission noted that the gains from the devaluation in 2000 had not been passed on to cotton farmers through a proportionate increase in producer prices, thus increasing economic hardship in rural areas. The authorities had no immediate plans to reform the state order system. However, some modest progress is being made to increase the amount of irrigated land made available to private farmers on a leasehold basis. It is intended to provide leases without any restrictions on the crops to be grown or where the production could be sold. Also, the authorities continued work on a broad-based privatization program that would include the cotton sector. 19. It is diffkult to assess the soundness of the commercial banking system in Uzbekistan. Although all commercial banks met their prudential requirements at end- September 2000, this is mainly because the vast majority of loans are government guaranteed and thus carry zero risk weighting in the calculation of capital adequacy (see Box 6). The authorities claimed that so far there had been limited impact on commercial banks’ lending portfolio of the significant depreciation of the official exchange rate in 2000. However, as the gradual devaluation of the official exchange rate was expected to continue, it seemed likely that more enterprises and banks would face difficulties in the period ahead. The mission urged the authorities to carefully analyze the balance sheets of banks and enterprises to assess their viability in the context of a liberalized foreign exchange system. The further depreciation of the official exchange rate could potentially lead to widespread difficulties for the corporate sector to fulfil1 its debt obligations with associated ripple effects on the financial system. In turn, given the prevalence of government loan guarantees, public sector finances could be severely burdened. The mission also urged the CBU to arrange to have its balance sheet for 2000 audited by an international auditing firm. The Chairman of the CBU said that a contract would be signed shortly, l5 Reforms of the cotton sector will be particularly important from a macroeconomic perspective, given the significance of this sector in the Uzbek economy. Cotton accounts for more than 40 percent of total crop production and 6-8 percent of GDP. Cotton is also the major source of foreign exchange, accounting for about one third of export receipts.

Uzbekistan: Financial sector Vulnerability Uzbekistan has consistently pursued a strategy of supporting selected enterprises and sectors by providing government guarantees on domestic and foreign loans. In total, more than three-quarters of the loans extended by commercial banks were guaranteed by the government at end-September 2000. However, there has been some reduction in the share of new loans that has been extended with government guarantees (both for foreign currency and sum loans) over the past year. Commercial banks rely heavily on government guarantees to maintain capital adequacy ratios at acceptable levels. Official statistics (see below) indicate that nearly all commercial bank loans are rated as either of “good’ or “standard” quality. Government-guaranteed loans are automatically classified as being of good quality. The modest decline in the proportion of loans classified as “standard” or higher during 2000 reflected the impact of the May and July devaluations on enterprise operations.

B. Macroeconomic Policy 20. The authorities admitted that the economy displayed weaknesses in a number of sectors, but did not regard the situation as worrisome. Shortfalls in cotton production were expected to be reversed in 2001~through diversion of water resources from wheat and rice production to cotton-and progress on import substitution was expected to give some relief to the balance of payments. The official forecast for real GDP growth was an acceleration to 4.5 percent and a reduction in the CPI inflation rate to 16 percent. The mission argued that the deficiencies in the official statistics on both GDP and CPI made them a poor guide to recent and prospective developments. Alternative indicators suggested that growth in 2000, although still positive, was somewhat weaker and inflation much higher than suggested by official statistics. Taking the deteriorating performance in 2000 as a base, the mission pointed out that a sharp reduction in inflation combined with an acceleration of growth were very unlikely, even if underlying policies were to change dramatically in 2001. 21. The authorities described the main themes of their macroeconomic policy, which featured the adoption of a modestly restrictive stance to support the goal of eventual unification of exchange rates. The authorities foresaw a fiscal deficit for 2000 of about Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - 1 percent of GDP (% percent of GDP on the authorities’ definition). On the basis of the official forecast for growth and inflation together with a mid-year wage increase of 30 percent, the authorities budgeted a fiscal deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP for 2001 .16 The timetable for exchange rate unification within this framework remains ambiguous. With the exception of a reduction in the corporate profit tax rate to spur enterprise activity (from 3 1 percent to 26 percent), no major tax or expenditure initiatives are expected. However, to reduce reliance on bank financing, the formal cap on CBU credit to the government will be reduced from 1 percent of GDP in 2000 to ‘/z percent of GDP in 2001. The balance is supposed to be financed through non-inflationary sources, mainly privatization revenues. The authorities are cautious in relying too much on treasury bill financing as they regard the high interest rates that are needed to make this instrument attractive as an excessive burden on the budget. The authorities took note of the budget estimates prepared by the mission on the basis of alternative macroeconomic projections, but did not provide detailed comments on the results. 22. The authorities intended to pursue a tight monetary policy. After having acquiesced in rapid monetary growth through September, the CBU planned to substantially reduce monetary aggregates during the fourth quarter of 2000. The main mechanism envisaged was sales of foreign exchange in both the official and commercial bank markets. As gross international reserves are a multiple of the broad money stock, this tightening could be effected with only a modest reduction in foreign reserves. The mission pointed out that a more efficient way to soak up liquidity would be to intervene in the cash market for foreign exchange, but the authorities were not willing to do so since this would require a relaxation of the access restrictions. The authorities have not yet formulated a monetary program for 2001, because of the uncertainty concerning exchange rate policy. The authorities took note of the monetary programs proposed by the mission, but did not provide detailed feedback. 23. The discussions of the outlook for 2001 were based on the assumption that the authorities would achieve their macroeconomic policy targets for end-2000. At the authorities’ insistence, the discussions were based on the official historical data rather than the mission’s alternative estimates for GDP and CPI. Even on that basis, the mission estimated that GDP growth for 2000 would be somewhat lower and consumer price inflation significantly higher than projected by the authorities. With respect to the outlook for 2001, the mission established two alternative scenarios: one based on a continuation of current policies and another assuming that exchange rates would be unified by the middle of 2001 according to the path indicated in Figure 5. Taking into account also its alternative estimates for past growth and inflation, the mission expected in both scenarios lower real GDP growth (1 percent) and significantly higher inflation than the official forecasts. Given the importance of the curb market exchange rate in price determination in Uzbekistan, inflation would be higher in the scenario based on current policies (because of the continued depreciation of the l6 On the IMF definition, this would correspond to a deficit of about 3 % percent of GDP in the baseline scenario and 4 percent of GDP in the liberalization scenario. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - curb market exchange rate over and above the depreciation of the official exchange rate) than in the liberalization scenario. In the latter instance, the curb market exchange rate is assumed to appreciate somewhat and offset some of the price increases caused by the depreciation of the official exchange rate. Moreover, as described in the medium-ten-n scenarios below, the adoption of a liberalization strategy for 2001 would set the stage for higher economic growth, lower inflation, and a more sustainable external position over the medium term than a strategy based on a continuation of current policies. C. Medium-Term Outlook 24. The medium-term outlook was discussed with the authorities on the basis of two alternative scenarios-a baseline scenario assuming unchanged policies and a liberalization scenario assuming that the government will introduce current account convertibility by mid-2001 (Tables 6 and 7). The baseline scenario suggests that growth will stagnate at about 1 percent annually over the medium term and that inflation will remain high. Existing economic distortions would only permit modest growth in exports while the demands on foreign exchange posed by debt service payments and capital outflows would require a continuation of the policy of severe import compression. The result would be current account surpluses, which would be accompanied, following an initial improvement, by a steady deterioration in the debt service ratio to 29 percent by 2005. It is very likely that before these levels of debt service were reached, access to foreign borrowing would become limited and the authorities may need to compress imports to an even greater extent than currently assumed. The debt/GDP ratio would continue to increase through 2005. 25. The liberalization scenario assumes a strong supply response that would permit a resumption of strong growth in due course and that inflation would fall into single digits by 2004. It is assumed that the authorities would follow appropriately tight macroeconomic policies and an exchange rate policy that protects the competitiveness of the economy. Although the response to the liberalization measures is assumed to be modest in the short term, the balance of payments would benefit over the medium term from a more rapid growth of exports and a build up in foreign direct investment (FDI) as confidence is established. Imports are also projected to increase over the medium term from the currently administratively compressed level, partly reflecting the purchase of investment goods that would be the counterpart of the FDI. As the resultant current account deficits are projected to be financed to a large extent with non-debt creating and official capital inflows (rather than by higher-cost commercial borrowing as in the baseline scenario) and capital outflows are assumed to be reduced, the debt service ratio is expected to start declining from its projected peak in 2002 (29 percent) to reach sustainable levels by mid-decade (14 percent in 2005). The debt/GDP ratio would reach 77 percent by 2003, but start to decline thereafter although it would still be somewhat higher by 2005 than in the baseline scenario. The authorities did not comment in detail on these scenarios, but they did not disagree with the main conclusions concerning the medium-term outlook.

Uzbekistan’s macroeconomic statistics continue to suffer from a number of serious weaknesses, especially in the areas of national accounts, the CPI, and fiscal data, which hamper the analysis of economic developments. These weaknesses relate to problems with the source data, the application of proper statistical methods, and political interference with the disseminated data. The mission urged the authorities to implement the recommendations of technical assistance missions as soon as possible and repeated the recommendation to grant the statistical office greater independence in order to depoliticize the compilation, production, and dissemination of statistics. The authorities currently report core economic indicators to the Fund on a regular basis.17 27. A number of external sector issues were discussed. Despite the difficult balance of payments situation, the authorities claimed that there were no external payments arrears. No progress had been made in the dispute with Russia concerning the settlement of technical credits extended by Russia to Uzbekistan during 1992-94. Some modest reform of the foreign trade regime was envisaged.18 New regulations adopted at midyear had abolished the requirement that enterprises pre-register with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations as a condition for engaging in foreign trade. Also, the authorities were preparing a revision to the import tariff schedule to take effect in early 200 1, which would include a reduction in the number of tariff bands and in the average tariff rate. However, there were no plans to reduce the number of goods subject to export bans in the near future. The authorities said that they were actively pursuing Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO, including submitting a memorandum to the WTO secretariat in September 1998. Bilateral market access contacts have been initiated but little progress has been made. The next step would be for the WTO working group to visit Uzbekistan, but the timing of this visit was uncertain. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 28. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in January 2000, Executive Directors encouraged the Uzbek authorities and the staff to pursue an active policy dialogue on an economic reform program that could be supported by financial assistance from the Fund. However, the momentum for reform that had built up before the presidential election in January 2000 was quickly lost, and there were no serious discussions of a Fund-supported program during 2000. There has been little change in the non-market orientation of the govemment’s policies, and the foreign exchange market reform measures taken so far fall far t’ Statistical issues are described in Appendix III. I* Appendix II of the accompanying report on Recent Economic Developments describes in more detail the foreign trade regime, which remains very restrictive. It has a rating of “10” on the Fund’s IO-point index of trade restrictiveness, i.e., most restrictive Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public, - 27 - short of what would be needed to liberalize the foreign exchange market and enable Uzbekistan to accept any time soon the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement, a key goal set out in President Karimov’s post-election reform program. It is regrettable that the opportunity to speed up economic reform following the presidential election was not taken and that the timetable for the introduction of current account convertibility has once again been pushed into the future. 29. The staff notes the authorities’ concerns about the political and economic risks of introducing current account convertibility and their assessment of the need for large up-front financing from the international community. While recognizing the risks involved, the staff believes that a well-designed liberalization program would require only limited external borrowing to cover the budgetary costs of exchange rate unification and any need for intervention in the foreign exchange market. The financing need could be covered by quick- disbursing loans from official and bilateral creditors that would be forthcoming in the second half of 200 1 if a serious liberalization program was implemented during the first half of the year, leading to the establishment of a Fund-supported program during the summer. 30. The staff considers the foreign exchange market measures taken so far as steps in the right direction and acknowledges that the introduction of the cash market exchange rate in July was important psychologically since it implicitly recognized the existence of the curb market. However, access to foreign exchange remains strictly controlled and some of the measures taken have resulted in more segmentation of the foreign exchange market as well as in the introduction of several new exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices. While believing that a rapid liberalization would have advantages, the staff is willing to accept the authorities’ goal of gradual progress toward the implementation of reform and is prepared to participate in the elaboration of such a program, provided tangible progress is being made. 31. A key element of a reform program for 2001 would be the measures needed to introduce current account convertibility. Exchange rate unification in itself will not, contrary to the authorities’ views, achieve this goal. It has to be accompanied by genuine liberalization of access to foreign exchange and the eventual elimination of remaining restrictions on cash withdrawals of sums from commercial banks. In this context, the staff regrets the adoption of the resolution “On the Program of Localizing Production of Articles and Materials with the Use of Local Raw Materials for a Period up to 2005”. The implementation of this resolution will intensify the import substitution strategy and will necessitate continued import and foreign exchange restrictions. The staff urges the government to reconsider this strategy and to adopt an export-oriented policy based on full liberalization of access to foreign exchange for current account transactions. Similarly, the staff has concerns about the decision to channel imports of certain consumer goods through a recently established centralized import agency, since such centralization of imports appears to be inconsistent with the envisaged liberalization of foreign trade. The supply of the population with consumer goods, including foodstuffs, can be better performed by independent importers who face no access restrictions on foreign exchange purchases or other quantitative trade barriers.

While the introduction of current account convertibility should be a central part of the economic reform agenda for 2001, the program would need to be comprehensive enough to address the fundamental distortions currently characterizing the Uzbek economy. Most important from a macroeconomic perspective would be the phasing out of the state order system for cotton and wheat. Passing on the devaluation gains to farmers would significantly improve living standards in rural areas and create a constituency for reform. It will also be important to improve the environment for private enterprise and government and corporate governance. Finally, it will be essential that macroeconomic policies be kept appropriately tight in support of the intended liberal&ion of the foreign exchange system. 33. Macroeconomic policies remained too loose during most of 2000, resulting in renewed inflation pressure and a widening of the spread between the official exchange rate and the curb market rate after midyear. The staff commends the authorities for their efforts to reverse the trend in the closing months of 2000 and urges a continuation of such policies for 200 1. However, it is doubtful that the authorities will be able to tighten policies sufficiently unless they are willing to accept a significant increase in interest rates, in particular the refinancing rate of the CBU and the yield on treasury bills. The staff considers the deficit target in the recently adopted budget for 200 1 appropriate and welcomes the intention to reduce government borrowing from the CBU. It is worrisome, however, that the budget appears to be based on unrealistic macroeconomic assumptions, and the staff urges the authorities to keep budget implementation under close review and be prepared to make the necessary adjustments as warranted by economic developments. Because of the uncertainty concerning the macroeconomic situation and the envisaged exchange rate policy, the CBU has been unable to establish a detailed monetary program for 2001. Thus, it would likewise be necessary for the CBU to keep monetary policy implementation under constant review in the coming months. 34. The authorities are rightly worried about the potential impact on enterprises and banks of a further depreciation of the official exchange rate. Although the health of the banking system appears to be sound according to official data, this is mainly because the majority of loans extended by banks are government guaranteed and therefore considered to carry no risk. The staff urges the authorities to closely analyze the balance sheets of banks to assess which of them would be viable in a liberalized foreign exchange system and to take remedial measures where necessary. It welcomes the authorities’ intention to start limiting the extension of government guarantees for bank loans and strongly recommends that the practice of directed lending be phased out as soon as possible. The staff also recommends that the CBU arrange to have its balance sheet audited by international auditors for the 2000 accounting year. 35. The staff reminded the authorities of the importance the Fund attaches to member countries honoring their obligations under the Articles of Agreement to provide it with accurate and timely information. While the staff acknowledges the efforts made at the technical level to improve Uzbekistan’s macroeconomic statistics, official data continue to suffer from a number of weaknesses, particularly in the areas of consumer prices, national accounts and fiscal data, and from political interference with the production of official Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - statistics. These weaknesses complicate meaningful analysis of economic developments in the context of Fund surveillance. The staff urges the authorities to show their commitment to the production of high quality data by implementing recommendations of previous technical assistance missions in these as well as other areas. Furthermore, it urges the authorities to depoliticize the compilation, production, and dissemination of statistics, including through the creation of an independent statistical office. It would also be important that the authorities take additional measures to disseminate offtcial data to the public in a timely manner. 36. Uzbekistan maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, as described in paragraph 3 above. In the absence of a clear timetable for their removal, the staff does not recommend their approval and would urge their speedy elimination. 37. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12- month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- JO - Table 1.

Exchange rate arrangements The national currency, the sum, was introduced on July 1, 1994 to replace the transitional sum coupon issued in late- 1993. The conversion rate was 1,000 sum coupons to 1 sum and the initial auction-based official exchange rate was sum 6.94 per U.S. dollar. Through 1996, the official exchange rate was the auction exchange rate as determined by auctions of U.S. dollars held twice a week (daily since March 1997). Effective January 1, 1997, a system of multiple exchange rates was formally introduced. The official exchange rate is set as the weighted average of the U.S. dollar auction rates from the previous week plus a discretionary adjustment. In practice, this exchange rate deviates only slightly from the auction rate. Official exchange rates for 30 other currencies and the SDR are established through U.S. dollar cross rates and are applied to official transactions and used as accounting rates by the central bank. Until June 30, 1998, the central bank formally limited the margin at which foreign exchange bought at the official exchange rate could be sold on the official commercial bank and cash markets to 12 percent. As of July 1, 1998 the commercial bank exchange rate was officially delinked and the spread allowed to increase. On May 1,2000, the official exchange rate was unified with the commercial bank exchange rate at the commercial bank rate level. On July 1,2000, two new exchange rates were introduced: (i) a commercial bank exchange rate applicable to imports of consumer goods for license holders and the non- surrendered part of the receipts ‘from non-centralized exports (see below); (ii) a cash foreign exchange bureau rate applicable to cash foreign exchange transactions conducted at the authorized foreign exchange bureaus. These two new exchange rates were set at the same level and close to then prevailing curb market exchange rate. On January 1, 1999, a 5 percent tax on foreign exchange purchases at the commercial bank market was introduced. After May 1,2000, this tax applies only to foreign exchange purchases for government-guaranteed external debt servicing and licensed imports of non-consumer goods (conducted at the official exchange rate). Presently, all proceeds from the so-called centralized exports (mainly cotton and minerals, accounting for about two thirds of total exports) must be surrendered to the central bank at the official exchange rate. In addition, 50 percent of all other export proceeds must be sold to commercial banks at the official exchange rate. The central bank sells foreign exchange at the auction rate for imports of certain capital goods, raw materials, government purchases, and servicing of official or government-guaranteed external debt. In addition, it sells foreign exchange to commercial banks at this exchange rate. Commercial banks are allowed to sell foreign exchange to their customers only within a quota established by the Republican Monetary Policy Commission and only for certain imports of priority consumer and capital goods and services. These restrictions have lead to the emergence of an illegal parallel market for both cash and non-cash foreign exchange. The authorities continue to control administratively the auction exchange rate, as well as the commercial bank and cash foreign exchange bureau rate. The latter two rates were not differentiated until November 7,200O when the cash exchange rate was depreciated from Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4o- APPENDIX I sum 675/US$ buying and sum 690/X$ selling to sum 690/L&$ buying and sum 724.5/US$ selling while the commercial bank exchange rate remained unchanged. The official exchange rate was depreciated by 46 percent during 1997, 37 percent during 1998,27 percent during 1999, and 132 percent during 2000. The premium for cash foreign exchange on the parallel market was about 100 percent over the auction rate until July 1998, but has increased significantly as the result of the intensification of restrictions on access to foreign exchange and was 172 percent over the official exchange rate and 28 percent over the cash foreign exchange bureau rate as of end-December 2000. The premium on the non-cash parallel market rate is somewhat higher. Uzbekistan currently maintains the following exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (i) foreign exchange rationing implemented through the identification of low priority goods, not eligible to receive foreign exchange from either of the two official markets, the identification of eligible goods and importers and assignment of foreign exchange quotas, and delays in central bank approval of applications for foreign exchange; (ii) a multiple currency practice arising from the segmentation of the exchange market, resulting in deviations in the commercial bank rates vis-a-vis the official rate’; (iii) a multiple currency practice arising from the imposition (since January 1999) of a five percent tax on the purchase of foreign exchange; (iv) a restriction arising from the prohibition on the purchase of foreign exchange by enterprises during the first six months of their operation; (v) a restriction on the making of advance payments to certain specified offshore territories and on the making of payments under contract for works (services) to such offshore territories; (vi) a restriction on the making of payments to non-residents that are not party to import contracts; (vii) a restriction arising from the requirement that importers that wish to purchase foreign exchange to make an advance payment under an import contract must make an advance sum deposit in the amount of 100 percent of the advance payment, which is released only after the importer presents to the bank a certified original of the document confirming that the goods have actually been imported; (viii) a restriction arising from the imposition of a ceiling on the amount of interest and other payments provided for in loan contracts with non-residents that can be paid in the fulfillment of such legally valid loan contracts (a maximum of 20 percent per annum of principal outstanding); (ix) a restriction on the amount of foreign exchange which residents may purchase for the purpose of making invisible payments; and (x) a restriction arising from the stipulation that restricts the amount of foreign exchange that can be purchased by nonresident individuals to the amounts earlier exchanged for sums. ’ A separate multiple currency practice identified in the 1999 Article IV consultation relating to the contemporaneous application of the official rate and the auction rate was on the occasion of the 2000 Article IV consultation judged to be part of the general segmentation of the exchange market.

Uzbekistan became a member of the IBRD and the IDA in September 1992, of the IFC in October 1993 and of the MIGA in November 1993. 2. In March 1998, the Executive Board discussed a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The operational program during FY 1998-2000 reflected the intermediate scenario described in the CAS which was to create incentives for deeper structural reforms through selected investment operations, in parallel with a continuing policy dialogue. The implementation of this scenario, however, fell short of expectations due to delays in project preparation, including outstanding government actions, and only five projects totaling US$2 11’ million were approved during FY 1998-2000. A new CAS covering FY2001-2003 is currently under preparation and is expected to be presented to the Bank’s Board in May 2001. 3. As of December 21,2000, ten projects had been committed by the Bank for Uzbekistan. These are: Institution Building Technical Assistance (USS2 1 million, approved October 1993 and closed in October 2000); Rehabilitation (US$l60 million, approved March 1995, and was fully disbursed and closed in June 1996, but performance was rated unsatisfactory I ; Cotton Subsector Improvement (US$66 million, approved May 1995); Pilot Water Supply (US$5 million, approved September 1996); Water Supply, Sanitation and Health (USS75 million, approved August 1997); Tashkent Solid Waste (US$24 million, approved May 1998); Enterprise Institution Building (LJS$28 million, approved June 1998); Health (US$30 million, approved September 1998); Financial Institution Building (US$25 million, approved May 1999); and Urban Transport (US$29 million, approved May 2000). 4. Disbursements for the ten projects as of December 21,200O totaled about US$255 million. Negotiations for the Rural Enterprise Support Project were concluded in December 2000, and the loan is scheduled to be presented to the Board in February 2001. Project preparation is also ongoing in water supply for Bukhara and Samarkand, irrigation, and pumping station rehabilitation. ’ In the February 1998 CAS, the Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project was excluded from the FY 1998-2000 lending program since it was covered by the previous CAS (1995). 2 This loan was subsequently subsumed under the Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project, and is now closed.

The Bank’s nonlending activities have taken the form of a Country Economic Memorandum (1993) and thematic economic and sector work focusing on subsidies and transfers ( 1994), social protection (1994), intergovernmental finance (1995), the financial sector (1997), and a social and structural policy review (1999). The Bank has also approved Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants in external resources management (1992), public procurement (1996), securities market (1996), economic statistics (1998) and economic policy analysis (1999), pension reform (1998), anti-monopoly and competition policies (2000), and environmental management (2000). In addition, since 1997 the Bank has been financing a technical assistance project at the CBU with the objective of improving banking supervision and commercial bank accounting. 6. The International Finance Corporation has focused its activities in Uzbekistan in, developing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and strengthening the financial markets. SMEs have received financial assistance via credit lines through local financial intermediaries and direct investment on a selective basis. Five SME credit line facilities have been approved including two with small private regional banks. Technical assistance for pre and post investment support is being provided to SME borrowers. Other approved IFC investments are in the pharmaceutical industry, furniture manufacturing, granite processing, and cheese production. 7. In the financial sector, emphasis has been placed on the creation of a strong and competitive private banking sector. IFC has approved an equity investment in ABN-AMRO Bank Uzbekistan and a technical assistance component to two local banks to assist them in becoming more efficient and prudent financial intermediaries. Leasing activities have been a priority with assistance given to draft the law on leasing and IFC investments in two joint- venture leasing companies. A regional early stage equity investment fund is being developed by IFC and SEAF, a leading manager of small equity funds.

In the area of national accounts, the Uzbek statistical authorities have made some progress in developing statistics that are compatible with SNA standards, with technical assistance provided by the OECD and the Fund and following the guidelines of the CIS statistical committee. 2. A number of deficiencies were identified by a STA mission that visited in February 1998. These include an overestimation of real GDP growth rates in past years due to a number of factors, including (i) the inconsistent treatment of informal sector activities over time; (ii) inappropriate procedures for dealing with the increased share of high value commodities with low trade margins in organized retail turnover;’ and (iii) the use of the downward biased consumer price index as a deflator for trade activities and subsidies. While the staff has made an independent estimate for the 1997 results, the data base is insufficient to prepare estimates for the preceding years. For 1998 and subsequent years, adjustments to official data are still under discussion. Serious problems also persist at the level of source data, which continue to be collected and processed following statistical methodologies of the former centrally planned economy. 3. Another STA mission identified a significant downward bias in the consumer price index owing to an incorrect methodological treatment of prices of all goods that are temporarily unavailable, including seasonal products. In 1997, this resulted in a major difference between official and Fund staff estimates for food price increases in the capital, Tashkent, although both sets of calculations were based on identical source data supplied by the authorities. STA has recommended that the authorities recalculate the consumer price index from January 1997 using the correct methodology. The authorities appear to have started using an improved CPI methodology effective May 1998, but have resisted recalculating past inflation data. Since January 1999, however, differences between the official estimates of food price increases and those prepared by Fund staff have increased dramatically. 4. Further deficiencies have been identified in the methodology used to compute sectoral deflators, and no price indices for imports, exports, and investment exist. Although the authorities have made substantial progress in constructing a producer price index, the enterprise and product coverage should be expanded. I The Uzbek statistical authorities estimate output of retail trade in constant prices by using a volume index for total retail turnover rather than disaggregated retail turnover volume indices. This method does not take account of changes in the commodity structure of trade. As the share of high-value commodities with low trade margins (automobiles) increases, it results in an overstatement of growth in retail trade.

Regarding data on external trade, exports of cotton and other bulk exports are valued on a c.i.f. basis rather than f.o.b., and data are not adjusted to capture informal cross-border trade and shuttle trade. Also, two parallel systems-based on customs declarations and on enterprise surveys-exist for compiling trade data. STA has recommended that the customs data be used for compiling merchandise trade statistics and that the enterprise reports be continued for collecting data on trade in services only. Government finance 6. Detailed data on revenues and expenditures of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds are compiled by the Ministry of Finance monthly, and they are available after a processing time of about three weeks. Between missions, however, it is difficult to obtain these detailed figures. Only broad categories for revenue and expenditures of the state budget and the balance of major extrabudgetary funds are provided on a routine basis. 7. When available, detailed data on the components of state-budget expenditure are organized according to the largely functional classification. An economic classification of expenditure data is available only annually, and the quality of these data is inadequate. Detailed data on revenue and expenditure of the state budget and the extrabudgetary funds often include items that should be classified as financing (e.g., credit repayments). The Ministry of Finance has started to provide occasionally data on tax and expenditure arrears. The authorities have also started to provide information on total proceeds from privatization operations. The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fund for an expenditure review, but FAD has postponed indefinitely such a mission because of a lack of data provision and receptiveness to Fund advice. FAD has withdrawn prematurely a resident advisor who was to help in the establishment of a Treasury at the Ministry of Finance because of a lack of support by the authorities for his work. One of the benefits of the Treasury would have been an improvement in the compilation of government finance statistics. 8. Uzbekistan does not yet report the government finance statistics to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA). As a result, a country page in the Wernational Finance Statistics (P3) or Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) could not be prepared. Money and banking 9. In March 1997, the authorities introduced a new chart of accounts for the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) and commercial banks. A money and banking statistics mission in March-April 1997 assisted the CBU in developing procedures for compiling monetary statistics based on the new charts of accounts and in improving the account classifications in the old chart of accounts for use in revising historical data.
