Performance under the cwoaram in 1995 There were slippages in performance under the program in 1995. Real GDP growth was in line, and the public finances were better, than in the program. However, a smaller improvement in the terms of trade and lower volume of coffee exports caused by bad weather, together with insufficient tightening of monetarv oolicv, led to a widening of the external current account deficit; and credit expanded at a faster pace and private financial savings grew less than programmed resulting in a lower accumu- lation of reserves. Inflation accelerated to 11.4 percent (7 percent in the program), the colon appreciated by 7 percent in real effective terms, and the financial system borrowed abroad the equivalent of 2 percent of GDP. Also, El Salvador did not observe the December performance criteria on the net domestic assets and net international reserves, and the contracting of external debt. On structural reforms, an obligatory employment reduction program was put in place, efforts to control public expenditure and restructure the public enterprises continued, and the privatization program was given new impetus. Also, the Banking System Law was modified, and bank supervision strengthened. The coverage and quality of the data provided for surveillance was significantly improved in 1995. 2. The economic Droaram for 1996 The revised proaram for 1996 is based on real GDP growth of 4.5 percent, and seeks to reduce inflation to 7 percent. The smaller improvement in the terms of trade would result in less accumulation of international reserves and a larger external current account deficit than envisaged in the original program. As regards structural oolicies, tax administration would be improved further, the indirect instruments of monetary control strengthened, public utilities privatized, and the pension system reformed. To tighten monetarv oolicv, the authorities have reimposed reserve requirements on external borrowing by the financial system, and stand ready to increase them if needed until more permanent measures take hold; will move to market-determined interest rates through competitive auctions by mid-March; and will increase the remunerated portion of reserve requirements. The authorities’ exchanae rate oolicv for 1996 will continue to aim at maintaining the nominal value of the colon at C 8.75 per U.S. dollar. The authorities believe that part of the pressures on imports in 1995, particularly of consumption goods, stemmed from once-and-for-all factors, and are convinced that the policies supporting the program for 1996 are consistent with the present level of the exchange rate. They noted the strong performance of nontraditional and in-bond exports in 1995, and the importance of exchange rate stability for private capital inflows. In view of the corrective actions already taken, the staff supports El Salvador’s request for waivers on the observance of some performance criteria and the completion of the review.

Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and the midterm review under the stand-by arrangement, which included understandings on an economic program for 1996, were held in San Salvador during December 2-15, 1995 L/ and on February 15, 1996. y On July 21, 1995 the Executive Board approved a 14-month stand-by arrangement for El Salvador in an amount equivalent to SDR 37.68 million (30 percent of quota), which the authorities are treating as precautionary. El Salvador has no outstanding purchases from the Fund. The economic program for 1996 is described in the attached Memorandum on the Economic and Financial Policies of El Salvador (Memorandum) dated March 11, 1996. On the basis of actions already taken and the policies being pursued, the authorities have requested waivers for the observance of the performance criteria at end-December 1995 on net domestic assets (NDA) and net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Reserve Bank (BCR), and on the contracting of external debt. The 1994 Article IV consultation with El Salvador was concluded by the Executive Board on October 14, 1994 (EBS/94/91, and SUR/94/112). 3/ At that time, Directors commended the authorities for their vigorous implemen- tation of the economic program supported by the stand-by arrangement from the Fund. However, they noted that strong private demand had kept infla- tionary pressures high, and that financial policies needed to be tightened in order to achieve the program's objectives, especially for inflation. II. Recent Developments and Performance Under the Program q The economic program for 1995-96 was designed under a scenario which envisaged the eventual move to a fixed exchange rate system under a currency board or replacement of the domestic currency by dollars. The authorities' view was that, with relatively low fiscal and external current account deficits (0.5 percent of GDP, after grants, in 1994), such a regime would help reduce inflationary expectations and interest rates. Subsequently, the Government shelved these plans, in part because measures taken during u The staff team consisted of Ms. Jul (Head), Mr. Da Costa, Ms. Fichera (EP), Mr. Mikkelsen, and Mr. Morales (all WHD). u At the meeting of the Central American Monetary Council in San Jose, Costa Rica, attended by Ms. Jul. 2/ El Salvador has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. 4/ The program for 1995 referred to in this report is described in EBS/95/107 (6/28/95).

The projected accumulation of reserves reflected an improvement in the terms of trade of about 19 percent over 1995-96, and net long-term capital inflows to the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) averaging 1.4 percent of GDP a year. The coverage in dollars of the monetary base was projected to increase from 63 percent in 1994 to 77 percent in 1996, to support the move toward dollarization. To achieve the program objectives, the overall deficit (excluding grants) of the NFPS was to be reduced from 2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 0.6 percent in 1996, while public savings would increase from 2 percent of GDP to 3.4 percent over the same period. Also, credit nolicv would be aimed at maintaining external competitiveness, and structural measures deepened to increase productivity and facilitate private investment. 0 In .the event, the improvement in the terms of trade has been well below that originally foreseen, and is now projected at about 4.5 percent over 1995-96, with coffee exports expected to fall short from program projections by US$240 million (2.3 percent of GDP, or 1 month of imports), reflecting also the impact of bad weather on production. l At the same time, while the outturn for the public finances in 1995 was better than programmed, monetary policy was not tightened as needed to contain credit expansion in line with the program, and the growth of private financial savings also was below that in the program. 0 As a result, commercial banks and other financial institutions borrowed abroad the equivalent of 2 percent of GDP (US$189 million compared with a repayment of US$40 million envisaged in the program) to supplement domestic loanable funds. Performance with respect to the 1995 nrozram's main indicators was mixed (Table 1), and El Salvador observed the performance criteria for end- December 1995 2/ regarding the savings and net domestic financing of the NFPS, and on contracting of external debt with a maturity of 1-5 years (Table 2). However, it did not observe the NDA ceiling and the NIR target IJ These measures included issuing of BCR stabilization bonds in U.S. dollars, equalizing reserve requirements for foreign currency and domestic currency deposits, and authorizing interest on foreign currency deposits of more than US$5,000. 2J El Salvador observed all performance criteria for end-September 1995.

This acceleration resulted from a sharp rise in private consumption related in part to the loose credit policy, and the impact of bad weather on food prices. 0 Moreover, the windfall profits from coffee during the first half of the year and the change in expectations brought about by the announcement of dollarization, appear to have contributed also to the increase in private consumption. l Public savings rose by 1.2 percentage points of GDP to 3.2 percent in 1995, while the overall deficit (before grants) of the NFPS declined from 1.9 percent of GDP in 1994 to 0.9 percent (1.6 percent in the program) (Table 3). u l National savings declined from 15 percent of GDP in 1994 to 14 per- cent in 1995, reflecting a reduction in private savings of 2.2 percentage points of GDP. However, as private investment was in line with the program, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) widened to about 5 percent of GDP in 1995 (2.8 percent of GDP in the program). During 1995 the BCR intervened in the foreign exchange market through net sales of foreign exchange (US$38 million) to maintain the nominal value of the colon in relation to the U.S. dollar. This compares with net purchases by the BCR of US$47 million during 1994. The colon appreciated in real effective terms by about 7 percent during 1995, bringing the apprecia- tion since January 1993, when the exchange rate was pegged at C 8.7 per U.S. dollar, to 16 percent (Chart). 1/ This reflected larger than programmed contracting of project loans from the IDB by the electricity (CEL) and telecommunications (ANTEL) companies. u The overall deficit after grants amounted to 0.1 percent of GDP, with a shortfall in official grants relative to the program projections of 0.3 percent of GDP.

Central Government The overall deficit of the Central Government (before grants) exceeded the program target by 0.3 percentage point of GDP in 1995 (Table 4). J&c revenue increased by 1 percentage point of GDP, but fell short of the programmed level due mainly to the delayed implementation of laws to strengthen tax administration, u and of changes to liquor and cigarette taxes. Income tax collections rose by 0.6 percentage point of GDP mainly on account of a new withholding tax on coffee producers' incomes and the full- year impact of increases in withholding rates on income taxes paid by professionals, the self-employed, and corporations. Receipts from consump- tion taxes also rose by 0.6 percentage point of GDP, reflecting an increase in the Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate from 10 percent to 13 percent in July 1995, while import tax receipts fell slightly due to the reduction in tariffs on capital goods from 5 percent to 1 percent in April. Central government current outlavs were in line with the program in 1995. Wages were increased by 10 percent in July 1994, and by 8 percent in July -1995, with the wage bill remaining at 5.3 percent of GDP in 1995. u While outlays on other goods and services, and transfers to the public sector were lower than programmed, transfers to the private sector exceeded those projected in the program on account of drawback payments to exporters and the implementation of peace agreements. Capital outlavs were larger than anticipated in the program, but capital transfers to the private sector fell short of the programmed level be-caus-e- of-delays- in the approval of the legal procedures required to transfer lands to ex-combatants. Following a decline of 0.6 percent of GDP in 1993-94, militarv expenditure.fell further by 0.2 percent of GDP in 1995 (to 1.0 percent of GDP). b. Rest of the Dublic sector The overall position of the public enterprises was in balance in 1995 (0.7 percent of GDP deficit in the program), mainly because of a shortfall in capital outlays. Tariff adjustments in the public utilities and lower operating costs offset the effect of lower-than-projected demand on revenues. Despite an increase of 16 percent in electricity rates in July 1995 (and a 30 percent increase in May 1994), the operational surplus of CEL declined in part because of the need to rely on more expensive sources of energy (thermal) on account of a drought. Also, the operational surplus of ANTEL declined slightly in terms of GDP, with an adjustment in domestic u The "Fiscal Crime" and "Customs Violations" laws. u In July 1995 the minimum wage was increased by 10 percent to USS2.26 per day for agricultural workers, and USS4.40 per day for workers in the manufacturing sector.

The water and sewerage company (ANDA), which had raised tariffs by 24 percent in December 1994, saw its operating position worsen slightly in 1995. Capital outlays of the public enterprises declined from 1.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1.1 percent of GDP in 1995 (1.9 percent of GDP in the program). Some of the delays in the implementation of the investment projects resulted from the reassessment of plans in view of the decision to accelerate and broaden the privatization program for the public utilities. Other contributing factors included delays in the approval by the Assembly of certain loans, weaknesses in implementation capacity, and failure to comply with conditions for disbursement of some of the loans. The operating surplus of the Salvadoran Social Securitv Svstem (ISSS) remained unchanged at 0.4 percent of GDP in 1995 as an increase in contri- butions of almost 20 percent was offset by higher expenditure on benefit payments and the delivery of health services. Contributions were boosted by an increase of 10 percent in average private sector wages and of 10 percent in the number of contributors to the system. Capital expenditure of the ISSS rose sharply in 1995 (although representing only 0.1 percent of GDP) mainly on account of repairs and reconstruction of hospitals and clinics. The operating balance of the BCR shifted from a loss of 0.2 percentage point of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of 0.1 percent in 1995, as interest earnings from international reserve holdings and the loan portfolio of state owned commercial banks assumed by the BCR more than offset losses from sterilization operations. C. Structural reforms The Government continued its efforts to control nublic expenditure in 1995. The Ministry of Planning was eliminated, and a comprehensive law (the "AFI" law covering operations of the Treasury, Budget, Accounting, and Public Credit offices) was enacted in November to improve financial manage- ment and coordinate the Budget with the monetary program. In addition, the office of the Director General of Customs was restructured; the legislation referring to the "Corte de Cuentas" was modified to modernize its functions, and redirect its scope to the ex-post control of public expenditure; and the 1996 budget was presented to the Assembly in a unified form (including the budgets of the public enterprises). Also, a management unit, which started operations in January 1996, was created at the Ministry of Finance to oversee and coordinate fiscal policy to improve the budget process, making it consistent with macroeconomic targets and strengthening control over public spending, along the lines recommended by FAD. u The restructuring of tariffs in April-July 1995 resulted in an increase of 11.5 percent in telephone revenues in 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - As part of the measures to reduce the size of the Government, an oblizatorv emnlovment reduction program was approved by the Assembly in November 1995, which resulted in the elimination of 11,500 positions (8 per- cent of public employment) in January 1996. In addition, through this program about 2,500 positions (1.7 percent of public employment) will be vacated by early retirement during 1996. The Government will make efforts to cancel or freeze these positions. The restructuring of the public enterprises continued in 1995. CEL elaborated a management and privatization plan for the four electricity distribution companies, and is implementing a restructuring and reorgani- zation program which has resulted in a reduction by about 15 percent in personnel and an improvement in the efficiency of its workforce. ANTEL also reduced personnel by about 15 percent and is undertaking changes required for privatization. Restructuring at ANDA has resulted in a reduction in personnel by about 20 percent over the past eighteen months, with services such as reading of meters, connections and disconnections of water supply, and vehicle maintenance contracted out to the private sector (in some cases to former employees). On privatization, the assets of the National Coffee Institute, the National Sugar Institute, and the Salvadoran Investment Corporation were put up for sale in 1995. Also, one sugar refinery was sold, another was put up for sale, and the sale of the Mortgage Bank was initiated in November 1995 with 25 percent of the shares being offered to the employees. In addition, a large private concern invested in electricity generation, and the 96 MW plant started operations in November 1995. 2. Monetarv policy The net domestic assets of the BCR declined by C 504 million during 1995, compared with a targeted decline of C 1.2 billion (Table 5). The main factors behind this shortfall were a larger drawdown of central government deposits u and lower-than-programmed placement of BCR stabilization bonds (CEMS). In the first half of the year the BCR halted sterilization opera- tions following the announcement of plans to dollarize the economy, and through August 1995 kept the interest rate on CEMs below market levels. These actions led to an acceleration in financial system 2/ credit to the private sector from 23.5 percent during 1994 to 41 percent (about double the rate in the program) during the year through June 1995. Loans in foreign currency more than doubled (to account for 9 percent of total loans at 1/ This larger drawdown of deposits was almost offset by a larger accumulation of deposits in the rest of the financial system. In all, domestic financing to the Central Government decreased by 0.7 percent of GDP in 1995 compared with a decrease of 0.8 percent envisaged in the program. u The financial system comprises the BCR, commercial banks, finance companies, and savings and loan associations.

To control credit expansion, starting in August 1995 the BCR raised reserve requirements on public sector deposits from 30 percent on sight deposits and 20 percent on time and savings deposits, to 35 percent, and re- imposed reserve requirements on commercial banks' externaI borrowing at 10 percent in September. Also, starting in August 1995 the BCR raised interest rates on CEMs by about 4 percentage points, to 19 percent by end- December 1995. u These measures notwithstanding, the stock of bonds 3/ held by the financial system declined by C 444 million (0.6 percent of GDP) during 1995, compared with a programmed decline of C 87 million (0.1 percent of GDP). Moreover, interest rates in the financial system did not rise in line with those on CEMs and the 12-month rate of growth of private financial savings decelerated to 12.7 percent through December. A/ However, the 12-month growth rate of financial system credit to the private sector slowed to 32 percent by December 1995, still above the 24 percent increase in the program (Table 6). As regards structural reforms in the financial system, in December 1995 the Assembly modified the Banking System Law. The law eliminated the requirement that new banks have at least 50 percent of Salvadoran capital; and strengthened capital requirements and the regulatory framework by raising the risk-weighted capital assets ratio from 8 percent to 10 percent over six years. It also reduced the permissible increase in the capital base from revaluation of bank assets and of current net earnings from 100 percent to 75 percent and 50 percent, respectively; and lowered the limit on credit that could be extended to enterprises owned by banks and financial companies from 50 percent to 15 percent. In addition, new penalties against noncompliance were imposed to strengthen the enforcement capacity of the Superintendency of Banks. u Commercial banks and finance companies onlend in foreign currency the funds they borrow abroad; however, these loans are not necessarily extended to debtors generating foreign exchange. u After taking into account the tax credit on these bonds.

In December, interest rates on deposits increased by about 150 basis points, reflecting the efforts of financial institutions to window-dress their balance sheets at the end of the year. Interest rates ranged between 18-24 percent on loans in domestic currency, compared with 13.2 percent on loans denominated in dollars.

External sector The widening of the external current account deficit in 1995 reflected mainly a sharp rise in imports. The rate of growth of merchandise exports accelerated from 10.7 percent in 1994 to 22.5 percent in 1995, but fell short of the program projection of 35 percent, as coffee exports were affected by lower production caused by adverse weather conditions, and by lower unit export prices (Table 7). Also, nontraditional exports expanded by 16.5 percent instead of the 20 percent envisaged in the program because of lower shipments to markets outside the Central American Common Market (CACM). Almost half of the shortfall in merchandise exports was offset by a higher-than-programmed growth in net in-bond (maquila) exports. Private transfers (workers' remittances) were 1.0 percent of GDP higher than in the program. The 12-month. rate of growth of merchandise imoorts peaked in September 1995 at 38 percent, but slowed to 27 percent by December. The growth of imports of consumption goods almost doubled in 1995 to 31.5 percent, while imports of capital goods (including vehicles) and raw materials increased by 26.5 percent and 24 percent, respectively. In addition to the real effec- tive appreciation of the colon, the acceleration of imports, particularly of consumption goods, reflected the effect of the sharp increase in coffee prices, increased confidence, ample supply of credit at relatively low real interest rates, and unattractive yields on financial savings. Official transfers dropped sharply in 1995, from 3.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 2.2 percent, compared with 2.8 percent of GDP in the program. Also, public sector net capital inflows declined from 1.9 percent of GDP in 1994 to 0.5 percent in 1995 (1.5 percent of GDP in the program). Gross dis- bursements amounted to US$190 million compared with US$300 million in the progr=, reflecting shortfalls in balance of payments assistance of US$30 million (under the IDB Investment Sector Loan) and in project loans totaling US$SO million. To offset part of the shortfall, and to finance higher investment outlays, the Government placed short-term treasury bills l/ for US$70 million (0.7 percent of GDP) in December 1995, US$30 million of which comprised bridge financing for the IDB Investment Sector Loan now expected to be disbursed in the third quarter of 1996. Also, ANTEL borrowed US$9 million short term to bridge for a shortfall in project loans. Net external borrowing by the financial system, other than the BCR, amounted to US$189 million, with the stock of debt outstanding rising to about 3 percent of GDP at end-1995. Notwithstanding the short- term borrowing by the Government, the accumulation of NIR of the BCR fell short of the program targets by US$25 million, with the stock of reserves rising to US$935 million at end-1995, or the equivalent of 3.9 months of imports. lJ Placement of treasury bills of less than one year maturity, whether in domestic or foreign currency, does not require the approval of the Assembly.

The external debt service ratio fell from 25.6 percent in 1994 to 16 percent in 1995, as the BCR repaid all its outstanding debt in 1994; interest payments remained at about 7 percent of exports of goods and services. 4. Statistical issues The information required for surveillance has improved since the last Article IV consultation, both in terms of quality and coverage. Moreover, the unit created at the Ministry of Finance should contribute to continued improvements in the quality of the fiscal data, providing data on a weekly basis starting in mid-1996. However, the timeliness of balance of payments statistics was affected adversely by a change in the unit responsible for the preparation of the data. The mission agreed to include the operations of the pension funds in the fiscal accounts to improve their comprehensiveness, and the in-bond industries' exports and imports in the trade statistics for consistency with the BCR records. The mission updated statistics on commercial banks and financial institutions, which still show some deficiencies stemming from the transition to a simplified reporting process. III. The Economic ProPram for 1996 The economic program for 1996 seeks to correct the slippages- in policy implementation which occurred in 1995. Despite a stronger fiscal adjustment than the one envisaged in the original program and tightening of monetary policy, the smaller than-programmed improvement in the terms of trade has resulted in a downward revision of the international reserve target (by lJS$78 million over 1995-96) and a larger current account deficit in 1996. Also, GDP is expected to increase by less than envisaged originally. The revised program for 1996 is based on real GDP growth of 4-5 per- cent, and seeks to reduce inflation to 7 percent, narrow the external current account deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP, and increase NIR by US$lOO million to US$1,035 million (4.1 months of imports). lJ National savings are projected to increase by 1.4 percentage points of GDP to 15.4 percent of GDP, with public savings targeted to rise to 3.9 percent of GDP (3.4 percent of GDP in the original program). Although private savings are expected to recover in 1996 to 11.5 percent of GDP, they would still be below the 1994 ratio of 13 percent of GDP. Reflecting an increase in fixed capital formation relative to GDP in both the public and private sectors and a smaller accumulation of inventories, investment outlays are expected to increase by 0.5 percentage point of GDP in 1996 to 19.6 percent. The I/ The coverage of the monetary base would reach 75 percent compared with 77 percent envisaged in the original program.

Fiscal policy The revised fiscal program for 1996 aims at increasing public sector savings and reducing the overall deficit to the level required to attain the inflation objective, while meeting the Government's commitments to raise social, peace-related, and infrastructure outlays. Despite an increase in interest payments of 0.3 percent of GDP, public sector savings would rise by 0.7 percent of GDP. Investment outlays are projected to increase by 0.6 percent of GDP, reflecting larger outlays by public enterprises and municipalities. Thus, the overall deficit of the NFPS (before grants) would narrow from 0.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 0.4 percent; after grants the overall position of the NFPS would attain equilibrium. Notwithstanding an increase in disbursements (mainly from multilateral creditors), net foreign financing of the NFPS is projected to fall sharply in 1996 because of the repayment of the short-term debt placed in December 1995 and lower grants. However, domestic public debt would contract further by 0.9 percent of GDP. a. Central Government The central government current primary surplus would increase by 0.3 percent of GDP in 1996. Tax revenue would rise by 0.5 percentage point of GDP, with the full year impact of the increase in the VAT rate and the effects of improved tax administration more than compensating for the scheduled reduction in import duties in the second half of 1996 (see below), and a sharp drop in tax proceeds from the coffee sector. Central government current expenditure is projected to rise by 0.4 percentage point of GDP to 11.3 percent in 1996 mainly as a result of an increase in social expenditure, security spending, and interest payments on debt owed to the BCR. Transfers to the private sector also would rise substantially because of severance payments under the employment reduction program; however, the contraction in the wage bill would more than offset these payments. Central government employment is projected to decline on a net basis by about 2,500 positions during 1996, and the across-the-board salary increase scheduled for the second half of 1996 would not exceed 5 percent. The Government's commitment under the Peace Accords for the purchase and distribution of land to ex-combatants would be completed during the first half of 1996. Also, the Government would maintain military expenditure constant in nominal terms, which implies a further reduction of 0.2 percentage point of GDP in 1996. The Central Government's direct investment outlays are projected to decline by 0.5 percentage point of GDP to 1.8 percent in 1996; however, capital transfers to the private sector under the peace-related programs would rise from 0.1 percent of GDP in 1995 to 0.5 percent. In all, the overall deficit of the Central Government (before grants) would be cut by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - almost half in 1996, to 0.7 percent of GDP. With grants projected at half the level received in 1995, the overall deficit of the Government after grants would narrow from 0.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 0.3 percent. b. Rest of the Dublic sector The operating surplus of the public enterprises is expected to increase by 0.3 percent of GDP in 1996, with no adjustments programmed in public sector prices and tariffs. This improvement would result from larger revenues of ANTEL on account of receipts from international calls pending from 1995, a reduction in the operating costs of CEL which will revert to the use of cheaper sources of energy, and a decline in the wage bill of CEL, ANTEL, and ANDA. Capital outlays of the public enterprises are projected to increase by 0.5 percentage point of GDP, mainly reflecting repair and exten- sion of services in the electricity and water utilities, and refurbishment of port and airport installations. The current primary deficit of the rest of the general government would remain at 0.7 percent of GDP, with an improvement in the finances of the ISSS being offset by larger operating expenses of the Hospital System. Capital expenditures of these institutions would expand by 0.4 percentage point of GDP, with virtually all the increase accounted for by the municipalities- -reflecting a rapid growth of community projects--and the remainder representing construction of medical facilities by the ISSS. The operating surplus of the BCR would remain at 0.1 percent of GDP in 1996, with higher expenditure related to a larger volume of sterilization operations and remuneration of legal reserve requirements, to be offset by central government interest payments and earnings from international reserves. The Central Government's debt to the BCR stood at C 6.2 billion (7.3 percent of GDP) at end-1995, with no interest being paid on C 4.9 bil- lion of this debt. In addition, losses incurred by the BCR from assuming nonperforming loans of the state commercial banks in 1992 amounted to C 2.6 billion at end-1995. To recapitalize the BCR, the Central Government will start paying 6 percent on the C 4.9 billion in 1996, and starting in 1998 will assume C 1.4 billion of the C 2.6 billion losses from the recapitalization of the state banks, with annual payments of C 50 million over 28 years. Also, C 100 million a year will be included in the budget starting in 1996 to compensate the BCR for the higher interest costs from the elimination of the tax exemption on interest earned on CEMs (see below), and the increase in the remunerated portion of legal reserve requirements on time deposits. C. Structural reforms The Government intends to consolidate the fiscal position over the medium term by continuing its program of structural reforms in the public sector in 1996. These efforts will focus on improving tax administration and expenditure management, reducing the size of the public sector, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - increasing the role of the private sector, and will be supported by program loans from the IDB in 1996-97. Improved tax administration is to be achieved through use of a computerized database; checks against information provided by large tax- payers; and the establishment of two new regional tax offices. In the customs area, there will be closer monitoring of large importers (imports of more than C 50,000 per year), and the privatization of certain services (including warehousing and tax collection) will be explored. On the expenditure side, as noted above, tighter controls would be achieved through, inter alia, the unit already set up in the Ministry of Finance to oversee fiscal policy. To modernize the public sector and make it more efficient, policies will be developed during 1996-97 to upgrade the quality of staff through improved recruitment, training, and promotion policies, and other incentives to attract and retain qualified staff. Privatization efforts in 1996 will focus on the electricity distribu- tion and telecommunications companies, the pension system, and the airport. Legislation to establish a framework allowing for the privatization of electricity distribution was presented to the Assembly in February 1996; and a bill to establish a single regulatory body for all public utilities will be ready by June. The Government plans to offer 10 percent of the shares in the electricity distribution companies and ANTEL to their employees, 45 percent to the private operators to be selected via an auction system, and 45 percent through the stock exchange. Also in 1996, the Government plans to offer for sale the remaining sugar factories. 2. Monetary policv The monetary program for 1996 aims at lowering inflation to 7 percent, and increasing the NIR of the BCR by US$lOO million. This would be achieved by reducing the net domestic assets of the BCR by about 6 percent (in relation to currency in circulation at the beginning of the year), mainly through the net placement of C 870 million (0.9 percent of GDP) in CEMs. Private financial savings are expected to grow by about 14 percent (somewhat faster than nominal GDP) during 1996, and the monetary program provides for financial system credit expansion to the private sector of about 19 percent. External borrowing by the financial system is projected at US$120 million, with financial system external debt outstanding at end-1996 reaching the equivalent of 3.9 percent of GDP (or 40 percent of NIR). To help contain credit expansion at the targeted levels, the BCR has introduced a system of market-determined interest rates for all maturities of CEMs and treasury bills (LETES) through competitive auctions. This new system, which will begin operations in March 1996, will facilitate the programmed placement of CEMs. The income tax exemption on interest earned on CEMs will be eliminated and legislation to this effect will be presented to the Assembly in March 1996, to make the rates of return transparent and nondistortionary. Starting April 1996, the BCR will modify and simplify the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - legal reserve requirements on financial system liabilities, while increasing gradually the remunerated portion of reserve requirements on time deposits from 5 percent to 10 percent. In addition, the BCR will monitor the external borrowing of the financial system, and if necessary, would increase the reserve requirement on such borrowing from 10 percent to 20 percent. As regards structural reforms, the process of privatization in the financial sector will be completed in 1996 with the sale of the Mortgage Bank. Twenty-five percent of the shares in the bank were offered to employees and 35 percent will be offered to small investors, with the remaining 40 percent to be sold through the stock exchange. Also, modifications to the securities law will be presented to the Assembly by June 1996 and changes are being considered to related provisions of the Commercial Code as part of efforts to deepen and modernize the system. To improve efficiency in the pension system, and help deepen and broaden financial markets, the Government is preparing a reform of the pension system which will substitute privately administered individual accounts for the current pay-as-you-go system. Legislation will be presented to the Assembly in the first half of 1996 that would allow the operation of private pension funds. 3. External Policies The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to decline to 4.2 percent of GDP in 1996, reflecting a sharp slowdown in merchandise imports, and continued growth in nontraditional and net maquila exports that would offset a decline in coffee exports due to further drop in prices. Exports of traditional goods are expected to decline by 17 percent in U.S. dollar terms, while nontraditional exports would grow by 16.5 percent. Merchandise imports are projected to rise by about 5 percent, reflecting a slowdown in private and public.consumption and decline in inventories, while exports of maquila would grow by 23.5 percent. Official transfers are projected to decrease further to 2 percent in 1996, while private transfers would fall to 11.9 percent of GDP. Net external financing of the NFPS is projected to drop to about US$lOO million in 1996, reflecting repayment of short-term debt (including US$lS million of short-term bonds held by the Central American Bank of Economic Integration). That would be offset only in part by an increase in net disbursements of medium- and long-term loans. Of the US$315 million in disbursements to the NFPS, about US$175 million would be from multilateral creditors. Disbursements by bilateral and commercial creditors would amount to US$70 million, and US$75 million, respectively. Commercial banks and finance companies are expected to continue to borrow abroad, albeit at a much slower pace (US$120 million). The authorities' exchange rate policy for 1996 will continue to aim at maintaining the nominal value of the colon at C 8.75 per U.S. dollar. In view of the widening of inflation differentials relative to trading partners and pressures on the external current account observed during 1995, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - staff urged the authorities to be prepared to consider greater flexibility in the exchange system. However, the authorities believe that part of the pressures on imports in 1995, particularly of consumption goods, stemmed from once-and-for-all factors. Moreover, they are convinced that the financial policies, including wage adjustments in the public sector below projected inflation, and structural reforms supporting the program for 1996 are consistent with the present level of the exchange rate. They noted the strong performance of nontraditional and maquila exports in 1995, and the importance of exchange rate stability for private capital inflows, including remittances. Regarding trade policy, all nontariff barriers (which covered a few tariff lines) were eliminated in early 1995. Also, during July-December 1996 import tariffs will be reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent on consumer goods, from 5 percent to zero on raw materials, and from 1 percent to zero on capital goods. The revised schedule for implementing these reductions (which is consistent with planned reductions in the other countries in the CACM) has been delayed for six months to allow more time for the effects of the employment reduction program and other fiscal measures to take hold. The Government is currently drafting legislation to address unfair trade practices (anti-dumping) and to set minimum standards for trade in food products. 4. Social and environmental nolicies Since 1991, the Social Investment Fund (FIS) has been the main vehicle for allocating funds, provided mainly by the IDB, for poverty alleviation. Most of the projects financed by the FIS (averaging about 0.4 percent of GDP a year) have been aimed at improving basic education, health, water, and sewerage facilities in small, rural communities. The projects--whose average cost amounts to US$20,000--are identified in consultation with the local communities, which also provide most of the labor required for carrying them out. In 1996, the Government plans to merge the FIS with two other existing social programs, Municipalities in Action and the National Secretariat for Reconstruction, into a National Development Fund (FONDES), with a view to consolidating efforts in this area and reducing administrative costs. The Government's environmental strategy under consideration by the Assembly calls for an environmental impact analysis to be made for all projects and public works, and an environmental education plan. In 1995 the environmental agency initiated a series of television advertisements to raise public awareness of these matters.

Medium-Term Outlook I/ Based on the continued implementation of appropriate economic policies, the revised medium-term outlook contemplates real GDP growth of 5 percent a year and a decline in inflation from 7 percent during 1996 to 3 percent during 1998 and thereafter (Table 8). Gross domestic investment is projected to increase from 19.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to 21.5 percent in 2001, centered in the private sector. National savings would increase from 15.4 percent of GDP in 1996 to about 19.5 percent by 2001, with both the public and private sectors contributing to the improvement. The use of external savings (excluding official transfers) would continue to decline to about 2 percent of GDP by 2001. 2J Over the medium term, the overall deficit of the NFPS (after grants) would be limited to 0.5 percent of GDP and public savings would rise from 3.9 percent of GDP in 1996 to 5.4 percent by 2001. J/ The savings perfor- mance would reflect mainly reduced outlays in terms of GDP, namely wages and transfers, following the reduction in employment in 1996, efforts to reduce the scope of the Government, and tighter expenditure controls. Public sector investment would rise from 4.0 percent of GDP in 1996 to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2001, reflecting the continued need for rehabilitation and upgrading of infrastructure, including health, education, and other social facilities. With net external financing averaging 1.6 percent of GDP a year, the nonfinancial public sector would repay internal debt at an average rate of about 1.0 percent of GDP a year. The baseline medium-term balance of payments projections envisages a slowdown in the growth of traditional exports (including coffee), from about 9 percent in 1997 to 6 percent in 2001, and continued strong growth in nontraditional and net maquila exports (11.0 percent and 15.5 percent a year on average during 1997-2001). Merchandise imports are projected to increase on average by about 6.5 percent a year, and private transfers would decline from 11.9 percent of GDP in 1996 to 10.0 percent by 2001. The projection assumes a decline in El Salvador's reliance on official grants following full implementation of the peace accords. The overall balance of payments surplus would average 0.7 percent of GDP in the period 1997-2001, and gross international reserves of the BCR would rise to 4.5 months of imports in 2001. lJ The medium-term outlook described in EBS/95/107 (6/28/95) has been revised to take into account recent developments and updated WE0 projections, including downward revisions in coffee export prices. 2J Including official transfers, the external current account deficit would narrow to about 1 percent of GDP by 2001. 3J The medium-term projections do not assume the privatization of the main public utilities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - Sensitivity analysis indicates that if coffee prices were lower by 10 percent every year relative to the baseline projection, the external current account deficit would be larger by an average of 0.3 percent of GDP a year and the accumulation of reserves smaller on average by US$37 million a year during 1997-2001 (Table 9). Also, if the growth of nontraditional exports were 1 percentage point lower each year, the external current account deficit would be larger by an average of 0.2 percent of GDP a year and the accumulation of reserves smaller by US$35 million on average a year. Moreover, a shortfall of a similar magnitude in the growth of private remittances from the baseline would result in a current account deficit larger on average by 0.4 percent of GDP a year and an accumulation of reserves lower by US$53 million on average a year. Public sector external debt would decline by 0.7 percent of GDP over the projection period, and the debt service ratio would be virtually unchanged at about 9 percent of exports of goods and services and private transfers (Table 10). On this basis, El Salvador should not require debt rescheduling nor have difficulty in meeting its debt service obligations over the medium term. In view of the authorities' commitment to the policies outlined in the Memorandum, the measures already adopted during 1996, and the absence of existing obligations to the Fund, it is the staff's assessment that should El Salvador make purchases under the stand-by arrangement, it would have the capacity to repay the Fund. V. Program Monitoring Performance criteria have been set for end-March and end-June, and indicative targets for end-September and end-December 1996 (Table 11 and Tables 1 to 5 of the attached Memorandum). The customary injunction against exchange and trade restrictions and accumulation of external-payments arrears will be applicable at all times during the period of the arrangement. VI. _ Staff Appraisal Since the end of the civil war in 1992, the Salvadoran authorities have been implementing policies of adjustment and reform supported by successive stand-by arrangements from the Fund. Through 1994, real GDP grew rapidly, inflation was halved to single digit levels, public savings increased and the overall fiscal deficit was reduced sharply, and the external current account moved to near balance. Substantive progress was made also on structural reforms, especially in the tax system and the labor market. There were slippages in performance under the program in 1995. Real GDP growth, public savings, and the overall balance of the NFPS were in line or better than in the program. However, the combined effect of a smaller improvement in the terms of trade and lower volume of coffee exports, together with insufficient tightening of monetary policy led to a widening Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - of the external current account deficit, pressure on domestic prices, and lower accumulation of NIR than projected under the program. As a result, inflation accelerated, with only part of the increase reflecting corrective price adjustments, and the colon appreciated in real effective terms. Also, El Salvador did not observe the end-December performance criteria on the net domestic assets and the NIR position of the BCR, and the contracting of external debt, for which the authorities are requesting waivers for noncompliance. Significant progress was attained in structural reforms in 1995. An obligatory employment reduction program was approved by the Assembly, the Government continued its efforts to control public expenditure and restructure the public enterprises, and the privatization program was given new impetus. Also, the Assembly modified the Banking System Law, measures were put in place to strengthen the enforcement capacity of the Superintendency of Banks, and work commenced on reform of the pension system. The Government's revised program for,1996 aims at correcting the policy slippages that occurred in 1995, with a view to returning the economy to the path envisaged under the original program. Based on real GDP growth of 4-5 percent, the revised program seeks to reduce inflation to 7 percent, narrow the external current account deficit to about 4 percent of GDP, and increase NIR by US$lOO million. These objectives will be achieved by tightening credit policy and by further improvements in public savings and the overall finances of the NFPS. However, the smaller-than-programmed improvement in the terms of trade would result in less accumulation of NIR and a larger current account deficit than envisaged in the original program. As regards structural policies, tax administration would be improved further, the indirect instruments of monetary control strengthened, public utilities privatized, and the pension system reformed. The weak stance of monetary policy accounted for most of the slippages in the program which occurred during 1995. Efforts must be made to ensure that stabilization bonds are placed as programmed, and that tightening of monetary policy is not offset by increased foreign borrowing by the finan- cial system. In this connection, the staff welcomes the authorities' readiness to reimpose reserve requirements on financial system external borrowing, the move to market-determined interest rates through competitive auctions for stabilization and government bonds, the planned elimination of the tax exemption on interest earned on stabilization bonds, and the plans to increase the remunerated portion of minimum legal reserve requirements. The staff urges the authorities to increase reserve requirements on external borrowing without delay so as to reduce the incentive for financial institutions to borrow abroad rather than attract domestic savings, allowing more time for other more permanent measures being adopted to take hold. Monetary policy would be facilitated by the authorities' fiscal program for 1996. The staff welcomes the measures already implemented, including the reduction in public sector employment; postponement of the planned Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - reduction in import duties until the second half of the year; cutbacks in central government nonpeace-related current expenditure; and the cancellation of some investment projects budgeted for the main public enterprises. It will be essential that these measures be supplemented by improved tax administration and limits on wage increases. Also, to consolidate the fiscal position over the medium term, the staff would urge that reforms supported by the World Bank and the IDB in the areas of financial management, human resources skills, and public sector moderniza- tion, be implemented without delay. In this connection, the staff welcomes the renewed efforts toward privatization of the public utilities and the authorities' plans to reform the pension system. The BCR plans to continue its policy of maintaining the nominal value of the colon with respect to the U.S. dollar. In view of the appreciation of the colon in recent years in real effective terms, the authorities will need to monitor closely the impact of exchange rate policy on export competitiveness, including the maquila sector, and stand ready to take action to preserve competitiveness as needed. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities' plans to maintain wage adjustments in the public sector below the inflation projected for 1996. The staff also welcomes the authorities' intention to reduce further import tariff rates during 1996. Despite El Salvador's relatively low external debt and debt service ratios, the staff urges the authorities to minimize recourse to short-term external borrowing on commercial terms. In this connection, priority should be given to taking the steps necessary to expedite disbursements of both program and project loans from multilateral agencies. The staff welcomes the improvement in the coverage and quality of the data provided for surveillance. In particular, the creation of a new analytical unit in the Ministry of Finance is noteworthy, and the staff urges the prompt implementation of an information system which will allow weekly reporting of fiscal data. In view of the corrective actions already taken, particularly in the areas of monetary policy, public sector employment, and expenditure controls, and given the authorities' commitment to adopt additional measures, including structural reforms, the staff supports El Salvador's request for waivers relating to the observance of some performance criteria and completion of the review. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with El Salvador be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

El Salvador has consulted with the Fund in accordance with paragraph 3 of the stand-by arrangement for El Salvador (EBS/95/107, Supplement 1) and paragraph 4 of the letter dated June 12, 1995 from the President of the Central Reserve Bank, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Economic and Social Development of El Salvador in order to review performance under the program, set performance criteria for end-March and end-June 1996, and reach understandings regarding the circumstances in which purchases can be resumed under the arrangement. 2. The letter dated March 11, 1996, with its annexed memorandum and tables, from the President of the Central Reserve Bank, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of El Salvador, shall be attached to the stand-by arrangement for El Salvador, and the letter dated June 12, 1995, and its annexed memorandum and tables, shall be read as supplemented by the letter dated March 11, 1996, and its annexed memorandum and tables. 3. Accordingly, the limits, targets and ceilings for end-March and end-June 1996, referred to in paragraph 3(a) of the stand-by arrangement shall be as specified in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 annexed to the letter dated March 11, 1996. 4. The Fund decides that the review contemplated in paragraph 3(c) of the stand-by arrangement is completed and that no further understandings are needed for the resumption of purchases under the arrangement.

Attached is a Memorandum on the Economic and Financial Policies of El Salvador setting out the objectives and policies the Government intends to pursue in 1996 in the context of the 14-month stand-by arrangement approved by the Executive Board of the Fund on July 21, 1995. The arrangement specified that El Salvador would conduct a midterm review with the Fund no later than February 1996, to reach further understandings on the performance criteria and indicative targets for 1996. 2. As explained in the Memorandum, difficulties arose in the implemen- tation of the program in 1995. Despite a better-than-programmed outcome for the public finances and the Government's efforts to tighten monetary policy, the performance criteria for end-December 1995 regarding the net interna- tional reserves and net domestic assets of the Central Reserve Bank, as well as the ceilings on short-term external debt and debt of l-12 years maturity were not observed. The program for 1996 described in the Memorandum aims at strengthening policies in areas where slippages have occurred, and on the basis of those policies the Government of El Salvador requests that the Fund grant El Salvador the necessary waivers for the observance of the performance criteria referred to above. Before the request for waivers is discussed by the Fund's Executive Board, the Government will have presented legislation to the Assembly to eliminate the income tax exemption on interest earned on stabilization bonds (CEMs), and moved to market- determined interest rates through the implementation of competitive auctions. The Fund staff, together with the Central Reserve Bank, will evaluate the functioning of the auction system l-2 months after commencement of operations, with a view to making any corrections that might be needed. 3. The Government of El Salvador believes that the policies outlined in the Memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will consult with the Fund on the introduction of any further measures that may become necessary for this purpose during the period of the arrangement, in accordance with the Fund's policies on such consultations. In addition, the Government will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the implementation of the policies and objectives of the program.

As described in the Memorandum of Economic Policies of June 12, 1995, the main macroeconomic objectives for 1995 were to reduce the rate of inflation to 6-8 percent, attain real GDP growth of 6-7 percent, and maintain a strong balance of payments. These objectives were to be achieved through a further reduction in the overall deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) (before grants), increased public savings, credit restraint, and lower import tariffs. Structural reforms were to be deepened to support sustained economic growth, including through additional incentives for private savings in the medium term, and the social safety net programs were to be strengthened. 2. Performance under the economic program for 1995 was mixed. Economic activity remained strong through mid-year, but started to weaken in the last months of the year. This development reflected a decline in construction activity related to an excess supply of high-priced residential units; lower-than-expected coffee earnings, as international prices dropped sharply; some slowdown in receipts from maquila exports resulting from increased competition from Mexico; and the effects on private investment of the rise in interest rates related to the Government's efforts to control the boom in private consumption. Real GDP grew by 6.3 percent in 1995, while inflation increased to 11.4 percent, reflecting in part the effect of the adjustment of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate from 10 percent to 13 per- cent in July, -and of bad weather on food prices. The effect on consumer prices of the adjustments in public utilities rates (water, domestic telephone tariffs, and electricity) and the VAT, is estimated at about 5 percentage points in 1995. 3. The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened to 2.9 percent of GDP in 1995 compared to balance in the program, mainly reflecting higher imports and lower coffee exports. The net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Reserve Bank (BCR) rose by US$147 million, compared with a target of US$172 million, despite central government short-term borrowing not envisaged in the program (see paragraph 9 below). The colon remained stable in nominal terms relative to the U.S. dollar during 1995, but appreciated in real effective terms by about 7 percent. 4. The performance of the public finances was better than programmed in 1995. The overall deficit of the NFPS (before grants) was 0.9 percent of GDP compared with 1.6 percent of GDP in the program, while public savings exceeded the target of 3.1 percent of GDP by a small margin. Shortfalls in privatization proceeds and tax revenue, and larger central government investment outlays, were more than offset by lower interest payments and capital outlays by the public enterprises. The lower tax revenues stemmed mainly from the delayed implementation of laws to strengthen tax administration (the "Fiscal Crime" and the "Customs Violations" laws), while lower-than-expected privatization proceeds were due mainly to legal and procedural delays in finalizing sales of government property. Although there were slippages in the public enterprises' investment program, capital Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - ATTACHMENT outlays by the Central Government and the rest of the General Government were well above program, reflecting reconstruction of public buildings, roads, and bridges, and increased outlays on health and social infrastructure. 5. In the public enterprises, tariff adjustments helped maintain the operational surplus in line with the program despite rising costs. However, the operational surplus of the electricity company (CEL) declined notwith- standing a 30 percent tariff adjustment in 1994 and an additional increase of 16 percent in July 1995, due to a larger increase in expenditure reflecting, in part, the need to rely on more expensive sources of energy. The operational surplus of the telecommunications company (ANTEL) declined slightly in relation to GDP in 1995, with a 30 percent rise in domestic telephone tariffs in April 1995 offset in part by a decrease in interna- tional rates. Also, the water and sewerage company (ANDA) increased tariffs by 24 percent in December 1994. 6. The operational surplus of the Salvadoran Social Security System (ISSS) remained unchanged at 0.4 percent of GDP in 1995 as an increase in contributions of almost 20 percent was offset by higher expenditure on benefit payments and the delivery of health services. Contributions were boosted by an increase of 10 percent in private sector wages, following increases of 15 percent on average in each of the previous two years. Capital expenditure of the ISSS rose sharply, mainly on account of repairs and reconstruction of hospitals and clinics. 7. Commercial bank credit to the private sector grew by 30 percent during 1995, compared with 24 percent in the program, while credit to the private sector from the financial system expanded by 32 percent. At the same time, the growth of financial system liabilities to the private sector slowed from 18.5 percent during 1994 to 12.7 percent (20 percent in the program) during 1995. As a result, and notwithstanding the contraction of credit to the public sector and an increase in their capital, the financial institutions borrowed abroad about 2 percent of GDP to supplement their domestic loanable funds. 8. To control credit expansion, reserve requirements on public sector deposits were raised to 35 percent starting in August 1995, and reserve requirements on commercial banks' external borrowing were reimposed in September. In addition, interest rates on stabilization bonds (C!Xs) were raised by 220-270 basis points (to the equivalent of about 18 percent) between June and September 1995, However, commercial banks' interest rates on deposits were lowered by 40 basis points to 14.8 percent, and lending rates increased by 90 basis points to 19.4 percent over this period, and by end-October the stock of CEMs outstanding had declined by C 50 million from the December 1994 level. Interest rates on CEMs were raised once again in December by 130 basis points, which, coupled with the banks' efforts to attract deposits to improve their end of year balance sheets, led to an increase of 200 basis points in deposit rates and of 30 basis points in lending rates. These actions notwithstanding, the stock of CEMs and other bonds fell by C 444 million during 1995 compared with a decline of C 87 mil- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - ATTACHMENT lion in the program, and the net domestic assets of the BCR declined by C 504 million during 1995 (C 664 million less than programmed). The latter refiected also withdrawals of central government deposits in the BCR, related in part to shortfalls in external financing. 9. The balance of payments outcome in 1995 was weaker than programmed. Imports increased by 27 percent (15 percent in the program), while coffee exports amounted to US$362 million compared with US$450 million in the program mainly because of lower volume caused by bad weather. Nontradi- tional exports were up by 16.5 percent in 1995 compared with 11 percent in 1994, and net maquila exports expanded by 50 percent. Official transfers and net long-term external financing of the NFPS amounted to US$261 million in 1995 compared with US$409 million in the program, while net inflows to the BCR amounted to US$39 million (US$14 million in the program). To offset part of the shortfall, the Government placed short-term treasury bills for US$70 million, US$30 million of which comprised bridge financing for an IDB loan now expected to be disbursed in the third quarter of 1996. Also, commercial banks borrowed abroad US$179 million on a net basis (repayments of US$40 million in the program) and other financial institutions US$lO mil- lion, to supplement domestic loanable funds. Private inflows (including remittances) were US$88 million larger than programmed. In all, the accumulation of NIR of the BCR fell short of the program target by US$25 million. 10. El Salvador observed all end-September 1995 performance criteria. However, as described in the Letter of Intent and despite a better-than- programmed fiscal outcome, for end-December 1995 it failed to observe the targets for the NIR and the net domestic assets, as well as the ceilings on contracting of short-term external debt and debt of l-12 years maturity. 11. Regarding structural measures in the public sector, the.Government continued its efforts to control public expenditure in 1995. The Ministry of Planning was eliminated, and a comprehensive law ("AFI" law covering operations of the Treasury, Budget, Accounting, and Public Credit offices) was enacted in November 1995 to improve the financial management of the public sector and to coordinate the Budget with the Monetary and Financial Program. Also in November, an obligatory employment reduction program was approved by the Assembly, which resulted in the elimination of 11,500 positions in January 1996. Moreover, through this program about 2,500 additional positions will be vacated through voluntary retirement during 1996. The Government will make efforts to cancel or freeze these positions. In addition, the office of the Director General of Customs was restructured during 1995; the legislation referring to the "Corte de Cuentas" was modified to modernize its functions and redirect its scope to the ex-post control and auditing of public sector expenditure; the 1996 budget was presented to the Assembly in a unified form (including the budgets of the public enterprises and the economic reactivation fund); and a management unit, which started operations in January 1996, was created at the Ministry of Finance to strengthen the budget process, making it consistent with macroeconomic targets, along the lines of recommendations from FAD.

In 1994, the Constitution was modified to allow private sector participation in the electricity and telecommunications sectors, and authorization was granted for a large private concern to invest in electricity generation. The plant, which has a capacity of 96 MW, started operations in November 1995, and authorization has been granted to expand its capacity by a further 40 m. In addition, CEL has elaborated a management and privatization plan for the four electricity distribution companies, and is implementing an internal restructuring and reorganization program which has resulted in a reduction of about 15 percent in personnel and an improvement in the efficiency of its workforce. ANTEL also reduced its personnel by about 15 percent and is undertaking changes in anticipation of privatization. Internal restructuring at ANDA has resulted in a reduction in staff by about 20 percent over the past eighteen months, with services such as reading of meters, connections and disconnections of water supply, and vehicle maintenance contracted out to the private sector (in some cases to former employees). The Government is preparing also a reform of the pension system which will substitute privately administered individual accounts for the current pay-as-you-go system. 13. The Government has started implementing a comprehensive privatization program to open to the private sector areas of economic activity previously reserved for the state, thereby attracting new local and foreign investors, and creating jobs. The proceeds from the sales of government assets will be allocated to finance social programs and the payment of government debt. In 1994, part of the San Bartolo Free Zone was privatized, and in 1995, assets of the National Coffee Institute, the National Sugar Institute, and the Salvadoran Investment Corporation were put up for sale. Also, one sugar refinery (El Carmen) was sold in 1995, another (Chaparrastique) was put up for sale, and the sale of the Mortgage Bank was initiated in November 1995 with 25 percent of the shares being offered to the employees. 14. The program for 1996 aims at strengthening policies in areas where slippages occurred in 1995, including structural reforms. The main macroeconomic objectives are to reduce inflation to about 7 percent, achieve real GDP growth of about 5 percent, and strengthen the balance of payments. These objectives are to be attained through a further reduction in the overall deficit of the NFPS (before grants), increased public savings, credit restraint, and lower import duties. 15. The deficit of the NFPS (before grants) is programmed to decline to 0.4 percent of GDP in 1996, despite a sizable increase in peace-related and social expenditure, severance payments, interest payments to the BCR (see paragraph 24), and larger capital outlays. Public savings are programmed to rise from 3.2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 3.9 percent in 1996, while public sector capital outlays would increase to 4.6 percent of GDP because of an increase in investment by the enterprises and municipalities. Despite lower external financing on account of the repayment of short-term debt and lower grants, domestic public debt would decline further by 0.9 percent of GDP in 1996. Quarterly performance criteria for the net domestic financing and savings of the NFPS are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 51 - ATTACHMENT 16. The overall deficit (before grants) of the Central Government is projected to decline from 1.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to 0.7 percent in 1996. Central government savings would increase slightly in 1996 to 1.9 percent of GDP, with tax revenue projected to increase by 0.5 percentage point of GDP to 12.3 percent. This increase reflects the higher VAT rate introduced in July 1995, modification of the tax on alcoholic beverages, and improved tax administration, which would more than offset a decline in import duties in the second half of 1996 and in tax receipts on windfall proceeds from the coffee sector. Central government receipts will benefit also by 0.2 percen- tage point of GDP from the proceeds of the sale of government assets. 17. As regards tax administration, about 250 additional professionals have been recruited and are being trained in the tax department. With the assistance of international accounting firms, a fiscalization plan is being developed to ensure maximum income tax collections. The plan includes use of a computerized database to identify unpaid tax obligations. Also, information on suppliers and clients provided by large taxpayers will be used to detect evasion. As part of the public sector modernization plan, two new regional tax offices will be established to facilitate improved collections outside of San Salvador. In the customs area, the Ministry of Finance plans to reduce illegal imports and undervaluation by, inter alia, monitoring more closely individuals and businesses which import more than C 50,000 per year. Options also will be considered to privatize certain services, including tax collection and warehousing. 18. Central government current expenditure is projected to increase by 0.4 percentage point of GDP to 11.3 percent in 1996, reflecting mainly an increase in social expenditures and severance payments for the employment reduction program--which will be offset partly by a corresponding decline in the wage bill. Peace-related expenditures relate mainly to the purchase of land to be distributed among demobilized ex-combatants and the provision of credit, equipment, and training to these beneficiaries. The strengthening of the judicial system and the new National Civil Police have been included in the budget for 1996. The wage bill reflects the full-year impact of the 8 percent wage award effective July 1995 and an across-the-board increase in the second half of 1996 that will not exceed 5 percent. The Government will ensure also that employment in the Central Government at end-1996 will have been reduced on a net basis by 2,500 positions from end-1995. 19. The Government of El Salvador attaches great importance to expanding and improving basic health and educational services as well as ensuring public safety to facilitate the development of the economy. Social expenditure is projected to increase from 3.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1996. The Government will help accommodate social and peace-related expenditure by maintaining military expenditure constant in nominal terms, which implies a further reduction of 0.2 percentage point of GDP in 1996 to 0.8 percent of GDP. 20. The overall deficit of the rest of the NFPS is projected to widen by 0.6 percent of GDP to 1.4 percent in 1996, reflecting a large increase in investment outlays. The increase in capital expenditure would reflect Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - ATTACHMENT mainly outlays by CEL and ANDA on repair and extension of services; the municipalities, on account of decentralization and the rapid growth of community projects; ISSS on the construction of several rural and urban medical units to increase coverage of health services; and the Port Authority (CEPA) on improvements and repairs in port and airport installations. 21. The modernizationof the public sector plays a central role in the achievement of the Government's medium-term objectives. The public sector will be transformed to encourage and facilitate a larger role of the private sector in the economy, and at the same time ensure that the economic and social infrastructures are adequate. The Government has designed a Public Sector Modernization Plan (PSMP) to be implemented in several phases. The plan was initiated with the AFI law to put in place a System of Integrated Financial Administration (SAFI). The system will establish standard budget and expenditure control norms throughout the public sector, use new technologies for the formulation and execution of the budget, and include institutional modernization to allow for more efficient planning and control of public spending. The functions and units of the Ministry of Planning have been distributed among various ministries, and the Unit of Administration of Public Investment (DAIP) is now under the jurisdiction of the President of the Republic through a special commissioner. The objective of this restructuring was to coordinate the implementation (physical as well as financial) of the public investment program with the quarterly targets in the monetary and financial program. 22. In 1996, privatization efforts will be concentrated in four areas: the electricity distribution companies, ANTEL, the pension system, and the Airport. Legislation to establish a framework allowing for the privatiza- tion of CEL was presented to the Assembly in February; draft legislation that would allow private managers to operate pension funds will be presented to the Assembly in the first half of 1996; and a bill to establish a single regulatory body for all public utilities will be ready by end-June 1996. The Government plans to offer 10 percent of the shares in the electricity distribution companies and ANTEL to employees, and 45 percent to the private operators that will be selected via an auction system; the remaining 45 per- cent is to be sold through the stock exchange. The new pension funds are expected to improve the efficiency of the pension system, and help deepen and broaden financial markets. Also during 1996, the Government plans to offer for sale the remaining sugar factories. 23. The monetary program for 1996 is designed to support an increase in the NIR of the BCR of US$lOO million through a reduction in the net domestic assets by 6 percent (in relation to currency in circulation at the beginning of the year). The program assumes a growth of financial system liabilities to the private sector of about 14 percent (somewhat faster than the growth of nominal GDP), while providing for credit expansion to the private sector of about 19 percent. To keep the expansion at the targeted level, the BCR will (a) modify and simplify the system of legal reserve requirements, while increasing gradually the remunerated portion of minimum reserve requirements on time deposits from 5 percent to 10 percent starting April 1996; (b) move Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - ATTACHMENT to market-determined interest rates for all maturities of CEMs and treasury bills by switching to competitive auctions in March 1996; (c) place C 870 million (0.9 percent of GDP) in CEMs on a net basis by end-1996; and (d) monitor closely external borrowing by the financial system, and if necessary, increase reserve requirements from 10 percent to 20 percent on this borrowing. In order to make the rates of return on CEMs transparent and nondistortionary, the income tax exemption on interest earned on this instrument will be eliminated, with pertinent legislation presented to the Assembly in March 1996. Quarterly performance criteria for the BCR's net domestic assets and NIR are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. 24. The BCR operating result shifted from a loss of 0.2 percentage point of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of 0.1 percent in 1995, as growing receipts on international reserve holdings more than offset losses from sterilization operations. To enhance the role of the BCR in the financial sector and facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, the Central Government will start the recapitalization of the BCR in 1996 by paying 6 percent interest on the 80 percent of its debt to the BCR on which no interest was being paid. Also, the Central Government will cover C 1.4 billion of the C 2.6 billion of BCR losses stemming from the assumption of nonperforming loans from the state commercial banks, to be paid in 28 equal annual installments of C 50 million starting in 1998. In addition, C 100 million a year will be included in the budget starting in 1996 to compensate the BCR for the costs of the elimination of the tax exemption on interest earned on CEMs and the increase in the remunerated portion of minimum reserve requirements on time deposits. For 1996, the BCR surplus is projected to remain at 0.1 percent of GDP with higher expenditure related to sterilization operations and remuneration of reserve requirements offset by central government interest payments and larger earnings on international reserves. 25. To further deepen and modernize the financial system, the BCR will present to the Assembly in June 1996 draft legislation to modify the securities law, and is also considering modifications to related provisions of the Commercial Code. The Assembly approved a modification of the Banking System Law at end-1995. The new law aims at increasing competition in the financial system by eliminating the condition that required new banks to have at least 50 percent of Salvadoran capital, and it strengthens capital requirements and the regulatory framework. Also, it requires that the risk- weighted capital.asset ratio be raised from 8 percent to 10 percent over six years, with the ratio increased to 8.3 percent by end-1996. Other stipulations include a limit on the ability to increase the capital base equal to 75 percent of the revaluation of bank assets and of 50 percent of current net earnings; a reduction in the limit on credit extended to enterprises owned by banks' directors or owners to 15 percent from 50 per- cent of capital; and an increase in the minimum capital requirements from C 35 million to C 50 million for banks, and from C 13 million to C 25 mil- lion for financial companies. In addition, new penalties against noncompliance were imposed to strengthen the enforcement capacity of the Superintendency of Banks.

Balance of payments projections (based on an average coffee export price of US$l.lO a pound) indicate that the external current account deficit (including official transfers) would decline from 2.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 2.2 percent of GDP in 1996, mainly reflecting a sharp deceleration of imports and continued fast expansion of nontraditional and maquila exports, which would more than offset the decline in coffee exports. Imports are expected to grow by 5.2 percent in value terms, mainly reflecting a slowdown in private consumption and a reduction in inventories. Private inflows (including remittances) are projected to decline from 12.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to 11.9 percent of GDP in 1996, while official transfers would decrease from 2.2 percent of GDP to 2.0 percent mainly reflecting lower grants from USAID. Long-term net external financing to the NFPS is projected to increase to about US$195 million in 1996, while total net financing to the public sector would remain at about US$lOO million. Public sector disbursements in 1996 are projected at US$322 million of which multilateral creditors would provide US$170 million, commercial banks US$75 million, and official bilateral creditors the rest. Balance of payments support is projected at US$40 million, while borrowing by the financial sector is expected to drop to about US$120 million in 1996. In all, the NIR of the BCR would increase by US$lOO million, bringing the total accumulation of reserves for 1995-96 to US$247 million, with gross reserves equivalent to 4.1 months of imports at end-1996. Regarding trade liberalization, during July-December 1996 import tariff rates will be reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent on consumer goods, from 5 percent to zero on raw materials, and from 1 percent to zero on capital goods. 27. The program includes a ceiling of US$500 million for 1996 on the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external loans by the public sector with maturities of more than one year (Table 5). Within this ceiling, new commitments or guarantees of loans of more than one year and less than twelve years will be limited to US$300 million, and of loans of more than one year and less than five years to US$120 million. The Government will not incur or guarantee short-term external debt during 1996, except for normal import-related credit lines, and it will eliminate its outstanding short-term external debt, which stood at US$93 million at end-1995, by end-September 1996. 28. The BCR plans to continue with its present exchange rate policy of limiting the variation of the colon with respect to the U.S.'dollar in an effort to reduce perceived exchange risk. The Government will continue to rely on tight financial policies and structural reforms with the aim of maintaining export competitiveness. Emphasis will be placed on reforms to improve the efficiency of the public sector, accelerate privatization, and further reduce import tariff rates. 29. El Salvador maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current and capital interna- tional transactions. The Government will not impose new restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, introduce multiple currency practices, impose or intensify import restric- tions for balance of payments reasons, or enter into new bilateral payments Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT agreements with member countries of the Fund that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. The Government will actively pursue an association with NAFTA countries. In this regard, a Labor Code and an Intellectual Property Law were passed by Congress in 1994. 30. The Government seeks to reduce poverty through increased job opportunities and the improvement of the social safety net with a larger role of nongovernment organizations. Also, health and education services have been decentralized to improve targeting and increase efficiency. The Social Investment Fund (FIS) expanded its investment program by 22 percent in 1995, with almost a quarter of the-program financed by external grants. The Government's strategy is to expand the social safety net, using the services of the Government, the communities, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, and municipalities. Four principles will guide the strategy: targeting resources on those who need it the most; decentraliza- tion; participation of the private sector and communities; and the modernization of the social institutions. This strategy includes actions to help develop human capital; programs of support to families and vulnerable groups; improving basic social infrastructure; and increased access to housing, credit, land, and social security. For 1996, the Government plans to merge into a National Development Fund (FONDES) three existing social programs: FIS, Municipalities in Action, and the National Secretariat for Reconstruction, with a view to consolidating efforts in this area and reducing administrative costs. 31. In order to achieve sustained economic growth, the Government is taking steps to protect the environment through legislation and education as well as through recycling. The Government's environmental strategy being considered by the Assembly includes an environmental impact analysis for all projects and public works, and a plan for environmental education. In 1995, the environmental agency initiated a series of television advertisements to raise public awareness on these matters. 32. Medium-term balance of payments projections indicate that, with the continued implementation of appropriate economic policies, the external current account deficit (including official transfers) would decline from 2.2 percent of GDP in 1996 to about 1.0 percent by 2001. Taking into account project disbursements likely to be available from bilateral creditors and multilateral agencies, the balance of payments is projected to show overall surpluses over this period. Public debt-service payments would remain at about 9 percent of exports of goods and services and private transfers. On the basis of these projections, El Salvador would not require debt rescheduling and should not have difficulty in meeting its debt-service obligations.
