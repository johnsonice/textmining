Executive Summary 0 A weakened diamond market contributed substantially to a slowdown in real GDP growth from an average of 10 percent a'year during the 1980s to an average of 3 percent a year during the period 1991/92-1994/95. At the same time, the fiscal position worsened sharply, mainly because of the steep fall in diamond revenue and continued expenditure growth. However, 'since 1993 a tight monetary policy has contributed'to a moderation in broad money growth and inflation, as well as positive real lending,interest rates. By end- 1994, foreign reserves equivalent to 28;months of imports had been accumulated. 0 The 1995/96 budget provided for.reduced income tax rates, and a moderate wage increase after no increase in 1994/95. Since late 1994, some public enterprises have been restructured or liquidated, important financial sector legislation has become effective, and significant measures have been taken to reduce costs and improve cost recovery for public sector services. The exchange system was liberalized, and on November 17, 1995 Botswana accepted the obligations of Article VIII. A new medium-term strategy is emerging to reduce the role of Government, and enhance private sector participation in the economy. 0 For 1995/96, real GDP growth is projected to recover to 7.7 percent, reflecting diamond output expansion, and better prospects for a broad range of exports to South Africa and for exports of nondiamond minerals. Medium- term growth is projected at 4-5 percent, constrained by slower growth in diamonds from 1996/97 onward. The revised fiscal estimates show a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP, contributing to an acceleration in broad money growth to an estimated 10 percent. Inflation is edging upward and is now higher than in South Africa. The real effective exchange rate has remained fairly stable since 1993. Better export performance and earnings on external reserves should improve the external position in 1995. 0 Given the prospect for lower growth rates for real GDP, exports, and government revenue toward the'end of the current decade, the discussions focused on economic policies necessary to enhance a diversified development of private sector activity. The various steps taken to enhance the climate for private sector investment are welcome, including the acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII and the authorities' efforts to strengthen the role of the investment promotion agency in attracting investors to Botswana. 0 In the fiscal area, the focus of the discussions was on the measures required to restrain public expenditure by reducing the costs and improving the efficiency of providing government services, as well as to reduce dependency on revenue from diamonds. Moreover, the contribution that a more cautious fiscal policy stance could make to ensuring monetary restraint and achieving a reduction in the inflation rate was stressed by the staff.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Botswana were held in Gaborone 'during the period November 6-21, 1995. 1/ Botswana has not made use .of Fund resources, but has instead maintained a strong creditor position in the Fund and has been included in the operational budgets for transfers since 1984. The country has also made a deposit equivalent to US$lO million for the benefit of the subsidy account of the extended and enlarged enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). Botswana accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement effective November 17, 1995, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for the multiple currency practice under the Government's Foreign Exchange Risk Sharing Scheme. The latter scheme was discontinued in 1990 and repayments of the last loan under the scheme are scheduled to end in 2006. Summaries of Botswana's relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are presented in Appendices IV and V. Botswana is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation was.concluded on November 21, 1994 (SM/94/266). At that time, Directors expressed concern about the weakening fiscal position and underscored the need to promote productive investment, diversify the economic base, and implement restrained macroeconomic policies in order to moderate increases in prices and wages. Directors welcomed the authorities' lifting of a number of restrictions on current international transactions and commended them for their participation in the ESAF Subsidy Account. The Botswana authorities report a limited set of core monthly data to the Fund reasonably promptly, but other data are provided with considerable lags, particularly with' respect to national income accounts. Much of this information is also made public. Statistical information is generally of good quality, but there are weaknesses in a number of areas, including the lack of information on economic activity and the public sector outside of the central government, years. Z?/ and problems due to the multiplicity of accounting lJ The mission consisted of Mr. Kibuka (head), Mr. Chirwa, Mr. Franks, Mr, Mordi, Mr. Oumi, and Mr. Maynard as assistant (all AFR). The mission met with the Honorable Festus Mogae, Vice President and Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Mr. H.C.L:Hermans, Governor, Bank of Botswana Mr. 0. Matambo, Permanent Secretary, Planning, Ministry of Finance and Development' as well as with other senior government officials, and with representatives of the private sector. 2/ Appendices VI and VII contain further details.

Developments through 1994 Botswana's overall economic performance is dominated by developments in the diamond sector, which by 1990 accounted for about 30 percent of.GDP, nearly 80 percent of exports, and 55 percent of central government revenue. The economy experienced exceptionally high growth in real GDP, averaging 10 percent a year during the 1980s--largely reflecting the opening up of the mineral sector and, in particular diamond production. Government participation and incentives were used to,initiate production and export of soda ash and copper-nickel matte, while the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) was important in promoting mostly small and medium-scale manufac- turing. Prudent financial policies contributed to surpluses on fiscal and external accounts, resulting in the accumulation of foreign reserves, the equivalent of 20 months of imports of goods and services by end-1990. I/ Real GDP growth slowed to an average annual rate of about 3 percent during the period 1991/92-1994/95 Q--below the population growth of 3.5 percent. 2/ (Appendix Table 1 and Chart 1). This reflected the signifi- cant weakening in the diamond market in 1992, which resulted in the imposition of a sales quota on diamond exports and a lowering of produc- tion. A/ The growth performance was also adversely affected by the con- tinued weakness in other mining activities, and a slowdown in the manu- facturing and construction sectors. Because agriculture accounts for.only 5 percent of total GDP, the impact of recurring droughts on overall growth since 1991 has been minimal, though the rural areas were seriously affected. Between 1991 and mid-1993 employment suffered from the economic slowdown, as the private sector shed 12,900 jobs--5.6 percent of total formal employment, even as employment of Batswana in South Africa declined (Chart 2). The revenue generated by the diamond boom fueled a rapid growth of expenditure programs to improve the'infrastructure and provide incentives to promote economic.diversification. The economic slowdown of the early 1990s I/ The balance of payments data in this report are presented in the format of the new 5th edition of the Fund's Balance of Payments manual. Thus, some historical data differs from that presented in previous staff reports. L?/ The national income accounting year is July/June. J/ Provisional returns, based on the 1991 population census, indicate that the population growth rate may now be lower, in the range of 2.5- 3 percent. &/ The international diamond marketing cartel--the Central Selling Organization--imposed sales quotas of 75 percent of production capacity to shore up prices. This quota was subsequently raised in two stages to 85 percent of production capacity in July 1993, where it has remained since. s/ In 1991, Botswana's policy shifted from emphasizing food self- sufficiency to food security, which precludes subsidies and provides for producer prices to be adjusted in line with South Africa's import parity prices.

The fiscal outturn for 1994/95 was better than the balanced budget envisaged in the budget speech, as a revenue shortfall--largely from lower earnings on external reserves u--was more than offset by lower development expenditure and net lending to public enterprises, mainly as a result of implementation bottlenecks. Although the government's net repayment to the banking system at 3.8 percent of GDP was higher than budgeted, it was substantially less than in 1993/94. The sharp growth in net foreign assets of the banking system (averaging 46 percent of the beginning period money stock in 1993 and 1994) was offset in large part by the continued contraction of net domestic assets. Domestic credit.declined by 16 percent of the beginning period money stock in 1993, and by 32 percent in 1994, on account of the significant contraction in net credit to the Government by the banking system. Credit to the private sector moderated significantly in 1993, but grew by 11 percent of beginning period money stock in 1994. Reflecting these developments, the growth rate of broad money (M2) declined further from 9 percent in 1993 to about 5 percent in 1994 (Appendix Table 3). The aggressive sales of Bank of Botswana Certificates (BOBCs) during 1991/92, were eased over the subsequent two years; consequently, BOBC interest rates declined from their peak in 1993 of about 14 percent to about 12 percent by June 1994, where the rate has more or less stabilized. Simi- larly, the Bank of Botswana (BOB) rate was lowered in stages from 14.5 percent in late 1993 to about 12 percent (February 1994) and subsequently kept at 13.5 percent for the rest of the year, broadly in line with developments in South Africa and reflecting expectations of moderating inflation (Charts 4 and 5). Inflation, as measured by the end of period consumer price index, moderated to 9.8 percent at end-1994 from 12.7 percent a year earlier. Thus, the BOBC and BOB rates as well as bank lending rates remained positive in real terms; however, with bank excess reserves rising and limited competition, most deposit rates continued to be negative in real terms (Chart 6). In 1994, the value of merchandise exports (in U.S. dollar terms) increased by 9 percent largely due to a strong performance of exports of 1/ Botswana--along with Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland-- belongs to the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), which collects customs duties that are distributed on the basis of an arrangement last agreed in 1978, but is being'currently renegotiated. Payments in any year are based on estimated imports of two years earlier. 2/ A large part of the reserves was in bonds, whose value declined with the increase in international interest rates.

Import growth was limited to an estimated 3.5 percent, due to overall weakness in the economy. Never- theless, the current account surplus dropped sharply to 1.3 percent of GDP, primarily because of a substantial decline in the earnings on international reserves. Owing largely to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to other international currencies and the consequent valuation adjustments of assets held in other international currencies, there was a further increase in international reserves in terms of U.S. dollars to the equivalent of 28 months of imports of goods and services by the end of 1994 (Appendix Table 4). External debt outstanding at end-1994 amounted to US$681 million or the equivalent of 16.7 percent of GDP. The pula was devalued by about 5 percent in terms of the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of 1991, and there was an adjustment in the basket in July 1994, resulting in a further pula depreciation by about 3.5 percent in terms of the U.S. dollar. The nominal effective exchange rate of the pula depreciated by a cumulative 12 percent since the third quarter of 1991 through October 1995, reflecting the depreciation of South African rand in relation to the U.S. dollar. However, because inflation has been higher in Botswana than in South Africa, the real effective exchange rate recorded a cumulative appreciation of 4 percent over the same period, although it has been relatively stable since 1993 (Chart 7). 2. Outlook for 1995/96 Preliminary staff estimates indicate some increase in inflationary pressure to 10.8 percent at end-1995 and recovery in real GDP growth to 7.7 percent in 1995/96. The latter reflects largely the coming on line.of Jwaneng mine's fourth stream, which would boost overall diamond production capacity by 12.5 percent to 18 million carats. In addition, there are signs that leaner and more efficient firms are taking advantage of the recovery in South Africa to expand exports; a recovery in export commodity prices has improved prospects for the nondiamond mineral sector; and in early November 1995, the price for diamonds of 2 carats and above was increased by 5 percent. Hence, overall exports are estimated to increase by 8 percent in 1995. Although imports are estimated to also grow by 8 percent due to the economic recovery, the overall balance of payments should show a surplus and contribute to further accumulation of reserves. The 1995/96 budget called for a deficit of about 3.1 percent of GDP, a 14.6 percent increase in revenue (excluding grants) reflecting a projected recovery in customs receipts and returns on international reserves, and a 27.6 percent rise in total expenditure (including net lending -and an across- the-board wage increase). Tax reform measures included reductions in the effective company tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent (15 percent for manufacturing firms) and in the top marginal tax rate for individual income to 30 percent, while increasing the threshold income. As a result, Botswana has the lowest income .tax rates in the region. Grants under the FAP were exempted from income tax.

The projected increase in recurrent expenditure of 18.8 percent incorporated an 8 percent salary increase for civil servants that is below the rate of inflation projected for 1995/96 (after no wage increase in 1994/95). Development expenditure was projected to rise by 26 percent and included a drought relief allocation (P 43 million), equity injection and net lending to restructure or financially strengthen parastatal organizations (P 303 million), and a provision for the FAP of P 40 million to assist new small-scale enterprises. The revised estimates, prepared in November 1995, provide for a lower fiscal deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP on the basis of improved revenue estimates and lower expenditures. The wage bill is projected to be contained to about P 1,256 million or P 93 million lower than budgeted, as the Government has not been able to fill the 10 percent vacancies provided for in the budget. An underspending of about P 150 million is envisaged for development expenditure because of implementation bottlenecks, but will be offset by the Government's contribution to the restructuring of the Soda Ash Botswana--now Botswana Ash (BOTASH). I/ Broad money growth accelerated appreciably, and is estimated to grow by 10 percent by end-1995. While the increase in net foreign assets slowed in 1995, the increase in the net domestic liabilities of the banking system was even smaller, reflecting a reduction in net repayment by Government. The effective yield on BOBCs has remained virtually unchanged. Although the Central Bank raised the bank rate to 14 percent in February, it was eased back to 13.5 percent in September. Bank excess reserves have continued on an upward trend and nominal interest rates have remained below comparable rates in South Africa. In the recent period, inflation is higher in Botswana than in South Africa mainly because the latter has experienced a recent drop in food prices. III. Report on the Discussions The staff's baseline scenario medium-term projections (Appendix III), which are broadly in line with those of the authorities, indicates that real GDP growth in Botswana is expected to pick up to 7.7 percent in 1995/96, and to slowdown thereafter about 4-5 percent per annum during 1996/97-2001/02. The forecast slowdown in real GDP growth reflects a similar time profile for the growth rate of the diamond sector, which faces market uncertainties. The Government's fiscal deficit is projected to widen as a ratio to GDP towards the end of the current decade, largely because of a decline in the ratio of I/ Soda Ash Botswana has been financially distressed since the early 1990s because of the depressed world markets and, in particular, in South Africa, where other established producers were allegedly dumping.

The growth in private sector credit is expected to outpace nominal GDP growth. However, with the moderation in the growth of external reserves, . these trends in domestic credit are not expected to undermine monetary restraint and aggravate price pressures. Inflation would moderate to 8 percent in 1996/97 and thereafter. Influenced largely by developments in the diamond sector, and the projected demand for imports, the external current account surplus is forecast. to decline from 6.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 1 percent in 2002. As a result, the foreign reserves cover of imports of goods and services is projected to decline to approximately 20 months by 2002. This should be adequate given considerable unexploited diamond reserves as well.as low external debt (projected at 23.3 percent of GDP in 2002). In the baseline fiscal scenario, the Government's fiscal position improves during 1997/9S-1998/99 and thereafter weakens steadily to a deficit equivalent to about 3.5 percent of GDP by the year 2001/02. The initial improvement of the fiscal position in the late 1990s reflects an increase in mineral revenues, due to the gradual lifting of the CSO export quota on diamonds. Thus, central government revenue is projected to remain at around 39 percent of GDP through 1998/99. Over the subsequent.three fiscal years, the revenue/GDP ratio declines mainly because.of the slowdown in diamond revenues- While the baseline scenario provides for no change in current SACU revenue sharing arrangements, the SACU customs tariffs are assumed to be further reduced within the World Trade Organization.(WTO) context. Over the projection period,' the net effect of lower tariffs and,the growth of imports is estimated to yield a rate of customs revenue growth that is less than that of nominal GDP. Recurrent expenditure is assumed to be contained around 26 percent of GDP during the projection,period-.-with the wage bill held at about 9 percent of GDP (assuming cost of living adjustments for civil service wages of about 7 percent annually). Taking into account the need for some growth in government capital expenditure on the infrastructure, capital spending is to be held at about 13 percent of GDP from 1996/97 onwards. L/ In an alternative scenario A, which assumes a 10 percent decline in mineral revenue throughout the projection period, the deficit would rise to about 7 percent in 2001/02. This scenario would result in a faster depletion of international reserves to about 14 months of imports. Given this risk, the authorities have.been considering a more cautious policy of limiting budgetary access to, the returns on international reserves (Scenario B). In this context, they are working on a provisional fiscal profile under the National Development Plan for 1997/98-2002/03 (NDP a), 2/ which would seek to contain l/ Some of the key projects include the construction of a further 900 Km of roads, including the Trans-Kgalagadi highway to link to Namibia, the P 1.2 billion, North-South Carrier project to provide water security for lo- 15 years, and the P 460 million school expans,ion program to provide 31 new community Junior Secondary schools and 172 extensions. 2/ The authorities expect to finalize NDP 8 by April 1996.

The possible outcome under this scenario is roughly a balanced budget by 2001/02. Against this background of an eventual slowdown in overall growth, exports, and the fiscal revenue contribution of the diamond sector, the discussions focused on the macroeconomic and structural adjustment policies necessary to create an enabling environment for a robust and diversified development of private sector activity. In particular, in the fiscal area, the discussions focused on the scope for consolidation of public expenditure by reducing the costs and improving the efficiency of providing government services, as well as on revenue measures to reduce the dependency on revenue from the diamond sector. Moreover, a more cautious fiscal policy stance (as reflected in the baseline scenario) would benefit efforts to ensure monetary restraint and achieve a continued reduction in the inflation rate. 1. Financial nolicies The mission noted that the 1995/96 revised estimates of the fiscal position showed a cumulative weakening of about 13 percentage points of GDP since 1990/91. This reflects a tax revenue decline equal to 12 percentage points of GDP (almost entirely due to a drop in mineral tax revenue) and a rise in recurrent expenditure of over 5 percentage points of GDP. Some of the offsetting items were a decline in capital expenditure (3 percent of GDP), reflecting implementation problems, and net lending (5 percent of GDP). I/ The mission indicated to the authorities that the high dependence on mineral tax receipts has not been adequately addressed by alternative tax revenue measures to diversify the tax base. It urged the adoption of early measures to improve on the low tax compliance (45 percent for corporations), reduce income tax arrears (currently estimated at P 215 million), introduce unique tax identification numbers, and expedite the computerization program to strengthen tax administration. At the same time, it noted that the broadening of the coverage of sales tax, to include services, is essential to moderating the growth in household consumption and offsetting potential revenue losses from the ongoing SACU renegotiations and tariff reforms; this move would also bring Botswana closer to the goal of establishing a value-added tax in line with Fund technical assistance recommendations. The authorities concurred that there was scope to improve tax adminis- tration and explained that steps had been taken to resolve the technical problems in computerizing tax records. In addition, task forces had been established to clear tax arrears and upgrade the list of taxpayers. The inclusion of services in the coverage of sales tax was problematic given Botswana's high utility costs and the current effort to promote the tourist 1/ Mainly as a result of a policy to discourage direct lending to public enterprises, including raising lending rates to market levels.

VAT remained a long-term goal because of the dispersion of the population and poor record-keeping by most taxpayers. The mission noted that the increase in recurrent expenditures relative to GDP would have been substantially higher if the envisaged capital expendi- ture had been realized. With regards to efforts to restrain recurrent expenditure, the mission welcomed the measures, over the past two years, to limit the growth in the government wage bill and the broadening of cost recovery measures (Box 1). The Botswana authorities acknowledged that these measures had not been popular but were seen as essential to improve external competitiveness and enhance economic diversification. The authorities also explained that there had been delays in introducing a new formula-based grant system for local governments in place of the existing deficit-based grants due to technical difficulties, but the new arrangement is expected to be ready in 1996/97. Furthermore, the authorities indicated that a number of government functions, including those of the Central Transport Organi- zation (about 8,000 vehicles), the Department of Electrical and Mechanical Services, and the Department of Architecture and Building Services, all within the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications had already been identified for possible privatization. The mission encouraged the authori- ties, and they agreed that it is important to take advantage of the envisaged World Bank project on civil service reform and the existence of a fully functional Botswana National Productivity Center, to undertake a restructuring of the government establishment to increase efficiency and shift manpower to priority areas. The mission observed that the overall government financial position continues to be understated by contingent liabilities, particularly the unfunded civil service pension scheme. In this context, it stressed that urgent measures should be taken to complete the civil service pension study, as this would facilitate an assessment of the cost of the pension scheme and of the proposals for funding it, including in particular, through individual contributions. The mission also suggested that car and housing loan guaran- tees for civil servant',s should be limited or eliminated. I/ A contribu- tory civil service pension scheme, a more limited loan guarantee scheme (for cars) and higher consumption taxes should be seen as complementary in a package to enhance private savings. The Botswana representatives explained that these issues had been under review for some time, and while it was not easy to reduce entrenched benefits, the Government was determined to tackle the issues and also signal the private sector to follow suit. Given the important role played by public enterprises, the mission urged the authorities to expedite the establishment of the Public Enterprise Monitoring Unit in order to facilitate the formulation of policies to deal I/ The mission was informed that the government guarantees of civil servant's car and housing loans did not give rise to contingent liabilities since civil servants are obligated to take out private loan/mortgage insurance.

Cost Reduction and Recovery Measures l Public sector wage awards have been constrained with a zero increase in election year 1994/95 and an 8 percent increase in 1995196, compared to average inflation of 10 percent in that year. l Private sector wage awards settled by the Industrial Court for 1994 were limited to 6 percent and 5 percent for Debswana (operates the three diamond mines in Botswana and is owned in equal shares by Government and De Beers) and Morupule Colliery, respectively. Debswana awarded a 7 percent across- the-board wage increase and 2 percent for productivity in 1995. l The beef industry has renovated the Lobatse abattoir, renegotiated road, freight, and auditing contracts and reduced its labor force by over 10 percent, to realize lo-20 percent overall cost savings. l There has been a switch from self-sufficiency in electricity generation to participation in the regional pool for up to 25 percent of requirements; and the renegotiation of covenants have contributed to a 10 percent reduction in electricity tariffs. l A rationalization of telecommunication tariffs has resulted in a 5 percent increase in domestic tariff and an average 20 percent reduction in international tariffs. l Effective April 1995, a P25 airport passenger charge and airport parking fees were introduced. l Land charges to recover livestock rearing costs and to conserve grazing lands have been agreed. l Botswana and other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries have agreed to regional road maintenance charges to help defray the cost of repairs. l As part of the P 1.2 billion North-South Carrier Water Project, water tariffs are expected to be adjusted annually to fully cover costs. with problem enterprises, including the Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC) and Botswana Railways, and to encourage their commercialization/privatiza- tion. L/ The mission welcomed the recent liquidation of Soda Ash Botswana and its replacement with BOTASH--a debt-free enterprise that is now well placed to take advantage of the improved prospects for soda ash exports to South Africa. The recent completion of the restructuring program for the National Development Bank (NDB) and the closure of the Botswana Cooperative Bank (BCB) are also measures in the right direction and should contribute to greater confidence in the financial sector. The authorities were encouraged to expedite the report on an action plan for Botswana Telecommunications Corporation which should lead to greater competition, or outright privatiza- tion.

To reduce this risk. it noted that the continued sale o'f BOBCs, iricluding to the general pub.lic, could be.useful for absorbing excess liquidity and possibly induce banks to raise deposit rates., This out'come would be required for the projected moderation in inflation in 1996 and beyond. While agreeing that tighter monetary conditions would reduce the. risk of inflation, the authori- ties argued that Botswana may very well benefit from the lagged impact of the.rec'ent decline in South Africa's inflation rate.

Furthermore, the mission noted that the timeliness of data needs to be improved to facilitate early policy response and orderly adjustment. these areas, While acknowledging the need for improvement in the authorities explained that they have been making an effort to address the problems and were committed to making further progress, possibly with additional recourse to Fund technical assistance. 2. Exchanze and trade system and exchange rate policv Botswana's international trade policy, the framework of SACU, which is largely shaped within is continuing to undergo major changes. SACU external tariffs are being reduced over a six-year schedule under WTO arrangements; all surcharges, ranging from 5 percent to 40 percent, were eliminated effective October 1, 1995, and the duty on cars was reduced from 80 percent to 65 percent in September 1995. The authorities believe that the reductions in tariffs will result in cheaper imported inputs, which could enhance the country's competitive position. The authorities also confirmed progress with the ongoing SACU negotiations, having recently reached agreement on the democratization of the SACU decision-making process through the establishment of a secretariat. At the same time, various proposals for revenue sharing formulae have been tabled and Ministerial meetings are expected to consider them by early 1996. Botswana's preferential access to beef exports to the European Union (EU) is likely to be affected by EU's conversion of its levies into tariffs and the reduction in these tariffs by 36 percent, as well as by its plan to reduce other subsidized exports by 38 percent by 2000. beef prices in the EU may, however, The possible lower be offset by new opportunities for Botswana to take advantage of reduced agricultural subsidies and increase beef exports to the EU. this regard, The mission indicated that Botswana's success, in will be contingent on increased competitiveness of its beef in- dustry. that The authorities reported progress in this area (Box 1) and explained they had recently reached understandings to export beef to Norway.

I/ The current account was already free of restrictions, except for a multiple currency practice mentioned above. With respect to the capital account, resident individuals and companies are permitted to use foreign currency for portfolio and direct investment outside of Botswana. In addition, Batswana and companies can now operate foreign currency accounts at banks in Botswana. In welcoming these reforms, the mission encouraged the authorities to continue with a judicious pace of capital account liberalization. With resp,ect to the exchange rate policy, the authorities were of the view that the policy of pegging the pula to a basket of currencies had resulted in a fairly stable real effective exchange rate since 1993, and that external competitiveness had been maintained, including for the nontraditional exports. They felt that the exchange system had served Botswana well by also limiting inflatipnary pressures. The staff noted that the ongoing efforts to restrain public ,and private sector wage awards, the tariff reforms, as well as the tax and cost reduction measures, were also likely to have a beneficial impact on the competitiveness of nontraditional exports. In view of this and judging by the still strong external position, as evidenced by the substantial accumulation of reserves and the absence of a major external debt burden, the staff supported a continuation of the current exchange rate policy. 3. Medium-term economic strategy and structural reforms The mid-term review of the NDP 7 (1991/92-1996/97) was completed in 1994. It provided a candid assessment of the shortfalls of the plan, and outlined a new strategy, yet to be implemented, to reduce the scope of Government in the economy, curtail the growth of budgetary expenditure, and improve project im- plementation. This was further articulated in the Keynote Policy Paper for NDP 8 (August 1995), and President Masire's recent address to Parliament, both of which in addition, highlighted job creation, wage restraint, and improved quality of education and human resource development. 2/ The general thrust of the economic strategy has been reinforced with the third review of the FAP in 1995 with recommendations to target support to private sector firms which are likely to be sustainable in the long run, to reduce the potential for fraud, and to contain overall costs to the Government. A new Industrial Policy to be approved by early 1996, is expected to focus on the creation of an enabling and supportive environment for both manufacturing and service sectors. The mission welcomed the new economic strategy and the concerted effort to implement cost reduction and recovery policies and urged the authorities to extend the exercise to the housing sector, where rentals, particularly for low-income groups, are still heavily subsidized and Botswana Housing L/ The indicative limits for the current account consolidated allowance was raised to P 100,000 per person; and the limits on outward individual and corporate investment were set at P 100,000 and P 1 million, respectively. 2/ Address by President Masire to the first meeting of the Second Session of the Seventh Parliament, November 6, 1995.

The authorities explained that housing was a major problem because of the weakness in the market and the possibility of a large number of empty units if rents were raised substantially. A number of key infrastructure projects and other structural reforms are making good progress and when fully in place should have a far-reaching impact in consolidating the already favorable environment for private sector activity and key social services, including in the rural areas 1/ (Box 2). The investments in education and the ongoing review and improvement in the quality of health services should.benefit human resource development. background, Against this the mission cautioned the authorities on the potential adverse impact of a significant curtailment in development expenditure envisaged in the provisional fiscal profile under NDP 8. The authorities explained that this fiscal profile was one approach to addressing the high-level of government expenditure; details of the development expenditure profile will be put together in the next few months to provide a comprehensive review. Several institutional reforms in the financial sector (the restructuring of National Development Bank, the new Banking Act, and the Stock Exchange Act) should enhance the scope for financial deepening and efficiency in Botswana. The recent establishment of the Botswana Institute of Development and Policy Analysis augurs well for efforts to strengthen policy formulation and implementation and capacity building in Botswana and should provide, inter alia, important input in the formulation of NDP 8. The mission welcomed the bold measures to improve the investment environment in Botswana and urged the authorities to expedite approval and implementation of reforms to translate the Trade and Investment Promotion Agency into a dynamic autonomous institution, in new sectors to diversify the economy. capable of attracting investment The mission added that it is also essential to eliminate red-tape in all areas of public administration, and in particular in those areas which hinder potential investors. Coordination with the private sector received a welcome boost with the July 1995 inaugural meeting of the High Level Consultative Council (comprising public and private sector officials), chaired by the President; the mission urged the authorities to extend this initiative into a lasting liaison. Botswana's ability to develop and apply appropriate policy responses to the rapidly evolving economic situation in the region and the world at large, including the design of a medium-term strategy in the context of NDP 8, would be greatly enhanced by timely preparation of national income and trade accounts and other improvements in the statistical database. The mission pressed that measures should be taken to address these problems. 1/ A total of 57 percent of expenditure in the development budget for 1995/96 are for the Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing (covering mainly rural infrastructure development and social services), the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Water Affairs, and the Ministry of Education.

Staff Auvraisal The Botswana authorities have established a sustained good track record of implementing prudent macroeconomic policies, which contributed to the accumulation of international reserves estimated at 28 months of imports of goods and services at the end of 1994. However, since 1991/92 the country has suffered from a protracted economic slowdown, principally because of the weakened diamond market, while recurring drought has also hit the rural areas particularly hard. In these circumstances, the authorities have reinforced their resolve to pursue policies largely favoring an open economy, as evidenced by the shift toward greater regional dependency in the food and energy sectors and by the stronger efforts that are emerging to spur diver- sified private sector activity, inter alia, through further liberalization of exchange controls. Notwithstanding these new efforts, the significant real GDP growth projected for 1995/96 is not projected to continue in the medium term, even with somewhat improved near-term prospects for diamonds. Against this background, and in light of the stated objectives of further reducing the public sector role and encouraging economic diversification, Botswana needs to expeditiously create an enabling environment for robust private'sector activity. This would require, in particular, a strengthening of financial policies to contain inflation, while moderating and reorienting fiscal policies to curtail the Government's intervention in the economy. Improved macroeconomic policy coordination and timely provision of quality data would also contribute significantly to improved economic management, as would a bolder effort to promote Botswana to potential investors. The importance of a tighter fiscal policy is reinforced by the emergi,ng deficits in the baseline scenario and the recent steps to liberalize the external capital account and promote a greater regional integration of Botswana's,trade and financial sector. Fiscal consolidation will be important also for moving forward with the plan to limit the Government's access to the profits generated by the accumulated international reserves, retain a sizable portion in the proposed Pula Trust Fund, and use these resources to undertake long-term investment to benefit future generations. To reduce the dependency on mineral revenue, the reforms to strengthen the administration of the tax departments and to broaden the tax base, including the coverage of the sales tax,, should be pursued with urgency; it is encouraging that the authorities are taking steps to address problems in tax administration. On the expendi- ture side, the,re is a need to privatize some government functions, phase out the provision of civil servant loan guarantees, and restructure the government establishment to increase efficiency. Urgent steps should be taken to assess the cost of the civil service pension scheme and to initiate the funding of the scheme, including through individual contributions. Fiscal prudence must also be extended to local governments by a timely replacement of the current deficit-based system with a formula-based system for providing grants, to encourage them to raise additional revenue and exercise expenditure control. Considerable progress has been achieved with respect to public enter- prises. The staff welcomes the successful restructuring of BOTASH and the National Development Bank, the recent closure of Botswana Cooperative Bank, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - and the privatization of companies by the Botswana Development Corporation. This progress needs to be consolidated with an expedited establishment of the Public Enterprise Monitoring Unit, measures to strengthen the financial position of Botswana Housing Corporation and Botswana Railways, and further efforts to curb public enterprise borrowing from the PDSF and encourage them to access the market directly. In the area of monetary policy, the staff believe that greater efforts are clearly warranted to reduce excess bank reserves through further sales of BOBCs; such measures should benefit from further implementation of the MAE technical assistance mission recommendations and from improved monetary data. Greater coordination between monetary and fiscal policies would clearly be important, particularly as the potential'for capital flows is increased further. While welcoming the recent Banking Act, the staff urges the authorities to expedite passage of other financial sector legislation to promote a sound and more diversified financial sector that should enhance financial intermediation and benefit expanded private sector activity. With regard to the external sector, the staff welcomes the SACU tariff reforms and the extensive measures undertaken by the authorities to reduce taxes and contain wages and other costs to improve efficiency and strengthen external competitiveness. The recent liberalization of the exchange system and the acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement are commendable steps. Against this background and the continued strong external position of Botswana, the level of the exchange rate remains broadly appropriate. The staff notes the authorities' request for Fund approval of the multiple currency practice. In view of the authorities' definitive discontinuation of the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme in 1990, and their intention to eliminate the multiple currency practice arising out of the scheme by 2006, the staff recommends temporary approval of the multiple currency practice. Botswana is implementing important projects and structural reforms to enhance the private sector investment climate. The staff welcomes these steps and urges the authorities to complement them with a more aggressive and focused role for TIPA to bring investors to Botswana. Botswana's data remain deficient in some areas, especially with regard to the timeliness of compiling the national income accounts and some monetary statistics, as well as the multiplicity in the accounting years, which arise from inadequacies in the statistical system. There is a need to address these data limitations so as to facilitate economic analysis and policy formulation, particularly in the context of the medium term. The staff urges the authorities to take the necessary steps, with recourse to Fund technical assistance if needed, to improve these data. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Botswana be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - V. PrODOSed Decision The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Botswana's exchange measure subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Botswana conducted under Decision No. 5392-(7,7/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in EBD/95/168 and SM/96/5, Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice arising from the Foreign Exchange Risk- Sharing Scheme (FERS) applicable to outstanding external loans obtained by certain public enterprises before December 1, 1990, that is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. 3. In view of Botswana's definitive discontinuance of the FERS scheme in 1990, and of its intention to eliminate the above multiple currency practice by 2006 when the last loan under the FERS'scheme will mature, the Fund approves the retention by Botswana of the multiple currency practice until February 28, 1997, or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation with Botswana, whichever is earlier.

Real sector Over the medium term, GDP growth will be largely determined by developments in diamond production, which depends heavily on world market conditions. While there are uncertainties, the market prospects in the medium term seems to be improving. As Russia's sales of diamonds are brought within the framework of the Central Selling Organization (CSO), export quotas are expected to'be raised. Moreover, although demand from Japan has been weak, that from other Far East economies has become increasingly strong, while demand from the U.S. is gro&ng reasonably well. In the light of these prospects, the following assumptions on diamond production have been adopted. The installed production capacity is assumed to increase in two stages: (1) the completion of the fourth stream of Jwaneng mine in mid-1995 is assumed to raise the total capacity from 16 million carats to 18 million carats per annum; and (2) the adoption of continuous production, which improves operational effectiveness, as well as a possible shift to higher grade pipes is assumed to increase effective capacity by 0.5 million- carats,-per,annum, starting in 1997. Any investment to expand production at the Orapa mine is assumed to be delayed until after the projection period. The quota is assumed to be lifted gradually, from the current level of 85 percent of production capacity to 90 percent in 1997, to 95 percent in 1998 and to be abolished in 1999. On the basis of these assumptions, diamond'production is projected as follows: after a surge in 1995/96 (July-June), which reflects the.expansion of Jwaneng mine as well,'as arecovery from'production adjustment towards the end of 1994, the production is-expected to increase gradually from 17.2 million carats in 1995/96 to 18.5 million carats by !,997/98, and to stabilize at that level. Nondiamond mineral GDP is projected to grow by 3-4 percent in the medium term driven by a sizabl'e growth of soda ash production. The increase in 1995/96.is also partly due to a significant.increase -in copper-nickel production, which reflects recent increases in metal prices, as well as a recovery from a maintenance closedown of the mine in the first half of 1995. The agricultural sector is projected to grow at an annual rate of 1.4 per- cent. The manufacturing sector's growth is projected to edge up, from 5.6 percent in 1996/97 to 6.8 percent in 2001/02. Consistent with this assump- tion, as well as reflecting the completion of Trans-Kgalagadi Road and the recovery in soda ash shipment, the transport sector is projected to grow somewhat faster than 5 percent over the projection period. The growth rate of the construction sector is expected to recover initially to 5 percent, as construction projects in the water, road, and education sectors come on stream, and slow down later to a 3.5 percent growth rate. The water and electricity sector is projected to grow by 7 percent. The growth rate of trade and hotels, finance and business services, and social and personal services are projected to average 5 percent annually over the medium term.

After that, real GDP is pro- jected to increase by 4-5 percent per annum. ,As a result, moderate gains in per capita GDP are expected over the medium term. The projection for expenditure on GDP are hampered by lack of some key data after 1988/89. Tentative estimates prepared by the staff suggest that, over the projection period, both the government's and the private sector's fixed investment levels remain relatively stable as a proportion of GDP. 2. Fiscal sector The medium-term fiscal projections are largely influenced by assump- tions for diamond exports as well as the wage policy stance. Total revenue is projected to remain in the range 38-40 percent of GDP, of which mineral revenue increases steadily from the revised 19.2 percent'of GDP in 1995/96 (April-March) to about 21.4 percent by 1999/2000, .reflecting the progressive easing of the diamond export quota during the period 1997-1999, and a modest strengthening of diamond prices. Mineral revenues start to decline after 1999/2000, falling to 20.5 percent of GDP by 2002. The growth of customs receipts is projected to slow down, reflecting the net result of import growth, the ongoing tariff rationalization, and lowering of rates by South Africa. 1/ Sales tax revenue is projected to rise steadily from 1.7 per- cent of GDP in 1995/96 to 1.9 percent in 2001/02, reflecting administrative measures to improve collection. Other tax revenues are projected to remain constant as a percent of GDP throughout the period. Nontax revenue is projected to decline from 8.4 percent of GDP in 1995/96 to 7.2 percent in 2001/02, reflecting primarily a projected levelling off in the share of profits that the Bank of Botswana will transfer to the Government, after allowing for the expected growing cost of, interest on Bank of Botswana Certificates (BOBCs) and the levelling off in earnings on international reserves. Total expenditure is forecast to be contained in the range 40-41 per- cent of GDP over the projection period. Recurrent expenditure is expected to remain constant, as a percent of GDP throughout the period, reflecting a restrained wages policy, a tightening of budget controls, and the efforts to recover costs in government services. The wage bill is projected to remain around 9.4 percent of GDP--an assumption which is also consistent with a constant 3.5 percent annual growth rate in the civil service, and a 1.5 per- cent per annum wage creep. Implicit in these assumptions is that the growth in wages and salaries should remain below the rate of inflation, consistent with the policy objective of enhancing Botswana's competitiveness. L/ A 15 percent'surcharge on motor vehicles was eliminated and the tariff was reduced from over 100 percent to 80 percent in September 1994 and, subsequently, to 65 percent in November 1995. All surcharges were eliminated effective October 1. 1995.

The deficit nonetheless should then narrow to 1.9 percent of GDP in 1999/2000, reflecting the salutary effect of the easing of the diamond export quota during 1997 through 1999. Subsequently, the deficit is pro- jected to deteriorate again to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2001/02, reflecting the slowdown in diamond revenue, customs revenue, and property income tax receipts (Table I). Under the alternative scenario A, which simulates a 10 percent reduc- tion in mineral revenue, the fiscal deficit would worsen to about 7 percent of GDP by 2001/02. This would result in a much faster drawdown of the Government's deposits with the banking system and therefore, a rapid depletion of international reserves to about 14 months of imports. The authorities are still discussing changes in the Bank of Botswana Act, inter alia, to limit the budgetary access to profits from the invest- ment of the international reserves. In a separate development, which would however be consistent with the potential changes in the Bank of Botswana Act, the authorities have developed a provisional fiscal profile under NDP 8. Using the revised 1995/96 budgetary estimate as a base, projections based on this tentative fiscal profile were made (Scenario B). Domestic revenue is projected in the range 35-39 percent of GDP. Total expenditure and net lending is projected in the range 34-42 percent of GDP with capital spending declining from 14.2 of GDP in 1996/97 to 5.1 percent in 2001/02. The fiscal deficit as a result improves from 2.6 percent of GDP in 1996/97 to roughly a balanced budget position in 2001/02. 3. External sector The balance of payments projections are based on the assumption of both a recovery in the diamond market and improved performance by Botswana's other mineral exports. The 5 percent increase in the price of diamonds of 2 carats and above announced in early November 1995, is expected to increase the unit value of Botswana's diamond exports by some 2 percent in 1996. Better prices for copper and nickel are expected to lead to higher values of matte exports, while the financial restructuring of Botswana Ash and higher demand in South Africa are projected to increase export proceeds from soda ash significantly. For imports, the six-month data for 1995 were used to project imports for the whole year. From this base, imports are projected to grow 10 percent faster than GDP in 1996 and in line with GDP thereafter, reflecting economic recovery and imports of materials for the North-South Carrier Water and other projects. In spite of an assumed rapid growth in tourism and improved returns on Botswana's external reserves, the current account surplus is expected to decline in both absolute and relative terms, from the equivalent of 6.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 1.1 percent in 2002. The transitory improvement in 1997 through 1999 reflects the assumed removal of quotas on diamond exports in that period.

These results are of course very sensitive to the assumptions made concerning the behavior of exports and imports; serious problems in the diamond market, and/or increased import demand resulting from over-expansionary domestic demand policies, could erode Botswana's currently comfortable reserve position very rapidly. The balance of payments projections in pula terms reflect a full adjustment of the U.S. dollar/pula (and U.S. dollar/rand) rate to offset the differential in price movements between the region and its trading partners, averaging some 6-' 7 percentage points per annum. - 25 - APPENDIX III 4. Monetarv sector Liabilities to the private sector are projected to move in line with the growth rate of nominal GDP (implying a unit income elasticity of demand for money or constant velocity) over the period 1995-2000. The projections for net foreign assets and net claims on government were derived from the forecasts for the balance of payments and fiscal accounts, respectively. The 1995 estimate for claims on the p.rivate sector was based on outstanding credit to the sector as of end July 1995, and was influenced by the informa- tion that bankers provided about their efforts to curtail loans and advances, in response to their recent experiences with nonperforming assets. Claims on the private sector for 1996-2000 are projected to grow somewhat faster than nominal GDP to account for the expected relaxation of the restraint on credit extension by banks as the economy recovers. 5. Conclusion The above-described baseline scenario projects a recovery of real GDP growth in 1995/96, following the recent recession. However, over the medium term, even with optimistic assumptions concerning inflows of new private investment into nontraditional sectors, real growth in Botswana is expected to be less than l-2 percent per annum in per capita terms, through the year 2002. Influenced largely by developments in the diamond sector, and the expected demand for imports, the external current account surplus declines significantly as a percentage of GDP during the projection period. As a result, foreign reserves are projected to cover approximately 20 months of imports of goods and services by 2002. The ratio of mineral revenues to GDP increases in the late 199Os, due to the assumed lifting of the export quota on diamonds; thereafter, both mineral revenues and nontax revenues decline as a proportion of GDP. Largely reflecting these revenue trends, the Government's fiscal position worsens,.from',a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to a deficit equivalent to 3.5 percent of GDP by the year 2001/02.

The Fund takes this decision relating to Botswana's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with Botswana conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted .April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Botswana's multiple currency practice from the foreign exchange risk-sharing scheme applicable to external loans obtained by certain public enterprises before December l,, 1990 is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and.3: In view of Botswana's intention to eliminate the multiple currency practice by end-December 1994, the Fund approves the retention by Botswana of multiple currency practice until November 21, 1995 at the conclusion or the conclusion of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Botswana, whichever is earlier. IX. Technical Assistance The Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department (MAE) provided a resident expert to.the Bank-of Botswana in foreign exchange reserve manage- ment during 1989-91, and money market operations, 1990-91.. In February 1994, MAE provided further assistance in respect of money market development and monetary management. For the period 1991.February 1995, an MAE expert served as Deputy Governor at the Bank of Botswana, and since April 1995, an MAE-expert has been serving as resident senior reserve management advisor. The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) provided assistance to Botswana during April/May 1994 on broadening the sales tax base. A STA mission conducted during August/September 1994 provided assistance on the compilation of the balance of payments.

National income and product accounts have yet to be systematically made current. 1. Real sector (a) National accounts The final national accounts were until recently only available through 1987/88; for the period 1988/89-1993/94, provisional estimates were provided. Some progress has been made with the recent compilation of accounts based on questionnaires from enterprises for the years 1991/92 and 1992/93. The authorities indicated their determination to process the 1993/94 accounts by early next year and those of 1988/89 through 1990/91 by mid-1996. Thereafter, they expect to remain on course because personnel shortage and computing difficulties, which contributed to existing data deficiencies, have been resolved. Technical assistance has been provided by the British ODA and Sweden to improve the accounts. The parallel exercise yet to be embarked upon is that of rebasing the national accounts from 1985/86 to 1992/93 to take account of the transformation in Botswana's economic structure. The existing macroeconomic model (MEMBOT) is arcane. Efforts are underway, with the assistance of the World Bank, to replace it with RMSM-X and 123 (Computable General Equilibrium) models, which have so far been well received by the authorities, as a major input in generating internally consistent macroeconomic data that is also useful in generating projections. (b) Prices and emnlovment Monthly consumer prices, which are collected within the first week of each month, are published during the second week of the following month by the Central Statistics Office but are reported to the Fund with a six-week lag. The latest CPI data are for October 1995. Average wage earnings by sector are available through May 1995 while employment data is through September 1994. Some information on producer prices is available and has been reported through the third quarter of 1993. The reported index includes import prices as well as domestically manufactured products. With the new data standards that are being recommended by the Fund, consideration should be given to developing a set of domestic producer price indices that meet internationally accepted standards. Data on employment are collected twice a year and are published with lag exceeding one year.

More timely ,reporting is essential, 2. Government finance statistics Government finance statistics are available through 1992/93. Timeliness of the annual GFS data has been hampered by personnel shortages. There are in addition outstanding issues relating to social spending, and reconciliation of foreign financing with disbursement under foreign debt. The authorities' intention is to finalize the processing of the annual GFS data for 1993/94 and 1994/95 by early next year. Although there have recently been delays in providing annual GFS data to the Fund, the monthly fiscal data provided for publication in IFS is more timely--for example, the December 1995 edition of IFS includes monthly data through March 1995. 3. Monetarv statistics The monetary survey is produced with a two-month lag, mainly because of the length of time it takes various fund managers who manage Botswana's substantial foreign exchange reserves to provide all the necessary information to the Bank of Botswana. The latest monetary survey relates to August 1995. The authorities indicated that efforts are underway to reduce the lag though they conceded that technical difficulties,in this area should not be underestimated. Interest rates are available through September 1995. ., ,:. 4. Balance of navments Quarterly foreign trade data are published by the Central Statistics Office. Import and export data are available through June 1995. However, complete data on the balance of payments are available through December 1994. STA provided technical assistance to Botswana in August/September 1994 on the compilation of balance of payments data against the background of ongoing liberalization of the payments' system. Balance of payments data are now based on BPM5 and are compiled on an annual basis. It would be more helpful for analytical purposes if quarterly data could be compiled. 5. External debt There are major discrepancies between the data on public external debt provided to the mission and that collected by the IBRD's Debt Reporting System--especially as regards debt outstanding to the IBRD itself. This issue will require further work.
