Real GDP in 1999 contracted by close to 1 percent, prolonging a stagnation that spans most of the past two decades. This stagnation can be attributed to serious deficiencies in infrastructure, a neglect of health and education, and pervasive governance problems. In 1999, the economy was further weakened by deteriorating terms of trade and the devaluation of the Brazilian real. At the same time, the country does not exhibit major macroeconomic imbalances, as inflation is around 5 percent, the external current account is in the l-l l/2 percent of GDP range, and the public debt is below 30 percent of GDP. However, this situation may change given growing deficits in the consolidated public sector, which by 1999 had widened to about 1.8 percent of GDP. A crisis in the banking system between 1995 and 1998 abated during 1999, as progress was made in the resolution of the problems of failed banks. Nevertheless, the crisis contributed to the economic downturn and complicated the management of monetary policy. The new government that took office in March has set economic reactivation as its main priority. The financing constraint of the government has been relaxed with the receipt of a loan from Taiwan Province of China in July. The loan carries exceptionally favorable terms and is equivalent to more than 5 percent of GDP. The staff is concerned about the authorities’ emphasis on increased current spending and stressed instead the importance of using the foreign loan to alleviate the deficiencies in infrastructure. The staff also advised strongly against the authorities’ plans to relax prudential regulations on banks in order to promote the economic recovery. Because of the intended utilization of the foreign loan, the deficit of the public sector in 2000 is projected to remain at around 2 percent of GDP. Given the lack of support from fiscal policy, the authorities will need to make active use of the interest rate and exchange rate policies to maintain inflation under control while avoiding a damaging loss of international reserves. A depreciation of the Guarani by 10 percent in June 1999 was insufficient to offset the effects of the devaluation of the real, and the authorities plan to allow the Guarani to depreciate further in early 2000. The new government prepared a comprehensive program of structural reforms for the years 2000-03; this program, however, lacks a specific time schedule, and the considerable opposition to it by vested interests casts doubts about its chances of implementation.

The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions with Paraguay were held in Asuncion during October 25-November 4, 1999.’ Paraguay has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 8, 1999 (F&l/98/277 and SM/98/282). On that occasion, Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability, but stressed the need to resolve the problems in the financial sector and cautioned against a further loss of international reserves. They recommended flexibility in the use of exchange and interest rates and expressed concern about the slow pace of structural reform. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTS 2. Paraguay’s economy does not exhibit major macroeconomic imbalances, but it continues to register a disappointing growth performance. Real GDP in 1999 was estimated to have contracted for a second year in a row, prolonging a stagnating trend that spans most of the past two decades. Real income per capita in 1999 was at about the same level as in 1980. However, inflation is in single digits, the external current account deficit is in the l-l % percent of GDP range and, reflecting generally small deficits in the public finances, the burden of the public debt is still relatively low. Economic developments in 1999 were significantly shaped by a change in government in late March, following grave political disturbances. 3. The economic stagnation can be attributed to the slow progress made in regard to structural reforms, particularly to the maintenance of an inefficient state sector, rigid labor market regulations, and a cumbersome judicial system. Deficiencies in infrastructure, neglect in the areas of health and education, and pervasive governance problems also have inhibited productivity growth. There is a large informal economy, based mainly in contraband but extending also to undeclared domestic activities. Such activities result not only in tax evasion and in a large unprotected segment of the work force, but also spawn corruption and distort incentives to legitimate productive activities. 4. Real GDP is expected to drop by close to 1 percent in 1999 (Table 1). Since 1995, economic activity had been adversely affected by difficulties in the banking system that eroded confidence and disrupted the payments system. In 1999, although the banking situation stabilized, the adverse trends were reinforced by a deterioration of the terms of trade, the economic downturn in the region, and the devaluation of the Brazilian real, which ’ The staff mission comprised Thomas Reichmann (head), Benedikt Braumann, Juan Carlos Jaramillo, and Eva Jenkner (all WI-ID). The mission was assisted by Hem&n Mejia, resident advisor from MAE to the Central Bank of Paraguay.

Reflecting the weakness of domestic demand, the 12-month rate of consumer price inflation fell to 4.6 percent in November 1999 (Figure l), while the rate of urban unemployment increased from 10% percent in 1997 to 11% percent in 1998 and is deemed to have risen further in 1999. 5. Beginning in 1997, the overall balance of the consolidated public sector slipped into a small deficit, that by 1999 has widened to an estimated 1.8 percent of GDP (Table 2). Considering the impact of the recession on tax revenues, the fiscal impulse during the last two years was roughly neutral. The central government typically records a deficit, offset in whole or in part by a surplus in the social security system, which benefits from the demographics of a young and growing population. The public enterprises are nearly all monopolies (electricity, telecommunications, water and sanitation, and petroleum) and also have been recording small deficits since 1997, reflecting increased capital spending and insufficient tariff adjustments. 6. After strengthening briefly during the latter part of 1998, the financial position of the central government weakened again in 1999 as efforts to reduce tax evasion slackened and the recession took its toll on revenues (Table 3). Expenditure restraint was nonetheless maintained during the first nine months of the year. In the last quarter, however, the fiscal situation changed dramatically with the receipt of a US$400 million loan obtained in Taiwan Province of China in July. The loan was equivalent to more than 5 percent of GDP and carried exceptionally favorable terms-l percentage point over LIBOR with 20 years maturity. Most of the loan was intended to be used in the course of 2000, but about one fourth of it was already utilized in 1999 to settle arrears on public works, pay guarantees to depositors in failed banks, and provide subsidized credit to cotton and soybean farmers. Altogether, the deficit of the central government was estimated to rise to around 2% percent of GDP in 1999, from 1 percent in 1998. 7. The social security institute (IPS), manages both the health and pension systems for the private sector. Rising wage expenditures, high costs from inefficient management, and poor investment decisions reduced the surplus of IPS, endangered its medium term viability, and impaired the quality of its services. Notably, since IPS had placed around 50 percent of its assets in banks that were later intervened, it has not been earning interest on them during the last two years. In addition, the institute registered heavy losses in the banks that were closed, in direct credits to firms, and in low-yielding real estate investments. 8. The crisis in the banking system abated during 1999, as progress was made in the resolution of the problems of failed banks. Between 1995 and 1998, the crisis had resulted in the closure of 13 domestic banks (representing about a third of deposits) and a number of other financial institutions. The affected entities were typically insufficiently capitalized and poorly managed, and operated in an environment of weak supervision and lax enforcement of prudential regulations, particularly in regard to related lending. New banking laws, approved in 1995-96, improved the legal framework for prudential regulation and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Figure 1.

By 1999, only a handful of domestic banks remained, and most deposits had moved to foreign-owned banks, which are generally healthy. The downturn in economic activity and high real lending rates in 1999 put renewed strains on the quality of the loan portfolio of banks. However, the deterioration reflected for the most part the weak performance of the sole remaining public bank, the Development Bank (BNF), with the private banks, although showing some weakening, still maintaining reasonable soundness indicators (Figure 2). 9. The banking crisis and the progressive, albeit slow, deterioration of the fiscal position created increasing difficulties for monetary policy. The assistance required by failing banks and the drawdown of public sector deposits resulted in rapid increases in central bank credit (Table 4). At the same time, the banking crisis, the weakening of the public finances, and the continued recession eroded public confidence and led to a move away from Guarani- denominated assets. To limit the growth of its net domestic assets, the central bank sharply stepped up the placement of short term securities. Nevertheless, it has been losing foreign exchange reserves. By June 1999, reserves had fallen by 45 percent from their peak in 1995, to around US$650 million (about two months of imports), while the share of dollar deposits in broad money increased over the same period from 3 1 percent to 55 percent. Interest rates on short term bills rose to around 30 percent by mid-1999, and the spread between lending and deposit rates widened to close to 25 percentage points, reflecting the increased uncertainty and the deterioration of the bank’s loan portfolio. Nevertheless, in the latter part of the year, the boost to international reserves provided by the receipt of the loan obtained in Taiwan Province of China reduced speculative pressures against the Guarani and permitted a decline in interest rates (Table 5). 10. The central bank continues to operate a managed float of the Guaram, adjusting the exchange rate broadly in line with the inflation differential with main trading partners. The adjustment is implemented mostly through discrete steps taken a few times during the year. The real effective exchange rate has fluctuated narrowly since 199 1. However, the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999 resulted in an appreciation that was not fully offset by a step-devaluation of the Guarani by 10 percent in June, and in real effective terms, the Guarani is estimated to have appreciated by around 10 percent during 1999. 11. The external current account deficit widened slightly from 1.2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1.5 percent in 1999 (Table 6). Exports dropped by more than 30 percent, as a result of the economic downturn in the region and a decline in the terms of trade by about 25 percent between 1998 and 1999, mainly due to low international prices for soybeans and cotton. The contraction of exports was only in part offset by a decline in imports related to the domestic recession. The value of re-exports fell by about a third in 1999, after border trade with Brazil was paralyzed for several months following the devaluation of the real. The capital account surplus increased from US$275 million in 1998 to US$581 million in 1999 as the disbursement of the large external loan mentioned above more than offset an increased outflow of private capital.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS 12. The authorities noted that when they took office in late March they encountered an economy in the midst of a severe recession, strapped with very high real interest rates and experiencing a rapid outflow of capital. Main export crops had been adversely affected by the decline in the terms of trade, a severe drought and the Brazilian devaluation. Moreover, the effects of the unfavorable external environment had been compounded by the uncertainties arising from the political turbulence that affected the country in the early part of the year. 13. The authorities indicated that since April the new government had re-oriented economic policy. The Guarani had been permitted to depreciate and, with the subsequent disbursement of the loan from Taiwan Province of China, the foreign exchange market had been stabilized, while interest rates on central bank bills had been reduced significantly. Since the economy remained stagnant, the government’s priority was to induce the upturn of economic activity through stepped-up government expenditure, now made possible by the new external loan. They also expressed the view that a return to growth would require the removal of impediments to bank lending imposed by what they considered over-zealous prudential regulations. 14. At the time of the discussions, the authorities were putting the final touches on an economic program for 2000-03. The program would include the downsizing of the central government, changes in tax legislation, privatization of major public enterprises, and a reorganization of public financial institutions. At the same time, it would seek to reduce corruption, improve governance and provide adequate incentives for private sector growth. The authorities explained that the announcement of the program had been delayed because of the need to build national consensus around it, notwithstanding that the current coalition enjoyed a broad majority in Congress. They acknowledged that this delay-in a context of increased availability of external resources-had created a sense of inaction that had led special interest groups to garner political support for particular spending initiatives. As a result, the government had lost flexibility in the allocation of the external loan while legislation to ease existing prudential regulations in the banking sector had gained support. 15. The mission disagreed with the authorities’ emphasis on current expenditures and regulatory forbearance to promote economic activity, and stressed instead the importance of assigning the foreign loan to alleviate the country’s many deficiencies in physical and social infrastructure, and of maintaining discipline in the financial system. The mission emphasized that, with its resource endowment, Paraguay’s attainment of sustainable growth was largely a matter of policy resolve and overcoming the damaging governance problems that shackled the system with inefficiencies and rigidities, and in this context it advised strongly against Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- any relaxation of prudential regulations on banks. The mission was of the view that economic activity was in any case likely to pick up, given the upturn in the region expected next year, moderately improved terms of trade, and the impulse provided by the utilization of the external loan. In these circumstances real GDP was projected to grow by about 2.3 percent in 2000, with inflation maintained at single digit levels, and the external current account deficit narrowing to about 1 percent of GDP, mainly in response to increased demand from Brazil and Argentina. A. Fiscal Policy 16. The staff noted that the budget proposal for 2000 included unrealistic estimates of revenues and expenditures*. The authorities acknowledged that the figures were overestimated and indicated that in practice their expenditure decisions would be largely dictated by the actual evolution of tax revenues and the availability of external financing for the public sector. They stressed that despite similar shortcomings in the budget process in recent years, expenditure had remained under control. The staff recognized that expenditure restraint had indeed been maintained, but noted that the budgetary process had progressively lost significance as a macroeconomic policy tool, and that although this approach provided considerable discretion to the executive branch, it tended to bypass the legislative oversight of public expenditure and reduced transparency in the public finances, making it difficult to assess needs and prioritize expenditure. The authorities undertook to work with congress to adopt a more adequate budgetary process in the future. 17. The risk that the loose budget constraint could result in a poor allocation of resources had been heightened by the disbursement of the loan from Taiwan Province of China and the expectations of new spending it had awakened. The staff urged the authorities to resist such pressures and to work towards the restoration of a fiscal position compatible with internal price stability and a sustainable external debt position. To this end, and on the basis of a more conservative estimate of revenues, the staff suggested that the authorities limit the central government’s deficit in 2000 to no more than Guarani 600 billion (2.1 percent of GDP). The authorities acknowledged that with the new loan, Paraguay’s external public debt was emerging as a potential problem, but indicated that this debt, at US$2.1 billion, was still low in relation to GDP (28 percent), especially considering that the government had no net domestic debt.3 They agreed, nevertheless, on the need for an early adjustment of the fiscal * The draft budget assumed that revenues in 2000 would increase by 40 percent over the likely outcome of 1999, allowing for a correspondingly large increase in expenditures. 3 Including its deposits in the banks, the public sector actually has a net creditor position. However, the Central Bank is undercapitalized and there is a potentially large unfunded liability in the Social Security Institute.

Paraguay’s tax system-based mainly on customs receipts and unevenly applied value added and corporate taxes-results in an overall tax burden that, at around 11 percent of GDP, is one of the lowest in the region. The authorities noted that in first instance they would seek to increase tax revenues by clamping down on tax evasion, and generally by improving other areas of tax administration. In the medium term, and as indicated in their economic program, they intended to change tax legislation with a view to close certain important loopholes in the existing system, such as the exemptions of corporate tax and VAT included in Law 60/90.4 The mission encouraged the authorities to be more ambitious in this area and move to implement the recommendations made by FAD’s recent tax mission, including establishing a personal income tax, restructuring the land tax, and widening the base of the VAT. The mission stressed that these measures, particularly the land tax and the personal income tax (with suitable deductions) could help reduce income inequality. 19. As regards expenditures, the mission emphasized the need to shift expenditures towards investment in physical and social infrastructure. There are major deficiencies in the provision of health and education services that needed to be addressed to raise basic social indicators to the level of other countries in the region, while the country’s physical infrastructure is in need of repair and upgrading. To make room for these outlays, there would be a need to cut other current expenditures, in particular outlays on wages and pensions, which during the present decade had more than doubled as a percent of GDP, to 12 percent in 1999. The authorities explained that public sector wage increases for 2000 were still under discussion, but added that the government would favor a proposal by which a planned 10 percent increase would be limited only to employees earning less than G 1.5 million (US$450) per month. The authorities acknowledged that legal obstacles, such as Law 200 governing public sector employment, were a factor that impeded the reduction of the public workforce, and noted that the government was promoting legislation to relax those obstacles. They also noted that their Economic Program 2000-03 contemplated the reform of the pension fund of the central administration, as well as those of other public entities, with a view to restoring operational and actuarial balance to these funds. Finally, they reiterated their intention to exercise restraint in the day-to-day execution of the budget, limiting expenditure in 2000 to the availability of noninflationary financing. 20. The authorities indicated that they would not adjust public tariffs until early in 2000. The staff noted that the delays in public tariff adjustments had created financial difficulties in the public enterprises, and emphasized that although such increases should not substitute for 4 Law 60/90 offers a five-year tax holiday to foreign fnrns investing in Paraguay, whereby they are exempted from 95 percent of the corporate income tax as well as from the VAT.

Furthermore, the staff cautioned against concentrating all major price adjustments-wages, public sector tariffs, exchange rate, and interest rates-during the first quarter of the year. B. Monetary Policy and Banking Issues 21. The staff noted that the strengthening of the international reserve position after the arrival of the large external loan in July had reduced the speculative pressure against the Guarani present in the first half of the year, and had permitted some decline in interest rates, underscoring the importance of maintaining international reserves at a level that provides confidence to the market. The authorities would thus need to strike a careful balance throughout 2000 between allowing the partial utilization of the loan to finance the government’s efforts to reactivate the economy, maintaining the desired level of reserves, and keeping inflation at a single digit rate. This task would be particularly difficult during the first quarter of the year when, as mentioned, strong pressures on prices would result from the adjustment of public tariffs and of wages in the public and private sectors. 22. Furthermore, the authorities indicated that because the devaluation implemented in June had been insufficient to offset the effects of the devaluation of the Brazilian real, they intended to let the Guarani depreciate further to a more competitive level. Against this background, the mission assisted the authorities in the preparation of a monetary program for 2000 that aims to keep inflation below 10 percent and to contain the loss of international reserves during the year to US$lOO million, to a level of about US$900 million (three months of imports). The authorities acknowledged the importance of fiscal restraint to help the implementation of the monetary program, and the mission stressed the need to make active use of interest rates to avoid an excessive depreciation of the Guaram or a larger loss of international reserves. 23. The situation in the banking system was calm, despite the increase in nonperforming assets due to the recession. The ratio of broad money to gross international reserves, which had reached 170 percent at the height of the crisis in 1997, is estimated to have declined to 90 percent by end-1999. The authorities stressed that the private banks that had survived the protracted crisis of recent years, most of them foreign owned, were generally in good financial shape. A few minor institutions remained vulnerable, but they were being merged with, or bought by, stronger entities. The authorities noted that the liquidation of the institutions closed during the crisis was now reaching its final stages, and that the recovery of assets in failed institutions had exceeded original expectations, allowing to project that the cumulative costs of the banking crisis since 1995 (in terms of each year’s GDP) would be about 10 percent of GDP, as compared to 12 percent of GDP that had been estimated previously. 24. The authorities explained that, in order to facilitate the economic recovery, they had moved to suspend the effectiveness of the loan classification and provisioning clauses of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - banking law, so as to permit banks, especially the BNF, to refinance overdue loans in their portfolios. The suspension would be in effect for 240 days and would favor mainly farmers and industries that had been affected by the recession. Part of the proceeds of the new external loan would be utilized to finance this operation. The mission deplored the tampering with prudential legislation to attend to problems of particular sectors, and cautioned that regulatory forbearance was planting the seeds of further crises in the future. The staff insisted that, if unavoidable, support to ailing debtors should be provided through transparent budget appropriations. 25. The staff also questioned the suspension of the publication of CAMEL ratings of individual banks, but were assured by the authorities that the suspension responded to the intention of avoiding moral hazard-i.e., having the supervisory and regulatory agency publishing the ratings that would trigger its own intervention in the affected bank-and that the relevant information about the banks financial statements was being made available to the public through Banking Superintendency publications and through the intemet. The authorities also explained that the Banking Superintendency was currently in the process of setting up a system of mandatory bank ratings by specialized international firms, and that they expected that such mechanism would be in place within the next 12 months.

The authorities noted their intentions, as mentioned above, to allow a further depreciation of the Guarani during the first quarter of 2000 in order to recover lost competitiveness. At the same time, they explained that exchange rate policy was somewhat limited by the sizable dollar-denominated obligations (mostly domestic) of the private sector and by the large pass through effect of a depreciation. They took note of the staffs view that competitiveness should also be pursued through efficiency gains in the economy, in particular by improving conditions in regard to transportation, labor markets, and judicial security. 27. In the area of trade policy, the economic downturn in the region as well as the tensions associated with the devaluation of the real led to a resurgence of protectionist pressures and allegedly increased use of nontariff barriers by Paraguay’s partners in Mercosur. Nevertheless, integration continues. In January 1999, Paraguay implemented the third of the scheduled reductions of tariffs on intra-market trade; these tariffs will be completely phased out in January 2000. At the same time Paraguay will maintain until 2006 the exceptions it has been allotted with respect to the common external tariff. The mission found only scant evidence of nontariff barriers, and with tariffs in 1999 averaging around 11.5 percent (single average), Paraguay is rated as a “2” on the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness.

The Government’s program for 2000-03, although lacking specificity, is quite comprehensive, listing most areas of structural reform that have been identified as priorities, inter alia, by the IMF, the World Bank, and the IDB. In the area of privatization, the authorities intend to initiate the process with the least controversial public enterprise: the post office, which operates in an area where the private sector has already a presence of over 90 percent. The authorities intend to introduce legislation in congress, before the end of 1999, to permit private capital participation in the telephone company ANTELCO, with a view to diluting the public sector’s ownership over time. A regulatory framework to ensure transparency and competition has already been prepared. The authorities’ intention, however, could be frustrated by a labor contract that entitles current employees to large compensations if the ownership of the company changes; this contract is currently before the courts whose decision on the issue is pending. The authorities also plan to allow private capital and management in the water company CORPOSANA. The bidding for the restructured company is expected to take place next year, once the enabling law is passed by congress and the corresponding regulatory framework is in place. Finally, the authorities explained that before end- 1999 a new law would provide a legal framework for contracting-out road construction and operation to the private sector. 29. The National Development Bank (BNF) is slated to be restructured and, according to proposed legislation on the reform of the public banks, is to be combined with several other financial entities into a new development finance institution. The proposed legislation would remove nonperforming assets from the BNF and pass them to a trust that would manage their liquidation. It would also provide the new bank with the double role of a first tier (retail) and second tier (investment bank) institution, and would grant it several prerogatives, such as a monopoly on deposits of the public sector. While agreeing with the thrust of the proposed reform, the mission expressed reservations regarding the lack of transparency of, and the predominant role envisaged for, the new public bank. In particular, the staff insisted on the complete separation of the first and second tier branches of the new institution, and on eschewing any special privileges for the first tier branch that could give rise to unfair competition vis-a-vis the other banks in the system. 30. The staff stressed the importance of addressing the reform of the social security system (IPS) and of the labor market. Regarding IPS, officials at the entity commented that the government’s offer to provide treasury bonds, yielding 1 percent above inflation, to replace about 85 percent of the resources IPS lost in the banks closed during the crisis, would still leave a sizable loss within the social security system that remained to be addressed. The mission encouraged the authorities to commission an independent audit of the institution to assess its true financial and actuarial positions, before drawing up plans for its reform. Such a reform would most likely entail the separation of the health provision from the pension part of the system, and could in due course extend to the introduction of private alternatives to the public pension system. As regards labor markets, the authorities indicated that, as Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-IS- mentioned above, several proposals to modify Law 200, which imposes undue rigidity to labor contracts in the public sector, were being considered in congress. The staff noted that labor relations in the private sector also were in need of reform, particularly in regard to restrictions on hiring and firing, and the existence of a minimum wage, adjusted in line with past inflation, which was already too high by regional standards. 31. Social conditions in Paraguay remain precarious. As indicated in a recent official report,5 32 percent of the population lives in poverty, half of which are classified as extremely poor. Of particular concern is the worsening of the urban-rural gap and the increases in both extreme and general poverty between 1995 and 1997/98. The Gini coefficient for rural areas rose from 0.563 to 0.609, in contrast with 0.525 (1997-98) for Paraguay overall. The authorities agreed with the staff that public efforts to alleviate poverty should center around the provision of basic services and infrastructure, particularly education. 32. Paraguay’s statistics suffer from a number of deficiencies, which hamper their suitability for surveillance. These stem in part form difficulties in adequately covering the informal sector. Despite substantial efforts made by the authorities in recent years to improve balance of payments and national accounts statistics, some weaknesses persist. Also, there are problems with the coverage, consistency, and timeliness of fiscal and financial data. Technical assistance from STA in monetary and balance of payments statistics is slated to be provided in early 2000. 33. The central bank, the banking superintendency, the Ministry of Finance and the telephone and electric companies conducted a series of Y2K preparedness tests over the months of October and November, after several months of revisions and preparations. On the basis of these tests they announced that they did not expect Y2K related difficulties in the corresponding sectors. E. Medium-Term Prospects 34. The staff discussed with the authorities a medium-term scenario that describes conditions that would be consistent with growth moving gradually up to 3.5 percent a year, inflation remaining in single digits, and the external current account maintaining balance from the year 2001 onward (Table 7). This scenario assumes fiscal adjustment measures to ensure a gradual consolidation of the public finances, and that the required structural reforms are implemented at an early stage. 35. Real GDP growth in Paraguay averaged a little over 2 percent a year during the 1990s. This disappointing performance reflects stagnant factor productivity, which in turn 5 Robles, Marcos, “Pobreza y Distribution de1 Ingreso en Paraguay”, 1997198, Direction General de Estadistica, Encuestas y Censos, Asuncion, julio 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- can be attributed to the lack of infrastructure, inadequate investment in human capital and pervasive governance problems. Thus, for the scenario’s assumption of a gradual increase in the growth rate to become a reality, these issues will need to be addressed. In particular, there will be a need to reorient public investment toward eliminating bottlenecks, increase spending on health and education, carry out a comprehensive privatization, and seek other measures to help productive private undertakings, such as reforms in the labor market, and in the legal, regulatory, and administrative frameworks. 36. The structure of the public finances would change in response to the reforms. The privatizations would shift capital spending and the operational surpluses of the divested entities to the private domain, but tax receipts would pick up reflecting the larger base and tax administration efforts. With restraint in current expenditures-after providing room for outlays in the social areas- the overall public deficit would narrow gradually. Accordingly, the public debt would also decline, after peaking at over 30 percent of GDP in the early years of the projection period. With the adjustment in the fiscal position and some increase in private savings, the external current account would move into balance. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 37. Paraguay’s economy weakened further in 1999. Economic activity was adversely affected by the economic downturn in the region and by deteriorating terms of trade, but also by the uncertainties associated with political turbulence in the early part of the year, and subsequently, with the lack of clear definitions in the economic policy area. A matter of continued concern is that another year was allowed to pass without addressing the structural reforms that are critically required to set the country on a sustainable growth path. 38. While the economy does not exhibit major short term macroeconomic imbalances, the need to tackle fundamental reforms and to address the country’s grave governance problems looms ever larger. The authorities have elaborated a program for the period through 2003 laying out their main policy and reform intentions for the coming years. The commitment to reform implied in this program is encouraging, and the staff welcomes the attempt to widen ownership of it by taking time to seek a consensus around its main initiatives. However, the absence of a specific timetable raises questions about the speed of its implementation, particularly in view of the fractured nature of the country’s politics and the power of vested interests. 39. The large loan obtained on concessional terms in Taiwan Province of China provides the financial basis to tackle the needed reforms and, particularly, to alleviate the country’s deficiencies in physical and social infrastructure. However, the staff is concerned that, instead of seizing such an opportunity, the authorities intend to use much of these resources to engineer a temporary reactivation of the economy and to attend to the interests of particular groups. The loan has significantly added to Paraguay’s debt service obligations, and it is Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 17- crucially important that as much as possible of it be used to produce a lasting improvement of the economic situation. 40. Of special concern is that, together with using the new foreign resources to attain short term objectives, the authorities are supporting the loosening of prudential regulations in the banking system. Paraguay is just emerging from a costly and protracted banking crisis and it is especially important that the laws and regulations that were put in place in the wake of the crisis be respected, so as to foster the discipline required to prevent a repetition of the events that led to the crisis. The staff deplores the suspension of the loan classification and provisioning requirements, adopted to attend to the arrears problems of particular sectors. Regulatory forbearance carries the seed of a future crisis, and assistance to distressed activities, if needed, would be better and more transparently provided through the nation’s budget. 41. The practice, increasingly used in recent years, of overestimating budgetary revenues and relying subsequently on expenditure restraint to maintain the public finances under control reached new levels with the 2000 budget, to the point of removing all meaning from the budget as an instrument of economic policy, let alone of legislative oversight. The increased availability of foreign financing for 2000 makes this lack of budgetary control particularly dangerous, and the staff urges the authorities to exercise restraint and work towards a fiscal position compatible with internal price stability and a sustainable external debt position. 42. Fiscal restraint will need to be accompanied by a reordering of budgetary priorities that would reorient spending to more productive uses. The authorities will need to address the legal and administrative rigidities that impede the reduction of the public sector workforce and will also need to stand firm in their intentions of restraining wage adjustments in the public sector. The quality of public expenditure will need to be improved with greater emphasis given to spending on health and education and to investment in basic infrastructure. In regard to taxes, the staff urges the authorities to work towards a more efficient and equitable tax system, in particular, to proceed with the implementation of the recommendations of the FAD technical assistance mission of early 1999. The staff also encourages the authorities not to delay the restructuring of the Social Security Institute. 43. The drawdown of the new external loan as the authorities proceed with their spending plans will put additional strains on monetary policy. The authorities will need to strike a careful balance between providing the liquidity needed for the economic recovery, maintaining inflation under control, and avoiding a loss of international reserves that would erode confidence in the market. Because of the scant support that can be expected from the public finances, it will be important to allow for flexibility in the use of the interest rate and exchange rate instruments to attain these objectives. The depreciation of the Guarani in mid-1999 was appropriate, but proved insufficient to offset the effects of the devaluation of the Brazilian real. The intended further depreciation of the Guarani is well advised. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- 44. Durable gains in competitiveness, however, will require efficiency gains in the economy, particularly through structural reforms. Progress in this area has been slow, and much remains to be done in regard to the institutional modemization of the country and to improving the efficiency of the economy. The staff welcomes the intentions to revitalize the structural reform process included in the authorities’ economic program for 2000-03. In particular, the staff encourages the authorities to proceed with their plans to allow private participation in the equity and management of main public enterprises and to continue with the preparation of the regulatory framework that would permit the opening to private capital of the major utilities. There remain, however, other fundamental reforms in need to be addressed, including that of the public administration, both in regard to the civil service and the public pension funds, the public banks, judicial procedure, and the social security. As the economy opens itself to world trade, the rigidities embodied in present labor market arrangements will become more evident and will increasingly restrict growth and competitiveness; the reform of the labor market should not be postponed. 45. Notwithstanding recent efforts to correct deficiencies in a number of areas, Paraguay’s basic economic and financial data still exhibit weaknesses that hamper a meaningful discussion of macroeconomic policy. The authorities are intent on overcoming these difficulties and the staff encourages them to intensify their efforts to improve the coverage and timeliness of statistical data. 46. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Paraguay be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Real Sector National accounts statistics have a number of shortcomings, including the use of an outdated base for constant prices (1982), limited coverage of the informal sector, long publication lags, and the absence of quarterly information. However, major improvements are to be expected in 2000. With the technical assistance of a resident UN expert, Paraguayan national accounts data are being made compatible with current international standards (SNA93), which entails a fuller coverage of all industries, a finer level of disaggregation and a change in the base year to 1994. Also, the consistency with external trade and fiscal data will be improved. Both the consumer and producer price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis. The CPI has a base period of December 1992 and the PPI of December 1995. Employment statistics are published with a lag of more than a year, but now cover the whole country since a new household survey has been introduced. Wage indices are updated only twice a year. B. Public Finances Much progress has been made in the official data on central government finance. In particular, deficit estimates from the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance are now consistent, and are available on a monthly basis. The asset position of the social security system has become available on a daily basis, but information on revenues and expenditures needs to be integrated more closely with the Ministry of Finance. The reporting lag of public enterprise (up to three months) needs to be reduced. Despite these improvements, work remains to be done to restore regular reporting to STA, which has been interrupted since 1994. C. Money and Banking The Central Bank of Paraguay’s (CBP) monitoring of commercial banks is timely and accurate, but does not include other financial institutions that represent around 10 percent of M3. However, most of these institutions will be covered by a new database that will go in operation in early 2000. Data on credit to the public sector are subject to occasional revisions due to legal classification problems and the need to be reconciled with the fiscal data, although progress toward this end has been made in 1999. The Superintendency of Banks publishes a detailed report on the soundness of the financial system. The report appears monthly and can be accessed on the intemet. Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve money and banking statistics, the data remain deficient in some areas. In particular, the institutional coverage needs to be expanded to all depository corporations and other financial institutions, and the reasons for the considerable discrepancies in interbank positions reported are yet to be ascertained. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - APPENDIX II timeliness of reporting to STA for publication also needs to be shortened. STA has scheduled a technical assistance mission for early 2000 on money and banking statistics to address these issues. D. External Sector Paraguay’s balance of payments statistics are published on an annual basis, and the classification generally corresponds to the recommendations of the Balance of Payments Manual (5th edition). Significant improvements in the estimation of unrecorded and entrepot trade have enhanced the quality of the Central Bank’s trade statistics. Data on services have also benefited from a better measurement of informal sector activities. However, data on private capital remain deficient, especially since they fail to cover transactions of large unregistered mutual fund firms. These deficiencies are reflected in sizable and volatile errors and omissions. After important revisions, statistics on public sector external debt have been made consistent, but there are no data on private sector external debt. As requested by the authorities, a balance of payments statistics mission has been scheduled for March 2000. The mission will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the sources and methods underlying the compilation of balance of payments statistics, and will make recommendations in order to improve the coverage and quality of balance of payments estimates.
