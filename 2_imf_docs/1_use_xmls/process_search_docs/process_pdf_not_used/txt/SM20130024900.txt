Economic growth has been robust, and inflation has declined to single digits. The investment requirements of the GTP are large and securing the associated financing remains a challenge. Without greater scope for the private sector the realization of the GTP’s objectives could be elusive. Growth and inflation prospects: Real GDP growth remains robust and is estimated by staff at 7 percent in 2012/13 and projected to increase to 7.5 percent in 2013/14 and 2014/15 before tapering-off slightly in subsequent years under current policies.1 Inflation has been brought down to around 7 percent at end 2012/13 and is projected to remain in single digits. Policy mix: The discussions focused on policies to sustain robust and inclusive growth and structural transformation in the context of prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Staff recommendations centered on maintaining pro-poor expenditure, improving the investment climate, and adjusting the overall fiscal stance with the aim of creating greater room for the private sector to further leverage large public  investments. Enhancing external competitiveness and building adequate foreign reserves (to at least three months of imports) through greater exchange rate flexibility and improved productivity of the traded goods sector were recommended to enhance resiliency. Bolstering capacity at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) for the formulation and implementation of financial sector policies to promote financial deepening and broader inclusion were considered important for the realization of the GTP objectives. Risks: Persistent shortfalls in the financing of planned infrastructure investment and a tightening of foreign exchange availability could constrain medium-term growth in the absence of policy adjustments. A significant slow - down of the major emerging markets could also hamper development plans and robust growth.                                                    1 Historical GDP statistics are official data and are subject to significant weaknesses. Arms-length methodologies suggest Applying plausible factor productivities would suggest that the annual GDP growth rate prior to 2011/12 could be overestimated by as much as 3 percentage points (Annex 1).

Ethiopia: Urban Unemployment Rate(Percent of labor force, urban areas)Sources: ILO and Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency.2.      Income distribution in the country is relatively even. Among Sub-Saharan African countries, Ethiopia is one of the most egalitarian with a Gini coefficient of 33.6 (Figure 3) and it has consistently maintained this distribution in the last ten years. With a large population and more than 80 percent of it in rural areas, Ethiopia stands out among comparable African countries regarding relatively even income distribution, although there are likely differences between rural and urban populations.   3.      Economic growth has helped to reduce unemployment particularly in urban areas. While overall unemployment rate stands at about 25 percent, urban unemployment rate declined from 22.9 percent in 2004 to 17.5 percent in 2012 (Figure 4). In urban areas, both female and male unemployment declined and the large gap between the two groups has narrowed for the two years of available and comparable data (2009 and 2010). Unemployment rate remains particularly high among young females, with almost one third of them unable to find a job in the urban areas.  4.      A public sector-led growth strategy centered on high public investment has been instrumental in delivering these results. The strategy, which calls for substantial external financing and state mobilization of domestic resources, has provided an important impetus to growth. Combined with pro-poor spending that has averaged more than 12 percent of GDP over the past decade, this has helped improve living standards. Following the passing of Prime Minister Meles in August 2012, the new Prime Minister Hailemariam has reaffirmed the state-led model and the public investment plan embodied in the GTP. Developments in the first two years (2010/11–2011/12) of the GTP suggest that the required external financing is not materializing, and the investment drive in the priority projects through directed domestic credit is squeezing the availability of credit and foreign exchange for the rest of the economy.

The recommendations from the 2012 Article IV consultation have only been partially implemented. The authorities brought inflation down to single digits. While, owing to the decline in inflation, the extent to which real interest rates were negative have been reduced, positive real interest rates are yet to be realized and liquidity management at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) remains to be improved. Similarly, progress has been slow on structural reforms to allow proper functioning of financial markets; to liberalize the foreign exchange or improve the business climate. Much emphasis continue to be put by the authorities on improving physical infrastructure such as roads, railway, and electricity supply, which they believe would help improve business climate. The 2013 Article IV discussions touched upon these recommendations, which remain valid. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK A.   Recent Economic and Policy Developments 6.      Recent macroeconomic developments are encouraging, with a significant deceleration in inflation and continued robust economic growth (Figures 5, 6, and 7). Despite significant decline in coffee prices and supply bottlenecks growth remains robust, supported by better agricultural output and construction and other services activities.4 Inflation declined from the peak of 40 percent in July 2011 to around 7 percent in June 2013, lower than initially projected by staff. This has significantly eased the extent to which real interest rates were negative, reducing the severity of the distortionary effect on financial intermediation. Pressures resulting in foreign exchange shortages in the wake of the passing away of Prime Minister Meles, have eased, although the spread between the official and parallel markets is yet to be eliminated. 7.      Fiscal policy at the general government level remains prudent with cautious execution of the government budget. 5 Overall revenue-to-GDP ratio is estimated to fall from 14.0 percent in 2011/12 to 13.2 percent in 2012/13. Reflecting the strong pro-poor focus, the ratio of poverty-reducing expenditure to GDP is being maintained and non-priority expenditure will likely be compressed in 2012/13. Staff estimates the government budget deficit, including grants, to be 2.8 percent of GDP.                                                    4 GDP statistics in Ethiopia are subject to significant weaknesses. Arms-length methodologies suggest  Applying plausible factor productivities would suggest that the annual GDP growth rate could be off by as much as 3 percentage points in recent years. In the past two years, staff used its own estimates showing lower GDP growth. The methodology improved considerably in 2011/12 and the authorities are continuing efforts to further strengthen national accounts statistics. Staff has thus reverted to using official statistics, but has stressed the need to further improve national accounts data and offered technical assistance (see Annex I). 5 Excluding public enterprises.

However, public enterprises continue to expand their investment activities. Net credit expansion (through loans and corporate bonds) from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) to public enterprises (in the 10 months up to April, 2013) alone accounted for 3 percent of GDP. In addition, they borrowed from the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) and through bond issuance for the construction of Renaissance Dam, which is proceeding as planned. The dam is estimated by the authorities to cost 10 percent of 2012/13 GDP and is intended to be entirely financed domestically. 9.      An accurate overall fiscal stance for the consolidated public sector (including public enterprises) is difficult to gauge, although it would seem considerably more expansionary. While appropriately consolidated data on the overall public sector finances were not available, external financing of public enterprises in 2012/13 was 2.3 percent of GDP and the monetary survey indicates additional domestic financing of public enterprises from the banking sector of 4.3 percent of GDP in 2012/13, not taking into account the non-bank financing of the Renaissance Dam. This implies overall public sector (including public enterprises) borrowing of at least 9.4 percent of GDP in 2012/13. 10.      Although the monetary stance remains generally tight to keep inflation in single digits, recent developments point to some relaxation. Base money contracted by 4 percent in 2011/12, achieved by not extending any new NBE credit to the government and foreign exchange sales. Annual base money growth at end-May 2013 stood at 18 percent (compared to one percent contraction for end-May 2012) and the authorities adjusted only slightly the base money target for the year at 13 percent from 12.2 percent. The pickup reflects an increase in net domestic credit, net foreign assets, and in other items net. Achieving the 13 percent target implies a very tight monetary policy for the remainder of the fiscal year. The reserve requirement ratio has been further lowered recently (March 2013) from 10 percent to 5 percent, following an earlier (January 2012) lowering by 5 percentage points, and NBE sterilized the resulting liquidity injection through the sale of certificate deposits, reflecting lack of clarity in monetary policy decision-making. Broad money growth remains somewhat high and stood at 28 percent in 2012/13. 11.      The external current account deficit widened slightly to US$3 billion in 2012/13 from US$2.8 billion in 2011/12, reflecting a weaker trade balance, although it improved as a ratio of GDP from 6.6 percent to 6.4 percent. Export performance suffered from a decline in prices and weak external demand conditions, growing only 3.2 percent (in nominal terms), while continued infrastructure and industrial investment and higher fuel importation contributed to an increase in imports by 6.3 percent. Transfers brought in a net inflow of around US$5 billion due to a surge in net private transfers that more than offset a decline in official transfers. Increased loan Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTHE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA 8 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND disbursements to the central government and public enterprises yielded a capital account surplus of US$3.4 billion. The resulting surplus on the overall balance of payments was less than US$0.2 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) compared to a deficit of US$1.1 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) in 2011/12. The NBE’s gross international reserves slightly declined to US$2.2 billion (1.8 months of imports) at the end of 2012/13 from US$2.3 (1.9 months of imports) at the end of 2011/12. 12.      Foreign exchange supply came under pressure in the first half of 2012/13. The passing of Prime Minister Meles created uncertainty and excess demand in the foreign exchange market which was also reflected in a widening of the premium in the parallel market. Since its previous peak in October 2008, the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) reached the highest level in November 2012, indicating an erosion of competitiveness gains from previous devaluations which may also be a factor in the recent trade performance. This has started to turn around with the recent decline in inflation, although the REER may still be significantly overvalued based on the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate methodology (Annex II). B.   Medium Term Outlook and Risks 13.      Outlook. Inflation has been brought down to about 7 percent at end-2012/13 and is projected to remain in single digit over the medium-term.6 The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is projected to slightly improve over the medium-term, as exports recover after declining in 2012/13. Moderate recovery in external demand and ongoing efforts to improve productivity, increase value-added, and diversification of the export base (covering, for example, agricultural and agro-industrial, horticultural, livestock, light manufactures, and electricity exports) are expected to support export growth. Overall economic growth is projected to remain robust in 2013/14 and beyond but fall short of the highly ambitious GTP target. Constraints on external financing for public investment, uncertain external demand, and a cumbersome business environment are the factors underpinning the growth shortfall. Reflecting continued uncertain global environment and unchanged policies, the projected growth rate tapers-off over the medium-term falling further short of the ambitious GTP target. 14.      Risks. Key risks to the outlook include (i) a continuation of limited financing for infrastructure investment in the GTP; (ii) re-emergence of severe foreign exchange shortages;  (iii) significant growth slowdown in the major emerging market countries; and (iv) weather-related shocks, particularly a possible drought returning to the Horn of Africa (Table 1).                                                    6 Taking into account developments on the ground, in particular better than anticipated inflation at the end of the fiscal year 2012/13 and less severe negative real interest rates, staff has adjusted its projections, notably on broad money. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicCORRECTED: 9/26/13 THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND     15 18.      Policy discussions focused on sustaining robust and inclusive growth and structural transformation while maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability and mitigating vulnerabilities. Key recommendations include (i) rationalizing and appropriately pacing public sector investment, especially for state-owned enterprises, (ii) keeping inflation under control, eliminating exchange rate overvaluation, and restoring reserve adequacy; (iii) strengthening financial deepening and inclusiveness, bringing real interest rates to positive levels, and enhancing access to finance for farmers and small and medium enterprises; and (iv) increasing the scope for the private sector’s role in the economy (Table 1). The implementation of these recommendations would facilitate financial development that should enable less distortionary financing of the GTP that is consistent with debt sustainability. 19.      Staff has developed an alternative scenario that targets stronger growth while safeguarding macroeconomic stability and reducing vulnerabilities and that is consistent with the policies mentioned above (Table 6). Under staff’s alternative (adjustment) scenario, the growth rate is projected to rise to 9.5 percent in 2016–17 and inflation is targeted to decline further to 6 percent by 2014–15, as positive real interest rates expand the deposit base, the exchange rate is kept competitive, private sector access to credit from the banking system increases. C.   Fiscal Policy: Stance and Inclusion Fiscal stance 20.      The fiscal stance embodied in 2013/14 general government budget submitted to parliament recently is appropriately restrained (Tables 3a and 3b). However, despite the government’s revenue mobilization efforts, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall from 13.2 percent in 2012/13 to 12.9 percent in 2013/14. Reflecting the ongoing efforts to improve tax administration, the tax-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise but nontax revenue is slated to fall on account of lower dividends from state-owned enterprises. The authorities are relying on administrative improvements to increase revenue substantially. Staff encouraged the authorities to consider the revenue potential of reducing tax expenditure and tax incentives and improved tax collection, along the lines identified by IMF FAD technical assistance.8  21.      The budgetary focus on pro-poor spending has been impressive and the 2013/14 budget aims to strengthen this further (Box 1). To maintain the ratio of poverty-reducing expenditure to GDP, its share in the total expenditure will need to rise as federal government                                                    8 Since 2012 FAD undertook a series of TA missions, recommending rationalization of tax incentives and tax expenditures. Staff alternative scenario suggests that annual tax revenue gain ranges from 0.4 percent to 2 percent of GDP over the next five years.

Public financial management (PFM) reforms are yielding significant improvements in the budgetary processes. Program-based budgeting is in the second year of full implementation and cash management reform, with the aim of reducing idle cash in the various government accounts and improving the quality of fiscal reporting, is progressing well. Staff stresses the need to maintain the momentum in these areas. The IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department is prepared to provide continued technical assistance as requested by the authorities. Public sector debt 23.      The pace of accumulation of overall public sector debt deserves close attention. A rapid growth of credit to public enterprises to finance major investments in dams, factories, and housing construction continues to drive this buildup. The net worth of the government is thus heavily exposed to the direct borrowing by these enterprises and contingent liabilities stemming from such lending by CBE and DBE. Staff stresses the need for comprehensive and timely information on the financial position of public enterprises as part of the enhancement to the medium-term debt strategy. 24.      Debt sustainability analysis continues to show that Ethiopia remains at a low risk of external debt distress. It is predicated on a conservative disbursement profile that is considerably lower than the requirements for the full implementation of the GTP. Staff encourages the authorities as in the 2012 Article IV consultation to seek concessional external financing and reconsider the pacing of the investments if scaled-up external financing on manageable terms is not forthcoming and authorities intend to maintain their low risk of external debt distress. 25.      Domestic debt is rising and vulnerabilities will continue to increase as large public investments draw financing from domestic sources. Beyond a certain limit, such financing could be destabilizing and/or inflationary, suggesting that careful consideration should be given to the sustainability of the overall financing envisaged in the GTP. Consideration should be given to developing a comprehensive debt management strategy covering total public debt, including the debt of public enterprises, to improve public fiscal management and monitoring of the total fiscal stance.

To the extent that directed credit allows access to finance across selected industries and geographical areas, it could contribute to financial inclusion. However, significant segments of the economy, especially in rural areas, remain constrained by lack of access to credit. The conduct of monetary policy suffers from rigidity in interest rates and inflexible instruments to achieve monetary objectives. Changes in reserve and other requirements and foreign exchange sales are used for liquidity management and for achieving other developmental objectives. 30.      The NBE’s monetary policy stance has contributed to the decline in inflation. Inflation has come down to single digits with beneficial effects for the general population and especially for the poor. Base money increased by 13 percent in 2012/13 (Table 4). In addition to the slowdown in global food and fuel price inflation, this has been instrumental in the recent decline in inflation to 7.4 percent in June. Limited resort to NBE financing of the government and mopping of liquidity through sales of foreign exchange also helped in this regard, although this is at the expense of not building foreign exchange reserve buffer. 31.      Monetary policy implementation and liquidity management would be greatly enhanced by the use of indirect monetary policy instruments and allowing for price discovery. At present, the NBE uses changes in reserve requirement and foreign exchange sales as the main tools and has also deployed offsetting deposit requirements for liquidity management, and for achieving other developmental objectives. While the reserve requirement ratio has been lowered recently (March 2013) for a second time from 10 percent to 5 percent, the NBE simultaneously sterilized the associated excess reserves through the issuance of the NBE’s certificate of deposits. To preserve the gains on inflation monetary policy will need to remain vigilant, taking into account the effect of changes in reserve requirement on the money multiplier and the growth of broad money. Going forward, monetary policy implementation would need to take into account the renewed NBE financing of the government’s budget deficit and changing money demand conditions. In the context of relatively low levels of foreign exchange reserves, monetary operations with market priced Treasury or NBE bills can provide the NBE with greater flexibility in liquidity management. 32.      Activating the Treasury bills market would be important for the development of the money market. It could also improve the monetary transmission mechanism, allow for establishing a short-term risk-free yield curve, encourage banks to more actively manage their own liquidity positions and allocate risks. Treasury bill market remains also a precondition for establishing a market for longer-term instruments, such as Treasury bonds. Technical assistance from the Fund could be helpful in this regard.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTHE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA 20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 33.      Proper coordination and consistency between monetary and exchange rate policies are critical for further financial market development and orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market developments in the first half of 2012/13 and the premium in the parallel market suggest considerable scope for improving the functioning of the NBE’s foreign exchange sale mechanism and the interbank market. Greater flexibility in exchange rate and presence of NBE in the foreign exchange market whenever necessary can be helpful in preventing excessive volatility and disorderly conditions in the market. Exchange rate flexibility is also essential for the competitiveness of the traded goods sector which staff considers critical for the realization of the authorities’ growth objectives. For NBE to effectively play its role in this regard, staff welcomes its objective of raising its foreign exchange reserve target to US$2.5 billion (about 1.9 months of imports) by the end of 2013/14 and further to the equivalent of 3 months of imports over the longer term as a move in the right direction. However, staff would prefer a faster buildup of foreign exchange reserves—which would be facilitated by an increased use of domestic securities (rather than foreign exchange sale) for liquidity management—to 3 months of import cover (Table 6). Authorities’ views 34.      The authorities agreed on a restrained monetary stance to sustain single digit inflation but were more circumspect about any policy response to international food and fuel prices shocks. They noted that low nominal interest rates were necessary to finance public investment but agreed on the need to have positive or near zero real interest rates. They were also open to considering flexible pricing of securities for the conduct of monetary policy but indicated that this would be dependent on sustaining single-digit inflation for some time. They indicated that renewed NBE financing of the budget is consistent with the demand for base money and in the event that money demand conditions changed, direct instruments will be used. They also stressed that foreign exchange market pressures in the first half of 2012/13 reflected the uncertainty and a speculative element in the wake of Prime-Minister Meles’ passing away. E.   Financial Sector Policy and Inclusion 35.      Access to finance in Ethiopia is mainly through the banking sector and to some extent the microfinance institutions; capital markets are yet to be developed. The country’s banking sector comprises one state-owned development bank and 18 commercial banks—including two state-owned, with one dominant, CBE, with assets representing about 70 percent of the sector total—as of May 2013. The remaining 17 commercial banks, mainly private, together account for the remainder. Out of a population of nearly 90 million, only 7.1 million have deposit accounts, i.e., less Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicCORRECTED: 9/26/13 THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND     21 than 8 percent of Ethiopians have a banking account. The proportion of borrowers is even smaller (a mere 112,793). Access to finance in rural areas is limited, with only 31 microfinance institutions (MFIs) as of end-June 2012, providing financial services to 2.9 million clients. Fifteen insurance companies exist with each insurance branch serving on average a population of 335,000. The industry is not sufficiently developed to mobilize significant contractual savings. 36.      Broadening financial inclusion could have a significant payoff in terms of economic growth. The limited reach of the financial sector constrains the opportunities for small entrepreneurs and savings instruments for the poor, subjecting them to vulnerabilities in the event of shocks. The structure and regulation of Ethiopia’s financial system contribute to these limitations. The authorities’ development strategy relies heavily on directed lending to public enterprises mainly by the CBE. 37.      Commercial banks continue to be subject to the April 2011 directive requiring them to hold 27 percent of new loan disbursements in low-yield NBE bills. The proceeds of these bonds are transferred to the state-owned Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) which, according to the stated policy is supposed to on-lend them to government targeted private sector activities. However, an analysis of DBE balance sheet reveals that more than half of the proceeds are used to buy T-bills. This, combined with the policy of directed lending mainly to public enterprises in an environment of negative real interest rates, results in a significant transfer of resources from creditors (savers) to borrowers, especially the public sector. 38.      The banking sector remains highly profitable despite a slowdown in overall credit extension to the economy. Overall credit to the nongovernment sector grew by 22 percent over the first 10 months of the fiscal year 2012/13 compared to 50 percent over the same period last year in the context of higher inflation. Of this, 79 percent was allocated to the public enterprises and the rest to the private sector. The authorities indicate that the composition of very short-term fast rolling-over borrowing of the public and private sectors was more even. Driven by aggressive expansion of the number of branches by banks, demand deposits increased by 16 percent while time and saving deposits increased by 22 percent over the same period. Owing to increased lending rates and net interest margins, profitability in the banking sector remains strong with return on assets of 3.1 percent and return on capital of 47 percent as of March 2013. 39.      The NBE directive requiring banks to hold NBE bills equivalent to 27 percent of their lending has been distortionary and has triggered unnecessary portfolio adjustment by banks. Since the directive initially did not discriminate short-term from long-term loans, private banks adjusted their portfolios toward long-term loans to avoid high NBE-bills purchase due to higher Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTHE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA 22 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND turnover of short-term loans. They also raised fees and commissions to make up for lower returns on NBE bills holding. The subsequent amendment to the NBE directive also requires banks’ short-term loans to be at least 40 percent of total loans at any given time. 40.      Staff reiterated the 2012 Article IV recommendation and suggested phasing out the 27 percent NBE bills holding requirement. The directive was introduced to provide funding to DBE for lending to priority projects. This modality is indirect and it would be better if DBE funds itself through bond issuance, supported by appropriate credit enhancements, including attractive pricing, as needed.  In the interim, proceeds from this requirement transferred to the DBE and not yet committed could be used to increase credit for small scale entrepreneurs to promote financial inclusion. Purchase of T-bills by DBE from these proceeds should be substantially reduced and limited to the DBE’s day-to-day liquidity management requirements. In addition, the recent amendment of the NBE directive requiring banks to hold 40 percent of total loans in short-term loans should be withdrawn. 41.      Although available financial soundness indicators (Table 8) do not point to immediate risks, the systemic importance of the CBE and the concentration of large exposures to single entities warrant strict supervision of compliance by the NBE. On the whole, the banking sector seems sound with aggregate CAR at 14.6 percent and system-wide NPL ratio at 2.4 percent as of March 2013. The NBE is strengthening its oversight of the financial sector through risk based supervision. NBE regulations set a limit of 25 percent of capital for loans to related parties and a limit of 15 percent of capital for a single borrower. These limits should be rigorously applied to the borrowings of public enterprises where they currently do not apply. The DBE should also be subject to similar oversight and supervision. Going forward, allowing greater role for private banks (including opening up to foreign banks) could reduce the systemic importance of CBE and the associated vulnerabilities (Table 1). 42.      Promoting financial inclusion is an essential requirement for pro-poor development. Staff supports the efforts the authorities are already devoting in this area. Among the promising avenues are seeking greater technology based penetration in rural areas to promote access to financial services; allowing banks to operate microfinance institutions with funding for on-lending purposes from international financial institutions eager to increase access in rural areas in low income countries, thereby giving time for domestic intermediation efforts to be created; and forging partnerships with international organizations with experience in rural and microfinance.

Staff underscores the need for continued improvements in data quality. There are significant financial sector data gaps and fiscal and BOP statistics require improvements. Comprehensive public sector data, including on public enterprises, data would be desirable for a proper assessment of public sector finances. 69.      Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia be held on the 12-month consultation cycle. This is in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles, Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010).

National Accounts Statistics Issues 1.      Ethiopia’s official national account statistics suffer from significant weaknesses. An IMF Statistics Department (STA) mission in March 2010 identified major compilation and estimation deficiencies and suggested corrective actions. The authorities developed a national accounts improvement and capacity building action plan which they have been implementing. 2.      During the 2012 Article IV consultation, it was agreed that completion of a new benchmark GDP for 2010/11 and implementation of the improved methodologies being supported by East AFRITAC (AFE) would help improve official statistics. Since then, with the help of AFE, the authorities have made methodological improvements and published the 2011/12 national accounts based on the new benchmark which show a real GDP growth rate of 8½ percent, significantly lower than in recent years, reflecting in part lower growth in agricultural output.  3.      The authorities need to continue to improve national account statistics and related capacity. In consultation with STA, the mission decided to use the official historical figures with a notation regarding data weaknesses and possible overestimation of GDP growth rates. This approach is consistent with the general practice of reporting official historical data in other countries with national account data deficiencies. Staff will continue to have its own projections, but at the end of the fiscal year will adopt official statistics based on the national accounts outturns with the appropriate caveat. Authorities expressed their disagreement about putting a caveat on their statistics. Staff stressed the need to continue to improve national accounts data and the readiness of the Fund to offer further technical assistance.
