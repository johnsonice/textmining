At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on February 23, 1994, Executive Directors commended the authorities for their successful economic management. However, they cautioned against excessive relaxation of monetary policy, noting the need for bringing inflation down further, the more so because of the risk of renewed overheating pressures. A number of Directors favored greater responsiveness of the exchange rate to market forces. Directors advised further strengthening fiscal policy, through rigorous expenditure control and improvements in resource mobilization, especially of non-oil tax receipts. It was also felt that substantial scope remained to deregulate the trade and investment regimes. Indonesia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Staff contacts since the last consultation included visits in April and December 1994 (the latter during Indonesia’s budget preparation) and through the resident representative.* Discussions that took place on those occasions, as during the April 1995 mission, focused on the need for further tightening of fiscal and monetary policy, and for allowing market forces an increasing role in exchange rate determination. Although data are fairly comprehensive and are provided to the staff on a timely basis, there are statistical shortcomings (see Annex V). These include details of the capital account of the balance of payments and related stocks and maturity of private debt, as well as comprehensive data for central government and public enterprise accounts. The rebasing of the national accounts is an important step; however, there remain weaknesses in the expenditure breakdown of GDP.3 ‘The staff team comprised Messrs. Hicklin (head) and Rumbaugh (both SEA), Mr. Weerasinghe (Resident Representative), Ms. Khemani (PDR), and Mrs. Francis (Senior Administrative Assistant, SEA). Mr. Ismael, Executive Director for Indonesia, attended some of the meetings. *In a break from earlier practice, the December 1994 mission was designated a stafFvisit, owing to staffing constraints, and the full consultation discussions took place during the April 1995 visit. As a result, the 1995 Article IV consultation will be concluded by the Executive Board more than 15 months after the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation. ‘At the time of writing this report, rebased data (which show a significantly higher !e& and growth rate of GDP) are available only for 1993 and 1994.

Recent Developments A. Background Indonesia shares with its ASEAN regional partners--especially Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand--a record over the last few deca.des of impressive economic management, which has been characterized by hig;h levels of savings and investment, strong growth in manufacturing and exports, and a substantial buildup in international reserves. Nevertheless, economic development in Indonesia--which has by far the largest population and most diverse geography, and began from a more difficult b.ase (despite oil)--remains behind these other countries in several respects. Indonesia’s per capita income ($880 in 1994 on new estimates) ranks far below Malaysia, Singapore, and Thariland; its external debt is relatively high; and, while the three other countries have been in fiscal surplus, Indonesia has not. Also, inflation has been markedly higher in I:ndonesia, reflecting the authorities’ tolerance of inflation of up to 10 percent per annum, which has been accompanied by the policy of gradual depreciation of the rupiah. Notwithstanding strong longer-term trends, Indonesia’s economy has been subject to episodes of overheating and subsequent adjustment.. After economic setback in the mid-1980s (lower oil prices were followed by a higher fiscal deficit and a doubling of external debt), the authorities implemented decisive reform policies. Major tax reform was combined with significant steps toward deregulation of the trade, investment, and financial sectors. Reform was also supported by devaluations of the rup:iah against the U.S. dollar which, when combined with the sharp decline of the U.S. dollar vis a vis the yen, resulted in a substantial effective depreciation of the rupiah in both nominal and real terms (Chart 1). These reform measures, and the wave of regional industrial relocation, triggered a strong economic expansion in the late 198Os, especially of non-oil output and exports (Chart 2). However, in the early 199Os, as non-oil GDP continued to rise strongly, the economy was subject to excess demand pressures. The subsequent monetary tightening, combined with steps to curb new official external borrowing, brought an abatement of excess demand pressures by 1992/93.4 Following the easing of domestic demand pressures, the focus of policy shifted in early 1993194 to supporting growth. Monetary policy was eased--interest rates fell sharply and there was an upturn in private sector credit growth--at the same time that fiscal policy was tightened. Consequently, fixed investment, particularly in construction, picked up, while private consumption rose considerably. Although import growth also increased, GDP growth remained above 6 percent, and the external current account deficit remained little changed. Large short-term capital inflows in the earlier part of the year were later reversed and the overall balance of payments recorded a small surplus. 41ndonesia’s fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 3 1.

Developments in 1994/95 The renewed expansion in economic activity gained ground, and real GDP growth reached about 7 ‘/4 percent in 1994 (Table 1). Although agricultural output was affected by drought, growth in manufacturing and construction was strong (Chart 3). Domestic demand expansion, which led the increase in activity since the easing of monetary policy in mid-1993, gained f&her momentum and exceeded GDP growth. While export growth increased, import growth rose more, and the external current account deficit widened slightly to 2 percent of GDP in 1994/95. Annual inflation remained high--at about 10 percent--as rising demand pressures contributed to increases in both food and non-food prices. Fiscal policy continued to provide some dampening effect. In particular, oil prices were a little above the budget assumptions, revenues and current expenditures were broadly on target, and development expenditures were relatively slow. As a result, government deposits in the banking system were built up and would have been higher in the absence of income tax cuts and some civil service wage increases that took effect in early 1995. The overall central government position was in balance in 1994/95, with the deficit excluding oil/gas revenue falling to 3 ‘/4 percent of GDP (Table 2). Monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly (Table 3). However, in contrast to previous years, the growth in reserve money resulted from an expansion in net domestic assets, which more than offset a decline in international reserves. This expansion occurred despite a gradual increase in interest rates since April 1994, by somewhat more than international rates (Chart 4). Higher interest rates, however, did not prevent the continued rapid expansion of private credit, which supported domestic demand growth. The external current account deficit was financed mainly by long-term capital inflows (Table 4). The large fluctuations in short-term capital flows, which had been a feature of developments in 1993/94, abated early in 1994/95. Following the events in Mexico, there was a brief period of mild turbulence in the foreign exchange market in the second week of January 1995. The rupiah depreciated by 1 percent and the authorities responded with a combination of small increases in interest rates (of about 3h percent) and limited intervention (reserves fell by $0.5 billion). The pace of inward portfolio investment slowed in 1994/95, but stock market prices quickly recovered from a 7 percent dip in mid-January. The episode was modest and short-lived compared with that in March-April 1994 when domestic uncertainties triggered substantial outflows in the wake of labor unrest, a weakening of non-oil exports, and a higher expected rate of depreciation. Foreign exchange reserves were $17 billion, the equivalent of five months of imports, at end-March 1995. III. Report on the Discussions Discussions took place against the background of the completion of the first year of the new five-year plan (Repelita VI), covering 1994/95-1998/99. Macroeconomic objectives included average GDP growth of 6.2 percent, an inflation rate of 5 percent, rapid growth in non-energy exports and non-oil GDP, and improvements in national savings in order to keep Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- CEAFlT3 INDONJBIA DEVELOPMENTS IN OUTPUT AND INFLATION, 1989-94 - 16 - 14 - 12 - 10 -6 -6 -4 1l5 . 13 - 10 -8 oDom&ic demand mNet aparta -Real GDP gmrth 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 Soura: Data provided by the hdmmhn authoritiar. l/ National acamntsdatamflectrwi&onolmgiabgin1BW.

While this medium-term framework remained useful, the authorities’ immediate policy focus had shifted over the past year--concerns over whether the recovery was firmly based had been met and, by early 1995, the emphasis had clearly shifted toward renewed concerns about overheating. Attention was therefore concentrated on the need to contain inflation and the external current account deficit. Since the authorities agreed with the sta.fY team that a tightening of both fiscal and monetary policies would be appropriate, the respective roles of these policies, and the timing of any measures, were a main focus. A. Short-Term Prospects The immediate outlook is for GDP growth of some 7 ‘/z percent. While the prospects for agricultural growth remain subdued, growth in other sectors is strong. Real domestic demand growth in 1995 is expected to be close to 9 percent for a second year. In particular, investment is likely to expand in the wake of t.he large increases in approvals for both domestic and foreign investment following the 1994 deregulation package. Consumption is also likely to rise as a result of wage increases. in the public and private sectors. Export performance may benefit as Asian economies (except Japan) continue to expand, and the authorities forecast close to 15 percent growth in non-oil exports (in U.S. dollar terms) in 1995/96. There was a question of the extent to which the projected demand growth and a further rise in real GDP growth to about 7 M percent in 1995 were likely to be accompanied by a f$ther pickup in inflationary pressures and a widening of the external current account deficit. The authorities were of the view that a slight increase in the growth rate in 1995 was possible. They pointed out that the boom in construction and property sectors appeared to have been easing and infrastructure bottlenecks were not yet widespread, although the economy was seen as already close to its productive potential. While broadly agreeing with these observations, the staff team noted that the present policy stance supported continuing high domestic demand growth. The central government position in 1995/96 was projected to move into a small deficit. Monetary policy wa.s targeted to be somewhat tighter, but the projected growth in monetary aggregates was still high. The extent of the underlying inflationary pressure in the economy was difficult to judge, given the combination of supply and dernand factors affecting the CPI, and the role that administered prices played. Nevertheless, it would be realistic to assume that, on the basis of ‘The authorities explained that, with the introduction of new national accounts data, which had shown GDP growth in 1994 of 7.3 percent (1993 prices) against 6.8 percent (1983 prices), the Repelita projections would need to be recalculated. In particular, the annual average growth target of 6.2 percent over the five-year period (based on 1983 prices) was unduly low, and revisions to the expenditure side of the accounts would have implications for the medium-term projection of investment and savings ratios. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- present policies, the rate of inflation would not be reduced significantly from the present level of 10 percent. Although the authorities did not wish inflation to exceed 10 percent, they shared the view that bringing inflation down to 6-7 percent in 1995--consistent with moving toward the authorities’ 5 percent medium-term objective--would require substantial policy efforts. In a medium-term context, the staff team reiterated the view that the inflation objective should be more ambitious, in line with that of major trading partners. Moreover, there was a risk that inflationary expectations could take hold, making the maintenance of inflation at its present level increasingly difficult. Given strong demand pressures, the staff team projected a widening of the external current account deficit to about 2 l/z percent of GDP in 1995/96, based on higher import growth. To the extent that this reflects increased investment rather than consumption, it would be less of a concern, and could be financed in part by an increase in foreign direct investment. Nonetheless, the staff team’s view was that the prospects of a widening external current account deficit, in the context of the high external debt, added urgency to the short- term challenge to reduce excess demand pressures. The authorities believed that the increase in imports and, therefore, in the current account deficit, would not be as high as the staff had indicated, but in any case they were very conscious of the need to avoid a significant increase in the current account deficit. B. Fiscal Policy Over the medium term, there remain significant constraints on the desirable fiscal path, including the high levels of external debt that have been built up, the likelihood that net inflows of official foreign assistance will level off, and the prospect of a declining share of oil and gas revenue in GDP. Accordingly, the staff team was of the view that small overall fiscal surpluses would need to be targeted, specifically an overall surplus of 2 percent of GDP by the end of the decade, to be consistent with the steady improvement in the external debt ratios.6 With the assumed decline of oil/gas revenues, the central government position (excluding oil/gas revenue) would need to improve from a deficit of about 3 percent of GDP to near balance. These budgetary goals, and the enormous pressures that are likely to remain on current and capital expenditure, underline the crucial importance of increasing non-oil/gas revenue by the equivalent of 3 percentage points of GDP between 1993/94 and 1998/99, as targeted in Repelita VI. Against this background, fiscal policies in 1995/96 were discussed. On the revenue side, a tax package was introduced from January 1995 that reduced personal and corporate income tax rates and increased deductions, while increasing or introducing taxes on stock transactions, and luxury taxes (including on property sales). Although the direction of structural change was appropriate, the staff was concerned about the short-term impact on the fiscal stance. Despite further measures to broaden the tax base, the net effect of these measures was projected to be a reduction in the ratio of non-oil/gas revenue to GDP, which 6Annex VI contains a discussion on the assumptions behind the medium-term outlook. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- had remained flat in 1994/95,, by about % percent of GDP in 1995/96. Instead of contributing to the five-year target, therefore, there was likely to be some slippage during the first two years of Repelita VI, and a substantial effort would now be left to the last three years. On the expenditure side, the budget represented continued restraint, with expenditure and net lending relative to GDP estimated to decline slightly. In combination with a continued decline in oil/gas revenues, the overall central government position was projected to be in small deficit of about % percent of GDP, with the deficit (aexcluding oil/gas revenue) remaining at about 3 percent of GDP. In these circumstances, the staff proposed an additional non-oil/gas revenue effort of 1 percent of GDP in 1995/96. This would be consistent with the progress envisaged over the medium term in improving the fiscal structure., thereby contributing to the achievement of the current account and inflation targets. It would also significantly help address the short-term need to reduce excess demand without the full burden being placed on monetary policy. Suggestions included an increase in domestic petroleum prices (especially since the failure to raise prices could lead to reduced surpluses or the re-introduction of subsidies), further increases in property taxes and raising forestry revenues, as well as greater efforts to improve tax administration. The authorities remained confident that improvements in tax administration and coverage would achieve the medium-term targets for non-oil/gas revenue, despite the slowdown in 1995/96. They indicated that further fiscal adjustment would be difficult this year, although the issue would be kept under review. Further reducing current expenditures would be problematic. Indeed, pressures may ,well rise, as expenditures for operations and maintenance were barely adequate, civil service salaries were low relative to the private sector, and there were some unfunded liabilities associated with the public sector pension fund. Such problems were, in ,the staff’s view, indications of the need not to delay further progress in resource mobilizati~on. The staff team also stressed the need to resist pressures for extrabudgetary spending and to bring on budget all such expenditures that do take place. There were pressures for transfers and loans to public enterprises, associated in part with efforts to develop high-technology industries. In this respect the incorporation of some forestry accounts within the scope of the central government accounts during 1994 was a welcome step, as was the decision to use receipts from the sales of shares in public enterprises to repay external debt. Without improved transparency of the central government and public enterprise accounts, judgments on the appropriate level and structure of expenditure and investment would remain very difficult. In recent years, the authorities’ prudent ‘external debt management policies have succeeded in maintaining Indonesia’s access to capital markets. (Indonesia’s Standard and Poor’s rating was upgraded in h4arch 1995.) Although estimates of total external debt are now close to $100 billion, the raltios of debt to GDP and to exports fell in 1994/95, continuing the steady progress made since the peak in 1990 (Table 5). The authorities expressed some concern at the impact of the recent yen appreciation on the debt stock and annual debt-service Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - payments, but agreed that this remained manageable, and could be partially offset by higher capital inflows. An important element of the authorities’ policy since 1991 had been ceilings on external commercial borrowings and export credit facilities contracted by the public sector. The staffteam urged that these ceilings, which had expired in early 1995, be reinstated at conservative levels as soon as possible. This would force a needed prior-Cation of projects and would help prevent a sharp increase in such borrowing. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies Although a tighter fiscal policy could contribute, monetary policy would also have to play a crucial role in reducing excess demand pressures and achieving significantly lower inflation. The authorities had increased interest rates since March 1994, by somewhat more than the increases in international rates. Although this policy had been in part a response to the episode of capital outflows in March-April 1994, interest rate increases continued throughout 1994/95. Nonetheless, they had been insufficient to prevent a substantial increase in liquidity that had contributed to pressures on the price level and the exchange rate. Accordingly, the stafl’s view was that there was a need to tighten monetary policy by allowing a further increase in short-term interest rates on Bank Indonesia instruments from the prevailing level of about 14 percent, and by targeting a lower growth in monetary aggregates. To help reduce inflation, a growth in monetary aggregates on the order of 15 percent initially, with a short-term operational target for reserve money, would be more appropriate than the current targets. Because of the unpredictability in the relationships between the various aggregates, the situation would have to be constantly reviewed and policy adjusted as necessary to achieve the desired objectives. Movements of reserve money had been affected in 1994/95 by an increase in foreign exchange swaps between Bank Indonesia and commercial banks. Although these still represented a small share of foreign reserves, the staff advocated winding this scheme down since market swap arrangements for up to six months were available; the authorities were reviewing this issue. The authorities indicated a willingness to tighten monetary policy gradually and pointed to the targeted reduction in the growth of credit and broad money to 19 percent in 1995. (The policy of effecting gradual increases in interest rates has also continued since the discussions, with short-term rates rising by ‘/4 of a percentage point in late April.) However, the authorities were reluctant to allow a large increase in interest rates, and, instead, intended to continue close monitoring of the banks with a view to preventing rapid credit growth to the private sector. The staff team observed that moral suasion on the banks not to extend credit beyond amounts deemed compatible with macroeconomic objectives ran the risk of being countered by increased lending by nonbank domestic institutions and by overseas banks, given the openness of the capital account. Although the authorities were aware of these risks, they nonetheless felt they were striking the right balance between controlling the growth of monetary aggregates, keeping interest rates from not increasing excessively, and using moral suasion on the banks to influence the amount and the composition of lending. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- Applying moral suasion was also deeimed necessary in light of prudential considerations, and the desire not to allow interest rates to rise substantially was in part driven by the concern that the portfolios of the banking system might deteriorate as a result. In this context, the staffteam fully supported the attempts by the authorities to improve bank supervision and take steps to try to ensure th,at credit extended to certain sectors, including property, was prudent. These were particularly important, given the very rapid growth of credit by some private banks in the wake of constraints applied to public banks, and would likely have some dampening i.mpact on overall credit extension. More generally, the staff urged that steps to restructure problem banks, and problem loans be implemented without delay. (Classified loans still comprised 19 percent of total credit in the state banks and 6 percent in the private banks as of December 1994.) The authorities noted that, with the help of technical assistance from the World Bank and Fund, the supervision teams set up to monitor the problem loans in the state and private banks were continuing their work and that there had been an improvement in portfolios during 1994. New regulations in January 1995 aimed to strengthen Bank Indonesia’s supervisory authority. Moreover, firm action had been taken in 1994, including through the courts, against fraudulent behavior at one state bank (Bapindo). The authorities’ desire to prevent a large increase in domestic interest rates was partly influenced by the experience of 1991-93, when increasingly expensive attempts had been made to sterilize capital inflows, and the differential between domestic and overseas interest rates had risen sharply. The staff team agreed that large-scale attempts to sterilize inflows, with possible implications of much higher interest rates on banks’ portfolios, would be undesirable. In addition to the recommended tightening of fiscal policy, the staff reiterated its advice that, in the event that a tightening of monetary policy led to a recurrence of sizable capital inflows, the authorities would need to allow an appreciation to make monetary policy effective in limiting inflation. (This would imply placing g.reater emphasis on broad money growth as a target.) Any associated real appreciation of the rupiah could be brought about by allowing the nominal exchange rate to appreciate, rather than through a higher rate of inflation. The strategic decision to move to allow a more flexible exchange rate would also mean that when market forces leaned in the opposite direction (which had appeared more likely in early 1995), a downward movement in the nominal exchange rate would be appropriate, provided that monetary policy were tightened sufficiently to achieve lower inflation. The staff team emphasized that it was advocating neither a step appreciation nor a completely flexible exchange rate at this time. .However, allowing scope for a nominal appreciation would require widening the band within which the exchange rate was allowed to fluctuate (from the present Rp .30, or close to 1 ‘/z percent). The staff team advised that this step be taken as soon as possible, but not during any episode of market turbulence. The authorities were likely to continue to widen the band very gradually, and the experience of other countries was being examined. However, the authorities opposed an appreciation of the rupiah, which they argued could harm the competitiveness of non-oil exports. The staff team noted that the unchanged. policy of a gradual crawl of the rupiah against the dollar, in the context of recent movements in the ;yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate, had led to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- a marked depreciation of the rupiah in the past year (in nominal effective terms by 15 percent and in real effective terms by about 8 percent). This was likely to add to inflation in the period ahead. In the circumstances, fairly modest market-led upward movements in the rupiah/U.S. dollar exchange rate in response to a tightening of monetary policy should not be cause for concern. More generally, an acceleration of structural reforms would likely lower costs and improve export competitiveness. D. Structural Policies Indonesia has made significant progress in liberalizing the economy in the past decade. Nonetheless, the achievement of the ambitious medium-term growth and export targets will require further structural reforms in key areas, which should also contribute to combating inflation. Trade and investment liberalization has been instrumental in maintaining the growth rate and strengthening investment demand. In the deregulation packages announced over the last two years, tariffs and other trade restrictions were substantially reduced, and the June 1994 package significantly liberalized investment regulations, including by eliminating divestment requirements in important sectors. The authorities indicated their intention to use recent trade commitments as a springboard for implementing more ambitious trade reform. The package announced in May 1995 focused on a sharp reduction in tariffs on an economy- wide basis, as opposed to the more sector-specific cuts of previous packages. Features also included the establishment of a comprehensive schedule of future tariff reductions and the removal of some nontariff barriers. However, nontariff barriers, including import licensing and local content requirements, as well as export and other marketing restrictions, continue to hamper trade in several important sectors where some progress might have been expected. One of Indonesia’s main commitments in the Uruguay Round had been to eliminate nontariff barriers over ten years, and the staff team emphasized that the efficiency of new investment, and therefore the growth of potential output, would benefit from faster implementation of these and other reforms. The authorities intend to allow the private sector an increasing role in the economy in order to increase the competitiveness of industry. This will require redefining the role of the central government, for example, as investment traditionally carried out by the Government is transferred to the private sector (e.g., in inii-astructure). The authorities have undertaken full or partial sale of some large public enterprises and indicated that further sales could be expected in 1995. The staff team advised that the scope of the medium-term program be considered in its entirety, so that the macroeconomic implications could be envisaged. Moreover, there was a need to reduce barriers to entry and to structure the regulatory framework and the tax system so that private sector investments enhanced economic efficiency.

Indonesia’s achievements of economic adjustment and growth are impressive. They are based on a sustained commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability--even when this has required sizable adjustments in fiscal and monetary policy--and to significant progress in structural reform. Rapid growth of the non-oil economy and improved living standards are testaments to the success of the policy direction. In addition, conservative external debt management policies in recent years have allowed steady progress in reducing the high external debt burden. This combination of policies has already been rewarded by increasing foreign investment that should boost potential output. It is clear that only the consistent pursuit of fundamentals--macroeconomic stability, high savings and investment ratios, and market-based structural reform--will ensure the continued confidence of both domestic and foreign investors. The staff believes that these elements remain the key ingredients to continued rapid economic progress and to meeting whatever challenges lie ahead. After one full year under Repelita VI (1994/95-1998/99), and the policy direction set for the second, the authorities recognize that many difficult challenges remain if the medium- term targets are to be achieved. In addition, a. short-term challenge has clearly emerged. With a new phase of expansion firmly under way, there is now risk of significant excess demand pressures, manifested both in higher inflation than targeted and a widening current account deficit. Even though the imbalances are not yet large, the staff would underscore the need to take timely and measured action, and thereby minimize the possibility of having to take more drastic measures later. Moreover, the policy framework under which the authorities have taken pragmatic action in the past to check excess demand pressures may need to be modified. In particular, in recent years the policy of steadily depreciating the rupiah to offset inflation differentials has complicated the ability to tighten monetary policy. In addition, central government surpluses will be required over the medium term. To prevent episodes of quite strong tightening and easing of policies, which the authorities rightly wish to avoid, consideration needs to be given to adjusting these aspects of the policy framework. The staff is in broad agreement with the authorities’ medium-term framework, noting that a somewhat higher average growth rate is probably feasible and that there is a good case for adopting a lower inflation target, in line with the lower levels prevailing in trading partner countries. A continuation of the present rate of inflation carries significant risks, including those brought about by the uncertainty concerning relative prices that adds to the costs of business and of financial intermediation. Inflati.on also becomes more difficult to contain if inflationary expectations become entrenched. The need to significantly reduce the rate of inflation is, in the staffs view, a high priority. Against the background of the substantial improvement in the fiscal position (excluding oil/gas revenue) in recent years, the staff would reiterate the importance of keeping on course to achieve the targeted increase in non-oiugas revenue by 1998/99. The fiscal adjustment is essential if the external current account objective is to be achieved, and the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- external debt ratios are to continue to improve. However, the effect of the recent tax changes is to lower the non-oil revenue/GDP ratio in 1995/96, implying that the targeted adjustment of 3 percent is now to be made in just three years. The staff views this adjustment as too back-loaded, and would urge that steps be taken as soon as possible to accelerate the non-oil/ gas revenue effort. Moreover, fiscal policy can also make a significant contribution to reducing excess demand in the short term. Emphasis should be given to policy measures that would be considered part of the envisaged medium-term adjustment. In this context, there appears to be scope for improving tax administration and widening the tax base. New measures should also be considered, including increases in domestic petroleum prices, to generate an additional non-oil/gas revenue effort of about 1 percent of GDP in 1995/96, in line with steady progress toward the desired medium-term target. On the expenditure side, the priority is to constrain expenditures to the budgeted amounts and resist pressures for expenditure financed from extrabudgetary sources. Monetary policy will have to play a crucial role in significantly lowering inflation. The staffs view is that the monetary targets for 1995 are too high, and that some increase in interest rates is in order. The dilemma faced by the authorities in 1993--when increases in interest rates provoked substantial capital inflows that negated attempts to absorb liquidity-- has not been an issue in recent months. Indeed, the monetary policy stance has been consistent with some downward pressure on the exchange rate. This has led to a decline in foreign exchange reserves, and a significant effective depreciation of the rupiah that is likely to add to inflation in the period ahead. In the staffs view, a clear short-term priority is to tighten liquidity for both domestic and external objectives. There is likely to be some scope to tighten liquidity through higher short-term interest rates without inducing capital inflows on a scale that would complicate monetary management. A key concern at this stage should, in any case, be to prevent all but minimal declines in foreign exchange reserves, and to take opportunities to steadily increase reserve levels, while winding down the investment swaps scheme. However, if a tightening of monetary policy led to a recurrence of very large capital inflows, the staffwould reiterate its advice to rely more on market forces in determining the exchange rate in order to make monetary policy more effective in limiting inflation. Moderate fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate would be unlikely to harm exports; the staffs view is that export competitiveness can be effectively enhanced by structural reform. Allowing scope for more flexibility in the exchange rate would require widening the band within which the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate, and this step should be taken in tandem with the recommended monetary policy tightening. Emphasis is given to interest rates and the exchange rate as instruments of monetary policy. The staffs view is that moral suasion on banks to limit credit expansion has a prudential role in some cases, in particular in constraining credit to the real estate sector. However, it is unlikely to have more than a limited, and perhaps temporary, role in restraining demand, given the possibilities for financial intermediation to switch to nonbank and foreign institutions. In weighing the benefits of a tighter monetary policy, concern has been expressed that high nominal interest rates could cause hardships to some borrowers and could Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- exacerbate the problems of nonperforming loans of the banking system. Such concerns argue strongly for the acceleration of the program to improve the quality of new loans, to resolve existing problem loans, and to restructure problem banks, since the maintenance of a sound banking system is crucial if monetary policy is to be effective. Sustained high growth will require further substantial structural reforms, in addition to those in the financial sector. The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations should provide a basis for Indonesia to further liberalize trade and resist protectionist tendencies. Liberalization under the auspices of AFTA and APEC can also be beneficial, provided the risk of trade diversion is minimized. The recently announced tariff reductions are welcomed and the staffwould urge that, to further advance economy-wide efficiency, forthcoming deregulation deal effectively with distortions in Indonesia’s trade system by eliminating nontariff barriers, liberalizing internal and external trade of key commodities, and halting any reversal in the policy of opening investment to foreign ownership. As the role of the private sector grows, it will be increasingly important to create a regulatory framework and t,ax system that e:ncourage the efficient allocation of resources. Indonesia’s record of external debt servicing is exemplary. Nonetheless, external debt and debt-servicing ratios remain high, and the authorities need to persevere to reduce them. Continued efforts are needed to improve the rnqnitoring of private sector debt and strengthen vigilance over public and publicly related debt which falls outside normal budgetary channels. The staff supports the authorities’ objective of reducing the nonconcessional borrowing by the public sector, and the opportunity taken to make early repayment of expensive external debt with the proceeds from the sale of public enterprise shares. The previously established public sector debt ceilings expired at the end of 1994/95, and the staff urges the authorities--as a priority--to re-establish prudent ceilings on both external commercial borrowings and export credit facilities contracted by t.he public sector. The authorities are aware of the increased scrutinity now given by policymakers and market participants to economic and financial (data, especially on emerging market economies such as Indonesia, and of the need to publish timely and accurate data. Available data are provided on a timely basis to the Fund staff. Priorities for improving data would include the monitoring and collation of data on private capital flows and external debt stocks, including by maturity; making the central government accounts more comprehensive by including nonbudgetary transactions; and developing a comprehensive set of public enterprise accounts. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Indonesia be conducted on the standard L&month cycle.

The initial r 100.0 0.4 ate established for the rupiah on that date was Rp 625 per US$l, with the U.S. dollar serving as the intervention currency. On March 30, 1983, the rupiah was devalued by 28 percent from Rp 703 to Rp 970 per US$l; and on September 12, 1986, it was devalued by a further 31 per- cent from Rp 1,134 to Rp 1,644 to the dollar. Subsequently, each business day Bank Indonesia has announced buying and selling rates for the rupiah/U.S. dollar exchange rate that currently differ by 30 rupiah per US$l (the band). These rates have been managed to broadly offset the inflation differential vis-a-vis trading partners. The interbank rate fluctuates within this narrow band. On June 1, 1995, the interbank rate was Rp 2,225 per US$l and the band was Rp 2,221/2,25 1 per US$l.

The World Bank Group has been closely associated with Indonesia’s development effort since 1968. Virtually all Bank Group lending was made through IDA until 1974, when Indonesia’s creditworthiness improved following the commodity and oil price increase. During the remainder of the 197Os, the bulk of World Bank lending was made through IBRD loans, and IDA lending was completely discontinued in 1980. The Bank’s policy dialogue with lending operations in Indonesia have emphasized prudent macroeconomic management; reforms in trade, investment, and finance; sector-specific policies to increase efficiency; development of human resources to reduce poverty; and environmental and natural resource management. During the 199Os, the Bank will continue to support the Government’s efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability; sustain the momentum of private sector growth; invest in critical areas of human and physical infrastructure; promote regional development; and support a more pro-active approach to environmental management in all sectors. In volume terms, the Bank’s lending program is expected to contribute about 6 percent of Indonesia’s external finance requirements over the next three years and to serve as an important catalyst in attracting concessional funds from other donors. The sectoral distribution of the lending program will reflect the demand for infrastructure investment supportive of the private sector and more balanced regional growth, continued emphasis on human resource development, and a shift from more traditional agricultural projects to those with particular environmental problems such as forestry. New commitments: Loans committed during FY 1995 (as of May 30, 1995) amounted to $708 million ($1,489.8 million in FY 1994). IFC and MIGA: IFC, since its first investment in Indonesia in 1971, has made gross (including participations) commitments (loan, equity, and guarantees) of approximately $1.5 billion (net of cancellations). Indonesia is a member of MlGA and has benefited from guarantees totaling $224.5 million. Technical assistance: IDA and IBRD technical assistance loans to Indonesia totaled $139 million as of September 30, 1994. In addition, significant allocations for technical services have been included in virtually all Bank Group loans. ‘Prepared wit h a ssistance from World Bank staff.

However, given the notable progress under this program, most of the special assistance has been phased out. Programmed lending commitments in 1994 were $748.4 million, well below the $1.29 billion approved in 1993. This outcome was due to revised project processing arrangements as well as to delays in the settlement of project-related issues. The 1995 lending level is expected to fall within the range of $1.2-1.3 billion. Cumulative AsDB loans to Indonesia, excluding private sector loans, reached $11 billion as of end- 1994. Cumulative private sector operations amounted to $117 million. Technical assistance projects have increased considerably in recent years, to a cumulative $96 million as of end-1994. The current AsDB operational strategy for Indonesia was adopted in 1994 to coincide with the commencement of Repelita VI (1994/95-1998/99). It is a continuation of the AsDB’s emphasis on promoting efficient economic growth coupled with efficient resource utilization. The strategy aims to raise Indonesia’s international competitiveness by improving factor productivity through: (I) improvement of physical infrastructure; (ii) development of more productive human resources; and (iii) sustainable resource management to prevent environmental degradation from eroding factor productivity. The AsDB’s strategy is to complement the Government’s ongoing efforts at liberal&g the economy and improving efficiency. The AsDB will promote measures to: (I) strengthen the policy environment for further economic reforms; (ii) support the efficient development of economic infrastructure (physical, social, and financial); and (iii) catalyze private sector investment. 1/ Prepared with assistance from AsDB staff.

However, there are data deficiencies in several important areas that tend to inhibit comprehensive macroeconomic analysis. There is a lack of transparency in thie classification of central government expenditure that takes place through nonbudgetary accounts, while comprehensive data on the consolidated public sector are not available. IDetails of the capital account of the balance of payments and of related stocks and maturity of external private debt are also in need of improvement. With respect to national accounts, there is a need to improve data on the expenditure components of GIDP, while improved data on wages and productivity would contribute to a better analysis of labor market issues. Within the next year a technical assistance mission from STA on government finance statistics is tentatively planned. I. Real Sector Data Historical national accounts data are prepared and published by Biro Pusat Statistik (BPS) on the basis of information received from ministries and agencies. The data by industrial origin are available on a quarterly basis. Quarterly estimates of the breakdown by expenditure category are madle available to the staff; but only the annual totals are published. While the national accounts data provide a useful assessment on movements in output, weaknesses remain in the expenditure data. BPS believes that both household consumption and imports of nonfactor services may be underestimated. Investment data are available only in aggregate form, with no division between the private and public sectors, and stock changes are calculated as a residual which in recent years has been large. Data on national savings are also not available. The staff is able to estimate public investment and saving based only on central government accounts, as the available data for the rest of the public sector are not comprehensive. The authorities are in the process osf revising national accounts statistics to a 1993 base year and improving the coverage. At this time, only data for 1993 and 1994 are available. Historical revisions in the GDP series are expected to be published in the near future. Labor market data, including wages and employment, are available through periodic government publications, and during the annua.l Article IV consultation discussions. Data on average wages in the private sector are not ava.ilable, but minimum and maximum wages are reported by economic sector and by region. Both consumer and wholesale price data are collected and published by BPS on a monthly basis. The weights for the CPI were updated in April 1990 on the basis of a 1988/89 cost of living survey, while the weights for the WPI (date from 1983.

IL Public Finance The public sector in Indonesia consists of the central government, 27 provincial governments, 368 municipal and local governments, and about 180 public enterprises (of which 23 are financial institutions). Comprehensive data for consolidated public sector accounts are not available. By focusing statistical analysis on the central government accounts, a significant portion of public sector activity is not being captured. Budgetary data of the central government are published twice a year by the Ministry of Finance. The staff is, however, able to obtain more current information on the main elements of central government operations through the Resident Representative’s office in Jakarta. Data on tax revenues are viewed as generally reliable, but difficulties often arise in assessing nontax revenues, expenditures, and net lending related to nonbudget government accounts held with the domestic banking system--primarily with Bank Indonesia. The staff is able to estimate total net expenditure from these accounts based on movements in total government deposits with the banking system. The staffs estimate of net foreign financing of the central government is derived from the balance of payments data provided by Bank Indonesia, which often differs from the budget estimate. The resulting expenditure and/or repayments are classified as capital expenditure and net lending. The staff has urged the authorities to provide comprehensive information on these items and to move toward preparing consolidated data for public sector accounts.’ ILL Monetary Data The central bank balance sheet and the monetary survey are provided with a relatively short lag (see attached table). These data are later published in weekly and monthly statistical bulletins. IV. Balance of Payments Foreign trade data are prepared by BPS on a monthly basis and by Bank Indonesia on a quarterly basis. The staff has noted weaknesses in the estimation of trade prices. Although BPS prepares export and import unit value data, Bank Indonesia also constructs an export price index for internal use, based on some broad price indices. For the purpose of staff reports and on reports on recent economic developments, the staff prepares its own estimates for import and ‘Owing to differences in coverage, there is not always a direct correspondence between bank financing of the central government in the fiscal accounts and changes in credit to the Government (net) in the monetary accounts.

The staff has encouraged the authorities to produce a more reliable terms of trade index. In the capital account’ there are several important gaps in data estimates. There are no data on long- and short-term investment of the banking sector and on short-term investment of the official sector. Also, the authorities do not have data on outward- portfolio investment and direct investment abroad. Errors and omissions were relatively large and positive in 1992/93, while they were large and negative in 1993/94-1994/95. There are, at present, considerable variations in private sector debt estimates compiled by different organizations. The World Bank staffs estimate is the highest, while that of the authorities is the lowest, with the Fund staffs estimate falling in between. Although the staff estimate, which is based on data provided by HIS, the World Bank, and the authorities, is considered acceptable given the circumstances and is used in staff reports and REDS, double counting of some items is possible. Therefore:, the staff has urged the authorities to improve their own estimates, which are debtor based, by widening the coverage of the reporting. The link between the external debt stock, debt service, and the balance of payments should also be improved. Estimates of the m.aturity of privat’e debt, in particular of short-term debt, are very approximate. Data on the gross and net official reserve position of the central bank are regularly provided to the staff on a weekly basis with a short lag. There is a difference between the data officially reported for publication in International Financial Statistics and those used by the staff. It has been agreed to use the staff estimate in staff reports and REDS; this estimate includes “contingent” reserves, which were assigned in the past by Bank Indonesia as an accounting counterpart to the domestic liability arising from the rediscounting of export drafts. In the staffs view, the:se reserves (which are gradually being reduced) should be treated as part of international reserves as they have the same liquidity and monetary implications as the other foreign exchange reserves. V. Reporting of Data to the Statistics Department 3 Most real sector data are provided by E3ank Indonesia on a timely basis. However, there is a lag of more than one year in the reporting of data on total exports, unit value of exports, and value, volume, and unit value of petroleum exports. Furthermore, trade data by partner country are not regularly reported for the Direction of Trade Statistics. prepared on the basis of the fourth edition of the BaZance of PaymentsManual. 31n some cases, data reported to STA by the authorities are not in the same format as those reported in the RED.

Although comprehensive data for consolidated public sector accounts are not available, data on the consolidated central government and provincial government accounts are reported as GFS data. Monetarv data are reported on a fairly regular basis. However, numerous data inconsistencies have prevented their publication. With a view toward resolving these inconsistencies, STA requested that Bank Indonesia submit its balance sheets as well as consolidated balance sheets for the deposit money banks (DMBs). Bank Indonesia has recently submitted its revised monetary data along with those of DMEk for 1994, which are generally consistent, although they do not resolve all of the identified data problems. As the most recent balance of payments data reported were for the fourth quarter of 1993, the timeliness of reporting could be improved. Moreover, there are significant gaps in the coverage of capital and financial account data as noted in Section IV above.

It assumes a sustained tightening of monetary and fiscal policies after 1995/96 in order to gradually reduce inflation by the end of the decade to 3-4 percent, a greater reduction than targeted in Repelita VI (1994/95-1998/99), reflecting the statI’s view that inflation should be targeted to reach levels in regional and major trading partner countries. The scenario also reflects the assumption that an increase in national savings will be necessary to finance the investment needs of the economy without a further significant buildup in external debt. A key element is the continued progress in reducing the debt/GDP and debt/export ratios. In 1995/96, growth and investment are expected to pick up and inflationary pressures are projected to keep prices increasing by close to 10 percent. The stance of fiscal policy is that reflected in the 1995/96 budget, together with estimates of nonbudgetary expenditure, while some tightening of monetary policy is assumed to take place.’ In 1996/97, the prospect is that strong growth in domestic demand in excess of output growth will continue, keeping inflation high and contributing to a further widening of the external current account deficit to close to 3 percent of GDP. A slowdown in demand growth thereafter will contribute to a subsequent narrowing of the external current account deficit.* Reflecting the gradual pickup in non-oil exports that began in 1994/95, non-oil/gas export volumes are projected to grow by 7 % percent in 1995/96 and then increase further to 11-12 percent per annum throughout the medium term on the assumption that structural reforms will improve productivity and efficiency. The widening of the current account deficit is at present expected to be financed by an increase in net capital inflows. Following the recent large increase in investment approvals, foreign direct investment is projected to rise from $2 % billion in 1994/95 to $4 ‘/z billion in 1996/97 and remain at $4-4 % billion throughout the medium term. Net official capital inflows are projected to increase slightly in ‘An adjustment has been made to the original budget estimates for 1995/96 in response to the recent appreciation of the yen. In general terms, a 10 percent appreciation of the yen increases debt-service payments by about $300 million. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of gross borrowing of about $200 million. *A judgment on the sustainable rate of economic growth over the medium term has been made more difficult by the recent revision to national accounts statistics. The staffs initial view is that the growth rate of potential output is currently about 7-7 ‘/2 percent. Since the economy is now viewed as close to full capacity, domestic demand growth rates of more than 7 % percent per annum are likely to lead to inflationary pressures and a wider current account deficit.

There is also expected to be a small increase in other private capital inflows (including portfolio investment), owing to improvements in the overall macroeconomic environment and a continuing emphasis on encouraging private sector activity. Over the medium term, the scenario incorporates an increase in public savings of about 3 percent of GDP from 1995196 to 2000/01. As revenue from the oil/gas sector is expected to continue to decline, this fiscal adjustment would be made by a sustained effort to mobilize central government non-oil/gas revenue by nearly 1 percent of GDP per year. This higher level of public savings will finance an increase: in public and private sector investment while containing the external current account deficit to less than 2 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. The projections assume little change in the private savings ratio over the medium term. The authorities expressed the hope that: private savings might increase. However, the staffs more cautious view is based on several factors. There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the estimates of private savings, as separate data on savings generated by public enterprises or the corporate sector are not available. Projected improvements in the macroeconomic environment might lead to changes in private saving behavior, but the extent of the change is unclear. Projected demographic changes (e.g., an increase in the proportion of the population in the work force) may also lead to an increase in household savings in the future, but this effect is not expected until beyond the present projection period. Accordingly, the scenario makes the assumlption that private savings will remain, on average, at about 24 ‘/2. percent of GDP, similar to levels observed in recent years. The staff team took the view that, given these uncertainties., assuming an increase in private sector savings would risk underestimating the size of the required fiscal adjustment. The attainment of the Imedium-term objectives for growth, inflation, and the external current account will require si,gnificant monetary and fiscal policy actions, particularly after 1995/96. If the actual tightening of financial policies falls short of the projected path, inflation would, at best, remain at or near double digit levels, and the external current account defici,t and levels of external debt would be higher.
