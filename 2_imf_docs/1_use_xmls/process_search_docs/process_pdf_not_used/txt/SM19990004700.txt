The 1999 Article lV consultation discussions took place in January 1999, two months afbzr a new coalition government headed by Mr. Hun Sen took office. Most members of the economic cabinet are holdovers from the previous government. . Because of persistent political uncertainty and the Asian financial crisis, macroeconomic performance deteriorated during most of 1998, although economic activity, particularly in tourism and retail trade, appears to have rebounded late in the year. For 1998 as a whole, no growth in output is estimated. The IZmonth rate of inflation was 13 percent at the end of the year, down from 19 percent in the middle of the year, and the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar stabiied in the last few months of the year, following a 10 percent depreciation in the tlrst half of the year. . Shortfalls in revenue collection, overspending on the military budget, and a lack of foreign budgetary support led to a weak fiscal performance in 1998, which gave rise to central bank financing of the government for the tirst time in 4 years. . There was little tangible progress last year in key structural reforms such as forestry, governance in budgetary management, and civil service and military reform, because government actions were paralyzed before the elections for the National Assembly and during the formation of the new government. . The new government is determined to break with the recent past and has announced strong measures against illegal logging, fiscal mismanagement, and corruption, and plans to resume other structural reforms. . Macroeconomic prospects for 1999 are likely to improve with economic growth rebounding to 4 percent and inflation decliing to 6-7 percent. While the current account deficit is expected to widen with an expansion in imports financed by higher FDI and aid flows, the overall balance of payments is expected to record a surplus, with international reserves remaining at the equivalent of three months of imports. . The authorities are keen to start discussions on a possible new ESAF program to support their reform efforts. Since actions in recent months have addressed most of the conditions set out during the 1998 Article IV consultation, the staff expects that discussions on a possible new ESAF-supported program could start in the near tbture, provided the authorities follow through with their commitment to improve public resource management and govemment revenue collection.

The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions were conducted in January 1999, two months after a coalition government had taken office following the July 1998 National Assembly elections. Jn concludmg the 1998 Article JV consultation (April 1998), Executive Directors expressed strong concern about the deteriorating economic situation in Cambodia and noted that little tangible progress was made in structuraJ reforms. They emphasized that, before discussions on a new ESAP arrangement could start, clear efforts would need to be made to improve public resource management, in particular in the forestry sector, and government revenue coUection.’ 2. A Consultative Group Meeting (CC) is to be held in Tokyo on February 25-26, 1999. The government plans to present a comprehensive reform program aimed at resuming the structured reforms that stalled in the course of 1997. These include forestry management, budgetary management, civil service reform, and demobilization of the security forces. The donor community haa given high priority to the government’s response to the issue of illegal logging and forestry management, as this issue cuts across a number of concerns in the fiscal, environmental, governance, and human rights fields. IL Recent Developments and Policy Performance 3. Domestic political uncertainty and the onset of the Asian crisis led to a deterioration in macroeconomic performance in the second half of 1997. The downward trend continued during most of 1998 amidst political uncertainty during the period leadmg up to the elections and its a%rmath. Governance in the forestry sector and budgetary management deteriorated markedly. However, the formation of a new government in November had a positive impact on public confidence, and economic activity, particularly in tourism and retail trade, started to pick up in late 1998. A. Political Background 4. The National Assembly elections in July 1998 were considered by most observers to be reasonably free and fair.* After long negotiations, amidst political and social unrest, ‘Cambodia’s first ESAP arrangement (SDR 84 million) covered the period 1994-97. Cambodia was able to disburse the fbll amount author&d under the tirst annual ESAP arrangement; the Executive Board approved a second annual arrangement, but the midterm review could not be concluded. Discussions for a third annual arrangement were concluded, but prior actions were not implemented, and the three-year arrangement expired in August 1997. %ime Minister Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) won 67 seats, Prince Norodom (continued...) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- interventions by Ring Norodom Sihanouk and the intemational community led to the formation of a coalition government in November 1998, based on the CPP and the PUNCINPEC and led by Prime Minister Hun Sen. Prince Norodom Ranariddh was appointed as Chaitman of the National Assembly. Many of the ministers of the new government are holdovers from the previous government. 5. In two important speeches 8&r 8ssuming oNi* the grime Minister promised broad focal reform, less spending on defense and recurity, and tough action on corruption, illegal logging, and crime. In early December, the government regained its seat at the United Nations. At the ASEAN meeting in Hanoi (December 1998), Cambodia was accepted in principle for membership in ASEAN, but formal membership has been postponed until there were clear indications of political stabiiity. B. Macroeconomic Devdopments 6. Output growth stagnated and inflation increased in 1998 even though economic activity started to rebound following the formation of the new government (Chart 1 and Table 1). Agricultural production remained at the 1997 level, owing to long periods of extreme drought, and the service sector contracted mainly because tourism declined Industrial production grew by about 1 percent, driven by 8nther growth in the garment sector. The 1Zmonth rate of inflation accelerated to 19 percent in June, spurred by rice price increases and the depreciation of the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, both of which were significantly affected by political uncertainty in the run-up to the elections. The rate of intlation subsided in the last quarter of the year, once the exchange rate stabilized, and ended the year at 13 percent, 7. The trade balance improved slightly, and the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) was able to accumulate US%13 million in international reserves3 Exports were buoyed by a booming garment sector, while import growth was modest, reflecting weak economic activity and reductions in project aid. A widening of the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) by % percent of GDP reflected increased provision of technical assistance by donors (Table 2). The riel depreciated by 10 percent against the US dollar during the tirst half of the year, despite modest exchange market intervention by the NBC, but rebounded following the July elections and showed more strength following the formation of the new ‘(. .continued) Ranariddh’s FUNCINPEC 42 seats, and the Sam Rainsy Party 13 seats. Thus, the CPP did not secure the two-thirds majority needed to form a government based on a single party. ‘In addition, gross international reserves increased by USSll7 million in May on account of the release by the BIS of the Cambodian government’s gold holdings that had been blocked since the Pol Pot regime. With this increase, international reserves increased in 1998 to the equivalent of three months of imports. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- government, giving the NBC the opportunity to buy foreign exchange from the market (Chart 2). 8. Shortfalls in revenue collection, overspending on the military budget and a lack of foreign budgetary support led to a weak focal performance in 1998,’ which was reflected in sign&ant recourse by the government to central bank Snancing for the first time in 4 years (CR125 billion, or 1% percent of GDP) (Table 3). Rtvtnut, at 8’% percent of GDP, fell about % percent of GDP short of the budget target, mainly owing to disappointing nontax revenue wllection, which wntinued to suffer from persistent governance problems (shortfalls in timber royalties and in revenue collection through other ljne ministries). Domestic tax revenue was as planned, benefitting from partial implementation of the 1997 Tax Jaw and improvements in tax administration. Trade taxes, while on target, could have been higher, if the government had not granted extensive ad hoc exemptions, particularly in the run-up to the elections.5 9. Current expenditure, at 8.9 percent of GDP, exceeded the budget by about 54 percent of GDP, to finance highepthan-expected military and election-related spending. Outlays on defense and security exceeded the plan by more than H percent of GDP to tinance the integration of 22,000 Rhmer Rouge soldiers into the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces @KM).6 This overspending led, for the third year in a row, to a squeeze in civilian operations and maintenance outlays. The budget registered a current account deficit of % percent of GDP (as opposed to a planned surplus), but the overall deficit was smaller than budgeted (4 percent of GDP), because of lower capital spending. 10. Broad money grew by 16 percent last year, or somewhat less than in 1997, reflecting a sharp increase in currency in circulation associated with bank financing of the budget deficit, partly offset by zero growth in foreign currency deposits (a 8% percent decrease in U.S. dollar terms) (Table 4). The decline (in U.S. dollar terms) in foreign currency deposits started in 1997 and continued almost uninterruptedly until July 1998, driven by the uncertain political climate. Credit to the private sector decreased by 6 percent in U.S. dollar terms, reflecting slow economic activity. Total bank credit, however, expanded owing to the government’s recourse to central bank borrowing. Commercial bank interest rates remained broadly unchanged at around 19 percent for dollar-based lending, 2-3 percent for dollar term deposits, and 7-8 percent for tie1 term deposits. ‘The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year 5 Data provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance indicate that foregone revenue (customs duties, turnover tax and consumption tax) due to ad hoc exemptions amounted to 0.3 percent of GDP in 1998. 6This additional expenditure was mainly of a social character to cover allowances for the families of the defected soldiers, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7. 11. Little advance was made during 1998 in the key structural reform areas of forestry, governance in tiscal management, and civil strvicc and military reform, as government actions were pat-a&d both before the elections and during the formation of the new administration. . Illegal logging and log exports reportedly increased dramatically during the second halfof 1997 and through the tirst half of 1998. The logging pace seemed to have decreased somewhat in the second half of the year. . In the focal area, ud hoc exemptions were granted widely, as noted earlier; the government failed to increase the collection of timber royalties; and the 1997 Tax Law was only partially implemented.’ . Progress in civil service reform continued at a slow pace. The government started preparing the implementation of a central&d automated payroll system and continued the identification of so-caged ghost workers. A total of 3,119 civil servants were removed gem the payroll, bringing the number of civil servants to approximately 167,000 at the end of 1998. Military reform staged, as attention was focused on the integration of Khmer Rouge military into the RCAP. ID. REPORT ON DISCIJ~NONS 12. The authorities agreed with the mission that Cambodia was now at a critical crossroads in its recent history. A more cohesive government is in power, general confidence is returning, and the recent surrender of the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders has increased the chances for a durable peace and domestic security. The current situation thus offers a unique opportunity to address the key economic problems of the country and resume structural reforms at an accelerated pace, Such actions would pave the way for sustained medium-term development, allowing the government to alleviate poverty and reduce social inequalities. A. Outlook for 1999 13. Consistent with a return to higher economic growth over the medium term, output growth of about 4 percent is expected for 1999, while inflation should decline to 6-7 percent, thus promoting a more stable exchange rate against the U.S. dollar around its current level. A somewhat wider external current account deficit is projected, as imports expand with a rebound in foreign investment and increasing aid flows. In this light, the authorities stressed their commitment to tight macroeconomic policies by implementing the budget as planned. The introduction of the VAT and the additional tax on petroleum products could exert upward pressure on prices by as much as 1X-2 percent; however, with a good agricultural harvest and no central bank Snancing of the budget, additional pressure on prices ‘The introduction of the VAT was postponed until January 1, 1999 even though technical preparations had been on track for an earlier implementation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- would be minimal. Jn this context, the mission stressed the importance of keeping the budget in check and of repaying part of the government’s outstanding credit from the central bank. 14. III January 1999, tbt government introduced a number of measure against illegal logging and corruption in general, and announced plaus to resume structural reforms. Several of these measures were part of the preconditions, discussed with the government during the 1998 Article N consultation, for resuming discussions on a possible new ESAP-supported program (Box 1). The mission welcomed the actions taken by the government, but stressed that the critical test for this initial effort would be to demonstrate wncrete results through e&ctive enforcement and to sustain it over time to ensure that the economic benefits of the reforms were realiied. B. Fiscal Policy 15. A&bough the 1999 budget marks an improvement over 1998, it still represents only a first tentative step on tbt road to medium-term fwcal sustainability. Total revenue is projected to increase by 1% percentage points to 10 percent of GDP. Current expenditure would remain around 9 percent of GDP, thus generating a small current account surplus, while capital expenditure is projected conservatively at around 3 percent of GDP. The overall deficit of about 2 percent of GDP would be tally covered by foreign budget support loans and other aid inflows, while the government’s net indebtedness to the banking system would be reduced. 16. Discussions focused on tbe feasibility of reaching the revenue target and the risks for expenditure management. Tax revenue is projected to increase by % percent of GDP (reflecting the introduction of VAT) and nontax revenue by 1 percent of GDP (because of the increase in timber royalties), The authorities recognized that the revenue projections remained fragile for several reasons: (i) although, in January, the govemment announced an increase in timber royalties 6om an average of USS14 per ms to an average of US!§54 per m3, it would take a few months before this increase was implemented; (ii) the VAT regime had yet to prove that it was operational, (iii) several nontax items included wUection of arrears, an issue that had proven difficult in the past years; and (iv) the government had yet to prove its determination in not granting any udhoc tax and duty exemptions. Jn the face of these factors, the authorities acknowledged the need to strengthen overall tax administration and to develop contingency measures. Jn this connection, they remained wmmitted to extending the coverage of pre-shipment inspections (PSI) for imports as a means of bolstering customs duty collections and reducing corruption. The introduction of the 10 percent excise tax on hotel stays (as provided in the 1997 Tax Law) was also being kept under review, although the authorities had been reluctant to introduce this tax right on the heels of the VAT at a time when tourist activity had been depressed.

Current expenditure only reflects an initial effort at reorienting spending. Gutlays for defense and security are set to decrease by % percent of GDP. However, the budget makes no provision for an increase in civil service wages (currently the equivalent of US%18 per month on average), while outlays for health and education are projected to rise by only % percent of GDP. The authorities agreed that pressures to increase current expenditure may arise as evidenced by the recently agreed increase. in teachers’ salaries, which has aheady committed the budget’s contingency reserve. The mission strongly encouraged the authorities to maintain a tight rein on spending as the experience of recent years indicated that any unanticipated spending (e.g., on defense and security) was o&et by forced cutbacks in civilian operations and maintenance, thus weakening the efficiency of the civil service and providing incentives for more corruption. The authorities recognised this danger and stressed their determination not to cut outlays for basic health and education. It was understood that the capital budget could expand ifintlows for project financing increased in the light of the forthcoming CG meeting. C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies ’ 18. The authorities’ primary monetary policy objective is to re-establish financial stability. To this end, the authorities expressed a commitment to the defacro freeze on central bank net credit to the government, as in place prior to 1998, and a target for base money growth broadly in line with money demand consistent with the targeted growth in nominal GDP and a girther expected small decline in income velocity. By improving their policy credibiity, the authorities hoped to be able to reduce graduslly the extent of dollarization in Cambodia over the medium term.* In the discussions, the mission endorsed the authorities’ decision not to pursue this end through administrative measures. The authorities are focusing their efforts instead on ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment through actions to strengthen the fiscal position and the soundness of the banking sector.’ The mission encouraged the authorities to pursue these efforts, while noting that other options, including a possible shit? to a dollar-based monetary system or a currency board, could be m-evaluated in the future. 19. The flexible exchange rate regime with a liberal payments system has served the Cambodian economy reasonably well, even though at times it has been subject to erratic market forces, particularly in periods of heightened political uncertainty. Against this backdrop, the authorities indicated their intention to continue a flexible exchange rate regime by adjusting the official exchange rate on a daily basis, so as to maintain the spread *DoUarization is extensive in Cambodia as most bank lending is denominated in dollars and foreign currency deposits account for around 60 percent of broad money. Dollars in circulation are estimated to be at least as large as measured broad money. 9he.y are also considering the issue of treasury biis as a means of promoting financial transactions in local currency.

Given the low level of international reserves relative to the volume of trade-related transactions and capital flows, it was agreed that a fixed-exchange rate regime would not be appropriate at this time. D. Structural Reforms 20. Tbe Prime Minister reaffhmed to the mission the government’s commitment to accelerated structural reforms in ah areas. The Superior Council for State Reform (SCSR) was formed in early 1999 to supervise and coordinate the overall reform program, including public finance reform, public administration reform, judiciary reform, and security forces reform. In addition, he emphasixed that the fight against illegal logging was at the top of the government’s agenda, as evidenced by the series of measures announced since the government took office. The mission welcomed these renewed reform efforts and, in regard to forestry management, stressed the need for sustained enforcement of the measures. Public resource management 21. The measures recently taken by the government to fight against illegal logging and improve forestry management go beyond tbe requirements formulated last year by the mission and were summarizd in a 1Xpoint Order issued by the Prime Minister on January 22 (Box 2). In addition, in January, 11 concession contracts were canceled because they either had expired or were in violation of the terms of the contract or of Cambodian law. The land covered under these contracts (around 2.1 million hectares or % of the total area under concession) will be kept in reserve or transformed into national parks. 22. The mission encouraged the government to make forest conservation a top priority within its overall reform agenda, in view of the extensive environmental degradation caused by illegal logging during the past 2-3 years. In addition to the actions laid out in the 17-point Order, the mission urged the government to: (i) move ahead quickly on the revision of the Forestry Law to provide a permanent thunework for sustainable logging and protection of Cambodia’s forest resources; (ii) expedite the establishment of a control and monitoring system; and (iii) start revising the existing concession contracts. The authorities agreed with these proposals. ‘DThere are no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, and the authorities are actively considering the implications of accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund.

The authorities indicated that the government had revoked all ad hoc tax and duty exemptions and that it intended not to grant any new ones. The mission welcomed this as an important step in improving governance in fiscal management and in bolstering revenue, and urged the government to adopt a consistent approach to avoid undermining its policy de&rations. The Mmination of the exemption from export tax for wood products and rubber was seen as an appropriate step. 24. The mission also stressed that the authorities should not neglect other sources of forgone revenue, such as the wllection of arrears through other line ministries and the transfer of all revenue from line ministries to the Treasury. In addition, the government should lend its fidl support to the Tax Department when its audits indicated !iaudulent practices. “Exemptions” of this nature should not be tolerated. The authorities agreed with the mission’s point of view but pointed out that weaknesses in tax administration hampered 111 implementation of this policy. The mission also welcomed the adoption of the prime Ministerial Order requiring prior agreement from the Minister of Economy and Finance for each transaction involving state assets, including natural resources, and encouraged the gove.mment to apply it wnsistently. Civil service and military reform 25. The government is determined to accelerate the pace of civil service reform in 1999. A centralized automated payroll system was started in January 1999 in five “pilot” ministries and would gradually be expanded to all ministries by the end of the year. In addition, a new head-count is planned for 1999 and a study will begin on the formation of a “group of core civil servants” to improve the productivity of the administration. The mission, while encouraging these steps, emphasii the need for complementary actions in the preparation of options for civil service reform, including a reduction in the civil service, implementation of a new salary scale, and a general increase in civil service pay levels, as recommended in the Public Expenditure Review recently undertaken by the World Bank. These steps would contribute to a reduction in corruption and an increase in efficiency. 26. The authorities expressed their commitment to resume demobiliition of the armed forcw and police service under the Cambodian Veterans Assistance Program (CVAP) by taking advantage of the improved security situation. The aim is to reduce the military forces from the current level (148,500) to a range of 80,000-100,000 over the next three years. However, the speed at which such a reform could be undertaken depends crucially on the availability of foreign financial assistance. The mission recommended a head start in 1999 by registering all military staff, pending the intlow of foreign assistance.

The authorities saw further modemization and ratiooaliition as key to increased confidence in the banking system. The authorities noted that a proliferation of banks appeared during 1994 after the government allowed the entry of private and foreign banks; they felt that the number of banks in Cambodia was excessive in relation to the needs for banking activity. Moreover, in the absence of a proper legal tiamework and strong supervisory capacity, the authorities recognized that banking operations had not beeo adequately monitored. In this context, they agreed with the mission that the long-awaited adoption of the Commercial Bank Law, currently under consideration by the National Assembly, was of critical importance. It was also agreed that, once this law was enacted, all banks should be required to reapply, thus giving the NBC the opportunity to close those banks that are operating in violation of Cambodian law. 28. Tbe authorities plan to continue on-site inspections through internationally recognized firms until the NBC has built up its own supervisory capacity.” They noted that there were two banks with liquidity problems, caused by excessive investment in real estate, and that a few banks were reported to have experienced problems complying with the decree of December 1997, which increased the capital guarantee deposit and the minimum capital. The banks with problems were branches of banks that had been under pressure in their home country in the wake of the Asian crisis. The system suffers from a lack of investment opportunities (lending as a percent of GDP is only 5 percent). In light of this situation, the NBC opened dollar-denominated accounts for commercial banks in 1998, remunerated at seven-eighths of SIBOR. 29. The authorities noted that the banking sector suffers from several structural problems, such as the lack of experienced banking staff, the lack of internal control and lending procedures, the absence of collateral and of well-established accounting principles. More generally, the absence of a clear legal flamework makes banking (and lending in particular) a risky activity in Cambodia (hence the generally prudent approach taken by most banks). The mission suggested that close monitoring of nonperforming loans be maintained, particularly because accounting standards were weak. In this context, it was agreed that the introduction of international accounting standards should be a priority for the banking sector, for which NBC management was interested in receiving technical assistance. 30. As part of a plan to expand financial intermediation in rural areas, the Rural Development Bank (RDB) started operations in early 1998 as a first-tier institution for channeling funds to lower-tier microfinance institutions. However, in the last months of the year, the RDB started to engage directly in some retail lending. The authorities explained that this was exceptional and that the statutes of the RDB had been changed in January 1999 to “An MAE resident expert is currently training NBC staff to start on-site inspections in the near future.

The mission welcomed the work of the NBC to bring the microtinance institutions under its supervision. Privatisation 31. Most of the major state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been privatized. As part of an ongoing process of rationalising the SOE sector, in 1998 the government privatized 15 enterprises in an amount of USS8.6 million. For 1999, the government plans to transform its six rubber cultivation companies into autonomous state enterprises under the Law on Public Enterprises. Partial privatization is planned for a later stage. The mission welcomed these decisions after the long delays that had been incurred. The authorities noted that most of the remaining SOEs (medium- and small-sized companies) would require time to divest because the employees were still demandii too high a severance payment (between USSl,OOO and USS3,OOO). The authorities did not have a clear strategy for privatiaing these SOEs but noted that their economic significance was relatively minor. E. External Sector Issues 32. Cambodii maintains a moderately restrictive trade regime, with an import-weighted average tarifFof 18 percent and the majority of tariff lines at one of four rates.r2 There are a number of exceptional rates and surcharges that push taritf peaks (on certain luxury goods) to 120 percent. The authorities agreed to study a reduction in the number of rates as well as the possibility of replacing taritf peaks with excise taxes. The adoption of fast-track status within ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) will also be considered, once ASEAN membership is completed. The authorities are proceeding with plans for WTO accession and have prepared a draft Memorandum to be reviewed by the Council of Minhters in the coming weeks. 33. Cambodia has not concluded bilateral agreements with the United States and the Russian Federation as called for under the 1995 Paris Club agreement. Current maturities with Russia would appear to be covered by a 1991 standstill agreement, but with the lapsing of the consolidation period on the Paris Club accord, Cambodia is again accumulating arrears to the United States. The mission made clear that regulariration of external payments would be a necessary precursor of a new ESAF arrangement. The authorities, noting ongoing World Bank technical assistance to deal with the complexities of these long-standing debts, indicated that they would be prepared to engage in negotiations with these creditors in conjunction with the next visit of the consultant, expected in March 1999. I2 These are 7, 15,35 and 50 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- F. Medium-Term External Prospects 34. Notwithstanding the government’s economic reform program, the medium-term prospects for Cambodia’s external position remain subject to uncertainties, as noted in two illustrative scenarios prepared by tbe staff for the period 19992004 (Appendii II, Table 5). Under the baseline scenario, the authorities would proceed to implement their announced reform agenda, maintaining cautious monetary and fiscal policies, resuhing in low inflation, a more stable exchange rate, and economic growth of around 7 percent per year over the medium term. This growth would be accompanied by a rebound in foreign dii invwtme.nt, tourism, and foreign assistance, as well as strong export performance linked significantly to the expansion of the garment industry. With the growth of these receipts, it would be possible to increase international reserves to over three months of imports by 2004, while still financing a current account deficit between 10 percent of GDP and 12 percent of GDP. The envisaged economic growth would also facilitate the successful implementation of civil service and military reform by creating employment opportunities for both displaced staff and the vast amount of young entrants in the labor force. Fiscal reform, leading to an increase in the tax and non-tax revenue effort to around 15 percent of GDP by 2004, and real&&ion of the “peace dividend” from military demobiition are critical to the success of this reform scenario and the government’s poverty reduction and public expenditure reforms as recommended in the World Bank’s recent Public Expenditure Review. 35. Should the government be unable to carry through its announced reform program, the prospects would be much bleaker. Inflation is projected to rise to around 20 percent by 2004 and, without the fiscal reforms and the added inflows from abroad, per capita GDP would be unlikely to show any significant increase over the medium term. Accordingly, the incidence of poverty would be likely to rise Rnther, placing additional pressures on Cambodia’s natural resource base. Moreover, in the alternative scenario, the debt burden would further threaten the sustainabiity of the fiscal framework. G. Statistical Issues 36. Cambodia provides the basic elements of the core statistical data set to the Fund. Despite significant progress in improving the statistical data base, much remains to be done in terms of coverage, accuracy, and dissemination. This is particularly true for the compilation of the CPI (which covers only Phnom Penh), the balance of payments, and national accounts data (no official data have been published since 1996) (Appendix III). The mission recommended that Cambodia take the actions required to participate in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Iv. STAFF APPRAISAL 37. Dominated by a mood of political uncertainty and the Asian crisis, macroeconomic performance continued to deteriorate during most of 1998. However, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-17. during the last quarter, and particularly once a new government was formed, economic activity has shown signs of a recovery, the exchange rate has stabii and inflation has declined. 38. The major task for the government in 1999 is to build conftience in its economic management and address boldly the economic, structural, and social challenges that currently face the country. Provided the political and social climate remains relatively stable and sound fiscal and monetary policies are pursued as planned (including no central bank financing of the budget de&it), economic growth is expeoted to resume, the (market- determined) exchange rate would remain stable, and inflation would come down further. 39. The staff welcomes the government’s determination to resume structural reforms in key areas which, together with prudent macroeconomic policies, would lay the foundation for sustainable high growtb over the medium term. The main priorities are to tackle the problem of illegal logging at its roots and to pursue civil service and military reform. The government, which assumed office in November 1998, has indicated its determination to fight against illegal logging and other forms of corruption through a variety of important measures. This policy needs to be enforced vigorously in ah parts of the country and at all levels of the government. It should also be complemented by the development of a new forestry management tiamework to guide. forest development and exploitation over the medium term. 40. The government has declared its intentionto improve governance in budgetary management by discontinuing the granting of ud hoc import duty and tax exemptions. The 1999 budget is a tirst tentative step towards the necessary restructuring of fiscal policy, as it contains several measures to enhance revenue performance that need to be monitored caretidly. In this regard, the introduction of the VAT is a particularly important step in improving Cambodia’s tax effort. Reorientation of government expenditure remains, however, a weak point. As recommended by the recent Public Expenditure Review undertaken by the World Bank, spending should be shit&l away from defense and security toward health, education, civil service wages, and civilian operations and maintenance. 41. Reforms in other areas need to continue or be resumed at an accelerated pace. The banking system should be rational&d, and the National Bank’s supervisory capacity needs to be strengthened further. Early adoption and implementation of the Banking Law is crucial for these objectives. Once donor funds become available, civil service reform and demobilization of defense and security forces should be pursued vigorously to support the needed reorientation of government spending. 42. The etforts undertaken so far by the government address most of the concerns raised during the 1998 Article IV consultation as obstacles to ESAF negotiations. However, meaningful progress in key reform areas will depend on the government’s willingness to follow through with the steadfast implementation of announced policies. If the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- measures taken so far are sustai&d and enforced, the &atT expects that discussions on a possible new ESAF-supported program could Mart in the near fbture. 43. Even though tbe new policy orientation has opened the door to a renewal of sustainable economic growth and stability in Cambodii, the medium-term prospects for Cambodia’s external payments position remain subject to uncertainties. Continuing fiscal r&am, fb primarily on a further strengthening of the domestic tax basis, is of critical importance. This effort, together with the “peace dividend” from military demobiition, would help to establish a sustainable fiscal position while providing funds for badly-needed poverty reduction programs. 44. Despite progMs since 1993, Cambodia’s statistical base remains weak and is plagued by inaccumciu and lack of broad covemge. The government has indicated its interest in participating in the GDDS which will help to establish a f%amework for abroad- based improvement in Cambodia’s statistical systems and Mastructure. 45. The staiTrecommends t+at the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: Since November 8,1992, the exchange rates of the riel for currencies of all countries have consisted of the following two rates. Fit, the official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external transactions conducted by the Government and state enterprises. The official exchange rate is adjusted so as to maintain the spread between the official rate and the riel-U.S. dollar rate prevailing in the parallel market within certain limits as discussed below. Second, the market rate, which is determined freely through interactions of foreign exchange traders in the private sector, applies to all other transactions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26- APPENIEX I From the beginning of 1994, the spread between the official and free market exchange rates was limited to no more than 2 percent on a daily basis and, &om March 1994, to no more than 1 percent on a daily basis, thus de facto unifying the dual exchange rate system.’ On January 31, 1999, the official exchange rate was CR 3,783 per dollar and the free market rate CR 3,795 per dollar. VII. Article IV Consultation: The Executive Board conch&d the last Article IV consultation on April 18, 1998 (F&I/98/80, 4/3/98). It was proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 1Zmonth cycle. Ix.

The principal advisor post (MAE) at the National Bank of Cambodia has been extended for another year. Further requests for Fund technical assistance will be considered on a case-by- case basis. X. Resident Representative: The resident representative office was closed in October 1997. ‘The spread exceeded 4 percent on a few occasions in August 1998 as the authorities supported the official rate through interventions, when the parallel market depreciated.

This appendix provides two ilhtstrative scenarios covering the period 1999-2004 (Table 5). L Full Reform Scenario The fvst scenario ir based on improvement in the conduct of macroeconomic policies and the steadfast implementation of the structural reform agenda, which would increase confidence in the government. As a result, economic growth would accelerate to about 7 percent per amnun by 2001 to raise per capita income and reduce poverty; national savings would increase steadily over the coming years to 6nance needed investment, while containing the external current account deficit to levels that can be financed on a sustainable basis; and gross official reserves would increase to at least 3% months of import coverage by 2003. Achieving these objectives will require the implementation of structural reforms in hey areas inchnling sustainable forestry management, governance and fiscal management, and civil service and military reform. In addition to lower military spending, significant improvements in revenue collection (to around 15 percent of GDP by 2004) will be necessary to finance a much needed increase in basic health, education, and infrastructure investment. The revenue improvement over the medium term would come gem the successfttl implementation of VAT, increased timber royalties, and improved tax administration, particularly in customs. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit will be contained at 3% percent of GDP which, after taking into account projected foreign financing, wig allow for the repayment of government debt to the NBC. Economic growth would be driven by a rebound in investment expenditure, including foreign direct investment, increased tourism, and a strong export performance. The improved fiscal position and a better climate for private savings will keep the external current account deficit at 1 1 - 12 percent of GDP, a level that can be tlnanced by projected donor support for the reform effort (Table 6). External debt would decline sharply in 1999, assuming the successfhl implementation of bilateral rescheduling agreements with key donors,’ and then ‘Cambodia’s external sovereign debt and debt service was rescheduled on Naples terms at the Paris Club on January 26, 1995 for all financial arrangements concluded before December 3 1, 1985 (cut-off date). Since then, Cambodia has signed bilateral rescheduling agreements with France, Germany, and Japan and has continued discussions with the United States. Cambodia also contracted sizable foreign obligations vis-a-vis four former CMEA countries. Cambodia (continued...)

Reflecting the highly concessional nature of donor support, debt service would remain at 2-3 percent of exports of goods and services, while the net present value of the debt would fall to less than 10 percent of GDP. II. Altenmtive Scenario The main downside risk in the medium term ia that, should the politic situation become unstable, tbe government would beunabk to follow tbrougb witb ita reform program. In these hamstances, Cahodia would have little prospect to reverse the economic decline experienced in recent years. The clbnate for domestic and foreign investment would deteriorate, foreign tinancing decline, and economic stagnation continue, kading to a further worsening in real per capita income and in poverty hrdicators.. Export growth would decline owing to a lack of investment, as well as a further deterioration in the natural resource environment. More domestic financing of the budget would lead to an acceleration in intlation and, while low investment would restrain the bxrease in the external current account deficit, the lack of fmancing would put pressure on the international reserve position. Because of waning donor support, more reliance would be placed on other external borrowing on less concessional terms leadiig to a worsening in debt indicators and placing increasing pressure,on the fiscal position. ‘(...continued) has suspended servicing these debts, pending the conclusion of negotiations. In the baseline scenario, these debts are assumed to be rescheduled in 1999 on concessional terms.

Substantial improvements have been made since then, and an IFS page for Cambodia was published in April 1996. Nevertheless, sign&ant problems remain even though the considerable amount of technical assistance has been provided by the Fund, the UNDP, the AsDB, and the World Bank. Core data are generally provided on a timely basis (see Table), although there have been occasional delays, which somewhat increased since the closing of the Resident Representative office in 1997. 1. National accounts The National Institute of Statistics @IS) of the Ministry of Phmning provides official estimates of the components of real GDP by economic sector. Official estimates of GDP by expenditure category are not available.’ The available statistical base on which the national accounts are estimated is extremely weak and fragmentary, and data for most sectors are not collected on a systematic basis. GDP deSators are estimated Tom CPI data, as no other price data are available. The NIS has recently begun to utilixe the data flom the comprehensive Socio-Economic Survey conducted in 1993/94 to estimate GDP by expenditure, supported by technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank. Surveys of the main economic sectors need to be conducted, and the improvement of the national accounts database will require a number of years. The latest official national accounts cover transactions for 1996. Estimates for 1997 are still prehminary and no work has been done for 1998. 2. Prices Prior to 1996, three consumer price indices were compiled separately by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), the MEF, and the NIS. All three indices were designed to measure inflation in Phnom Perth only. Substantial discrepancies in estimated intlation rates arose between the three indices owing mainly to diirences in coverage and weighting systems. A STA technical assistance mission on consumer price indices in 1995 concluded that the NIS index provides the most reliable measure of intlation in Cambodia. The Cambodian authorities subsequently agreed to adopt the NIS index as the official CPI and ceased the publication of the NBC and the MEF indices from January 1996. However, the February 1997 STA mission found that, although the timeliness of the CPI had been improved significantly since the 1995 mission, issues relating to the price collection procedures and the treatment of specitic problems encountered in the compilation of consumer price indices were still to be resolved. No producer or wholesale price indices are available. ‘Preliminary unofficial estimates of GDP on the expenditure side have been prepared by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), which were provided to the mission in January 1999.

Government finance statistics Government finance statistical, though still weak aa regards wverage, have improved during the last two years with substantial technical assistance fbtanced in large part by the World Bank. Fiscal data are compiled on the basis of the JMF’s GFS methodology, and expenditures are reported by both economic and ftmctional classitication, although the economic classitkxtion remains limited and detailed data are only available on a yearly baais several months a&r tbe end of the fiscal year.’ Information on external financing of the budget has improved substan&@, although detailed donor-specitlc data on investments financed by project aid are available only with substantial lags. The authorities do not provide fiscal data for publication in IFS or the GFS Yearbook. 4. Monetary statlstlca Data on monetary authorities and deposit money banks are reported by the National Bank of Cambodia on a monthly basis, with a lag of one to two months. Substantial hnprove- ments have been made in the past few years in the classitlcation of monetary accounts, particularly with the shift to the new plan of accounts by the National Bank beginning January 1,1996, followed by an introduction of an IFS page for Cambodia in April 1996. Monetary statistics in Cambodia cover riels in circulation and domestic bank deposits in riel and foreign cmrencies. However, data on the large amount of foreign currency in circulation in Cambodia are not available. ks a result, the effective money sttock in Cambodia is underestimated by the amount of foreign currency in circulation, which leads to overestimates of the income velocity of money. External strtisth While significant improvement has been made by the Research Department of the National Bank of Cambodia in the compilation of balance of payments statistics, aided in large part by a previous long-term advisor, weaknesses remain in several areas. First, customs coverage of trade with Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand has improved further over the past two years, as trade on which customs duties are levied is reported on a monthly basis. However, duty-gee imports, inckximg, in particular, goods related to humanitarian assistance and project aid, remain unrecorded. A sign&ant amount of illegal log exports is unrecorded, and details of untaxed exports passing through official channels are not available. Estimates of the trade balance are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Second, the compilation of Bows of foreign official assistance and disbursements is not yet central&d at the MEF. Third, while efforts have been made to compile better data on foreign direct investment, private capital flows are likely to be large and not tIdly captured by official data. Fourth, a range of international transactions by enterprises, such aa payments for imported services, income payments, and portfolio investment abroad are not included in the data. These issues were addressed by a STA mission which visited Phnom Penh in November/December 1998. ‘The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year.

Relations between Cambodia and the Bank were interrupted between 1975 and 1992. In September 1992, Cambodia decided to resume active participation in the Bank, appointing a representative on the Bank Board of Governors and designating the National Bank of Cambodia as .the depository institution for Bank assets in Cambodia. To date, eight projects have been approved for Cambodia (S268 million). The tlrst lending operation-an Etnergentzy Rehabiiition Credit-was approved in October 1993, to provide critical imports in agricuhur~ transport, water supply, power, education, and health. It waa followed by an Economic Recovery Credit that provided quick-disbursing balance of paymenta support. A Technical Assistance Project is assisting in strengthening institutional capacities for improving economic management and the enviromnent for private sector development. A Social Fund Project is tinancing small local projects in the area of social ir&atructure, economic idastructure, and social services. The Phnom Perth Power Rehabiitation Project focuses on restoring the network in Phnom Penh and instltutional development of the sector. In N 1997, two IDA project were approved--a Disease Control and Health Development Project to support rehabilitation and expansion of the public health system, with a focus on control of wmmunicable diseases, tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS; and an Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project focussing on institutional development at the Ministry of Agriculture, includmg rehabilitation of training facilities, retraining of staff and sponsoring pilot field activities. In N 1998, an Urban Water Supply Project was approved and would improve water facilities in both Phnom Penh and Siianoul&lle. An office has been opened in Phnom Perth to assist in the implementation of the Bank’s assistance program and facilitate wmmunication with the government and other donors. Cambodia became a member of the IFC in March 1997. The IFC is expected to provide entrepreneur training and business services for small and medium enterprises under the Mekong Project Development Facility. In addition, the IFC has approved an investment in a Cambodian power project. The IFC is also providing technical assistance to transform a Cambodian microlinance NGO into a commercial institution. With regard to analytical work, the Bank prepared an economic assessment for the ministerial meeting in 1992, and economic reports tbr the ICORC meetings in 1994 and 1995. Country Economic Memoranda were prepared for the CG meeting in 1996 and 1997. At the request of the government, a Forest Policy Assessment report was prepared in June 1996 jointly with the UNDP and the FA0 with a view to assisting in implementing sustainable management of forest resources. The second phase of a report on Cambodia’s poverty protile has been prepared. Assistance was provided to the government in preparing a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). A Public Expenditure Review has been prepared and will be presented at the Consultative Group meeting in Tokyo on February 25-26,1999. Also a poverty assessment and strategy report focussing on social sectors is under preparation. ‘Prepared by the Fund statfbased on information provided by the World Bank.

In 1992, after seversl AsDB missions, including joint missions with the Fund and the World Bank, the AsDB approved the S67.7 million Special Rehabilitation Assiince Loan. Consistent with the Deelaratlon of Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Cambodii issued at the June 1992 Tokyo Ministerial Conferewe, this loan provided assistance in agriculture, transport, energy, and education. It was wmpleted in October 1997. In January 1994, the first Country Progmmming mission to Cambodia developed a medium- term lending and TA strategy for EM-1997 focused on rehabiitation, reconstruction, and development. A 1995-98 Country Operational Strategy was tinalii in October 1995. It outlined the alleviation of certain key constraints through: (i) capacity-building to strengthen the macroeconomic and sector agencies; (ii) tlnancial as&tance for inflaatructure rehabilitation and upgrading; (ii) technical and financial support for social sectors; and (iv) assistant for environment and natural resource management and conservation. As of December 3 1, 1998, there were eight active AsDB project loans and one active AsDB program loan to Cambodia The December 1994 S28.2 million loan for the Power Rehabilitation Project was the first loan approved under normal operations. In 1995 two projects, the Basic Skills Project and the Rnrai Infrastrncturc Project, totaling GE.1 million, were approved. In 1996 the AsDB approved five loans for a total of $105 million; the Basic Education Textbook Project (S20 million), the Basic Health Services Project (SZO million), the Phnom Penh Water Supply and Sanitation Project ($20 million), the Siem Reap Airport Project (SlS million), and the Agricultural Sector Program (530 million). Because of the political events of July 1997, no new loans were processed in 1997. Normal operations were resumed in December 1998 with the approval of the S140 rnihion loan (ofwhich Cambodia’s share is S40 million) for the Greater Mekong Subregion: Pimom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project. Since the 1992 resumption of AsDB activities in Cambodia, S4 1.6 million of technical assistance (TA) has been extended to Cambodia in the form of 52 TA projects, 37 of which were for advisory and operational purposes and 15 of which were for project preparation. The sectoral distribution of these projects by amount is aa follows: 24 percent-multisectoral; 20 percent-social inliastructure; 13 percent-agriculture and agroindustry; 10 percent-transport and wmmunications; 4 percent-energy; 2 percent-tinancial, 1 percentindustry; and 26 percent-other. The first major TA project was for Strengthening Macroeconomic Management, wtinsneed by the UNDP, for S4 million. This project covered public Gnance, money and banking, economic planning, and statistics, and provided support for the preparation of the Commercial Bank Law, the Government’s First Socioeconomic Development Plan and Public Investment Program, and the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDMV Socioeconomic Survey.
