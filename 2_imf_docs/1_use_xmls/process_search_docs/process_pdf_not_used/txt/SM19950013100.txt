Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Bangkok during March l- 13, 1995.’ The mission met with Mr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, Deputy Prime Minister; H.E. Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, Minister of Finance; Mr. Vijit Supinit, Governor of the Bank of Thailand; other senior officials of ministries and agencies; and members of the financial and business community. Thailand has accepted the obligations. of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. In concluding the 1994 Article IV consultation with Thailand, Directors noted early signs of possible overheating and supported a tightening of financial policies. In their view, as fiscal policy was already fairly tight, the brunt of the tightening would have to be borne by monetary policy. In this regard, several Directors suggested that greater exchange rate flexibility would enhance the efficiency of monetary control and increase the authorities’ ability to pursue an independent interest rate policy. Directors also supported the authorities’ program of structural reform but cautioned against heavy reliance on investment incentives to promote the move to higher value-added production. II. Background to the Discussions A. Recent Developments Like most of its ASEAN neighbors, Thailand experienced rapid economic expansion in the late 198Os, some slowdown in the early 199Os, and a pickup in growth in more recent years. After reaching a peak of 13 percent in 1988, Thailand’s real GDP growth declined, reflecting a tightening of financial policies and a decline in activity irrmajor trading partners (Table 1 and Chart 1). However, growth began to accelerate in late 1992 and, in 1993-94, it averaged 8 l/2 percent. As in other countries in the region, a key factor behind this acceleration was strong growth in exports, although the external sector’s net contribution to growth was negative as the rise in imports was stronger still. Another key factor was a pickup--and increasingly faster growth--in domestic demand. The growth of real domestic expenditure is estimated to have risen from 6 l/2 percent in 1992 to 8 l/2 percent in 1993 and to over 9 percent in 1994. The acceleration in 1994 was mainly on account of private consumption and public investment spending. The strengthening of private consumption reflected a sharp rise in incomes--linked to a turnaround in the agricultural sector and an acceleration in labor earnings--and a continued decline in the ‘The staff team consisted of Messrs.

Public investment expenditure grew by over 20 percent in 1994, double the rate of increase in 1993, as infrastructure spending was stepped up. Private investment rose by 8 percent in 1994, about the same rate of increase. as 1993, as a strengthening of infrastructure development being undertaken by the. private sector in the Bangkok region and of medium- and small-size investment projects offset a softening of spending on construction. Inflation intensified in 1994: the’consumer price index registered an increase of 5 percent, up from 3 l/4 percent in 1993. This increase mainly reflected a sharp rise in food prices, owing to the effect of a drought in the previous year; however, the strengthening of activity also resulted in rising costs, contributing to an increase in the nonfood price index. Wages in manufacturing rose by 12 percent in 1994, somewhat more rapidly than the previous year, while the unemployment rate fell slightly to 2 l/2 percent. In 1994, the external current account deficit amounted to 6 percent of GDP, up slightly from 1993 (Table 2, Chart 2). The trade deficit in U.S. dollar terms narrowed slightly to 6 112 percent of,GDP in 1994, as a robust performance of exports more than offset a strengthening of imports. Agricultural exports rose sharply with a rise in commodity prices and the return of more normal weather, while those of manufactures continued their rapid growth. Imports of both capital and consumer goods accelerated, reflecting the strengthening of domestic demand. However, the improvement in the trade balance was more than offset by a smaller surplus on the services account that was partly linked to an increase in foreign travel by Thai residents. The overall balance of payments registered a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 1994, somewhat lower than in 1993, as Thailand once again experienced strong capital inflows. There was a change in the composition of inflows, however, as portfolio and direct investment weakened while short-term inflows to the banking sector accelerated sharply. The capital account data for 1994 needs to be treated with caution as the development of the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF)2 has changed the classification of capital flows3 In order to resolve classification issues, a staff member from STA is to visit Thailand in June. 2 The BIBP, established in May 1993, is an offshore banking facility composed of 15 domestic and 33 international banks. To date, most of the transactions of these banks have consisted of borrowing abroad to lend domestically. Twenty-two of the foreign banks have recently been given permission to extend BIBF facilities outside of Bangkok. 3 For example, before the development of the BlBF, a foreign parent might have transferred funds borrowed abroad to a subsidiary in Thailand,‘while now the Thai subsidiary can borrow from a branch of the same bank in Bangkok. While the former transaction is classified as foreign direct investment, the latter is reported as a short-term inflow, but in both cases the economic impact is the same.

The declining trend continued in FY 1994 but the surplus still amounted to 1 3/4 percent of GDP, about 3/4 percentage points higher than budgeted (Table 3).4 The better-than-expected performance reflected the authorities’ tendency at budget time to overstate expenditure and underestimate revenue for the coming year. Even taking this factor into account, however, the performance of revenue was unexpectedly strong, in reflection of the strength of economic activity and improvements in tax administration, particularly of the VAT. The authorities expect the FY 1995 surplus to again reach almost 1 3/4 percent of GDP. Among the major features of this year’s budget are a continued shift in spending toward infrastructure development, education and training. In addition, expenditure will be boosted by a 14 l/2 percent increase in wages and salaries intended to partially close the large gap between public- and private-sector pay scales. As regards monetary developments, broad money (M2) grew by 17 percent during 1994 while credit to the private sector increased by 29 percent, well above the authorities’ target of 22 percent. Interest rates varied widely in 1994. In the first part of the year, unsterilized portfolio outflows, coupled with strong economic activity, pushed short-term interest rates from 3 3/4 percent at the beginning of the year to almost 9 percent in July of 1993. Subsequently, the reversal in portfolio flows, together with short-term inflows to the banking system in response to relatively high rates of return, led to a decline in short-term rates to about 6 l/2 percent by the end of the year (Chart 3). In 1994, the Thai baht depreciated by 4 percent and 2 l/4 percent in nominal and real effective terms, respectively; during January-March 1995, it depreciated further by 2 l/2 percent in nominal effective terms, and by 2 percent in real effective terms (Chart 4). These effective depreciations, while much smaller than those that occurred in the late 198Os, reflected the exchange rate movements among the major currencies and the baht’s closer link to the U.S. dollar. Against the U.S. dollar, the baht appreciated by 2 percent in 1994 and by 2 percent in 1995 (through end-April); against the Japanese yen, it depreciated by 10 l/2 percent and by 16 l/4 percent in the two periods. Capital markets in Thailand experienced some turbulence in early 1995. Partly as a consequence of some reallocation of international portfolios away from emerging markets, equity prices slumped in January; the Stock Exchange Index of Thailand fell by nearly 8 percent in the week ended January 13. The sharp decline was coupled with strong capital outflows and, as a consequence, the overnight interest rate shot up to 50 percent on January 13 from its level of 6 l/4 percent a week earlier. The episode was short-lived; a stock market recovery began on January 16, while the overnight interest rate fell to 10 percent. 4The fiscal year begins in October.

Outlook The authorities’ most recent forecast calls for real GDP growth of 8 l/2 percent in 1995--the same as in 1994--with a marginal decline in inflation to 4 3/4 percent. Private consumption is projected to slow somewhat, a consequence of a moderation in farm incomes and a rebound in the household saving rate. Private investment is expected to accelerate, reflecting a recovery in construction and a pickup in foreign direct investment. As in 1994, exports are expected to perform well, reflecting the strength of regional economies and the ongoing recovery in the industrial world. The external current account is projected to register a deficit of some 5 3/4 percent of GDP. In the staffs view, there is a risk that demand growth could be stronger than envisaged in the official forecast. Private consumption could continue its strong growth, particularly if the public sector wage increase has an important demonstration effect on private sector settlements. In addition, the recent nominal effective depreciation can be expected to boost the demand for traded goods in Thailand, while the move against the yen could result in a sharp increase in direct investment inflows, as was the case in the mid-1980s. The net effect of these factors would be increased demand pressures in the period ahead. III. Policy Discussions The main issues covered in the discussions were related to the conduct of financial policies in the period ahead, Thailand’s development strategy, and the likely effect of international trade agreements. A. Macroeconomic Policies The staff was of the view that it was important to take steps to prevent an intensification of demand pressures. In that connection, it was observed that annual growth on the order of 8 l/2 percent in 1993 and 1994 had removed the remaining slack from factor markets and, indeed, wages and costs had begun to accelerate with the unemployment rate below 3 percent and the capacity utilization rate at a high level. In the period ahead, if left unchecked, it was likely that the projected strength of spending would strain resources further, resulting in greater pressure on wages and costs. Given the openness of the economy, wage and cost pressures would not manifest themselves primarily in a meaningfL1 rise in price inflation but, rather, would act to squeeze profit margins, constraining the responsiveness of output to higher demand. The resulting gap between supply and demand would be met through higher purchases from abroad. In these circumstances, the staff believed that it is important for financial policies to moderate demand growth, both to prevent a weakening of the external position and to prevent an unsustainable rise in wage expectations.

Monetary and exchange rate policy The authorities agreed that the risks in the outlook were on the side of overheating. As in previous upswings, they were committed to taking the steps necessary to prevent an intensification of demand pressures. In that connection, it was intended that the stance of monetary policy be more restrictive than in 1994. As a first step, on March 3, the bank rate was raised by 1 percentage point to 10 l/2 percent. It was expected that this increase would work its way through the banking system, eventually raising lending rates by a similar amount and lowering the demand for credit. As the bank rate was still lower than in the early 1990s the authorities believed scope existed for further increases, should they prove necessary. The authorities also said that steps would be taken to ensure that the supply of credit would grow at a more acceptable rate than in 1994. Last year, private lending by domestic commercial banks increased by about 21 percent, in line with the growth specified in the official credit plan; the credit plan sets quantitative guidelines on the amount of credit each bank can extend. However, total private lending rose by almost 30 percent, as institutions not covered by the plan--foreign banks in the BIBF and domestic finance companies--were very active in the market. In order to ensure that the total provision of credit will not provide an inflationary impulse, the authorities are extending the coverage of the credit plan to include the finance companies. While the foreign banks will not yet be included in the plan, their behavior will be monitored closely and moral suasion will be brought to bear if their lending is deemed excessive. The staff expressed the view that expanding the scope of the credit plan could not ensure that total lending would be brought under control. As financial market liberalization proceeds, new channels of credit become available and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to control them simultaneously. For example, in the current environment, extending the coverage of the plan to the finance companies and even to the BIBF would not completely control access to funds, as investors could turn to the expanding corporate bond and equity markets. In addition, the staff stressed that the development of financial institutions whose main purpose is to service borrowers not able to secure credit because of the operation of the plan imposes a resource cost on the economy. As financial market liberalization progresses, indirect instruments of monetary control--such as the bank rate and open market operations in interest-bearing securities--would, in the staffs view, have to play a more significant role in the conduct of monetary policy. However, as the external value of the baht is pegged to a basket of currencies, maintaining an appropriate interest rate, if different from major trading partners, could prove dificult. In view of this consideration, the staff encouraged the authorities to consider allowing market forces a greater role in the determination of the exchange rate. At this juncture, given the strength of the overall balance of payments, allowing market forces to play a greater role would mean that the baht would strengthen. The upward movement in the exchange rate would alleviate pressure on resources by switching Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- expenditure from domestic to foreign sources, thereby easing the task of monetary management. While the strengthening of the baht might entail a widening of the external current account deficit in the short run, failure to achieve sufficient control over costs would also act to undermine competitiveness, with more disruptive consequences for the medium run because of the impact on inflationary expectations. The authorities agreed that, given the pace of financial market liberaiization, greater emphasis would have to be placed on the use of indirect instruments of monetary control. In preparation for the expanded use of indirect instruments, the Bank of Thailand is presently taking steps to increase its ability to intervene in the repurchase market, and is also considering issuing Bank of Thailand bonds for the same purpose. However, the authorities said that, at this time, they were reluctant to allow greater flexibility in the exchange rate as, in their vjew, markets for hedging instruments were not sufficiently developed. They viewed sterilization as a better policy option to contain the effects of capital inflows, although they conceded that this policy could entail substantial costs and was not likely to be effective over the longer run. The authorities said that several steps were taken in 1994 to strengthen supervision of the financial system. Capital adequacy ratios were increased for both commercial banks and finance companies in order to comply with BIS standards, the required provisions for doubttil assets were increased, and limits on banks’ net open foreign exchange positions were tightened. The overall assessment of the authorities was that the financial sector was healthy. 2. Fiscal policy The authorities are currently formulating the FY 1996 budget that is to take effect in October. They expected the policy stance to be about the same as in FY 1995, with revenue and expenditure at about the same levels of GDP. In view of the constraints facing monetary policy, the St&took the position that in the upcoming budget fiscal policy should make a greater contribution toward relieving demand pressure. This could be accomplished through better control of expenditure--largely by rationalizing public sector employment--and through higher tax rates. In particular, there is scope to widen the base of the VAT and to raise its rate from the current level of 7 percent; indeed, revenue From this source has fallen short by roughly 3 percentage points of receipts from the taxes it replaced. In addition, the tax rate on dividend receipts could be raised, as a wide discrepancy exists between that rate and the tax rate on earned income. As to the priorities for the FY 1996 budget, the authorities said that capital expenditure would continue to rise as a share of spending. As in FY 1995, investment expenditure would be concentrated in rural areas, as the infrastructure development in the Bangkok region is increasingly being undertaken by the private sector. As regards current expenditure, civil service salaries would rise by a more moderate 5-6 percent, following the 14 l/2 percent wage increase in FY 1995. Narrowing the large gap that exists between earnings in the public and private sectors continues to be a priority; however, larger selective Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- increases for certain categories of civil servants would be offset by productivity gains and reduced staffing levels. The authorities also said that improving education and training continues to be an important objective. In order to maximize the effectiveness of expenditure, the delivery of education services is to undergo a dramatic change beginning in FY 1996. At that time, the private sector, with the aid of soft loans and tax incentives, would provide the facilities and instructors for post-mandatory education (nine years). The funding for the tuition fees, which are to be set by the private sector, would come from a system of student loans. In this way, not only would the Government eventually be repaid by the recipients of educational services, but the subsidization of education could be better targeted both to those in true need and to areas seen as important to Thailand’s development. The authorities said that the long-term target for fiscal policy was budget bafance. As revenue currently exceeded expenditure, there would be scope to cut tax rates. However, the movement toward balance would be determined by the cyclical position of the economy. In addition, the evolution of the external current account would also influence decisions regarding the move to balance. B. Medium-Term Issues 1. Industrial relocation and restructuring Over the past three decades, Thailand’s growth rate has averaged 7 3/4 percent a year, which has resulted in a five-fold increase in per capita incomes. This rapid expansion has transformed the economy from one depending on a narrow agricultural base to one with significant manufacturing and services sectors. For example, in 1965, agriculture accounted for 35 percent of GDP, while services and manufacturing contributed 41 percent and 24 percent respectively. By 1994, agriculture’s share of output dropped to 11 percent, while the shares of services and manufacturing had increased to 58 percent and 3 1 percent respectively. Rapid development has entailed costs, however. The manufacturing and service sectors are concentrated in a narrow region in and around Bangkok; this has resulted in environmental and social problems. In addition, strains in infrastructure have emerged, limiting the potential for continued high rates of growth. As a solution to these problems, the authorities said they have embarked on a strategy to promote a more even distribution of production around the country. In the first instance, the Government has given the private sector a major role in upgrading the infrastructure in the Bangkok area, which has allowed a large portion of the capital budget to be devoted to developing the peripheral regions. In addition, the Government has provided significant tax incentives to locate industry outside the Bangkok region. Further, tax incentives are used to encourage the move to more environmentally sound techniques of production. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- authorities said that their program is meeting with success, as applications for investment in peripheral areas have risen sharply. The authorities said that the industrialization of Thailand has entailed rising wage costs, threatening the future prospects of the more labor-intensive industries. In their view, maintaining high growth rates requires a transition to higher technology production. In order to facilitate this transition, as mentioned previously, education and training policies are being reformulated. In addition, generous tax incentives are available for industries and activities deemed to be consistent with an upgrading of the economy’s technological base. The stti cautioned against the pervasive use of fiscal incentives in this regard, not only in view of the fiscal cost but also because the distortions in resource allocation they encourage could significantly harm growth potential over the medium term. The economic development and urbanization of Thailand have meant that the extended family can no longer be relied upon to provide an adequate social safety net. The Government has endeavored to take on this role and, in 1990, passed the Social Security Act. The social security system, which is financed by equal contributions of 1 l/2 percent of wages from employers, employees, and the Government, currentl, provides benefits to members in four areas: invalidity, sickness, maternity, and death. Revisions to the Act in 1994 committed the Government to add pension and family allowance benefits to the system some time before 1998. The authorities said that the details of these new benefits are still under development, however, and no final decision on the structure, contribution rates, or benefit levels for the new schemes are anticipated before the end of 1995. 2. External viability Thailand’s rapid industrialization has been accompanied by a large current account deficit that averaged about 5 percent of GDP over the past decade (Table 3 and Chart 2). The staffteam discussed with the authorities the sustainability of this large deficit over the medium term and any possible problem that might spark a sudden change in international sentiment. After a review of the structure of the current account deficit, the staff team agreed with the authorities that the external position is fundamentally sound. In particular, foreign saving has been used to finance investment, not consumption, as was the case in countries that have tended to experience difficulty. Indeed, in Thailand, the level of the imbalance reflects a remarkable investment performance that overwhelmed a substantial rise in the rate of national saving. For example, fi-om 1985 to 1994, gross national saving rose from 20 percent to over 34 percent of GDP, while, over the same period, gross national investment rose from 24 percent of GDP to 40 percent of GDP. In addition, Thailand’s use of foreign saving has not involved a run-up in external debt; at the end of 1994, external debt amounted to 43 l/2 percent of GDP. As to the evolution of the external position, it can be expected that over the long term the current account deficit will narrow, perhaps significantly, as forces will be at play to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- reduce investment in relation to GDP and to increase the national saving rate.5 On the side of investment, the present high level of private investment reflects relatively high rates of return that will be brought more in line with those of other countries, as the process of capital deepening unfolds. Also, public investment in recent years has been .boosted by the need to improve infrastructure. Once the initial and most pressing needs are met, the growth of investment is likely to moderate. As regards saving, there will be scope to raise public sector saving through a number of revenue and expenditure measures. As to private sector saving, the process of financial market liberalization has given consumers a new-found ability to borrow against wealth and future incomes. The result has been an adjustment in the pattern of lifetime consumption levels, which has contributed to a decline in the measured household saving rate. Once this adjustment is complete, it can be expected that the household saving rate will rebound. Also, the saving rate may be increased by a series of measures designed to strengthen the pension system; effective from January 1, 1995, the amount of annual tax-exempt employee contributions to provident funds was raised from B 10,000 to B 300,000, subject to a limit of 15 percent of earnings. C. International Trade Trade policy in Thailand is an integral part of development strategy, and the authorities said that a more liberal trading regime would be a means of increasing both growth and efficiency. The Government is fully committed to the global and regional trade initiatives that took place within the context of the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations and the AFTA agreement. A preliminary round of tariff cuts affecting almost 4,000 products was begun on January 1, 1995. It is intended to reduce the average tariff from about 30 percent to 17 percent by January 1, 1997; this will entail a fiscal cost of B 18 billion (1 l/4 percent of tax revenue) over the next two years. Further reductions are then expected to follow. While these actions are in line with Thailand’s obligations under the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, the policy of liberalizing tariffs to expose domestic industry to competition predates the agreement. In line with the abbreviated timetable set out by ASEAN in September 1994, the authorities have also initiated tariff reductions for AFTA members on over 8,000 products, to be completed by January 1, 2000. ‘Experiences of Singapore and some other successful economies of the region show that investment (in relation to GDP) rises sharply at the initial stage of a take-off and reaches a plateau; savings (in relation to GDP) rise more gradually but eventually reach a level required to close the gap. In the case of Singapore, a large investment-saving gap emerged in the early 1970s when industrialization gained momentum. The gap was gradually eliminated by the mid-1980s, as the saving rate steadily rose. Since then, the current account has been in surplus. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Along with lowering the tariff rate, recent trade liberalization measures have also restructured the tariff system. Prior to these reforms, 39 different tax rates were used. Once the 1997 tariff reductions and restructuring are completed, the new tax structure will consist of only 6 rates: zero percent for certain goods, such as medical equipment; 1 percent for raw materials, electronic components, and international transport vehicles; 5 percent for primary and capital goods, including machinery, tools, and computers; 10 percent for intermediate goods; 20 percent for finished products; and 30 percent for those goods designated as requiring additional protection.6 The discussions also covered the likely impact of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, where Thailand has taken an active role, both as a participant and as a founding member of the World Trade Organization. The authorities said that the agreement will significantly increase welfare and efficiency in Thailand through wider market access for Thai goods and increased international competition. Although certain labor-intensive industries may move offshore, the authorities are optimistic that Thailand will maintain its competitive position in the global market place. Export subsidies and export performance requirements will be phased out in eight years, and trade-related investment measures, in the form of local content requirements, will be eliminated in five years.’ IV. Staff Appraisal As an important part of the east Asian economic miracle, Thailand has been a scene of dramatic economic changes over the last decade. Its rapid economic growth--and even more rapid industrialization--are among the most impressive on record. This impressive achievement, no doubt, came about as part of regional industrial relocation that gained momentum in the late 1980s. But, as important, it resulted from the authorities’ prudent financial management and their reform efforts which enabled Thailand to become a major partner in the region’s economic surge. Notwithstanding the strength of underlying economic trends, however, Thailand faces a number of policy challenges. The most important among them is to keep the economy on an even keel, while addressing the infrastructure and social problems that arose from an excessively rapid expansion of the Bangkok metropolitan areas. Given the openness of the economy, this task must be pursued while Thailand adapts itself to changes in the global 6Goods receiving a higher degree of protection include silk fabrics, canvas goods, garments, shoes, hats, and leather bags. 7Also in connection with the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, the Government passed the Copyright Act of 1994 with effect from March 1995 to better safeguard intellectual property rights, and a draft law establishing a specialized court on intellectual property issues has been approved by the Thai cabinet.

The resurgence in activity that began in late 1992 gained mcmentum in 19r/?: when, as in 1993, exports and domestic demand rose rapidly. This increase in activity brc rght with it a widening of the external current account deficit and some rise in inflation. The outlook is for demand growth to continue strong. Domestic spending will be underpinned bj, rapid income growth linked to the recent sharp increase in public sector earnings and by investment, which could strengthen further if the recent depreciation of the baht in relation to the Japanese yen is long lasting. In addition, exports should continue their good performance. In this situation, if left unchecked, the projected level of spending would result in rising inflation and/or deterioration in the external balance. In order to prevent this, financial policies should be set to moderate demand growth. In the staffs view, both monetary and fiscal policies can make a contribution to the needed restraint. Regarding monetary policy, the effectiveness of the credit plan has diminished, as financial market liberalization has made it possible to develop new avenues for credit not covered by the plan. In the staffs view, the financial system has evolved to the point where increased reliance should be placed on market-based instruments--such as the bank rate and open market operations--to control credit growth. However, the effectiveness of such instruments is linked to the exchange rate system. In this context, the staff would encourage the move to allowing more flexibility in the determination of the external value of the baht. In view of the strength of the external position, such a move would likely result in upward pressure on the baht, which would contribute to relieving demand pressure by switching expenditure from domestic to foreign sources. While the strengthening of the baht might entail a widening of the external current account deficit in the short run, failure to achieve control over costs would bring about the same result, with the additional cost of raising inflationary expectations. Thailand has attained fiscal surpluses despite the need to devote increasing resources to infrastructure development and education and training. While securing this outcome has required making difficult decisions, there is scope for fiscal policy to make a greater contribution to relieving demand pressure in the period ahead. On the side of expenditure, a meaningful step to close the large gap that exists between earnings in the public and private sectors was taken this fiscal year. The staff supports the authorities’ plan of containing the medium-term effect on expenditure of closing this gap by reducing the size of the public service. In view of the requirements of the current economic situation, consideration should be given to accelerating the move to reduce public sector employment. In addition, there is also room to move on the side of taxes, by raising the VAT rate and narrowing the difference between the tax rates on earned and dividend incomes. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- Thailand’s rapid growth over the past two decades has involved the emergence of significant and expanding manufacturing and service sectors. As rapid development has been concentrated in a narrow region around Bangkok, strains and imbalances have emerged. In that connection, infrastructure bottlenecks have developed in the rapidly industrializing areas and there has been a continually widening development gap between Bargkok and the country’s peripheral regions. The staff supports the authorities’ decision to invest substantially in upgrading infrastructure. At present, tax incentives are being offered to encourage industries to relocate from the congested Bangkok region. The staff supports this pragmatic approach in view of the need to address urgently the economic and social problems associated with the heavy concentration of industry in this area, but, at the same time, encourages the authorities to move to the introduction of pollution and congestion related taxes (including fuel tax). Rapid growth rates have inevitably been accompanied by rising wage costs, which have reduced the competitiveness of the more labor-intensive industries in world markets. Maintaining rapid growth will require that production shift toward higher value-added industries. This shift will certainly be encouraged by the authorities’ plans in the areas of education and training. The staff would caution against the use of fiscal incentives to achieve this objective, as they promote the use of labor before its skills have reached the appropriate level, thereby reducing underlying growth potential. The transformation of the industrial base will be best accomplished by allowing market forces to determine the pace at which the move to higher value-added activities takes place. This shift will be facilitated by the continued exposure of Thai industry to international competition. In this connection, it can be expected that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations will benefit Thailand by fostering liberalization of its trade regime, and increasing market access for its exports in agriculture and textiles and clothing. Liberalization in the context of AFTA can also be beneficial, provided the risk of trade diversion is minimized through further liberalization, on a most-favored-nation basis, of tariffs, which will remain high and dispersed, even at the end of the current tariff reform. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be on the standard 12-month cycle.

Domestic demand is pr ejected to remain strong, paced by infrastructure spending by both the public and private sectors, and by private consumption in the early years of the scenario. External demand would also remain buoyant, reflecting the robust level of activity in the region and improved performance of the industrial countries. The scenario assumes that fiscal policy would be broadly neutral over the projection period. It is also assumed that the underlying exchange rate regime will not be changed, so that the external value of the baht will continue to fluctuate in a narrow range against an underlying basket of currencies. As the growth of final demand contained in the scenario exceeds the underlying expansion of supply, pressure in resources will intensify. In view of the current high degree of resource utilization, pressure will result in accelerating costs, particularly wages. The scenario assumes that, in an attempt to combat overheating, interest rates will be raised and the scope of the credit plan will be broadened further. However, the extent to which interest rates can be raised will be mitigated by capital flows, while new sources of credit will emerge and limit the effectiveness of the plan. As the openness of the economy would constrain the degree to which domestic price inflation can deviate Corn increases in international prices, the excess demand would be reflected in rising costs and shrinking profit margins. Rising costs in excess of those in trading partners would reduce Thailand’s external competitiveness and, over time, induce a switch in expenditure from domestic to foreign sources. This will serve to bring demand growth in line with the expansion of supply, and cost and price increases would gradually moderate to those in trading partner economies. Of course, the appreciation of the real exchange rate required to equilibrate demand with supply could alternatively be achieved by allowing the baht to appreciate. Such a policy would alleviate the pressure on domestic resources without an acceleration of costs, which could spark expectations of high wage increases that could prove difficult and costly to reverse.

Balance of Payments During the 1995 consultation, the Thai authorities expressed the view that the large increase in short-term financing of the current account in 1994 did not represent a structural change from the past but was in fact due to classification problems arising from the rapid development of the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF). In response to their request for technical assistance on this matter, an expert from STA will visit Thailand in June 1995 to examine the system of classification of capital flows used in compiling the capital account. B. Data Reporting During the course of the year, staff receive a steady flow of economic data, either from published sources or through direct communication with the Bank of Thailand. Most data is received on a timely basis, with the exception of balance of payments figures that can be delayed up to five months.
