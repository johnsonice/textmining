Introduction The 1995 discussions for the Article IV consultation and the second review of the program supported by an la-month stand-by arrangement were conducted in Mexico City during the period May 9-26, 1995. 1/ Discussions were held with the Secretary of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Mexico, senior officials of the Government and the Bank of Mexico, and representa- tives of the private sector. The staff team consisted of Messrs. Loser (Head), Williams, Juan-Ramon, Thornton (all WHD), Figliuoli (FAD), Duefias (MAE), Allum (PDR), and Ms. Cadena (Assistant-STA). 2/ Mr. J. Guzman, Advisor to the Executive Director, also participated in the discussions. The arrangement, which was approved by the Executive Board on February 1, 1995, is for an amount of SDR 12,070.2 million (688 percent of quota), of which SDR 5,289.g million was disbursed upon Board approval. This was to be augmented by an amount equivalent to SDR 6,810.3 million less amounts obtained by the Managing Director from central banks of countries willing to participate in Mexico's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The Executive Board was informed earlier this year of the decision to discon- tinue efforts to secure resources from those central banks and of the consequent full augmentation from l%nd resources. It is being proposed that the additional resources be made available in six purchases. The first purchase of SDR 1,290 million (about US$2 billion) would be available upon completion of the forthcoming review; there would be a second purchase of SDR 1,104.06 million (about USS1.7 billion) in August 1995 based on compliance with new performance criteria for end-July for net international reserves (NIR) and the net domestic assets (NDA) of the Bank of Mexico and the performance criteria for end-June, except NDA and NIR; the remaining four purchases, also of SDR 1,104.06 million, would be based on: performance criteria for end-September 1995 and completion of a review of the program in November; performance criteria for end-December 1995; performance criteria for end-March 1996 and completion of a program review in May; and performance criteria for end-June 1996. In a letter to the Managing Director the authorities have requested a waiver for the nonobservance of the NIR and NDA performance criteria and for the nonapplicability of the other performance criteria for end-June. 2/ u The last Article IV consultation with Mexico was completed by the Executive Board on February 28, 1994. Mexico has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. 2/ The mission was assisted by Mr. Jan van Houten, the IMF resident representative in Mexico. 1/ A waiver for end-June performance criteria is required for the forthcoming purchase. Although the review is expected to be completed before the end of June, the purchase will take place in early July and it is thus subject to the performance criteria for the most recent performance date (end-June).

In their letter of request for the stand- by arrangement &ted January 26, 1995, the Mexican authorities have indi- cated that, if the situation were to stabilize soon, they would forego purchases and make early repurchases to the Fund as soon as international reserves permit. Fund financial relations with Mexico are presented in Table 1 and Appendix I. II. Backpround In early January 1995, the Government of Mexico adopted an economic program to deal with the financial crisis that followed the sharp depre- ciation of the peso in late December 1994. This program, which was supported by a Fund stand-by arrangement, did not succeed in calming financial markets and in early March the authorities took additional measures. The new measures included greater fiscal adjustment and a tightening of monetary policy and were viewed as consistent with a sharp reduction in the external current account deficit to USS2.4 billion from US$14 billion projected initially and USS28.8 billion in 1994 (or to less than 1 percent of GDP from the equivalent of 4.3 percent of GDP, after 7.8 percent of GDP in 1994). The subsequent reaction of the markets has been encouraging. From early March to early June the peso appreciated from a low of around MexNS7.60 to around MexNS6.25 per U.S. dollar; interest rates on 28-&y treasury bills declined from over 85 percent to a low of 48 percent in late May before rising to 54 percent in early June (commercial bank interest rates followed a similar pattern); the stock market recovered by about 32 percent; Mexican Brady bond prices rose by around 25 percent and the risk spread over U.S. treasury bills fell sharply (Table 2 and Charts l-5). In the light of the marked improvement in confidence, in May the authorities resumed issues of 182-day treasury bills (cetes), which had been suspended at the end of February because of weak demand; a few enterprises were able to make a limited return to the international financial markets for small amounts and at relatively high U.S. dollar interest rates. The evolution of the public finances has been substantially better than programmed. The primary surplus of the nonfinancial public sector reached MexN$25 billion in the first quarter of 1995 (equivalent to about 6.6 per- cent of quarterly GDP), close to double the program target of MexN$l4 bil- lion (4.6 percent of quarterly GDP) (Tables 3 and 4). The outcome reflected a somewhat better than anticipated performance of income taxes (due to lower foreign exchange losses of enterprises), and the strict containment of noninterest expenditure. Taking into account the higher than programmed interest payments, the overall surplus for the first quarter was MexN$9 billion (2.4 percent of quarterly GDP) compared with a program target of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - MexNS4.8 billion (1.1 percent of quarterly GDP). A little more than half of the shortfall in noninterest expenditures in the first quarter represents delays in implementing salary increases awarded in January and the post- ponement of some transfers to state and local governments to finance social programs. There were permanent savings through the elimination of some employment positions and the cancellation of certain investment projects approved in the budget. In the first quarter of 1995, the need to amortize short-term external liabilities of the Federal Government (mainly tesobonos) and commercial banks resulted in a substantial increase in the NDA of the Bank of Mexico and a decline in NIR. However, monetary conditions tightened markedly and the sharp rise in interest rates, and the liquidity problems being faced by many banks, resulted in a fall in private sector credit demand in real terms (Table 5). In the first quarter of 1995, the Government of Mexico amortized tesobonos (short-term dollar-denominated securities) of US$13 billion (Table 6) and commercial banks' short-term external liabilities totaling around USS3.2 billion. However, net disbursements from the ESF were only USS5.2 billion (see table below) as the US$20 billion U.S. support package was only finalized in late February, and Mexico did not make use of the resources from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) because of the conditions that applied to this financing. In addition, agreement was not reached with commercial banks on their contribution to the ESF. Accordingly, there was a decline in NIR of USS7.5 billion in the first quarter of 1995 compared with the program limit of USS1.5 billion for that period.

Nevertheless, NIR increased by USS4.1 billion as the share of maturing tesobonos smortized in pesos (and largely rolled over into peso-denominated securities) increased substantially; L/ commercial banks began to repay U.S. dollar- denominated loans granted by the Bank of Mexico through FOBAPROA; and sales of foreign currency receipts to the Bank of Mexico by PEMEX were higher than usual, mainly reflecting higher than expected world oil prices. Maturing tesobonos in June amount to USS1.6 billion (see table below). Even if virtually all of these securities are amortized in U.S. dollars, the authorities should be able to achieve an increase in NIR in the second quarter of at least USS2.8 billion. This minimum increase will be insufficient to meet the program limit for June, but it would result in a deviation of about USS3.7 billion which would be much lower than the US$6 billion deviation registered in March.

Total 15.7 1.6 3.5 3.3 . 0.6 0.6 1.2 0.5 27.0 The turnaround in the external merchandise trade and current account balances has been dramatic. In the first quarter of 1995, the merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus of USSO. billion compared with a deficit of USS4.3 billion in the corresponding period of 1994, and the current account deficit narrowed to USS1.2 billion from USS6.7 billion a year earlier. The trade surplus increased further in April to a cumulative USS1.3 billion, compared with a deficit of USS5.7 billion during the first four months of 1994. In the January-April period, merchandise exports (excluding those of in-bond industries) were around 41 percent higher than a year earlier in U.S. dollar terms, reflecting strong increases in agricul- tural exports (64 percent), non-oil extractive exports (48 percent), and manufacturing exports (41 percent); exports of in-bond industries (maquiladora) increased by 21 percent in U.S. dollar terms. Total imports during January-April were 4 percent lower than a year earlier; however, I/ The share of tesobonos amortized in dollars fell from an average of around 75 percent in late March to under 50 percent by end-May and early June.

Imports of consumer and capital goods declined by 34 and 39 percent, respectively, while imports of intermediate goods fell by 29 percent. In the first quarter of 1995 the capital account of the balance of payments registered a net outflow of USS6.2 billion, mainly reflecting net amortizations of tesobonos and repayments of short-term indebtedness by commercial banks. Foreign direct investment inflows were at minimal levels over this period. Preliminary official estimates indicate that real GDP declined by 0.6 percent in the first quarter of 1995 compared with the corresponding quarter of last year (which also was a quarter of weak growth) (Table 7); compared with the last quarter of 1994, the decline in real GDP in the first quarter of 1995 was around 9 percent, almost twice as large as any quarter since 1980. There was a modest increase in manufacturing output, as buoyant exports offset the impact of weak domestic demand, but in the construction and service sectors output fell sharply. Unemployment is estimated to have increased from 5.9 percent at the end of 1994 to 7.8 percent in March 1995. u Consumer prices rose by 14.5 percent during the first quarter, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the peso, and by a further 8 percent in April, because of the 5 percentage point increase in the value-added tax and an adjustment of about 35 percent in energy and other public sector prices; in May inflation fell to 4.2 percent. III. Policv Discussions and Prospects for the Rest of 1995 The authorities generally were satisfied with developments over the last two months. However, they were very concerned that in the absence of adequate financial support in July-August, when USS6.8 billion of tesobonos were maturing, there would be renewed pressure on the peso and on intema- tional reserves. In view of the critical importance of the period, the authorities have established new performance criteria for NIR and NDA for end-July (consistent with the September and December performance criteria). The new criteria envisage an increase in NIR of US$3 billion and a decline in the NDA of the Bank of Mexico of MexNS17.2 billion from end-March to end- July. The authorities felt that ESF disbursements of US$2-3 billion in July would serve to strengthen market confidence sufficiently to lead to a substantial reinvestment in peso-denominated securities and, along with continued tight financial policies, ensure the observance of end-July targets. 1/ Imports other than capital and intermediate goods purchased by maquiladoras and companies using the PITEX scheme (applicable to other temporary export-related imports). u Defined as the percentage of the economically active population wholly unemployed or unable to find employment for more than 35 hours a week.

Output was expected to decline by an average of about 3.5 percent in the second and third quarters (over the corresponding quarter of 1994), before starting a slow recovery in the last quarter. Inflation was expected to continue the decline observed in May, reaching about 1 l/2 percent a month in the last quarter of the year. u 1. Fiscal oolicv The authorities expect that government revenue for 1995 will be in line with the program projection of 25.6 percent of GDP. A revenue loss, equiva- lent to about 0.2 percent of GDP on an annual basis, is likely following the Government's decision not to eliminate (as originally envisaged) the zero rating of the value-added tax presently granted to certain food products and medicines at the intermediate stages of distribution. However, this loss is expected to be offset by higher petroleum taxes; other items of tax revenue are expected to remain broadly as programmed. The shortfall in government expenditure in the first quarter is projected to be partly reversed by the wage increase which went into effect on April 1, retroactive to January, &' and the catch up of social sector spending. On the basis of the present assumptions about interest rates and the exchange rate, interest payments for the last three quarters are projected to be MexNS3.5 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) larger than envisaged in the program; the overrun will be covered by the savings from the elimina- tion of federal government positions and by further compression of capital expenditures, as needed. The Government also expects some savings to accrue from the replacement of the system of food subsidies by a food stamp v-w=, expected to go into effect from mid-1995 (discussed later). In order to assess the possible risks to the program, the mission discussed with the authorities an alternative fiscal scenario assuming a larger decline in real GDP (3 percent instead of 2 percent), inflation at 50 percent (instead of 42 percent), an average exchange rate of MexN$7 per U.S. dollar (as against MexN$6 per U.S. dollar) in the second half of the year, and an average cetes interest rate of 49 percent (compared with 40 percent in the base case). The projections indicated that there could be a revenue decline of around 0.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis, mainly reflecting the effect of the existence of specific taxes. Given the Government's commitment to maintain noninterest expenditures in nominal terms, the main risk to expenditures would come from interest payments which u Most private sector forecasters currently project a 3-4 percent decline in real GDP and inflation of 45-50 percent by end-year. u Minimum and public sector wages were increased by 7 percent on January 1, and by a further 12 percent on April 1. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - could be as much as MexN$15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) higher than projected for the last three quarters. This alternative scenario would imply a modest improvement in the primary balance in relation to GDP compared with the program and a worsening of the overall balance equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP. The Government has appointed a Commission to prepare a comprehensive reform of the tax system to be submitted to Parliament by September 1995, in time for the 1996 budget. The work of the Commission is still in its early stages and only the broad outlines of the reform strategy have been agreed upon. Proposals expected to be under consideration include the exemption from income taxation of funds allocated to long-term savings accounts and of reinvested dividends, increases in consumption taxes (VAT and excises), and measures to give more fiscal autonomy to the states. The Government has requested technical assistance from the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) for the preparation of the reform program. u 2. Monetarv nolicy Monetary policy for the remainder of the year will be implemented mainly through open market operations and credit auctions and will aim at keeping the original target for the increase in the NDA of the Bank of Mexico of MexN$lO billion during 1995 (consistent with growth of the monetary base of 17.5 percent). Achievement of the target will depend critically on adequate disbursements from the ESF to help amortize short- term external liabilities. The implementation of monetary policy will be facilitated by recent increases in interest rates charged by FOBAPROA on loans to commercial banks facing liquidity problems, the elimination of the automatic overdraft facility and the requirement of collateral for banks' access to the lending facilities of the Bank of Mexico and FOBAPROA. These measures have forced banks to raise funds on the interbank market and put upward pressure on interest rates. The nominal demand for base money to May has been substantially lower than projected in the program, probably reflecting the higher than expected interest rates and inflation; as a result, the NIR and NDA targets provide scope for significant monetary growth during the second half of the year. Although some increase in the demand for money is likely (as inflationary expectations improve, as economic activity begins to recover, and on account of seasonal factors), the attainment of the NIR and inflation objectives of the program may require a lower increase in NDA than programmed. The authorities will therefore seek to maintain tight monetary conditions over the balance of the year and the decline in interest rates is likely to proceed more slowly than the fall in inflation. v An FAD mission is expected to visit Mexico in late June 1995.

The exchange rate reeime Against the background of continuing exchange market uncertainties and with gross international reserves at low levels, the authorities remain committed to the retention of a floating exchange rate regime, supported by appropriately tight financial policies. The authorization given to domestic banks to offer forward foreign exchange contracts, L/ and the establish- ment of peso future contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Mexican Stock Exchange should help reduce exchange market uncertainties. The authorities have refrained from direct intervention in the exchange market to support the peso since the end of March. They intend to continue this policy but will enter the market, if needed, to purchase foreign exchange to meet the NIR targets. 4. Trade nolicv The authorities have reiterated their commitment to an open trading regime. So far this year Mexico has signed free trade agreements with Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela, and negotiations are well advanced with Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In addition, steps are being taken to broaden and harmonize trade concessions extended by Mexico to Mercosur countries. The authorities indicated that certain domestic industries (in particular clothing and footwear) have faced difficulties as a result of tariff reductions and low cost imports. Prompted by the recent slump in domestic demand, in early May import tariffs on these goods were increased to 35 percent, u except where bilateral trade agreements specify a lower level. No date has been established for the prospective rollback of this tariff increase. In May, the authorities announced their intention to take anti-dumping measures against imports of iron and steel from a number of industrialized countries. 5. Balance of pavments outlook On the basis of revised projections, Mexico is expected to record a trade surplus of USS4.8 billion in 1995 (compared with a surplus of USS5.4 billion in the program) and a current account deficit of USS2.5 bil- lion (compared with USS2.4 billion in the program) (Tables 8-10). The growth of exports is expected to be around 27 percent, based on a decline in oil export prices (from US$16/barrel in the first quarter to US$lS/barrel u Approval is limited to banks with a capital ratio of no less than 8.5 percent, and with no outstanding U.S. dollar liabilities to the FOBAPROA. As of mid-May, authorization had been extended to seven banks. u Equivalent to the upper tariff limit for industrial imports agreed by Mexico in the context of its accession to the World Trade Organization.

The sharp decline in imports in January-April appears to have reflected, in part, a run down of inventories which are projected to recover somewhat later in the year. Nevertheless, total imports in 1995 are projected to be 21 percent lower than in 1994; consumer and capital goods imports are expected to fall by 40 percent and 36 percent, respectively, and intermediate goods by 10 percent. The capital account should show a surplus of USS2.6 billion, broadly in line with the program. Official capital inflows are likely to be USS3.6 billion lower than originally programmed, with an increase in net multi- lateral financing of USSO. billion (reflecting initial disbursements under IBRD and IDB loans for the restructuring of the banking system and to support social programs) more than offset by a fall, relative to the progrm of short-term official financing. The net private capital outflow is expected to be about USS1.8 billion compared with an outflow of USS5.6 billion projected originally. Foreign direct investment is expected to be somewhat lower (USS4.1 billion compared with USS6.5 billion) but other net private outflows will be smaller than envisaged, in part because of the lower than programmed amortization of commercial banks short-term external indebtedness. 6. Privatization In January 1995 the Government decided to broaden its privatization and deregulation strategy to include transportation, telecommunications, and certain parts of the electricity and petroleum sector. In early 1995 the Constitution was amended to permit private sector participation in railways, satellite communications and the storage and distribution of natural gas. Work is proceeding on the revision of the legal and regulatory framework for these sectors and to facilitate the privatization of electricity generation, sea ports and airports, and certain petrochemical plants. Preparations are most advanced in the telecommunications sector and it is likely that the concessions for satellite communication facilities could be awarded starting in early 1996; the private telephone monopoly also is expected to be opened up to competition'in 1996. The entire privatization process is expected to take two-three years because of the time required to prepare for an effec- tive sale process; no significant revenues from privatizations are expected in 1995. In addition, legislation has been amended to allow foreign banking institutions to acquire control of any Mexican bank with less than 6 percent of the total capital of the banking system; as a result, only the three largest banks would be protected from a foreign acquisition. Also, the market share limitation for foreign-controlled banks has been increased to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - 25 percent. These measures go well beyond the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement. u 7. Social safety net The budget announced in January 1995 included real expenditure increases (compared to 1994) for priority programs in education and health, larger grants for work training programs, higher subsidies in line with inflation and exchange rate developments and the free distribution of food and other basic products to poor families. When the adjustment program was reinforced in March, three new measures were introduced: the period of noncontributory coverage in case of unemployment under the health and maternity insurance program of the Social Security System was extended from two to six months; a small road construction program employing the rural poor was enacted; and a modest subsidy on electricity consumption by house- holds was introduced. As indicated above, federal government transfers for social programs in the first quarter have been lower than programmed. However, the impact on the provision of services has been smaller than expected because of the lower real costs of providing many of these services through decentralized agencies (for example the road construction program involved below-minimum wage rates). The authorities intend to make up the shortfall in social expenditures during the remainder of the year. To improve the targeting of social expenditure, in mid-1995 the authorities intend to introduce a food stamp program in place of several programs, including children's grants and subsidies for tortillas and milk.‘ IV. The Banking System 2/ So far the problems of the banking system have been contained, helped by a commitment by the Government to protect all depositors; provision of peso liquidity by the Bank of Mexico to the banking system; the temporary bank capitalization program (PROCAPTE); and the program of U.S. dollar loans (through FOBAPROA) to help banks meet their external short-term obligations. FOBAPROA also is responsible for the provision of assistance to weak banks of which three have been intervened--two in 1994 and one in March 1995. However, the quality of banks' loan portfolios has continued to deteriorate and is likely to worsen over the next few months as the decline in economic activity intensifies. A loan restructuring scheme denominated in units u NAFTA provides for the entry of foreign commercial banks up to a market share of 8 percent in 1995, rising to 15 percent over the next six years and 25 percent thereafter. u A detailed analysis of the problems facing Mexico's banking system and the programs being implemented will be included in the paper on Recent Economic Developments. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - indexed to consumer prices (the UDI scheme) 1/ was launched in April 1995 with the aim of easing the payments burden on specified groups of debtors. The scheme also is expected to limit the increase in nonperforming loans. Currently, six banks (accounting for 28 percent of total banking system deposits as of December 1994) are in the PROCAPTE scheme which has required the Government to purchase banks' subordinated debt in an amount of MexNS6.5 billion; the impact of these operations has been completely sterilized by the Bank of Mexico. The authorities expect that two more banks could enter PROCAPTE in the near future and that one or two banks currently under PROCAPTE could face solvency problems unless they attract new capital. As at end-May 1995, FOBAPROA had disbursed about MexN$19 billion to cover losses and otherwise support the three intervened banks and other small institutions. U.S. dollar lending to commercial banks by FOBAPROA reached a peak of USS3.6 billion in mid-April; thereafter, as market conditions improved, banks were able to re-establish some of their foreign credit lines and reduce the balances due to FOBAPROA, which, by end-May, amounted to USS2.2 billion. The UDI program includes the restructuring of: private corporate loans (the only program launched so far); household mortgages; development bank loans; and loans to states and municipalities. The loans to be restructured through these programs will amount to MexN$167 billion (25 percent of total outstanding credit at end-March 1995). The Government would issue zero- coupon bonds to replace the problem loans in the banks' balance sheet. The loans will be placed in a trust fund, which will issue liabilities in favor of the Government. The banks will keep the credit risk. The fiscal cost of the UDI program will depend on the amount of government bonds issued, and has been estimated by the staff at a total of between MexN$7 billion and MexN$14 billion over the life of the loans. The Government will begin to face the costs when the first bonds mature after five years; the medium-term fiscal scenario takes these costs into account. The authorities are currently discussing with two banks an arrangement in which FOBAPROA will purchase a part of their loan portfolio (with the proper provisioning) in direct proportion to new capital contributions by stockholders. Agreement on the amounts involved is not yet finalized; these operations will not have an immediate monetary impact as the loan portfolio payment will be made with long-term government bonds. The Government is receiving technical assistance from the World Bank and the IDB for the bank restructuring efforts. In late June, both institu- tions are expected to approve financial sector restructuring loans in an amount of USS2.25 billion to help restore the solvency and soundness of Mexico's banking system. 1/ Unidad de Inversion.

Medium-Term Outlook and Caoacitv to ReDav I. . _The medium-term outlook Projections of Mexico's medium-term outlook for the period 1996-2000 are presented in Tables 11-14. The projections assume a steady recovery in financial market confidence over the next 6-12 months, and the pursuit of prudent financial policies and structural reforms, which contribute to the reduction of inflation to international levels and the maintenance of export competitiveness. Real GDP growth is assumed to recover to 2 percent in 1996, and to an annual average of around 5 percent during 1997-2000, led by the expansion of exports and domestic investment; the increase in domestic investment, which is projected to rise from 18.1 percent of GDP in 1995 to about 21 percent of GDP by 2000, is to be financed by further growth in private saving and a modest rise in external saving (see Table 11). By 1997-98, private saving is projected to still be below the levels of the late 198Os, facilitated by the tax and pension reforms expected to begin in 1996. With the aid of the tax and public expenditure reform programs expected to go into effect from 1996, the public finances are assumed to show an overall surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 1996, which is projected to be maintained for the rest of the decade. lJ The external current account deficit is projected to stabilize at around 2 percent of GDP, a level that is considered to be sustainable over the medium term. The merchandise trade account, which shifted from a deficit of 5 per- cent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP in 1995, is expected to be roughly in balance by 1999-2000 (see Table 12). Export volumes would rise at an average annual rate of 7 percent during 1996-2000, reflecting growth of around 8 percent in non-oil exports (compared with an average of 13.7 percent in 1990-94). Imports would increase by an average of 9 percent annually in volume terms (compared with an average rise of 18.8 percent in 1990-94), reflecting the strong growth in investment-related imports. Net capital inflows are expected to recover significantly to average over US$lO billion annually during 1996-2000 (compared with an annual average level of about US$20 billion during 1990-94): in this period, net official capital inflows are projected to be modest, with maturing ESF liabilities being largely refinanced through medium-term bond placements. Higher private capital inflows reflect a recovery in foreign direct invest- ment inflows, together with resumed portfolio inflows (albeit on a more limited scale than in the early 1990s). By 2000, total external debt should decline to around 48 percent of GDP, compared to a projected 60'percent of GDP at end-1995 (see Table 13). The projected buoyancy in capital inflows would facilitate a reconsti- tution of NIR of around USS4.5 billion annually during 1996-2000. On this lJ The projections include the cost of the interest of the various bank rescheduling schemes averaging about 0.2 percent of GDP per annum.

Mexico's balance of payments has become less vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices and international interest rates as a result of the strong expansion of non-oil exports and the decline in the ratio of external debt to GDP that has occurred during the 1990s. In addition, the lower external current account deficit relative to the recent past and steps to lengthen the maturity structure of the external debt will make Mexico less dependent on volatile portfolio investment flows. The sensitivity of the medium-term projections to changes in assumptions about interest rates, world oil prices, trade performance, and capital flows ,are highlighted in Table 14. 2. Canacitv to reoav the Fund If all purchases under the stand-by arrangement are made, outstanding obligations to the Fund would rise by the end of August 1996 to SDR 13,437 million (766 percent of quota) or 7 percent of GDP. Total payments to the F'und (including repurchases and charges) would peak at SDR 5,330.O million in 1999 or 10.2 percent of exports of goods and services and transfers. Total public debt service would also peak in 1998-99, reflecting the combination of Fund repurchases and amortization of ESF liabilities. During this period, public debt service would average 30.3 percent of exports of goods and services and transfers, slightly below the projected figure of 30.6 percent in 1995. To the extent that the authorities are successful in limiting purchases under the present arrangement, or to the extent that conditions permit early repurchases, the medium-term debt service burden would be correspondingly lower. IJ With the external current account deficit during 1996-2000 averaging around 2 percent of GDP, Mexico's financing requirement over the next few years will be substantially lower than in the recent past. Mexico has an excellent record in meeting financial obligations to the Fund, and it had reduced its indebtedness to the Fund from a peak of SDR 4,730 million in 1991 to a level of SDR 2,615.l million immediately prior to the current stand-by arrangement. In light of the initial successes seen under Mexico's adjustment program, and assuming a restoration of access to international capital markets on reasonable terms, the staff is confident that Mexico's commitments to the Fund will be met. lJ Based on purchases made under the arrangement so far, total payments to the Fund would peak at SDR 2,882 million in 1999 or 5.1 percent of exports of goods and services and transfers.

Statistics The Mexican authorities have taken important steps to expand the scope and improve the timeliness of economic data provided to the Fund and for publication. Several important financial indicators are now available on a daily basis; a weekly summary balance sheet of the Bank of Mexico is now being prepared; data on NIR are being made available to the public on a monthly basis and the publication lag for key data series has been reduced significantly. Further improvements in these areas are underway (see Appendix IV). VI. Staff Anoraisal In January 1995, the Mexican authorities adopted a comprehensive economic program to deal with the financial crisis that followed the devaluation of the peso in late December 1994. In early March fiscal and monetary policies were tightened and financing arrangements were clarified. Since then the reaction of the financial markets has been encouraging; in particular, the peso has strengthened, interest rates have declined from very high levels, and the stock market has staged a noticeable recovery. However, significant risks remain and the authorities will need to be alert and adjust policies as needed to attain the program objectives. The public finances registered larger than programmed primary and overall surpluses in the first quarter, mainly due to the containment of noninterest expenditures. Interest payments in the remainder of the year could be higher than projected but the overruns are expected to be covered by accumulated margins and further containment of noninterest expenditures, if necessary. Additional challenges for fiscal policy can be expected over the next few years, as the fiscal costs of the restructuring of the banking system become evident; this underscores the importance of prompt action on the tax and the public sector reform programs that are being considered for implementation as from 1996. In the first quarter of 1995 the implementation of monetary policy was complicated by the heavy amortization schedule of tesobonos and commercial bank short-term external liabilities. Since March, monetary conditions have been tightened, contributing to a reduction in the NDA of the Bank of Mexico and an increase in NIR. The main monetary policy risks over the balance of the year would appear to come from financial market pressures in the event of inadequate financing, and from problem banks. In addition, given the unexpected decline in the demand for base money up to May, there is the possibility of an undue increase in monetary growth within the parameters of the program. To avoid these risks undermining the success of the program, the authorities would need to closely monitor financial and inflation indicators and be prepared to take additional monetary and fiscal actions if needed.

The Fund has been collaborating with the World Bank and the IDB, who are providing technical assistance and financial support for Mexico's bank restructuring efforts. As noted, some fiscal support for this effort also will be needed, though no cash payments are envisaged in 1995. The floating exchange rate regime has allowed the authorities to re-establish external competitiveness. Given the volatility of financial markets and the relatively low level of international reserves, they will have to remain with the floating regime for the present. The establishment of forward and futures exchange markets can be expected to help reduce the volatility of the peso, but exchange rate stability could only be ensured by appropriate financial policies. The recent increase in import tariffs on textiles and footwear represents an unfortunate reaction to the difficulties being faced by these industries. The staff notes the assurance given by the authorities that these measures would be temporary and urges that they be reversed in the shortest possible period. Mexico's medium-term balance of payments outlook is quite favorable given the exchange rate adjustment, the diversified export base, and relatively low level of external indebtedness. The current account deficit is projected to widen somewhat in relation to GDP after 1996 and the authorities will need to ensure that appropriate financial policies remain in place to maintain it at a sustainable level. While the debt to GDP ratio is projected to remain at manageable levels, the authorities should maintain a cautious approach to debt management. In summary, the staff is of the view that the general macroeconomic framework of the program continues to be valid, even though the decline in real GDP could be somewhat greater than projected by the authorities and inflation could be somewhat higher. The recent performance of Mexican financial markets reflects the tightening of policies since March and would appear to signal a slow return of investor confidence. However, the situa- tion is still fragile and carries risks. The most important of these risks are the likelihood of further substantial deterioration of commercial banks' portfolios and the possible reversals in market sentiment that could come from the absence of sufficient financing to cover the large stock of maturing tesobonos in July-August. The resulting pressures on financial markets could cause difficulties for the observance of the performance criteria and undermine the gains made in recent months, even as strict financial policies continue to be pursued. On the other hand, with the restoration of confidence and policies firmly on track, it is quite possible that the external financing available to Mexico after August will be more than sufficient to repay the Govem- ment's maturing foreign currency liabilities, while building an adequate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - level of international reserves. In this event, the authorities would be encouraged not to make further purchases after August and to consider making early repurchases of Fund resources. The tightening of fiscal and monetary policies in early March together with the greater certainty of international financial support led to a strong increase in NIR and a substantial decline in NDA in the second quarter. While the performance criteria for NIR and NDA for June are not likely to be observed, there is likely to be a large reduction in the deviation compared with end-March. With adequate financing and continued strong policies, financial market sentiment should continue to strengthen, facilitating the attainment of the performance criteria for the end of the year. On this basis, the staff supports the completion of the review and Mexico's request for the necessary waivers. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - VII.

With the successful conclusion of the debt restructuring exercise and the demon- strated commitment of the Government to policy reforms, lending shifted toward three priorities: a) reducing poverty and improving human resource development; b) protecting the environment; and c) reviving growth and facilitating private sector development through addressing constraints in physical infrastructure and institutional development. In response to the 1995 economic crisis, the World Bank has announced that it will provide up to USS2.0 billion in support, focused on three areas: a) strengthening of the banking system (with a US$l.O billion loan scheduled for Board consideration on June 22, and a follow-up loan of US$500 million planned for this winter); b) support for social sector expenditures in key areas (with a loan of US$500 million scheduled for Board consider- ation on June 22); and c) support for development of the legal and regula- tory framework necessary for infrastructure privatization (through a US$30 million technical assistance loan which is expected to go to the Board in July or August 1995).

Data reporting Since early 1995 there has been a considerable improvement in the coverage and timeliness of data made available to the Fund and to the general public. Also, there has been a marked increase in the amount of data on Mexico published by private sources. In January 1995, Mexico began sending information to the Fund on a dailv basis on gross and net international reserves, the monetary base, open market operations conducted by the Bank of Mexico, the peso futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, spot exchange rates, interest rates, foreign exchange intervention by the Bank of Mexico, and stock market prices. Weekly information being received by the Fund includes the summary balance sheet of the Bank of Mexico and details of auctions of government securities. Information received on a monthly basis includes the detailed monetary accounts of financial institutions, the revenue and expenditure accounts of the nonfinancial public sector, u and the financing requirements of the public sector; the lag in receipt of the &ta has been reduced from over 60 days to around 45 days. 2. Data Dublication oolicv Mexico has adopted a more open disclosure policy. The Bank of Mexico now makes available to the public, on a weekly basis, data on international reserves, the monetary base, domestic credit and the stock of public debt. The data are available through regular statistical publications, press releases and electronic services (Reuters, Bloomberg, and Infocel) and steps are being taken to make the data available through the INTERNET. 3. Data issues in each sector a. Fiscal sector The statistics on government fiscal operations are generally satisfac- tory in terms of coverage and quality; presentation and coverage have been improved. b. Monetarv sector u The monthly revenue and expenditure accounts are preliminary, with final data only available on a quarterly basis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - APPENDIX IV The monetary data also are quite satisfactory. Some improvements in the classification of accounts (for example, in terms of residents and nonresidents) are being undertaken and the authorities have expressed interest in discussing these refinements with the Fund's Statistics Department. C. Balance of oavments Mexico's balance of payments statistics are compiled by the Bank of Mexico in coordination with the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Information (INEGI) and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit; merchandise trade data are compiled and published by INEGI. In the view of the staff, the external sector data are compiled with due regard to international norms and standards. Traditionally, monthly merchandise trade &ta have been published by INEGI with 45-day lag. However, since January 1995 INEGI has published monthly preliminary estimates with a 21-day lag and the final &ta after a 35-&y lag. There is no formal schedule for the publication of Mexico's quarterly Balance of Payments data. Since January 1995 estimates have been published on a relatively timely basis; for example, first quarter 1995 balance of payments estimates were available in late May, i.e., with a 45 to 60-day lag. (By comparison, initial estimates of the U.S. first quarter balance of payments were published on June 13.) d. National accounts and orice indices INEGI produces the national accounts statistics, employment data, and leading indicators of economic activity. Since January 1995, INEGI has expanded the coverage of its statistics and reduced the publication lag. INEGI publishes a quarterly GDP series, a monthly survey on urban employment and a yearly survey on national employment, all with 45-&y lag. Also, INEGI has started publishing a monthly indicator of industrial activity (mining, manufacture, construction and electricity) with a 60-day lag, and a monthly indicator of commercial sector activity with a SO-day lag. All price indices are published by the Bank of Mexico. In the view of the staff, these indices are satisfactory in terms of coverage, quality, and timeliness. The Bank of Mexico publishes various monthly price-indices with a IS-day lag; the Consumer Price Index is published twice a month, with observations at mid- and end-month, with a lo-day lag. 4. The action elan The Mexican authorities plan to make further improvements with regard to reporting lags and data quality and to expand on the number of series published.
