Chabrier and Jestis Seade February 14,200l l The discussions for the program to be supported by the 2000 Article Iv consultation, the third annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), and the fourth review under the extended arrangement were held in Sana’a during February 4-l 7,2000, May 26-June 8,2000, and October 16-l 9,200O; Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) discussions took place during October 6-l 1,200O and November 2-8,200O. The team consisted of Messrs. Enders (head), Williams, Alabdulrazzaq, and Ms. Choueiri (all MED); Mr. Sobolev (PDR); and Messrs. Walliser and Moore (both FAD). Mr. Chabrier (MED) participated in the October discussions and Mr. Williams in the FSAP missions. The missions met with the Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet. l At the last Article lV consultation on March 23, 1999 (SUIU99/38), Executive Directors recommended a policy mix of fiscal adjustment, a flexible exchange rate system with limited intervention, and indirect monetary control. Directors also stressed the need for promoting diversification and raising productivity in the non-oil sector, and urged the authorities to (a) pursue with determination tax, civil service, legal, and judicial reform; (b) strengthen public expenditure on the social safety net and overall infrastructure; (c) move toward market-based pricing in the energy sector; (d) strengthen the banking system; and (e) initiate a transparent privatization process. In noting the difficult political environment, Directors stressed the need to enhance public awareness and mobilize political consensus in support of the reform program. l In the attached letter and the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the Yemeni authorities review recent economic developments, and summarize the macroeconomic and structural adjustment program for the third year under the PRGF and extended arrangements covering the period October 1,2000-September 30,200l. In the letter, the authorities also request that the Fund: (a) extends through October 28,200l the PRGF commitment period and the extended arrangement in order to allow for all disbursements to be made; (b) does not rephase over the third annual PRGF arrangement amounts not disbursed during the second annual arrangement and reduce the remaining amounts under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) by one-half; and (c) grants the necessary waivers with respect to end-September, end-November, and end- December 1999 structural performance criteria.

Macrobalances improved dramatically in 1999-2000 as a result of higher oil prices, high real interest rates, and continued expenditure restraint. However, non-oil GDP growth remained lackluster with a large unfinished agenda of reforms to improve the investment climate. Near-balance in the fiscal accounts in 1999 contributed to an external current account surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP, a strong buildup of foreign reserves well above the program target, and a decline in the average annual inflation rate to 8 percent. External balances improved further in 2000, but annual average inflation notched up to 10.9 percent. Implementation of planned structural reforms since the second half of 1999 was slow, reflecting growing difficulties of the government to mobile the necessary consensus for painful reforms in a context of a comfortable financial situation. Macroeconomic objectives and policies for 2001. The main macroeconomic objectives for 2001 are to achieve an increase in non-oil growth to about 5 percent while reducing inflation to an average annual rate of about 9 percent. With Yemen’s oil production likely to decline in the coming years, the authorities aim to continue high levels of public saving while stepping up long-delayed structural and institutional reforms, notably implementation of the General Sales Tax (GST), diesel price adjustments, and civil service and pension reform. Staff appraisal. The current comfortable levels of oil prices and production offer opportunities but also pose paradoxical challenges. The macroeconomic outlook remains bright provided the oil windfall gains are saved to create cushions for the leaner years ahead through expenditure restraint, subsidy reduction, and pension reform. To create the conditions for higher investment and growth in the non-oil sector, which are key to employment and to poverty reduction, a large structural reform agenda needs to be implemented-including tax reform, privatization, and more generally efforts to address governance issues and strengthen the rule of law. However, the comfortable macrofinancial situation has complicated the task of gaining broad support for painful structural adjustments-as evidenced by the delays in many planned reforms in 1999 and 2000-and has stirred populist pressures to “share” the oil gains, including through increases in public salaries. Such pressures, while understandable in a context of poverty and pressing needs, continue to pose the major risk to the program. The planned elaboration of a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) based on broad participation of the public as part of the next Five- Year Plan offers an excellent opportunity to widen understanding of, and support for, the reform program.

On June 28, 1999 the Executive Board completed the first review under the second annual PRGF arrangement and the third review under the extended arrangement. To date, four disbursements totaling SDR 150 million have been made under the PRGF arrangement and four purchases totaling SDR 40 million have been made under the EFF. A fifth disbursement under the PRGF (SDR 20.0 million) and a fifth purchase under the EFF (SDR 6.5 million) would be available upon Executive Board approval of the third annual PRGF arrangement and completion of the fourth review under the extended arrangement. Remaining PRGF and EFF disbursements are proposed to be rephased as set out in Table 9. A recently completed debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that after full use of all traditional debt relief mechanisms Yemen’s debt would be sustainable, and that it would not qualify for special assistance under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) (SM/OO/138). 2. Fund and World Bank staffs collaborated closely, including elaborating the DSA with the Yemeni authorities and launching preparations of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for Yemen. An interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) prepared by the authorities in consultation with World Bank and Fund staff was sent to the Fund in December 2000 (EBD/O l/ 17). The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit (US$50 million) and the second tranche of the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (US$30 million) were disbursed in October 1999. Recently approved IDA credits include support for Civil Service Modemization (US$30 million), Legal and Judicial Development (US$2.5 million), and Privatization Support (US$lO.9 million); the latter credit is awaiting approval by the Yemeni parliament to allow disbursement. In November 1999, IDA approved a US$l5 million commercial debt buyback grant. 3. Relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. The Fund provides extensive technical assistance to Yemen (Appendix I, Annex I and Appendix III). The timeliness and quality of data are adequate for program monitoring; however, statistical weaknesses continue to severely hamper analysis. Better and timelier reporting of fiscal data, and more generally improvements in the statistical base, continue to be an important objective under the program. II. BACKGROUND 4. On the political side, President Saleh was re-elected in September 1999 with a large majority in unified Yemen’s first contested presidential election. In June 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen reached agreement on the settlement of long-standing border issues; this could eventually contribute to the further integration of Yemen into the regional economy and prepare the way for scaling back military expenditure. Following the recent adoption of a decentralization law calling for the establishment of local governments, selected local Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- government elections are planned for February 2001 along with a public referendum on amendments to the constitution that would, inter alia, lengthen the terms of president and parliament by two years. 5. External balances improved sharply and by more than programmed in 1999- 2000 as a result of higher oil prices, maintenance of high real interest rates, and the authorities’ resistance to intense pressures for higher expenditure, although a pick-up of inflation in 2000 is of concern (Tables 3-7 and Charts l-4). In 1999, average annual inflation was brought down to 8 percent and reserves rebuilt by more than the loss suffered in 1998. On the external side, these trends broadly continued throughout the year 2000, with a further buildup of reserves to 10 months of imports by end-2000 driven by a growing trade surplus. However, beginning April 2000, recorded inflation accelerated steadily (to 18 percent over the 12 months through September 2000), a flare-up reflecting both the impact of drought conditions on locally produced food products and qat, and strong domestic demand fuelled by high public expenditure and accelerating growth in broad liquidity. Despite accelerating liquidity growth during the last quarter, 12-month inflation then subsided sharply to 3 percent in December 2000; thus, annual average inflation rose to 10.9 percent. While clearly driven by improved food supply conditions following strong rains in the summer of 2000, the sharp turnaround in inflation may need to be interpreted with some caution given long-standing concerns about the quality of Yemen’s price statistics. Real economic growth in 1999 was below target at an estimated 3.8 percent, reflecting: (a) a lower-than-expected increase in crude oil extraction; (b) drought in the first half of the year; (c) a decline in tourism reflecting a perception of worsening security problems; and (d) a continued weak investment climate. Although spring rains failed again in early 2000, non-oil growth close to the target of 4 percent for 2000 may have been achieved as a result of an apparent pickup in construction and tourism, and a strong autumn harvest. 6. A dramatic improvement in public finances, reflecting the saving of much of the oil windfall, was key to the macrofinancial performance in 1999-2000 (Table 4). The 1999 fiscal deficit (measured throughout on a commitment basis, excluding grants) is estimated at 1.2 percent of GDP, compared with a programmed deficit of 3 percent and a 6.7 percent deficit in 1998. Non-oil revenues were broadly as programmed, although some categories fell short of expectations-such as customs revenue-largely owing to ongoing problems with smuggling and fraud. The shortfall in indirect taxes was partly made up by nontax revenues, notably higher central bank profits. While expenditure rose sharply in 1999 in nominal terms (by about 22 percent), the authorities succeeded in keeping growth in virtually all expenditure categories below GDP growth and close to programmed levels except for domestic interest payments, defense, and wheat subsidies-the latter because - existing contracts had to be honored even after the liberalization of wheat imports and pricing. Reflecting the implementation of the new oil sector accounting mechanism, data on petroleum subsidies and domestic oil revenue are not comparable between 1998 and 1999.

Preliminary data point to a much higher-than-expected budget surplus for 2000 of about 9.5 percent of GDP, reflecting buoyant oil revenues that more than offset large overruns in the subsidy bill. The 2000 budget as approved by parliament called for a sizable reduction in subsidies as well as sharp increases in expenditure categories, including for the third year a double-digit increase in the wage bill. On the revenue side, in the course of 2000 the underlying oil revenue assumptions (an average oil price of US$17 per barrel) were quickly rendered obsolete by the surge in world oil prices. While disaggregated revenue and expenditure data are not yet available, preliminary data suggest that oil and gas revenue far exceeded expectations. The petroleum subsidy bill is estimated at 6 percent of GDP, much higher than budgeted owing to increased world prices and the decision not to implement the budgeted increase (of 70 percent) in diesel prices. Other expenditure appears to have been kept broadly in line with the budget. 8. Broad money growth accelerated to 13.8 percent over the year 1999 and further to 25 percent over the year 2000, well above the authorities’ target levels. This mainly reflected the sharp expansion in net foreign assets of the central bank since mid-1999, not fully offset by government repayments of credits from the banking system. While the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) had raised interest rates sharply from 15 percent to 20 percent in early i999 in response to mounting exchange market pressures, the turnaround in financial balances led the CBY to gradually lower the minimum benchmark interest rate on saving deposits, starting in late 1999, to 13 percent by mid-2000. High real interest rates and probably a better enforcement of prudential rules depressed private credit growth to 15 percent in 1999, far below program levels, but credit growth accelerated to 21 percent during 2000 as interest rates fell. All quantitative performance criteria for end-1999 were met (Table 1). The improved external position helped stabilize the exchange rate at about YRls 160 per U.S. dollar since mid-1999, following a 13 percent depreciation in early 1999. During a brief period in June/July 2000 the Yemeni rial appreciated sharply, following the announcement of the border treaty with Saudi Arabia, but fell quickly back to previous levels. With rising inflation, the rial experienced a sizable real appreciation in 2000 (Chart 3). yiables By contrast, progress on the structural front since mid-1999 was disappointing l-2). Out of the 13 structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the period September-December 1999, only two were observed. Nonetheless, a number of important structural steps were implemented, albeit sometimes later than planned: (a) the Privatization Law was promulgated; (b) the cabinet approved time-bound action plans agreed with the World Bank for the restructuring/liquidation of the three public sector specialized banks and two public sector commercial banks; (c) a reformed Central Bank Law was finally approved by parliament; and (d) the commercial courts were brought under the managerial oversight of the Ministry of Justice.

Republic of Yemen: Domestic Oil Revenues I. Of the government’s share of the country’s crude oil production (about 60 percent in 1999), two-thirds are exported, with one-third sold to government-owned retineries at Aden and Marib. The refined products are sold to the government-owned distributor, the Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC), which sells to private distributors and public enterprises, notably the public electricity company (PEC). 2. Under a new settlement mechanism introduced in early 1999. the government sells its domestic crude also at world market prices. The Matib refinery charges YPC monthly average prices quoted on the Mediterranean market, while the Aden refinery charges daily international prices (Rotterdam basis) plus a premium of USfl7 per ton to cover inefficiency costs and additional transportation costs.’ The YPC charges its customers the retail price set by the government (minus a 6 percent profit margin for private distributors), and retains a 6 percent administrative fee and a transport cost fee of YRl I per liter. At the end of each month, the budget pays YPC the difference between its sales volumes valued at administered sales prices net of fees and taxes, and at the international prices charged by the refinery. If prices ex-refineries exceed the net sales price, YPC receives a cash subsidy. Moreover, the budget reimburses any arrears on fuel purchases to YPC of government-owned companies such as PEC and the national airline, Yemenia. 3. Domestic retail prices are fixed administratively and include some explicit taxes, such as fixed fees (of YR10.5 for gasoline and YRl I for diesel) to finance the road and agriculture funds, a small vehicle tax, and a 2 percent consumption tax. The strong rise of petroleum product prices on international markets, combined with some effect of depreciation, has led to a reappearance of a substantial net subsidy bill for petroleum products in 1999-2000. This was aggravated by a shift in the composition of domestic consumption toward highly subsidized diesel, itself reflecting the divergence of relative retail prices of different petroleum products.

On the administrative level, the government in mid-2000 raised electricity tariffs and prices for fuel oil, but diesel price reform was again delayed as the sociopolitical situation was judged too precarious for the sensitive measure, which in the past has invariably led to social unrest. III. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES 10. The discussions were held against the backdrop of a sharply improved macroeconomic position and outlook, which at,the same time had weakened the ability of the government to build a sufficiently broad consensus for painful reform and an understanding for the need to save part of the revenue derived from depleting limited oil reserves. In the course of 2000, the authorities increasingly shared the mission’s concern that high public spending was a main factor fueling the surge in inflation and an unwarranted real appreciation of the exchange rate since April 2000, but they also emphasized that monetary tightening should be the main instrument to slow inflation. The concomitant launch of the preparation of the second Five-Year Plan (2001-05) with broad-based participation of civil society and, as part of this exercise, a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) added a strong emphasis on medium-term issues to the discussions. A. Medium-Term Strategy 11. There was broad agreement that Yemen’s medium-term strategy, as outlined in the IPRSP, needed to focus on higher sustainable growth to improve living standards and reduce poverty. While Yemen had made impressive progress in liberalizing pricing, markets, and the exchange and trade system, there is little doubt that during the 1990s poverty has risen sharply. In part, this reflects the dislocations of the first half of the decade associated with unification, the Gulf crisis, and the civil war in 1994; but it also reflects a weak growth performance in the second half of the decade that barely raised real per capita income and consumption. The authorities strongly felt that a focus on distributive policies would not help reduce poverty, although a strengthening of the social safety net was needed. To achieve higher growth, the authorities agreed that macrostability had to be preserved and emphasized that the reduction in inflation achieved in recent years had helped contain the rise in poverty. There was also agreement that growth had to be driven by the private sector and that this required “second generation reforms” to address deep-rooted weaknesses in the business and investment environment. Such weaknesses included weak contract enforcement, . an overstaffed and poorly trained civil service, and transparency and governance problems in the public sector. There was less unanimity about the role of public spending in promoting growth. The mission stressed the temporary aspect of the current level of oil revenue, given price volatility and with Yemen’s oil production based on proven reserves and expected production paths set to decline gradually in the next years (Box 2).

Republic of Yemen: Preserving Oil Wealth’ 1. Yemen faces the difficult task of spending its finite oil wealth in such a way that fiscal policy remains sustainable in the long run. This requires saving a portion of today’s oil revenue in the form of financial assets or investments in human and physical capital that generate sufficient revenues to sustain future real expenditures at current per capita levels. A simple rule to this effect would prescribe that government preserve per-capita wealth, i.e., consumes the real interest it receives on total wealth (oil wealth and other assets) net of what needs to be set aside for the growing population. 2. Calculating oil wealth at any given point in time is subject to considerable uncertainty, and depends inter alia on a forecast of future oil prices, oil production, and interest rates. Abstracting from any titure discoveries or development of natural gas, proven recoverable oil reserves of about 2.8 billion barrels imply a gradual decline of production in coming years (top figure). Assuming an interest rate of 4 percent, Yemen’s oil wealth at the beginning of the year 1999 was about USSl9 billion (or USSl.080 per capita) based on an oil price remaining at USSl8 per barrel forever; in early 2000, it rose to USS25 billion (USSl,400 per capita) baaed on US%26 per barrel. 3. Measured against the optimal consumption rule, Yemen would appear to have spent too much of its oil wealth over the past years. Taking into account the considerable debt relief afforded in 1996-2000, which increased net financial wealth and thus expanded sustainable consumption levels, and under the optimistic assumption that all capital spending added to net government wealth, Yemen’s non-oil government savings should have been in the order of -3 percent to -5 percent of GDP (bottom figure). With actual saving at -15 percent to -20 percent of GDP, there was a considerable decline in per capita government wealth. Under the planned medium-term scenario, the gap between optimal and actual savings would gradually narrow because of fiscal adjustment and faster non-oil growth. 160 , Projected Crude Oil Production, 1990-2020 (In millions of barrels) 0 -5 -IQ -IS -20 -25 0 ptim aI and Actual Non-011 G overnm cot SavInga (la percent of G D P) 0 ptim al savings 2 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 ’ A more detailed discussion is provided in the companion background paper. ’ Optimal savings in year t consistent with permanent income theory rule is based on oil wealth calculated for year I as explained above.

The prospect for exploiting Yemen’s natural gas reserves remains uncertain, although the international consortium dealing with the gas has recently invited bids for construction of the necessary facilities (Box 3). 12. Accordingly, the mission felt that there was a strong case to preserve some of the oil wealth for leaner years ahead. It provided the authorities with illustrative calculations indicating that the recent fiscal stance was markedly suboptimal from an intertemporal point of view (Box 2). In particular, the mission expressed concern that the sharp increases in the 2000 budget for wages, defense, and current transfers and subsidies-following similarly high increases in the preceding years- implied large expenditure commitments for the medium term, creating additional vuhrerabilities for macroeconomic stability given the volatility of oil revenue. However, the mission concurred with the increased allocations for the Social Welfare Fund, other social spending projects, and operation and maintenance. At least for 2001, and probably beyond, the mission saw a strong case to use any oil windfall to reduce public debt and accumulate reserves, perhaps in the form of an investment fund. This would also help to stem a real exchange rate appreciation that was not sustainable and threatened to weaken non-oil growth. In the discussions, several officials questioned the idea that Yemen should run budget surpluses, but a medium-term macroframework centered on high public savings was eventually adopted (Table 8). It targets a steady increase in non-oil revenue and an ambitious expenditure tightening in coming years (as share of GDP), which will require a considerable adjustment effort because of the need to accommodate increases in social spending associated with the PRS. Combined with development of additional oil and gas production, positive productivity growth in the non-oil sector based on strong structural reform, and a slowdown in population growth, such a fiscal program should shift public finances gradually toward a sustainable non-oil deficit. The staff also concurred that “saving the oil windfall” could at least partly take the form of accelerating human and physical capital formation through increased education and infrastructure spending, especially in rural areas, though some officials were of the view that a much larger share of any windfall should be spent immediately in these priority areas. However, as the authorities recognized, public spending in these areas was still inefficient, and there was consensus that the PRS process should help improve the design and allocation of such expenditures, at which time the medium-term expenditure program would be revisited. B. Objectives and Policies for 2001 13. The main macroeconomic objectives for 2001 are to achieve an increase in non-oil growth to about 5 percent through higher public and private investment while reducing inflation to an average annual rate of 9 percent. The macroeconomic policy - framework will be based on a floating exchange rate system, and reserve money targeting will provide a nominal anchor. The authorities will target a budget surplus of about 2.3 percent of GDP based upon an assumption of an average oil export price of US$22.2 per barrel in 200 1 and oil production of about 432,000 barrels per day in 2001. The mission agreed that these objectives for 2001 were feasible but hinged, in particular, on the strict Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Box 3. Republic of Yemen: Hydrocarbon Sector 1. During the first half of the 199Os, the civil war and a low success rate of hydrocarbon discoveries led to a decline in foreign interest in the Yemeni oil sector. Several operators pulled out of Yemen or reduced their exploration activities. To attract new operators and prevent a decline in oil production in the near future, in the mid- 1990s the government began to offer better financial terms in new contracts and eased existing contract terms on a case-by-case basis. Better terms offered included more than doubling the initial oil share recovered by the operator yearly to cover exploration costs and adjustments to allow for oil price fluctuations. Consequently, the number of new companies in the oil sector increased significantly, with 20 exploration blocks awarded between 1996 and 1999. 2. Production sharing agreements between the government and the oil companies determine the royalty oil (which goes to the government) and cost oil (which goes to the company to cover expenses incurred in exploration and production) deducted from net oil production (i.e., gross production adjusted for the amount of oil used up in the production process). These agreements also determine how the remaining oil is shared. The government levies a 50 percent income tax on the share of Hunt, operator of the Marib field. Despite more favorable terms for oil companies, the average total government share of oil production slightly increased from 54 percent in 1992-94 to 58 percent in 1995-99. 3. The combined proven recoverable oil reserves across the six currently active fields is roughly 2.4 billions barrels. Until the mid- 199Os, Marib provided the bulk of oil production in Yemen but, starting in 1995, that role was increasingly taken over by the Masila field. Both blocks currently produce over 80 percent of total oil in Yemen, while the Jannah field-in operation since 1996-provided 12 percent of the total in 1999. In the absence of further oil discoveries, Yemen’s oil production is expected to peak in 2000 at about 407,000 barrels per day before starting to decline at an initial annual rate of 3-4 percent, mainly due to the drying up of the Marib fields (with increased production from the Jannah and Shabwa fields insuffrcient to offset that decline). 4. Yemen has two state-owned refineries, one in Aden and the other in Marib. The Aden refinery currently refines about 75,000 barrels per day of crude oil, less than half its original capacity. The Marib refinery only refines Marib block crude, at the rate of 10,000 barrels per day. Both refineries mainly supply the domestic market, where current consumption of various products (gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, jet kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)) amounts to an equivalent of about 75,000 barrels per day. 5. With natural gas reserves estimated at about 15 trillion cubic feet, Yemen has potential as a large gas producer. Yemen Liquefied Natural Gas (YLNG)-a joint venture between Total, Yemen Gas Company, Hunt Oil, Exxon, and Yukong-has plans to construct a two-train liquefaction plant with a 5.3 million ton per year capacity, at an estimated initial cost of US$2.6 billion. Although it has not yet been able to secure long-term sales contracts (partly reflecting competition from the region), in April 2000, YLNG invited bids for the execution of the project. The only ongoing gas production is that of about 30,000 barrel per day.equivalent of LPG in the Marib block, fully covering domestic consumption.

In turn, this would require that populist pressures to increase expenditure beyond the approved budgets could be resisted-in particular in the case of higher-than-expected oil prices-and the planned structural reforms implemented on time. C. Public Finances 14. In discussing fiscal policy for. 200 1 and beyond, the authorities concurred that reforms in the domestic energy sector remained at the top of the agenda given the huge petroleum subsidy bill. Staff particularly stressed the importance of reducing diesel subsidies, accounting for 3.5 percent of GDP in 2000. The authorities largely agreed that it served limited social purpose but (a) encouraged excessive depletion of water reserves including for qat farming; (b) weakened the financial position of the public electricity company (PEC) by encouraging the better-off to switch to privately generated power; and (c) was stimulating smuggling to neighboring countries. The authorities agreed to incorporate a 40 percent diesel price increase into the 2001 budget (see below) but stressed the acute sociopolitical sensitivity of the diesel price-especially in the rural sector where two consecutive drought years had made farmers highly dependent on diesel pumps, and also because of the impact on public transport and trucking. The authorities felt there was limited administrative capacity to target support to those among the poor who may be adversely affected. Countervailing measures include increases in the social welfare fund, differentiating utility price increases to protect the poorest consumers, and earmarking part of the subsidy saving for agricultural and road development. As a first step, in August 2000, parliament approved a tax of 5 percent on diesel (and gasoline) with the extra revenue earmarked for agricultural extension and road maintenance; implementation of the measure was, however, delayed and is now expected after the February local elections. 15. The authorities concurred that the prospective decline in oil revenue combined with limited growth in tax revenue in recent years highlighted the need to step up the pace of tax reforms to reduce the dependency on oil revenue. A centerpiece of this tax reform is the introduction of a GST in value-added mode covering most goods and services, and a single rate structure. However, a draft law elaborated with Fund technical assistance and approved by the cabinet was drastically amended by parliament before it passed in January 2001. The amendments re-inserted most of the exemptions of the existing tax on consumption, production, and services (excise) (TCPS) and extended coverage only to a small positive list of relatively minor services. The rate structure maintains most taxable goods subject to 10 percent; excises ranging from 2-80 percent are maintained on petroleum products, cigarettes, and imports such as steel, wood, etc. Parliament also weakened the - proposed penalty regime and delayed extension of the GST to large wholesalers for 5 years, and to large retailers for 10 years. The authorities shared the mission’s disappointment about this outcome and feared that it may lead to revenue losses; accordingly they plan to resubmit a more meaningful law to parliament in the coming weeks with the aim of having the GST Law promulgated by June 2001. To ensure that the GST could be successfully introduced by late-200 1, the mission urged the authorities to make the recently established large taxpayer unit (LTU) fully operative in early 2001. The LTU is to administer all taxes Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- (GST, income tax, and withholding tax) of taxpayers, including all initial GST participants with sales above a certain threshold (resulting in about 1,000 files). The mission expressed concern that the process of staffing the LTU and of transferring tiles from other tax collecting departments appears to be moving slower than expected due to conflicting interdepartmental objectives, and expressed strong reservations about the authorities’ intentions to establish LTU offices in all major governorates rather than consolidating this work in a very few and fully equipped and modemized offices. With regard to customs modemization, the authorities detail in their MEFP ongoing efforts to modemize customs administration. The mission recommended seizures of smuggled goods as well as publication of any successful operations in this area, and stressed the need for more clearly delineating the respective role of customs services and the military. 16. In the area of income tax reform, the authorities explained that they did not submit as planned specific amendments to the Income Tax Law to parliament so as to complete, with Fund technical assistance, a diagnosis of the entire existing Income Tax Law. This has revealed the need for a more comprehensive reform, and the authorities are in the process of elaborating a reformed Income Tax Law for cabinet consideration by mid-200 1, with Fund technical assistance. 17. On expenditure reform, the mission stressed the need to adopt wage and recruitment policies consistent with the ongoing civil service reform. To ensure that in the coming years no further increases beyond cost-of-living adjustments will be granted for any ministry or agency that has not fully implemented its restructuring under the civil service reform supported by an ongoing World Bank project, the authorities have established an interministerial committee to formulate medium-term public sector wage policy aimed at a gradual reduction of the wage bill as a share of GDP. In this regard, the mission welcomed that new hiring was to take place under competitive procedures. The latest information received from the authorities indicate that 11,440 civil servants have been retired by end- December 2000. The staff also welcomed plans for the retirement of over 12,000 over-age mission in early 200 1. To this end, retirement procedures were further simplified in late 2000. The mission expressed concern about the delays in setting up a fully operational Civil Service Fund (CSF), which will seek to provide incentives for workers of a certain age to retire and will support the reinsertion of others in the private sector through training, severance pay, or other procedures. Establishment of the CSF was key to unblock the long- delayed resolution of “at home workers,” including workers from privatized or liquidated firms. The mission shared World Bank concerns that draft CSF by-laws recently approved by the cabinet needed to be clarified in some areas, particularly in the case of treatment of workers who choose neither to take retirement nor to be retrained. 18. Important elements of this fiscal agenda were incorporated into the 2001 budget, which was approved by parliament in December 2000. The budget assumes an average crude oil export price of US$22 per barrel and, on this basis, would imply a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP. The financial program agreed with the authorities differs from the budget mainly as it (a) targets some saving in the wage bill through accelerated retirement, (b) assumes a lower estimate of interest obligations consistent with the 2000 outcome, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- (c) aims at higher revenue collection. In particular, an increase of 1 percentage point in non-oil revenue as share of non-oil GDP reflects higher projected imports, yielding higher sales tax and customs revenues, and higher-than-expected earnings for the central bank as low-interest claims on the government are being replaced by foreign assets. Current expenditures are programmed to fall slightly as a percentage of GDP over 2000 (a decline of 7 percent in real terms), with the main saving coming from subsidy reduction and lower interest payments. The program provides for an increase in the wage bill of 12 percent (3 percent in real terms), based on limiting recruitment to 9,000 staff, mostly in health and education. While the increase (from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 8.1 percent in 2001) is greater than that recommended by the mission, the authorities have defended it as the smallest increase since 1997, and implying a decline as share of non-oil GDP. The authorities intend to implement the wage increase only after effecting a diesel price adjustment of YRls 4 per liter by mid-200 1. The budget also provides for considerably higher expenditure on materials and services, and development spending with each to increase by about 20 percent. Initially, the authorities proposed much higher investment spending but agreed to scale down their request as staff expressed concern that sizable increases in development spending could be premature and should await improvements in the administrative capacity to select high-yield projects and monitor their implementation. The mission expressed strong concern about the sharp increase in defense outlays, which partly reflect the carryover of large wage increases granted in mid-2000. 19. During the budget debate in parliament, there were strong pressures to raise spending and cancel the planned diesel price increase. In the end, parliament only issued a nonbinding “recommendation” that extra revenue resulting from oil prices exceeding US$22 per barrel should be deposited in an escrow account earmarked for additional development spending in the rural sector. Altogether, the authorities target a fiscal surplus of about 2.3 percent of GDP, implying an improvement in non-oil public saving by 1 percentage point of GDP. The authorities have undertaken to fully save any extra oil export revenue from higher-than-programmed international oil prices; revenue shortfalls due to lower prices would trigger offsetting contingency measures for one-fifth of the shortfall. The authorities have identified higher gasoline excises and cuts in nonpriority expenditure as contingency measures should the need arise. 20. The authorities are aware that pension reform is urgently needed to ensure the long-term viability of the public sector pension fund. The mission noted the recent doubling of the minimum pension for new retirees to bring it above the poverty line and welcomed the change in the basis for pension contributions to the full actual wage (rather than the much lower base salary). Pensions will be indexed automatically to 50 percent of the - public sector cost-of-living salary adjustments. However, the mission expressed strong concern that benefits have also been based on last full wage prior to retirement from the beginning of 2000, creating large future pension liabilities. The new rules are expected to yield large surpluses in the upcoming years because the number of pensioners will remain fairly small in comparison to the number of contributors. However, as current workers-who contributed most of their lives on the basis of their basic salary-will retire with benefits based on full salaries, rapidly rising deficits for the pension authority would emerge in about Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - five to seven years. To ensure the system’s sustainability, the mission emphasized that reforms-along the lines suggested in recent FAD technical assistance reports-will have to establish stronger links between benefits and contributions and a clearer circumscription of survivor benefits. The authorities explained that-after consideration of various options for radical pension reform-the government had narrowed its strategy to parametric changes to the existing, system, and it intended to submit reform options to the cabinet by early 200 1. Similar reform of the military and security personnel pensions will be prepared in 2001. 21. The mission stressed the need to improve the monitoring of public finances and welcomed the establishment of an economic and financial studies unit at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to forecast and monitor budget revenue and expenditure, following the recent adaptation of the current central bank accounting software for monthly budget data based on Government Finance Statistics Yearbook classification. In line with recent public expenditure reviews undertaken by the World Bank, the mission urged the authorities to strengthen institutional capability to better target public expenditure and monitor implementation. The authorities agreed that this was, indeed, a key prerequisite for poverty reduction and pointed to the ongoing implementation of a World Bank-supported project to improve public resource management. The mission noted that a recent decentralization law offered the opportunity to a greater involvement of local communities in formulating development policies but warned that better clarification of responsibilities between the center and local administration as well as a substantial strengthening of local governments’ administrative capacity were needed to avoid a loss of fiscal control. D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and Financial Sector Reform 22. Following the easing of monetary policy in late 1999 and early 2000, the authorities fully shared the mission’s concerns about resurging inflation and plan to tighten monetary policies in the months ahead. The objective is to slow growth of M2 to about 11 percent in 2001, well under projected nominal non-oil GDP growth (Table 5). With another sizable increase in foreign assets partly offset by the large projected repayments of credit to the government, this would allow a strong expansion of private sector credit. 23. The mission stressed that monetary policy should focus on reducing inflation and be less concerned with exchange rate stability. In particular, intervention in the foreign exchange market should be limited to smooth volatility. The mission expressed strong concern that the past policy of one-sided intervention (selling foreign exchange) had contributed to a real appreciation that could weaken incentives for tradable production and thus diversification away from oil. This could also lead to a public perception of a de facto commitment to a fixed exchange rate that could prove politically costly to change. The authorities recognized the risk of real appreciation and declining competitiveness, but they also pointed to the very pronounced public identification of stability of the exchange rate with the success of-and therefore support for-the reform program. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- 24. The authorities concurred broadly with the findings of a joint World Bank-Fund FSAP exercise in late 2000 (Box 4) which, inter alia, indicated considerable scope for enhancing the institutional framework and market mechanisms supporting the management of domestic liquidity. Although it would be preferable to issue treasury bills for monetary management purposes, given that the government would not currently issue any more treasury bills, the mission urged that the central bank begin to develop its own certificates of deposit (CDs) as principal liquidity management instrument, replacing the distortionary and unwieldy minimum benchmark saving deposit rate. The authorities considered that the time was not yet right to allow banks to set interest on savings deposits free of any restrictions, fearing that it would trigger a shift towards dollar deposits and that the benchmark rate may help to prevent collusion among banks. The mission felt that the downward trend in dollarization in 2000, even while the benchmark rate was reduced, did not support such fears. Following the introduction of weekly forecasts of the CBY’s balance sheet, coordination between the CBY and the MOF on public debt management and monetary operations should improve further with the recent creation of the macroeconomic monitoring unit at the MOF. 25. The authorities also concurred with the FSAP findings that, while the financial system lacks depth and suffers from a number of structural weaknesses, the potential for systemic or macroeconomic instability from shocks to the system and bank distress is limited. Deep-seated structural obstacles-including severe shortcomings in the legal and judicial system, accounting and auditing practices, corporate and general governance, and transparency+ontinue to limit the contribution of the financial system to economic growth and development. Banks dominate the financial system and, while the majority of banks are well capitalized and highly liquid, there are serious deficiencies in capital and provisioning against nonperforming loans at some systemically important banks. Stress tests suggest that these banks are vulnerable to a further deterioration in credit quality and an unexpected appreciation of the rial. The mission stressed the need for a clear, aggressive, and time-bound strategy for resolving the situation of weak banks-with particular focus on recapitalization and improved loan performance. 26. More broadly, progress has been made in strengthening bank supervision and regulation. Compliance with the Base1 Core Principles has improved with the supervisory initiatives of the central bank, especially with respect to preconditions for effective bank supervision, loan classification, and ongoing supervision. However, there is substantial noncompliance in important areas, including: lack of enforcement of standards regarding capital adequacy; credit policies; large exposures; and insider lending and internal controls. In this context, the mission pointed to the high share of nonperforming loans (estimated at - 35 percent of total loans and end-1999) and still inadequate capitalization of the banking system as a whole (an aggregate Cooke-ratio of 5.2 percent at end-l 999). 27. In the discussions, the authorities pointed to considerable progress in addressing financial sector weaknesses raised by the staff. With the recent promulgation of the Central Bank Law, the CBY’s supervisory authority in almost all areas has been strengthened Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Box 4. Republic of Yemen: Financial Sector Stability Assessment-Main Conclusions The financial system suffers from major weaknesses, although its relatively limited role in the economy contains the potential for systemic or widespread instability stemming from shocks to the financial system. The small size of the financial sector reflects deep-seated structural obstacles that limit its contribution to economic growth and development. These include: (a) weaknesses in the legal and judicial framework, particularly with regard to the functioning of commercial courts and the judicial processes for recovery of bank and other debts; (b) lack of proper accounting standards and disclosure practices; and (c) scarcity of banking and financial skills. There is significant scope for improving the authorities’ liquidity management framework. A high degree of segmentation of the limited money market, absence of an interbank market, and dollarization limits the ability of monetary authorities to influence domestic liquidity. Elimination of the administratively set minimum benchmark deposit rate, a gradual removal of market segmenting restrictions (such as restrictions on the banking transactions of public enterprises and pension funds), enhancement of central bank instruments for liquidity management, and better coordination between the ministry of finance and the central bank could significantly improve the liquidity management framework. The banking system is generally weak, although the risk of bank distress precipitating a widespread economic crisis is limited. There are serious deficiencies in banks’ provisioning against nonperforming loans. Under the central bank’s provisioning guidelines, 4 out of 13 banks have negative net worth and account for most of the nonperforming loans. The majority of banks, however, are strongly capitalized and are highly liquid. This, along with the absence of interbank exposure, limits the risk of contagion. Banks are vulnerable to a further deterioration in credit quality. Stress tests reveal that an increase in credit risk with a 10 percent rise in nonperforming loans renders two banks marginally noncompliant with the 8 percent Base1 standard. Five of the other banks are already below this, and their situation would also worsen. The predominance of short-term assets and liabilities in bank balance sheets limits the exposure of the banking system to interest rate increases. Most banks also have a long position in foreign assets and are to that extent not vulnerable to a sharp depreciation of the Yemeni rial, although their capital adequacy would suffer from an unexpected appreciation. The weak financial situation of some banks points to the need to have a clear, aggressive, and time-bound strategy for its resolution with particular focus on recapitalization and improved loan performance. The financial structure is underdeveloped, and key financial markets and supporting institutions are either nonexistent or play a very limited role. Pension funds are the main nonbank participants in the financial market. They are at present very liquid and tend to serve as a captive source of government finance because of restrictions on their investments. There is some scope for granting them limited flexibility in the management of their assets, notably allowing them for investment. Compliance with the Base1 Core Principles has improved with the supervisory initiatives taken by the central bank. Out of the 29 applicable core principles, 14 relating to preconditions for effective bank supervision, loan classification and ongoing supervision are either compliant or are largely compliant. However, the 15 areas of noncompliance or material noncompliance concern important areas, including: lack of enforcement of standards regarding capital adequacy; credit policies; large exposures; insider lending; internal controls; market and other risks; and consolidated supervision and legal protection for supervisors. While transparency practices seem adequate considering the state of development of the financial system, there is scope to improve coordination and disclosure of the operational relations between the central bank and other governmental entities.

On the other hand, the authorities expressed some concern about the administrative complications implied by one of the amendments introduced by parliament, which requires that the central bank invest the reserve requirements of Islamic banks in Islamic (non-interest-bearing) instruments. The central bank also explained that it had recently completed, with Fund technical assistance, a risk rating for each commercial bank and has adopted a supervisory strategy for each bank based upon the rating. Banks with poor ratings were required to sign memoranda of understanding with the central bank detailing the course of action to be taken. However, they agreed that better compliance would also require giving the banking law more teeth regarding enforcement provisions, and the authorities proposed to submit relevant banking law amendments to parliament in a few months. ’ 28. Reform of the commercial courts was seen as another priority area in building a financial sector supportive of private sector growth. To improve transparency, the authorities have begun publishing-in a new Ministry of Justice quarterly journal- judgments rendered and the underlying reasoning for supreme court judgments; in the near future, they will publish select lower court cases and all appeal court rulings. Also, the authorities detailed various programs to improve court administration, the training of judges, and provision of better equipment including computerization. The mission strongly welcomed additional recent innovations such as a strong push to investigate judges accused of corruption, and the establishment and training of a specialized police that will enforce court judgments. 29. The mission encouraged the authorities to pursue the restructuring/liquidation of three specialized public banks and reform of the two state-owned commercial banks in line with the action plan elaborated with the World Bank. The mission welcomed the approval by the cabinet of the privatization of National Bank of Yemen (NBY) and urged authorities to make the planned sale of NBY to strategic investors in the international market a signal of its commitment to transparent and competitive privatization. The Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development (YBRD) has recently resolved most nonperforming claims on government institutions and related guarantees. However, YBRD’s financial performance is still weighed down by excessive staffing and difficulties in collecting sizable overdue debts from private borrowers. A planned major labor shedding is awaiting the effective establishment of the civil service fund, while loan contract enforcement suffers from a very weak and ineffective judicial system. To ensure that YBRD board members are in full compliance with prudential regulations, the authorities persuaded two members owing large amounts of overdue debt to the YBRD, well in excess of prudential limits on insider lending and credit concentration, to resign. The mission welcomed this action, but expressed concern that collection of the underlying debt is still held up following an appeal against a supreme . court judgment in favor of the YBRD (after many years of proceedings) and subsequent return of the case to an appeal court. Resolution of this case would be important to provide a clear signal to the business community that contracts will be enforced and that well- connected debtors will not remain beyond the law.

As detailed in the MEFP, the institutional setup of the privatization process has recently been completed and in June 2000 the process for privatization of a large batch of firms was finally launched. Legislation to liberalize of the transportation system and breaking up of the domestic trucking cartel-in consultation with the World Bank-was submitted to parliament. The mission welcomed submission to parliament of a draft reform of the Investment Law elaborated with FIAS that (a) will go well beyond some tightening of tax holidays; (b) will streamline procedures for approving and implementing investments covered by the law; and (c) will liberalize exchange regulations applying to foreign investors under the law. However, the mission felt that tax exemptions could be further tightened to reduce scope for abuse and, more generally, questioned the importance of fiscal incentives for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). While the authorities agreed that a simple, enforced, and transparent regulatory framework may be more important to attract FDI, they argued that-given the time needed for such reforms-tax incentives were essential for the time being to offset weaknesses elsewhere. The authorities expect that the amended law will be promulgated in early 2001. On a related issue, the authorities felt that it was premature to change the regulatory framework of the Aden Free Zone, and that they would rather review at an appropriate time the experience with the zone to derive further ideas for establishing a modem legal, regulatory, and judicial framework for investment. F. Balance of Payments and External Financing 31. Implementation of the reform program is projected to help maintain a small external current account surplus (including grants) in the order of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2001, allowing for an increase in official reserves in the order of US$O.3 billion in 2001 (Table 7). Over the medium term, the outlook is for a gradual decline in current account balances, largely reflecting a gradual decline in crude oil production and prices. However, Yemen’s capacity to repay the Fund would remain strong (Table lo), and the import reserve cover should remain high even beyond 2001-above nine months of imports. 32. The government will continue to limit its recourse to nonconcessional borrowing. After the World Bank approved in late November 1999 a US$l5 million grant under the IDA facility for a buyback offer to be made to commercial creditors, a first set of creditors accepted the offer at the first closing in April 2000, and debt with a face value of about US$355 million was retired. In a second closing in October 2000, in which most of the remaining creditors participated, debt of US$l5 million was retired (at US$O. 10 on the dollar). The buyback includes commercial debts to Russia which were retired after an initial reduction of 80 percent was applied to the stock of Russian commercial debt in line with the provisions of the 1997 agreement between Russia and the Paris Club. Buyback provisions also required that any interest arrears be forgiven. Small remaining amounts will be similarly treated once legal issues affecting this debt are settled. In 2000, the authorities signed the bilateral agreement with Russia implementing the 1997 Paris Club Agreed Minute and are continuing discussions with France on concluding the last outstanding bilateral agreement. Upon approval of the third annual arrangement, the Paris Club will retroactively implement Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - the third phase of the 1997 rescheduling agreement covering maturities that fell due during January-October 2000. At the time of issuance of the staff report, the staff had indicated that Yemen may not have serviced maturities falling due to Paris Club creditors after October 2000, because of uncertainties about a possible extension of the 1997 Paris Club agreement. The mission has urged the authorities to clear any arrears as soon as possible. Negotiations with non-Paris Club creditors on comparable treatment continue. The authorities intend to request from Paris Club creditors a stock-of-debt operation on Naples Terms in conjunction with a possible new PRGF arrangement. The external debt management software, the Debt Monitoring Financial Assistance System, has recently been installed at the central bank and central bank staff are being trained in its operation; the authorities are working on its extension to the ministries of finance and planning with Fund technical assistance. The staff expressed, however, concerns about delays in inputting the data and making the system operational. 33. The authorities concur with the DSA completed in June with the help of World Bank and Fund staffs, which indicates that after the full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms Yemen’s debt is sustainable. However, they felt that inclusion of the oil companies’ exports in the exports base, while consistent with the guidelines for the Initiative for HIPC, overstated Yemen’s debt sustainability as much of these exports serve to pay cost recovery for the investments of the companies, akin to debt service. If these payments- at the levels as currently projected-were considered debt service, Yemen’s net present value of debt would far exceed the HIPC threshold. The mission agreed that the currently comfortable external position masks continued vulnerabilities to adverse external stocks. In particular, Yemen remains highly vulnerable to downward shifts in oil prices. Ceteris paribus, a decrease in world oil prices by US$l worsens Yemen’s fiscal and external current account balances by nearly 1 percent of GDP, and possibly more to the extent provisions in the agreements with oil companies kick in to increase the companies’ share in value if prices fall below certain thresholds. This effect tends to be compounded by the impact of lower oil prices on remittances, which mostly come from Yemenis working in the Gulf; private capital inflows are also correlated with the economic outlook for the oil producers in the Gulf. In discussing balance of payments needs, the authorities also stressed that the programmed continued accumulation of foreign assets in the coming year, transforming oil-wealth into financial assets, was needed to sustain current levels of government services over the longer term when oil revenue would fall. 34. On trade issues, the remaining import bans for economic reasons have been lifted in early 2000 and the relevant decree published in the offtcial trade journal, making Yemen’s trade regime one of the most liberal in the region (see background . paper for details). The mission expressed concern that for certain fruits and vegetables, licenses were still required for import during certain seasons. The authorities felt there were similar controls in many industrial countries and indicated that in practice the controls would Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - be liberally implemented. The authorities concurred that greater transparency was needed to clarify the trade regime and intend to publish all relevant regulations on a government web site. G. Transparency, Statistical Issues, and Technical Assistance 35. The mission urged the authorities to improve the quality and timeliness of economic data for informed government decision making and, combined with greater transparency, for strengthening public support for reforms. It strongly welcomed the authorities’ intention to publish the national metadata and plans for improvements in the Yemeni statistical systems under the Fund’s General Data Disseminations System (GDDS). The Yemeni metadata is near completion and it will be posted on the Internet on the Data Standards Bulletin Board once a few missing components are received and the GDDS coordinator is nominated. The mission reminded the authorities of the Fund’s transparency policies and notably the presumption to publish the letter of intent; it stressed that publication would serve as an important input for a better-informed debate in Yemen. Several steps should be taken over the next months to reinforce the statistical base in Yemen, and the mission flagged in this regard the Fund’s move toward stronger safeguards against data misreporting. In particular, there was a need to implement in a more timely manner agreed work plans on improving price statistics along STA advice, to make efficient use of Fund technical assistance and to develop producer price and foreign trade price data to derive more meaningful national accounts at constant prices. To design a better coordination among government agencies involved in compiling statistics, a STA multi-sector statistics mission during August 2000 advised Yemen’s statistical authorities on strategic planning and enhanced interagency coordination across the system of economic statistics. In the area of data provision, the mission encouraged the authorities to provide the Fund, as has been long agreed, with aggregated monthly budget execution data with a maximum delay of one month and with quarterly data on oil-related payments between the Yemen Petroleum Company, the refineries, public enterprises, and the government, and to improve the availability of pension fund statistics. The authorities decided against requesting an IMF resident representative in Sana’a during 2000; they were confident that they could prepare the PRS, and coordinate and monitor the reforms and the recently finalized United Nations Development Program United Kingdom/IMF technical assistance and cooperation plan. The plan involves a substantial increase in financing from the United Kingdom and would broadly maintain the sectoral focus of technical assistance on real, fiscal, monetary, financial, and external sector policy reform, but would add emphasis on provision of statistics for economic policymaking. The program will be supported by a United Kingdom-sponsored training and equipment unit stationed in Sana’a. IV. PROGRAM MONITORING 36. Implementation of the program will be monitored through a set of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets detailed in Attachment I, Annexes III and IV, as well as through a set of structural performance criteria and benchmarks listed in Attachment I, Annex II. With regard to the missed structural performance criteria (PCs) in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - the latter months of 1999, most of these have either been completed (with some delay) or have been deferred as structural performance criteria or benchmarks in 2001 as follows: (a) diesel price increases are now a structural PC for end-June; (b) in view of the authorities’ plan to prepare a more comprehensive overhaul of the Income Tax Law, submission to the cabinet of a reformed tax law is a structural benchmark for end-June; (c) the Investment Law has been submitted to parliament but, in view of its tight agenda, the law has not yet been discussed on the floor; (d) import bans were abolished in March 2000, although seasonal restrictions remain on a few locally grown fruits and vegetables; (e) the promulgation of the GST Law as originally agreed is now a PC for end-June; and (f) the Central Bank Law was promulgated in June 2000. In a change from previous practice, (a) credit ceilings are set on central bank aggregates rather than banking system aggregates to strengthen monitoring and policy guidance, (b) an overall ceiling on domestic budget financing is introduced, and (c) the definition of the external financing adjustment was modified to exclude grants pending improvements in measuring grants; it was agreed to move to quarterly reviews of the program. The first review under the third annual PRGF arrangement and the fifth review under the extended arrangement will be conducted no later than May 2 1,200 1; observance of end-February 2001 performance criteria will be verified at that time. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 37. ’ Economic and financial balances in 1999-2000 improved more than expected. While this mainly reflects the rapid recovery of oil prices since the second-half of 1999, credit also belongs to the authorities for maintaining a measure of spending restraint, especially in 1999, in the face of rising popular expectations of an end to painful adjustments. These expectations nonetheless complicated the task of the government to maintain consensus for difficult reform measures. As a result important tax reforms, the reduction of diesel subsidies, and civil service reform were delayed, although in important breakthroughs parliament finally approved the Privatization Law and the reformed Central Bank Law. Lackluster growth in the non-oil sector pointed to the importance of advancing structural reforms creating an environment for investment and job creation. 38. The staff recognizes the strong sociopolitical pressures, fuelled by oil-price euphoria, which have led to the adoption of an overly generous budget in 2000 and, to a lesser extent, in 2001. However, the large salary increases for civil servants and the military may weaken civil service reform and create medium-term obligations that will be difficult to meet once oil production and/or prices decline. The acceleration of public spending in 2000, combined with supply shocks related to a spring drought, have pushed up inflation and led to a real appreciation of the rial that is unlikely to reflect a sustainable equilibrium and could - threaten non-oil growth and the diversification of Yemen’s economy. 39. The staff believes that the economic policies proposed for 2001 could help arrest the pick up in inflation, strengthen external balances, and lay the basis for higher growth through structural reforms. On the macroeconomic front, this would require that the non-oil fiscal deficit target is adhered to strictly, which would move the fiscal stance closer to one that recognizes that Yemen’s proven oil resources are being depleted and that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - future generation also have a claim on part of this mineral wealth. A forceful tightening of monetary policy is needed to check re-emergence of inflationary pressures. Furthermore, to avoid public perception of a commitment to a de facto fixed exchange rate and to support non-oil growth by avoiding a further real appreciation of the exchange rate, the authorities need to refrain from one-sided intervention. To limit unnecessary exchange rate volatility, as well as to implement monetary targets, the staff encourages the central bank to move further toward the use of repos based on treasury bills or CDs (issued by the central bank) as the principal instrument of monetary policy. 40. A number of structural reforms are essential to address the medium-term fiscal vulnerabilities arising out of the expected decline of oil production and prices, and to allow essential public services to be sustained in the likely leaner years ahead. On the revenue side, promulgation of a GST Law is the main challenge, both to strengthen non-oil revenue and to improve the investment climate. Staff recognizes the great difficulties in overcoming strong opposition, in particular from business lobbies in parliament, and shares the disappointment of the authorities about the GST Law as recently approved by parliament. It urges the authorities to redouble, at the highest level, efforts to promulgate a law that would genuinely address the distortions and governance issues of the current tax system. On the expenditure side, the authorities face the difficult task of curbing current expenditures while accommodating higher poverty-related social spending. The most immediate need is to curb explicit and implicit subsidies in the energy sector that currently exceed 6 percent of GDP, more than twice the expenditure on health (see below). The staff encourages the authorities to pursue civil service reform with greater determination as the importance of these reforms cannot be overstated; apart from its beneficial fiscal impact, a leaner and better qualified civil service with a clearly defined role will be essential to carry out the overall reform strategy and to address many governance problems rooted, in part, in low salaries and insufficient links between merit and pay. Encouraging steps already underway include better management tools, transparent and competitive recruitment procedures, and actual retirement of over-age staff. The long-delayed establishment of the civil service fund should be completed soon to allow the easing out of many workers that are already considered redundant. The more complex part will involve the restructuring of all ministries, with a few pilot cases paving the way. 41. The staff recognixes that the run-up in international petroleum prices has complicated the planned move to full liberalixation of domestic retail pricing of petroleum products and that delaying the modest diesel price increases planned for 2000 may have avoided sociopolitical tensions. However, the social costs of continued diesel subsidies are high, especially for the poor. The underpricing of diesel stimulates (a) rapid depletion of water tables, including for qat production, in one of the most water-deprived countries of the world; (b) smuggling of diesel to neighboring countries; and (c) a proliferation of private power generation by those who can afford to buy diesel generators. The latter contributes to PEC’s financial difficulties and reduces its ability to cross-subsidize the poorest consumers and develop access to electricity in poor rural areas.

The Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) updates the MEFP dated February 27, 1999, and summarizes the Government of Yemen’s macroeconomic and structural adjustment program for the third year under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and extended arrangements covering the period October 1,2000-August 3 1,200l. In support of these policies, the government requests that the Fund approve the third annual arrangement under the PRGF; complete the fourth review under the extended arrangement; extend through October 28,200l the PRGF commitment period and the extended arrangement in order to allow for all disbursements to be made. The government requests that the Fund does not rephase over the third annual PRGF arrangement amounts not disbursed during the second annual arrangement, and that the remaining amounts to be disbursed under the EFF be reduced by one-half.The government also requests that the Fund grant the necessary waivers with respect to end-September, end-November, and end-December 1999 structural performance criteria, as would enable a purchase under the extended arrangement upon completion of the review. The government remains committed to the objectives and policies set out in the MEFPs of August 1997 and February 1999, as well as the supplementary letters of March 1998, July 1998, February 1999, and June 1999, and consistent also with the interim Poverty Reduction Paper elaborated jointly with the World Bank and IMF staff. 2. The government believes that the policies set out in the attached memorandum will achieve the objectives of the program. However, it stands ready to take any additional measures appropriate for this purpose, and it will continue to consult periodically with the Fund the progress being made in the implementation of the program and about any policy adaptations considered appropriate for the achievement of its objectives. In any event, during the third year program the government will conduct with the Fund reviews of the - program under the PRGF and extended arrangements as described in paragraph 3 1 of the memorandum. 3. The government’s assessment is that its reform program is fully financed, given: (a) expected loan and grant disbursements; (b) implementation of the last tranche under the 1997 Paris Club rescheduling; and (c) provided that non-Paris Club creditors provide debt relief on comparable terms, as the government has requested.

DEVELOPMENTSIN 1999-2000 1. Macroeconomic balances improved sharply in 1999-2000, mainly reflecting the increase in world oil prices since the second half of 1999, public expenditure restraint, and high real interest rates. Average annual inflation, as recorded by the official consumer price index, fell to 8 percent by end- 1999. The external current account balance moved into a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP for 1999-much better than programmed. Despite only limited foreign exchange sales by the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) in the private market, the Yemeni iial/U.S. dollar exchange rate has been virtually stable since June 1999 at around YRls 160 to the U.S. dollar, along with a rebuilding of official-own foreign exchange reserves to the equivalent to six months of imports. All quantitative performance criteria for end-December 1999 were met. Similar trends continued in 2000, with a further strong build- up of reserves to US$2.8 billion by end-2000. However, partly reflecting a drought in early 2000 which pushed up food prices, but also an acceleration in monetary growth fuelled by an expansion in foreign assets, inflation flared-up during April 2000, September average annual inflation therefore read 10.7 percent, higher than targeted before subsiding again in late 2000. 2. Real economic growth in 1999 is estimated at about 3.8 percent-lower than programmed due to a smaller-than-expected expansion in oil output, a decline in tourism and construction, and the failure of the spring crop cycle due to drought. Another failure of the spring rains in early 2000 aggravated an already difficult socioeconomic situation in many rural areas, but with improved rainfalls in summer 2000 the growth of non-oil GDP is expected to reach about 4 percent. The fiscal accounts in 1999 were in near balance, although in late 1999 the government had to complete the second round of steep wage increases for most teachers and health workers mandated by a 1998 law taken at the initiative of parliament. The third and last round was implemented with the 2000 budget. Nonetheless, as much of the oil windfall was saved, a large fiscal surplus was achieved in 2000. 3. With regard to structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the second half of 1999, parliament approved the privatization law and the cabinet approved time-bound action plans agreed with the World Bank for the resolution of the three public specialized banks and two public commercial banks, thus meeting corresponding end-September performance criteria. However, cabinet approval of an agreed central bank law and of the agreed General Sales Tax (GST) Law was achieved only in late 1999-later than programmed because of unanticipated difficulties in building a sufficiently broad consensus for the underlying reforms. Both laws were submitted to parliament at end- 1999. Regarding the end-September benchmarks, the steps for reform of the commercial courts were eventually taken in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I November, including by strengthening the oversight of the Ministry of Justice over their administrative and technical performance. The government furthermore considers that the Aden Free Trade Zone already serves as a pilot case for a modem legal, regulatory, and judicial framework for investment, and that any further steps should wait until some experience is gained with its performance. Amendments to the Income Tax Law, including elimination of tax preferences for export income and high agricultural income and revisions to Articles 6(h) and 69, were not submitted to parliament in 1999 as the government had embarked on a comprehensive review of the Income Tax Law that indicated the need to prepare a more comprehensive reform. Regarding the end-December benchmark related to civil service reform, a revised timetable for implementation has been adopted as discussed below. None of the November and December structural performance criteria were met, for the following reasons. First, owing to the aforementioned delays in cabinet approval, parliament received the draft Central Bank and GST Laws only during the Ramadan recess. Second, the agreed abolition of all remaining import bans and publication of the list of any remaining restrictions on imports as well as the diesel price increase programmed for November were delayed because of the difficult sociopolitical climate. Finally, while a reformed investment law was prepared for discussion within the government in consultation with the World Bank’s Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), it was not yet ready for cabinet approval in 1999. 4. A number of long-delayed actions were finally taken in the course of 2000. Regarding financial sector reforms, Parliament approved the Central Bank Law in mid-May, with some amendments which further enhanced central bank independence, and it was signed into law in June 2000. The central bank has completed a risk rating for each commercial bank and based upon the rating adopted a supervisory strategy for each bank focusing on identified bank-specific weaknesses. To improve the quality of commercial judgments, in particular enforcement of credit agreements, publication of selected supreme court commercial judgments and underlying reasoning started in April 2000. The liquidation of the Industrial Bank of Yemen is proceeding under a government liquidation committee and privatization of the National Bank of Yemen (NBY) was authorized by cabinet in August. The restructuring of the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development (YBRD) is progressing: nonperforming claims on government institutions have been settled; guarantees related to rescheduled debt to Paris Club creditors have been removed from the books of the YBRD; and in July YBRD board members owning a company which owes a large nonperforming loan in excess of the limits on lending to insiders and of credit concentration have resigned.. However, while in late 1999 YBRD won a supreme court judgment for repayment of the loan against these debtors, upon the latter’s appeal the case was sent back to the lower court. 5. On civil service reform, following an increase in the wage base for contributions and in pensions for new retirees in late 1999, the cabinet instructed formally in May 2000 the concerned agencies to implement the retirement of all over-age civil servants under streamlined procedures. By early February 200 1, we expect to have retired more than 12,000 civil servants (from the staff as of end-l 999). The government also constituted an interministerial committee with a view to formulating medium-term wage policy, and discussed guidelines to ensure that wage policy was consistent with the civil service reform Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I program. In September 2000 draft by-laws for the civil service fund (CSF) were approved by the cabinet, providing, inter alia, a time limit for staying in the fund and no salary increases beyond cost of living adjustments. The fund will be operational in early 2001. However, while debate on the various pension reform options is ongoing, further technical assistance is needed, in particular for the assessment of the actuarial implications of the various options. Preparation of a draft pension reform law ensuring a closer link between benefits and contributions and ensuring the long-term viability of the system is underway. 6. The government also advanced on the programmed agenda on trade and exchange system liberalization. Per Cabinet Decree No. 85, effective March 28,2000, all remaining import bans maintained for economic reasons were abolished, although Decree No. 89 later established seasonal import licensing requirements for certain fruits and vegetables. Concomitantly, the CBY removed for the recently liberalized goods all restrictions on opening letters of credit and requirements to obtain an import license (Circular No. 4). The Ministry of Supply and Trade issued in July 2000 a complete list of remaining import restrictions, (Decree No. 148,2000), to be published on its website which should clarify to the public that remaining restrictions are maintained solely for security, health, and religious reasons, and that in particular importing of all petroleum products is free, subject to regulations to ensure safety and protect the environment. The government has formally applied for full membership in the World Trade Organization, and is now in the process of gathering the required documentation on trade and trade-related legislation and regulations, with assistance from the European Union. 7. In early 2000, the cabinet approved the reformed Investment Law elaborated with advice from FIAS, to rationalize tax exemptions, streamline procedures for approving and implementing investments under the law, and liberalize foreign exchange restrictions contained in the current law. The cabinet also approved a draft Trucking Law elaborated with World Bank assistance, ensuring free entry into the freight forwarding business, liberalization of trucking tariffs, freedom for shippers to choose a freight forwarding company, and the authorities in this context also prepared regulations to set up the Yemeni Trucking Authority to collect road user and insurance fees, and to ensure safety inspections. Both draft laws have been submitted to parliament to be discussed in the coming months. A presidential decree issued in June 2000 formally established a large taxpayers unit (LTU) which will handle all (direct and indirect) tax liabilities of taxpayers with sales exceeding a certain threshold (about 1,000 taxpayers). Its top management was appointed in late 2000 and it will become operational in early 2001. The planned administered price increases have proven to be the most difficult steps, given their great socioeconomic sensitivity. Fixed electricity charges were raised in February, and average electricity tariffs were increased in . July by about 10 percent in most user categories, with no increase for the first tranche (up to 200 kwh in urban and 100 kwh in rural areas) to protect the poorest consumers. Fuel oil prices were raised to YRls 25 per liter, close to prevailing world market prices. Regarding privatization, the High Commission for Privatization has been appointed and, in its first meeting in June 2000, authorized the putting up for sale of 6 public enterprises (including NBY), and for 3 1 additional enterprises approved either their liquidation or shortlists for financial advisors. Decrees from the prime minister issued in February and April 2000 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 64 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I formally re-established the technical privatization office as secretariat of the High Commission and approved a manual of procedures for privatization. II. POLICIES FOR 2001 8. In recent years Yemen has made good progress in macroeconomic stabilization, price and market liberalization, and the liberalization of the exchange and trade system. However, the government recognizes that higher sustainable grow&and job creation in the non-oil sector are needed to stem the rise in poverty. This will necessitate further comprehensive progress across a broad range of structural and institutional reforms required to bring forth the domestic and foreign investment essential for non-oil sector growth. These reforms include the establishment of a competitive environment, a predictable and transparent legal framework, enforcement of property rights, and better governance. In the context of the preparation of the next Five-Year Plan and a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) we will give growing weight to addressing these more difficult institutional issues. 9. Such a reform agenda has become quite urgent in view of the fact that, barring the discovery of major new fields, from 2001 onward oil production and revenue will begin to taper off-although prospects have recently improved that production of gas for electricity production and liquefied natural gas will begin in a few years. Accordingly, the program aims to gradually raise non-oil real GDP growth through higher private investment and efficiency-improving structural reforms, while maintaining low inflation. Fiscal policy in the period ahead will aim at saving much of the expected oil export income to create some room for the possibly leaner years afterwards and will aim at a strong reduction of public debt as a share of GDP. To facilitate successful implementation, the government will aim to improve the understanding of these institutional reforms and the continuation of the macroeconomic adjustment program among the general public, the parliament, and the civil service through greater transparency and a broader participation of civil society. 10. The economic objectives and policies of the government for 200 1 remain consistent with the original targets, after taking into account the improved outlook for oil prices. The main macroeconomic objectives for 2001 are to achieve non-oil growth of about 5 percent and reduce annual average inflation to 9 percent. The macroeconomic policy framework will remain unchanged: within a flexible exchange rate system reserve money targeting will provide a nominal anchor. The financial program for 2001 has been formulated based on a further revised national accounts series for 1990-99, an assumption of an average oil export price in line with the January 2001 World Economic Outlook assumptions and a decline in oil production by 3 percent in 200 1.’ The 200 1 budget recently approved by parliament, while based on slightly more cautious oil price assumptions, is broadly consistent with the i The revised national accounts have been prepared by the statistical office in the context of an ongoing major overhaul with technical assistance from the Fund’s Statistics Department. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I medium-term macroframework recently endorsed by the cabinet as part of the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP). In the years ahead, with revenue from oil likely to decline, fiscal policy will aim at reducing the large non-oil deficit. 11. We have adopted a timetable for preparation of a PRS by mid-2001, and have prepared an IPRSP building on available material and contributions from concerned government agencies. The preparation of the PRS is being integrated with the preparation of our next Five-Year Plan (200145), which since mid-2000 is being discussed within the government and with representatives from civil society. The proposed overall economic policy framework already incorporates a number of poverty reduction goals such as: saving part of the current oil rent to help finance productive expenditure in the leaner years ahead; protecting the poor through low inflation; creating job opportunities for the poor through structural reforms aimed to stimulate higher investment and non-oil growth; and some redistribution of resources towards the poor, notably via the cash transfers of the Social Welfare Fund (SWF). Measures to contain the adverse impact of various adjustment measures on the most vulnerable include: continued subsidization of electricity and liquefied petroleum gas for the poor; creation of the civil service fund to protect workers released from public sector service; strengthening of the minimum pension component, and support for a sharp expansion of the activities of the autonomous Social Fund for Development, which has a strong track record in assisting local communities and nongovernmental organizations to design and implement projects related to basic social services and infrastructure, as well as microfinance. More specific elements will emerge from the process of the PRS preparation. In particular, the strengthening of human capital formation of the poor through restructuring of public expenditure and, even more importantly, greater efficiency in the delivery of basic social services, which is at the core of the World Bank supported civil service reform, will be elaborated and translated into monitorable indicators in the context of the full-fledged PRSP. Public finances 12. The fiscal program targets another surplus in 2001. If needed to ensure the fiscal target, the following possible contingency measures have been identified: higher gasoline excises; and cuts in development and other expenditure while protecting key education, health, and social welfare outlays as well as priority development projects, especially in the rural sector. In the event that oil prices exceed the level assumed in the program, the additional revenue will be used to reduce further the stock of government debt or increase the government’s deposits; if oil prices are lower, the ceilings on government credit will be eased as specified below. As part of the next Five-Year Plan, the government will study additional ways to preserve part of the oil wealth for the leaner years ahead and ensure that it will have - the resources to maintain its services and functions for the years ahead where oil production and prices may be lower. Taking into consideration international oil price developments during the course of 200 1, the authorities will develop concrete proposals for an investment account by end-2001 that would receive any surplus resulting from higher oil prices; invest such resources abroad through the central bank in a prudent and transparent manner; and with transparent rules and controls regarding any use of the investment account’s resources should the need arise. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I 13. Regarding budget revenue, reforms introduced in March 1999 established accounting and settlement at world market prices for government sales of crude oil to the refineries and for the refineries’ sales to the Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC). Combined with the move by YPC to charge its customers world market prices for aviation fuel and to raise prices for fuel oil, this brought into the open inefficiencies which, in the past, were covered by subsidies implicit in the distorted pricing of petroleum products and reflected in lower domestic oil revenue. To address these inefficiencies, the following steps will be taken to help ensure full and timely settlement of transactions. First, the Aden refinery is being prepared for privatization with assistance from the World Bank, and in this context will review the scope for reducing operating costs. Second, greater efforts will be made to strengthen Yemenia’s financial situation and ensure it pays its fuel bill fully and on time. Third, beyond the recent increase in the fixed charges and tariffs the electricity company (PEC) will further enhance collection efforts and take additional steps as needed to comply with covenants under the World Bank electricity sector project. The planned adjustment of diesel prices should also help in reducing incentives for large customers to build their own diesel-fuelled power generators. While delayed for several years, a medium-term action plan to reform the institutional framework for power generation and distribution will be soon discussed with the World Bank and be subsequently submitted to cabinet. Inter alia, the plan will call for an improved and more autonomous management structure of PEC; decide on a possible separation between power generation and distribution; and establish a timetable for privatization of power generation and possibly also distribution. 14. The prospective decline in oil revenue combined with limited growth in tax revenue in recent years highlight the need to accelerate tax reforms so as to establish a firm base for future revenue and to introduce greater fairness and reduce governance problems in the tax system. To replace the current complex and inefficient tax on production, consumption, and services, in January parliament approved a GST in value-added mode. Reflecting parliamentary concerns about the ability of Yemen’s business sector to absorb and comply with the new tax, the law is substantially weaker than the draft approved by the cabinet earlier. It notably includes a longer list of exemptions, a positive list of only a few relatively minor services to be taxed, and it phases in coverage of wholesale and retail sectors only after 5 and 10 years, respectively. The government believes the law preserves too many of the distortions and weaknesses of the current system, and will therefore resubmit an improved version to parliament that would limit exemptions, include major services in the tax base, and include wholesalers and retailers with sales above the threshold from the start. We will make every effort to have such a law approved by mid-2001. Since the law will be complemented by a major reform of tax administration (see below), we believe that the law will gradually attract greater public support and understanding of its rationale. This will allow the authorities over time to work with parliament to achieve a reduction in exemptions. On the tax administration side, the focus in the coming months will be on supporting measures, including making the large taxpayer unit fully operational, to ensure that the GST will be successfully introduced in late 2001. The first step has been appointing the management of the LTU headquarters and the regional offices in Sana’a and Aden. Full staffing of these offices and transfer of all large taxpayer files (for the tax on consumption, production, and services; the employee withholding tax; and the income tax) into the LTU Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-67 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I 7 and of small taxpayer files out of the LTU will be completed in March 2001. In the area of income tax reform, we will shortly introduce self-assessment by large taxpayers and have initiated work on a comprehensive overhaul of the income tax system, with a focus on rationalizing exemption, aligning the top personal and corporate tax rates, and establishing modem collection procedures and administration. A draft reformed Income Tax Law should be ready for cabinet consideration in mid-200 1. Finally, we will accelerate ongoing efforts to modemize customs administration, through (a) implementation of ASYCUDA at two main points of entry; (b) restructuring of staff towards a leaner and more competent customs service; and (c) reinforcing our anti-smuggling campaign through better clarification of the respective role of customs and military at the borders, and seizures of smuggled goods as well as publication of any successful operations in this area. 15. The government remains committed to phase in market-based pricing for domestic petroleum products. In particular, it recognizes that the heavy subsidization of diesel (currently sold at a quarter of world prices) encourages excessive water pumping especially for qat production; contributes to a weakening of the electricity company as high end customers acquire their own diesel-generators; and stimulates smuggling to neighboring countries. However, in light of the sociopolitical sensitivity of this subsidy-specially in rural areas now aggravated by the drought in 2OOO-only a gradual move towards world prices are feasible. As a first step, parliament approved a tax of 5 percent on diesel and gasoline, with the resulting resources earmarked for the road and agricultural fund; its implementation has been put on hold pending the planned local elections in February 2001. As a second step, the budget for 2001 as approved by parliament calls for an increase in the diesel retail price by YRls 4 per liter, to become effective by mid-2001. 16. The focus on the expenditure side is to provide the expenditure mix required for growth and poverty reduction. Expenditure policy in 2000 was constrained by legislation passed by parliament in 1998 mandating large wage increases during 1998-2000 for education and health workers, as well as university teachers. The wage bill for 2000 incorporated the last of these mandated increases as well as a cost of living increase of 10 percent for other civil service staff and 40 percent for military staff (both of which became effective in mid-2000). The 2001 budget as approved by parliament limits the total wage bill for the civil service to YRls 118 billion; this amount reflects additional recruitment of 9,000 staff in the health and education sectors and a planned cost-of-living increase (of 12.5 percent on average) that will be implemented only after the budgeted diesel price adjustment has become effective. Total military expenditure is budgeted at YRls 81.5 billion; expenditure on materials and services, operations and maintenance, and other current expenditure and transfers (excluding petroleum product subsidies and interest payments) limited to YRls 114 billion; and total development expenditure (including foreign financed) limited to YRls 90 billion. The financial program for 2001 is consistent with these budgeted expenditures, but will contain the wage bill at YRls 115 billion, including through further retirement of over-age staff and referral to the CSF. 17. With the establishment of a reliable database and management tools the time has come to start civil service reform in earnest, aided by financial and technical assistance from Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank. The government will shortly decide on a blueprint for the future structure of government, involving the merger and consolidation of various ministries and agencies while streamlining and clarifying lines of responsibility. Concomitantly, we will accelerate work on the restructuring of the pilot ministries under the Civil Service Reform Project, and transfer identified redundant labor to the CSF. The CSF will seek to buy-in workers above a certain age into the pension fund; will support the reinsertion of others into the private sector through training, severance pay, or other procedures; and will start receiving workers from early 2001. 18. To prepare for the retirement of all identified over-age civil servants the minimum pension for new retirees was increased in late 1999 to YRls 7,000 per month to ensure pensions are above the poverty line, changed the basis for computing pension benefits and contributions to the full actual wage (rather than the much lower base salary), and at the same time streamlined retirement procedures and initiated the actual transfer of civil servants to the pension authority. Pending the effectiveness of fundamental pension reform (see below) and given the comfortable financial situation of the pension fund expected for the next years, transfers from the budget to the pension fund will be strictly limited to the government’s share in pension contributions for its employees, together with withheld employees’ contributions; no transfers aimed to compensate for cost-of-living adjustments to pension, or for differences between the contributions and the benefits of retirees, will be paid. 19. The government is, however, aware that the recent change in benefits has created large future pension liabilities, calling for a drastic overhaul of the system to ensure its sustainability. The pension reform committee is pursuing a number of actuarial simulations of possible parametric adjustments in benefits and contributions, and on this basis a draft reformed Public Pension Law will be submitted to cabinet in the coming months. It will provide for stronger links between benefits and contributions, clear circumscription of survivor benefits, and medium-term financial viability. Similar reforms of the public pension systems for the military and security personnel, as well as for the private pension fund will be submitted to cabinet in early 2001. 20. As an important element of the ongoing budget management reform, an economic and financial studies unit has been created at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to forecast and monitor budget revenue and expenditure, which should considerably improve our ability to monitor public finances. The first budget analysis of 1999 developments was prepared in June 2000, and a financial report on the first quarter 2000 and revised projection of the budget outlook for the remainder of 2000 was issued in July, following the recent adaptation of the current central bank accounting software to provide monthly budget data based on Government Finance Statistics Yearbook classification. Monetary and exchange rate policy and financial sector reform 21. We will pursue a prudent monetary policy, with reserve money as the nominal anchor for the economy. For 2001, based on the observed broadly stable relationship between broad money and non-oil GDP, M2 growth is targeted at about 11 percent, taking into account the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 69 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I seasonal effects associated with the Ramadan holidays. Considerable credit repayment by the government to the central bank would allow credit to the private sector to grow by about 30 percent (from a very low base). Given the recent flare-up in inflation and ensuing pressure on the exchange rate, the authorities fully recognize that monetary policy needs to be tightened in the coming months. We will continue to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime and to limit, more narrowly than in the past, intervention in the foreign exchange market to smooth volatility. Liquidity management by the central bank will be aided by the recent successful introduction of repurchase agreements and the planned development of certificates of deposit. The MOF will closely coordinate its policy on treasury bills with this process. This will eventually create the conditions for the central bank to allow banks to set interest rates on savings deposits free of any restrictions. Following the introduction of weekly forecasts of the CBY’s balance sheet, coordination between the CBY and the MOF on public debt management and monetary operations is expected to improve further with the creation of the macroeconomic monitoring unit at the MOF. We are also preparing for shifting the public treasury functions fi-om the central bank to the MOF. 22. With modem supervision regulations now largely in place and the recent promulgation of the central bank law, the CBY’s supervisory role has been clarified and strengthened. However, compliance with the required level of capitalization and provisioning needs to be enforced more forcefully. In particular, the difficulties encountered in enforcing the banking law in certain cases has revealed fundamental weaknesses in enforcement provisions. Amendments to this law giving the CBY greater powers to enforce compliance on banks and bank board members will be promulgated by March 200 1. The recently adopted supervisory strategy for each bank based upon the CBY’s risk-rating will be fully implemented. We expect to issue an international public offer for the sale of the NBY and complete its privatization in the coming months; restructuring of the other four state banks will follow the action plan prepared in consultation with the World Bank and endorsed by the cabinet in 1999. We expect that YBRD will soon become compliant with basic prudential regulation, and will continue to work towards the resolution of a major non-performing loan owed by private debtors, as a clear signal that the judicial system is able to ensure collection of overdue bank credit even from infhrential debtors. YBRD also plans to launch its planned personnel reduction of 34 percent from end-l 999 levels over the coming months, and the government will prepare a strategy for the privatization of YBRD during 2001. 23. Reform of the commercial courts is another priority in building a financial sector supportive of private sector growth. Beyond recent steps to publish judgments rendered and the underlying reasoning for supreme court judgments, and in the near future for selected lower court cases and all appeal court rulings, we will continue to implement the action plan elaborated in 1999 involving improvement in court administration, training of judges, and better equipment including computerization. We have also recently stepped up efforts to investigate judges accused of corruption and to put on trial confirmed cases, and to establish and train a specialized police that will enforce court judgments.

The privatization of small- and medium-sized public enterprises, as well as of large enterprises such as the Aden refinery, has received a new push following the promulgation of the privatization law and the recent appointment of a High Commission to steer the privatization process. The authorities aim to complete the privatization or liquidation of 3 1 small- and medium-sized enterprises in the coming months, in the context of a World Bank-supported project. In addition, we have itemized a list of enterprises to be privatized in the near future and a list of public sector enterprises and entities, which would continue to receive current or capital transfers in 2000-01. The authorities are working also to allow quarterly balance sheets from all financially important or transfer-receiving public enterprises to be provided in a uniform accounting system to the MOF. 25. The government will intensify consultation with the private sector to set up a more efficient and private-sector friendly bureaucracy, including during the preparation of the Five-Year Plan and the PRS. In this context, we will keep under close review the experience with the Aden Free Trade Zone to derive further ideas for a model for a modem legal, regulatory, and judicial framework for investment. As detailed above, the authorities are in the process of liberalizing the transportation system and breaking up the domestic trucking cartel through a comprehensive reform, in close consultation with the World Bank, of the regulatory and institutional underpinning of the trucking sector. In particular, the government will fully apply a 1998 decree liberalizing entry into the shipping sector for all firms meeting well-specified criteria to the ship-agency business in the Aden port, and the reformed Land Transport Law is expected to be approved by parliament in the coming months. External sector 26. Under the envisaged macroeconomic adjustment and the expected progress of the structural reform program, a substantial increase in imports of both investment and consumer goods is expected. Thus, despite some pick-up in tourism inflows, the external current account surplus would decline to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2001. 27. Expected disbursements from the World Bank in 2001 will decline with the completion of major policy-related operations. After the World Bank Board approved in late November 1999 a US$l5 million grant under the International Development Association facility for a buyback offer to be made to commercial creditors, a first set of creditors accepted the offer in April 2000, and about US$355 million of debt was bought back with US$8.8 million. A second offer to most of the remaining creditors at similar terms closed in October 2000, buying back another US$15 million face value of debt. The authorities concur with the debt sustainability analysis recently completed with the help of Bank and Fund staff, and which indicates that after the full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms Yemen’s debt is sustainable, and that therefore Yemen will not be eligible for special assistance under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The external debt management software, the Debt Monitoring Financial Assistance System, has recently been installed at the central bank and is being extended to the Ministries of Finance and Planning; staff in these Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-71- ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I institutions has been trained and we aim at completing in early 2001 the input of all necessary data and will ensure that Yemeni officials are fully trained to prepare consolidated reports. The authorities have in early 2000 signed the bilateral agreement with Russia implementing the 1997 Paris Club Agreed Minute, and continue discussions with France on concluding the last outstanding bilateral agreement. We will request from Paris Club creditors release of the third tranche flow rescheduling under the 1997 Agreed Minute and seek comparable relief from non-Paris Club creditors. Over the medium term, the expected decline in oil production will lead to a weakening of the external balances despite growing diversification into non-oil exports. Nonetheless, import reserve cover should remain relatively high well beyond 2001. Governance, technical assistance, and statistical issues 28. The proposed program would aim to improve governance in key areas. In particular, the various tax reforms would reduce scope for corruption; the banking sector reform will curtail lending to insiders; and we expect that judicial reforms will strengthen confidence in the rule of law. The publication of import rules will enhance transparency and eliminate advantages for the well connected. The program also aims at greater transparency through better and published statistics and greater participation of social partners as well as the planned preparation of the PRS. To improve public reception of the adjustment program supported under the PRGF/EFF, the authorities agreed to publish the IPRSP through the Fund’s website. 29. A new three-year UNDP/IMFLDFID technical assistance program has been approved by all concerned parties and will broadly maintain technical assistance in the areas of fiscal, monetary, financial, and external sector policy reform, while adding new emphasis on improving the provision of statistics for economic policy-making. In particular, the authorities will take action, including the provision of sufficient resources, to ensure that agreed work plans to improve price statistics along STA advice will be carried out, and are addressing deficiencies in coordination among government agencies involved in compiling statistics. In the area of data provision, we recognize that drastic improvements are needed on the provision of fiscal data and will ensure that Fund staff is provided aggregated monthly budget execution data with a maximum delay of one month; quarterly data on oil-related payments between YPC, the refineries, PEC, Yemenia, and the government; and quarterly accounts of the public pension fund. Program monitoring and review 30. The measures that the Yemeni government intends to implement prior to IMF Executive Board consideration of the fourth review under the extended arrangement and the request for the third annual PRGF arrangement are surnmarized in Annex II. Implementation of the structural reform program will be monitored through a set of structural performance criteria and structural benchmarks, also listed in Annex II. Implementation of the financial program will be monitored by a set of quantitative performance criteria for end-February 2001, end-May 2001, and end-August 2001 as set out in Annexes III-IV, with ceilings on net Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - ATTACHMENT I ANNEX I domestic assets and net credit to the public sector now set on corresponding central bank aggregates to allow better monitoring and closer policy guidance. An overall ceiling on net domestic financing of the central government will also apply. Specifically, the following quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-February 200 1, end-May 200 1, and end-August 200 1 will apply: (a) a ceiling on net domestic assets of the central bank; (b) a ceiling on central bank claims on the public sector; (c) a ceiling on total net domestic financing of the central government; (d) a floor on NIR of the central bank; (e) a ceiling and sub-ceiling for the contracting or guaranteeing by the government of new nonconcessional medium- and long-term debt; (f) a ceiling on the net disbursements of short- term debt to the government; and (g) the nonaccumulation of any new external payment arrears on a continuous basis. For the purpose of this latter performance criterion, external debt-service obligations on debt contracted before January 1, 1993 with bilateral non-Paris Club creditors, and for which rescheduling on terms consistent with the 1997 Paris Club rescheduling has been requested, as well as debt to the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries the legal status of which remains under discussion, will be excluded. Quarterly indicative targets have been established for reserve money. The government places great importance on maintaining a liberal exchange and trade system, and will not impose restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, introduce multiple currency practices, conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, or impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. 31. The government will continue to consult periodically with the Fund, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations, about the progress made in the implementation of the program, and about any policy adaptations considered appropriate for achievement of the program’s objectives. We have agreed to move to a system of quarterly reviews. Progress with program implementation will next be assessed on the occasion of the fifth review under the extended arrangement and the first review under the third annual PRGF arrangement, to be concluded no later than May 20,200l. These reviews will examine progress in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform and will focus on tax reform and pension reform issues. 32. The government of the Republic of Yemen believes that the policies described above are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program. It intends to remain in close consultation with the IMF and provide the IMF with any information requested for monitoring economic developments and implementation of policies under the program. The government stands ready to take any further measures, in consultation with IMF staff, that might be necessary to ensure the overall objectives of the program are achieved.

Due to recognized shortcomings in most data, particularly outside the oil sector, a broad effort is in place to improve data compilation with technical assistance from the Fund and other donors. Nonetheless, improvements are not likely to be seen for at least another year or more. The most consistently reliable and generally timely data are those on the monetary sector produced by the central bank, which provide the foundation for the estimation of the other macroeconomic data. Central bank reserves data are now provided to the Fund on a weekly basis with less than one week lag. However, the recent STA multisector mission that visited Yemen during the period of August 7-22, 2000, identified a number of deficiencies such as: (a) treatment of repurchase agreements; (b) recording of nonstandard loans; (c) lack of precision in the identification of a counterpart for a number of accounts; and (d) combining positions on several instruments in one account. The mission also has recommended solutions to correct these problems. 2. National accounts data, produced on an annual basis both by economic activity and expenditure category, remain unreliable because of poor data sources and inadequate organization of the statistical system. There are also uncertainties regarding the monthly consumer price index because of unreliable data collection procedures and lack of supervision of price collectors. STA is currently working with the Central Statistics Office to upgrade the national accounts and price data. 3. In the fiscal accounts, data reliability is uncertain and timeliness is weak, particularly for detailed expenditure items. There are also discrepancies between reported budget data and the below-the-line financing data obtained from the monetary statistics. Many of these shortcomings are being addressed under I&IF/United Nations Development Program (UNDP) long-term technical assistance on both tax reform and budget management, which began in 1998. Since the beginning of 2000, fiscal data have been prepared according to Government Finance Statistics Yearbook classifications and monthly reports are available on the subchapter level. Further progress, particularly regarding more detailed expenditure data, should be achieved with the computerization of budgetary accounts that began in 2000. Despite this progress, no quarterly or monthly government finance data are reported to the Fund for publication in International Finance Statistics. 4. The compiling institution for balance of payments statistics is the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY), which carries out (a) the collection of initial data, (b) the implementation of the proper methodology, and (c) the dissemination of balance of payments data and more recently the international investment position statement in the framework of the Balance of - Payments Manual, fifth edition. As there is yet no legislation conferring to the CBY the authority to compile official balance of payments statistics, the tasks are performed on a part time and ad hoc basis, mostly relying on survey-based questionnaires whose response rate appears quite weak. Besides, the poor quality of the balance of payments statistics appears to be related to a lack of adequate staffing, adequate documented sources and methods, and noncommensurate financial and physical resources dedicated to the balance of payments compilation requirements. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 80 - APPENDIX I ANNEX II 5. A long-term resident advisor for balance of payments statistics was assigned in Sana’a from February 1998 till February 2000 as a result of an IMFAJNDP program. In his report, the resident advisor highlighted the inherent weaknesses and shortcomings in the Yemeni balance of payments compilation system and suggested an action plan for the improvement of the data. The authorities have already started implementing the recommendations. As a result, the balance of payments division was able to utilize data received from various sources for compiling balance of payments and international investment position statements for the years 1997 through 1999. The preparation of quarterly statements is also being currently undertaken by the CBY. The identified problems are the weak coverage of the oil industry transactions-in particular, for the reprocessing of imported crude oil-and the deficient reporting of foreign direct investment abroad. While official capital flows are deemed correctly reported, the transactions of foreign exchange accounts of resident commercial banks and private capital flows are still inadequately covered. 6. A STA multisector mission visited Yemen during August 7-22,200O in order to take stock of the implemented recommendations and to assess any further need to support Yemeni reforrrs in the field of balance of payments statistics, which will be addressed through the appointment of an IMFAJNDP resident advisor for a six-month period.

As of November 15,2000, the International Development Association (IDA) had approved 124 credits to Yemen for a total of US$1,716.9 million (net of cancellations). Of these credits, 102 have been closed, including two cancelled and two which were supplements to other credits; 22 are now under implementation. Cumulative IDA commitments for ongoing operations stand at US$665.2 million (net of cancellations), of which US$426.7 million remains undisbursed. The major part of the credits was for the agricultural sector (about one-quarter of all lending) and human resources (about one-fifth). IDA has approved credits for adjustment operations in FY 1996 (Economic Recovery), FY 1998 (Financial Sector Adjustment), and FY 1999 (Public Sector Management Adjustment). With the advance of the government’s reform program, IDA commitments grew from zero in FY 1995 to US$l81.5 million for five credits in FY 1999. Commitments in FY 2000 totaled US$159.9 million for five operations, including a Commercial Debt Reduction Facility grant of US$15.1 million. Commitments in FY 2001 will total US$143.3 million for five operations, including Basic Education Expansion (USS56.0 million), Irrigation Improvement (US$21.3 million), Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (US$20.0 million), Rural Access Improvement ($20.0 million), and Taiz Municipal Development and Flood Protection (US$25.0 million). 3 a. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has made investments totaling US$23.7 million (gross commitments). After a long hiatus, IFC has approved two projects since FY 1997 for a total of US$15.8 million. 3. In the early 198Os, political and economic developments and administrative weaknesses combined to create serious problems in IDA’s credit portfolio performance. In mid-l 995, IDA and the government reached a comprehensive agreement on restructuring of the portfolio and actions to address generic and project-specific implementation problems. Since then, and with the intervention of the new Resident Mission, performance has improved greatly. A second portfolio review in 1996 addressed remaining bottlenecks to implementation and led to an agreement to restructure all implementation units for IDA- financed projects. A third portfolio review in December 1998 addressed issues of implementation units, interministerial implementation roles, and a mix of factors still retarding project implementation. The disbursement rate on projects in FY 2000 was 32 percent. 4. IDA presented a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to its Board in May 1999 covering the period FY 2000-FY 2002. Based on extensive consultations with a wide range of Yemenis and external financiers, its four objectives are: (a) good public sector management (including budgeting, expenditure, revenue, and civil service reforms); (b) active and diversified productive private investment (including privatization, Aden Free ’ Prepared by World Bank staff.

Overall commitments during the CAS period are expected to reach US$530-580 million, depending on progress particularly in public management reform, and assuming the Fund program remains on track and portfolio performance remains good. Prospects for new IFC investments have improved, and IFC is considering investments in the financial sector (a leasing company) and agriculture, inter alia, which would test and accelerate on-the-ground implementation of investment-oriented reforms supported by IDA. 5. IDA is also assisting the government through an active program of technical assistance and economic and sector work. This included a broad Public Expenditure Review in FY 1999-2000; update on budget and expenditure management in FY 2001; and strategy notes in FY 1999 for fisheries, irrigation, animal resources, education, health, and rural access. Nonlending support in FY 2000 included: (a) a Comprehensive Development Review, cataloguing the latest sectoral and macro data and analysis including policy priorities; (b) rationalization of higher education; and (c) a strategy to deal with the problem of qat. In FY 2001, IDA is supporting the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy formulation; assisting with assessment of decentralization priorities under the new Local Authority Law, and producing notes on urban management and financial sector reform.

The first phase was from 1995-97 with total UNDP financing of US$l.4 million, followed by a second phase (extended through mid- 2000) with a total funding of US$5 million, including cost-sharing contributions from the government of Yemen as well as from the United Kingdom for an ASYCUDA component. The IMF’s parallel financing of TA totaled US$700,000 under the first phase and is expected to total over US$l million in the second phase. Fiscal sector reform Jn the tax reform area, technical assistance centered on tax policy and customs administration, including periodic assistance on tariff, excise tax, and personal income tax reform. Assistance has been provided through a long-term expert (LTE) in customs administration (1997-99), a short-term expert (STE) on tax identification numbers (short- term visits in 1997 and 1998), one LTE on direct tax administration, and another LTE on general sales tax (both since March 1998). With this assistance, the authorities implemented reforms, including: harmonizing excise tax rates; expanding the tax base; moving to ad valorem excise taxation; unifying corporate profits tax; and advancing preparations for the personal income tax reform and introduction of the General Sales Tax (GST). In customs reform, modem management techniques have been introduced at key entry points, but unabated smuggling and perceived rent-seeking continue to deflate potential customs revenue intake. A reorganization of the customs department has begun, and customs clearance operations have been modemized for Yemen’s major sea and airports along with computerization (ASYCUDA). In the area of public expenditure management, several Fund TA missions since August 1996 provided the basis for reform of budget formulation, management, and control procedures carried out with the assistance of two LTEs (March 1998 to March 1999) and later a single LTE (from March 1999). However, a modem budget management process is not yet in place that would facilitate expenditure prioritization. In pension reform, TA missions in 1996 provided the basis for reform and spurred initial drafts of a new pension law. Recent assistance on actuarial analysis of various reform options is expected to allow fmalization of a new draft law to ensure that the pension system will be viable over the long term with a fair and equitable benefit structure. External sector policy management Improvements in balance of payments statistics have been achieved with assistance from a LTE in place since February 1998 and from other periodic Fund TA missions. However, several components of the balance are still estimated through ad hoc methods rather than based on sampling and survey data, and local capacity remains underdeveloped. External Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 85 - APPENDIX III debt management has been enhanced significantly with the assistance of a LTE since July 1997, assisting in the preparation of data for Paris Club agreements and more recently the introduction of the computerized Debt Monitoring Financial Assistance System (DMFAS). A Fund TA mission in May 1999 provided guidance in foreign reserve management. Monetary and financial sector reform Aided by TA, progress has been made in implementing monetary policy reforms, including: (a) a LTE in monetary policy (November 1997-February 1998), (b) support by computerization of the CBY accounting system (LTE, November 1995-January 1998); and (c) assistance in modemizing the underlying legal structure. A reformed banking law prepared with assistance from the World Bank was enacted in December 1998, and a new Central Banking Law prepared with Fund staff assistance was enacted in June 2000. In the area of banking supervision, an upgrading of prudential supervision began with a bank supervision LTE from May 1997. New bank supervision rules and regulations have been introduced, but there remains a large need to train CBY staff on how to enforce the rules and commercial bank staff on how to comply with the rules. A major restructuring of public sector banks was launched in 1999 and benefits from TA under a World Bank project. Production of statistics for economic policymaking Several STA missions during 1996-2000 assisted in revising and updating key economic data, including the national accounts and price statistics. In addition, the government of the Netherlands is financing a comprehensive program of TA for the Central Statistical Office with an emphasis on improving compilation of social indicators. However, economic decision makers continue to operate without a reliable and timely set of basic economic data, and meaningful public debate about policy options remains difficult without better access to basic statistics. A multitopic mission in August 2000 provided a comprehensive diagnosis of weaknesses in most areas and proposed specific work plans to address such weaknesses. The TCAP for 2000-02 The experience to date has underscored the importance of public understanding and support of the reform program in moving reforms forward. In the context of a participatory approach to develop a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy, efforts will have to be doubled to improve understanding within the general public, the parliament, and the civil service of the need for the agreed reforms to underpin Yemen’s socioeconomic objectives and growth - prospects. In that light, the new three-year TCAP will focus on improving transparency, governance, and the efficiency of public spending. It will also intensify development of implementation capacity at the economic and financial government agencies, with an enhanced emphasis on training and skill transfer, along with a requirement that trainees demonstrate they have gained new knowledge, skills, and abilities. The World Bank is addressing complementary aspects of this agenda through its ongoing projects in (a) civil service and public sector management reform, (b) education and health sectors, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 86 - APPENDIX 111 (c)judicial reform under a proposed UNDP-financed program for Enhancement of Accountability, Transparency, and Rule of Law. A new TCAP for 2000-2002 was been launched in late 2000. While it continues to focus on the traditional area of Fund expertise, additional emphasis will be placed on statistics and on training and equipment. The Fund executed program will be financed by the United Kingdom (US$ - million), UNDP (US$- million), and the Fund (US$- million). 1. Fiscal Sector Reform This subprogram would improve capacity, transparency, and governance in the areas of: public expenditure (budget) management; tax and customs administration; pension fund administration; and social safety net management. 2. External Sector Policy Management This subprogram would improve capacity to monitor, manage, and prioritize policy decision making in the external sector, particularly with regard to external debt and through improved balance of payments statistics. 3. Monetan, and Financial Sector Reform This subprogram addresses the need for capacity improvement in four areas, each of which are key for titure economic development: monetary policy operations; management of international reserves; banking supervision; and restructuring public sector banks. 4. Production of Statistics for Economic Policymaking Finally, this subprogram will strengthen the government’s capacity to collect, compile, analyze, and disseminate broad economic statistics through reform of the statistical institutional framework. It is anticipated that this subprogram would enhance: (a) economic policy decision making; (b) transparency; and (c) the scope for building broader consensus through wider participation in policy debates. Resources for training and equipment The United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) will address the need to build institutional and human capacity by providing resources for training and equipment across all four areas. Management of the TCAP The TCAP will be executed by the government with the Ministry of Finance as the Government Executing Agency, with the assistance of the IMF as the United Nations Implementing Agency, and DFID as a bilateral partner providing both parallel and direct Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 87 - APPENDIX III cost-sharing contributions. The program will be managed on a day-to-day basis by a National Program Director or Coordinator who will be a senior government official appointed by the Ministry of Finance. Interministerial coordination of the program will be carried out by a Government Steering Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Finance. Monitoring, evaluation, and review The program will be subject to joint half-yearly reviews by representatives of the government; UNDP; the IMF; DFID; and, as appropriate, other donors. The reviews will evaluate progress against the objectives and monitoring indicators (below) and adapt the program as appropriate.

Macroeconomic balances improved dramatically in 1999-2000 as a result of higher oil prices, the maintenance of high interest rates and expenditure restraint. Average annual inflation was brought down to 8 percent in 1999 and reserves rebuilt by more to the equivalent of six months of imports by end-1999. The buildup of reserves continued in 2000, to more than ten months of imports by end-2000. However, average annual inflation rate rose to 10.7 percent. Real economic growth in 1999 was below target at an estimated 3.8 percent, reflecting: (a) a lower-than-expected increase in crude oil extraction; (b) drought in the first-half of the year; (c) a decline in tourism; and r Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and - financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Although spring rains failed again in early 2000, growth for the year is estimated at 6.5 percent due to high oil production and a recovery in agriculture after good summer rains. Long term growth prospects have received a boost from the agreement reached in June between Saudi Arabia and Yemen on the settlement of long-standing border issues; in particular, this could help opening the door to a better integration of Yemen into the regional economy. 2. A dramatic improvement in public finances driven by high oil export revenue was key to the strong macrofinancial performance in 1999 and 2000. On a commitment basis, excluding grants, the 1999 fiscal deficit is estimated at 1.2 percent of GDP, compared with a 6.7 percent deficit in 1998. Non-oil revenues performed broadly as expected, although some categories of indirect taxes such as customs revenue fell short of expectations. Overall spending restraint in 1999 succeeded in keeping expenditure growth below the growth of GDP. Domestic oil revenue (net of cash subsidies) improved over 1998, despite continued substitution toward diesel, the most heavily subsidized product. Available data for 2000 indicate that expenditure growth remains broadly in line with GDP except for a surge in petroleum subsidies, especially diesel. This will be more than offset by increased oil revenue, and the budget is expected to show a surplus in the order of 9 percent of GDP for the year 2000. 3. While in response to mounting exchange market pressures the Central Bank of _ Yemen (CBY) had raised interest rates to 20 percent in early 1999, the turnaround in financial balances allowed the CBY in late 1999 to initiate a gradual lowering of the benchmark interest rate on deposits, to 13 percent in July 2000. The improved external position helped stabilize the exchange rate at about YRls 160 per U.S. dollar since Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publica - 93 - mid-l 999, following a 13 percent depreciation in the first-half of 1999. Broad money growth has steadily accelerated since late 1999, to 25 percent in the year to December 2000, reflecting mainly the sharp expansion in net foreign assets of the central bank in the second half of the year which more than offset repayments of government credit to the banking system. At the same time, high interest rates and probably a better enforcement of prudential rules depressed private credit growth to 15 percent in 1999, while the monetary easing in 2000 helped spark a recovery to 21 percent in 2000. 4. Progress on the structural front slowed in 1999, albeit a number of important structural steps were taken: the privatization law was promulgated; cabinet approved time-bound action plans agreed with the World Bank for the restructuring of the three public sector specialized banks and two public sector commercial banks; and steps to improve the functioning of the commercial courts were initiated. Measures in 2000 included an adjustment of domestic fuel oil prices to close to world market levels, increased electricity charges to better cover cost, the promulgation of the reformed Central Bank Law, retirement of several thousand over-age civil servants, elimination of general import bans maintained for economic reasons, and the way was cleared for the privatization of a number of state enterprises. In early 2001 parliament approved a value added tax law with a single rate of 10 percent, to be applied to imports, domestic production, as well as major services; coverage of the wholesale and retail sectors will be phased in later. 5. The government has prepared an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) and has launched preparation of a full-fledged PRS in the context of elaborating the next Five-Year Plan (2001-2005). As proposed in the IPRSP, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 94 - poverty reduction strategy will focus mainly on promoting private investment to achieve higher growth, while strengthening the efficiency of public expenditure in delivering basic social services and providing infrastructure needed to allow the poor to participate in, and contribute to, economic growth. The government’s macroeconomic objectives for 2001 are to achieve an increase in non-oil growth to about 4 percent through higher public and private investment, containing inflation to an average annual rate of 9 percent, and to use the oil windfall gain for achieving a small external current account surplus in order to build a cushion for the future. As to the macroeconomic policy mix, fiscal policy will aim to contain the non-oil deficit to 13.5 percent of GDP, while within a flexible exchange rate system reserve money targeting will provide a nominal anchor. Structural reforms for 2000-2001 will focus on further tax reform, including introduction of a value added tax, civil service reform, restructuring of public financial institutions, and other reforms of the regulatory framework to improve the environment for private investment, growth, and job creation.
