BACKGROUND 1. Papua New Guinea’s economic performance in 1997-98 was adversely affected by drought, poor terms of trade, relaxation of fiscal and monetary policies, and widespread governance problems. Real GDP declined in 1997 as drought cut agricultural production and forced the temporary closure of the largest copper mine. Depressed export earnings in 1998 in the wake of the Asian crisis contributed to negative real GDP growth again, as well as lower tax revenue, a larger budget deficit, and increased domestic bank financing of the government. There were also increased concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in the public sector. As investor confidence deteriorated, private capital outflows intensified, the kina depreciated, and offtcial international reserves fell sharply. 2. The government of Prime Minister Morauta that took office in July 1999 adopted policies aimed at stabilizing the economy and fostering private sector-led growth through structural reforms. This strategy was largely successful in overcoming the serious macroeconomic crisis that had emerged under the previous government, although real GDP declined further during 2000-O 1. The pace of structural reform was slower-than- originally envisaged, partly because of military opposition to downsizing and student demonstrations that ended in the loss of four lives in the first half of 2001, but the major targets were broadly achieved by end-200 1. 3. The government’s program received strong financial assistance from the Fund, other multilateral agencies, and bilateral donors. The Fund’s Executive Board approved a 14-month stand-by arrangement (SBA) on March 29, 2000 in an amount of SDR 85.5 million (65 percent of quota), that was extended for four months through September 2001; it was fully drawn. The World Bank approved in June 2000 a Governance Promotion Adjustment Loan for $90 million, to support privatization and public sector reform, that has been Molly disbursed. The Bank also approved in December 2001 a $34 million program to support forestry management and conservation. The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved in December 2001 a Public Sector Program Loan for $70 million, to support policy and institutional strengthening of the public sector, of which $35 million has been released, Australia, Japan, and other donors have provided extensive financial aid. 4. At the conclusion of the fourth and last review under the SBA in September 2001, the Executive Board welcomed progress in stabilization and reform. Directors indicated that the reduction in inflation was encouraging, but urged readiness to take monetary action to ensure achievement of the program’s price objectives. Directors stressed the importance of prudence in the execution of the budget to avoid cash flow difftculties, in the context of tax revenue shortfalls and delays in external financing. Directors noted that perseverance in program implementation would strengthen confidence and facilitate timely and adequate external assistance. Directors reiterated that continued Fund involvement was desirable and could help catalyze the external resources needed to support economic diversification and growth. At the time of the fourth review, the authorities did not seek a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- successor Fund arrangement, while recognizing that the successful culmination of the SBA constituted a beneficial signal of the soundness of economic management. II. DEVELOPMENTS IN 2001 5. Real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 3.4 percent in 2001, a larger decline than initially expected under the stand-by arrangement (Table 1 and Figure 1). Oil production fell by 16 percent reflecting the long-anticipated depletion of reserves; gold output also dropped. Nonmineral activities contracted, particularly in the manufacturing, construction, and retail and wholesale trade sectors. Coffee production, the main cash activity for the highlands (where 40 percent of the population lives), was greatly affected by low international prices, deteriorating infrastructure, and the breakdown of law and order. 6. The rate of inflation was 10.3 percent in the year to December 2001, virtually unchanged from that recorded in the year to December 2000. The inflation rate, which had peaked at 21.9 percent in the year to June 2000, declined progressively to 7.8 percent in the year to June 2001, primarily reflecting the tighter macroeconomic policy stance under the stand-by program. The flow-through effects of the depreciation of the kina contributed to higher rates of price increase during mid-200 1. However, the increase in the December quarter of 2001 was smaller than expected, despite continued exchange rate depreciation, because of unanticipated falls in food prices. 7. The fiscal deficit is estimated at 3.5 percent of GDP in 2001, nearly 1 percentage point higher than expected at the time of the fourth SBA review (Tables 2 and 3). Tax revenue was broadly in line with expectations. During the first three quarters of the year, expenditure was well below budget, as a result of restraint in the issue of expenditure warrants and slows implementation of the large Rural Development Program. However, spending rose in the last quarter of the year mainly for wages and salaries, as the hiring freeze was not fully effective, and for development projects in expectation of the receipt of long delayed external assistance. Aid disbursements in December enabled the deficit to be largely financed from external concessional sources, although domestic financing of the budget amounted to almost 1 percent of GDP during 2001. 8. During 2001, the declining rate of inflation prompted the authorities to change their view on the balance of economic risks, leading to a gradual easing of monetary policy to help reverse the deepening recession (Box 1). This view also took into account cuts in interest rates in partner countries. The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate several times. Against a backdrop of net purchases of open market securities by the central bank, interest rates on treasury bills declined across all maturities, with commercial banks also reducing their lending and deposit rates. However, the relaxation of monetary policy failed to stimulate an economic recovery; bank credit to the private sector contracted in real terms during the year because of a lack of demand in part due to businesses’ appraisals of risks associated with the upcoming election (Table 4). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- 9. The external current account surplus narrowed to about 3 percent of GDP in 2001 (Table 5). Export earnings declined sharply owing to lower volumes and prices for minerals (particularly oil), coffee, and logs. This more than offset the impact of contracting import demand related to weaker overall economic activity. However, on account of high external assistance, the overall balance remained in surplus, and gross international reserves rose to $433 million at end-year (5.4 months of nonmineral imports of goods and services). 10. The kina depreciated by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar and about 10 percent in real effective terms during 2001. The poor export performance and lower interest rates contributed to foreign exchange market pressure. In addition, the depreciation of the kina contributed to a further increase in the overall stock of public external debt to 5 1 percent of GDP at the end of 2001, compared with 27 percent at the end of 1997 (Table 6). This trend is the main point of concern in the indicators of external vulnerability in the case of Papua New Guinea (Table 7). The direct impact of the September 11 events has been small, as tourism earnings are minimal, and Papua New Guinea is not dependent on remittances, although lower commodity prices and the world recession have adversely affected the external accounts. 11. Some progress was made on structural reforms in 2001. As regards privatization, the main development was the long-awaited sale of Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation (PNGBC), when the government in December 2001 agreed to sell its controlling stake to the local Bank of South Pacific (BSP) for cash and equity. However, the public sector will still have substantial interest in the merged bank, which will be the largest bank in Papua New Guinea, mainly through the combined shareholdings of the state’s privatization commission and publicly-owned commercial enterprises and superannuation funds. 12. There was progress also in public sector administrative reforms. Functional reviews were completed for the Departments of Finance, Treasury, Prime Minister and National Executive Council, Personnel Management, and Foreign AfTairs, as well as for the National Fisheries Authority. Three overseas missions were closed in July 200 1, and contracts for a new financial accounting and management system and a new payroll and human resource management system were awarded in August 200 1. These actions facilitated the approval of an AsDB loan agreement and the release of the second tranche of the World Bank Government Promotion Adjustment Loan in December 200 1. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 13. The discussions focused on the policies needed to achieve the authorities’ macroeconomic objectives for 2002, which include a modest recovery in real GDP of 1.2 percent, a reduction in inflation to 5 percent by end-year, and safeguarding foreign reserves. The staff team took the position that these objectives were achievable, but would require a much smaller overall budget deficit than was in prospect and a less accommodative monetary policy, including some firming of interest rates. Tighter expenditure control would be required in the months surrounding the June 2002 general election and corrective revenue Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- and expenditure measures would have to be implemented following the formation of the newly elected government. 14. The authorities agreed that the overall external position would weaken in 2002, with the current account projected to record a deficit of 1 percent of GDP. The value of total exports is expected to remain about unchanged, with low prices and poor infrastructure for the transfer of goods to market limiting recovery for coffee, and oil and mineral exports projected to decline because of the depletion of resources. Nonmineral imports are expected to rise significantly on account of the Napa Napa oil refinery project (fully financed by private inflows). With substantially lower exceptional financing, the overall balance of payments is projected to record a deficit. The staff team stressed that tighter financial policies are essential to limit the deterioration in the external balance and halt the downward pressure on the kina. 15. The discussions included an extensive dialogue on a possible medium-term strategy to achieve higher real GDP growth, on a sustainable basis, in order to raise living standards and alleviate poverty. This would necessitate a marked upturn in private sector activity in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, in contrast to the weak performance of these sectors in recent years. The staff team was pleased to note that the authorities had embarked on the development of a medium-term economic strategy to be presented to the new government. The staff team stressed that strong adjustment efforts will need to be put in place to meet faster medium-term growth targets, especially because prospects for the oil and mineral sectors are less promising than for most periods since independence. A. Fiscal Policy 16. The staff team estimated that, in the absence of corrective measures, the overall budget deficit could reach about 6 percent of GDP in 2002, well above the historical average and much higher than budgeted. The previous mission had already been informed that the budget deficit could increase substantially in the first half of 2002 and, since that time, the underlying fiscal position has weakened. The authorities’ current revenue estimates appear overly optimistic, given that WE0 projections of world oil prices still remain about $2 per barrel below the budget forecast, despite their upturn in recent months. Wage and salary costs at present are above the budget mainly because of additional unplanned recruitment by the national and provincial governments. Substantial unbudgeted spending also is being incurred on road bridges, that are unlikely to produce much value added in improving the country’s poor transportation infrastructure. These bridges were financed nontransparently through a nonconcessional external commercial bank loan (amounting to about $55 million to be spent over the next two years), which the staff team pointed out not only increases the deficit but also adds to the already high public debt burden. Preliminary data indicate that overall spending approvals were high in the first quarter of 2002, which, combined with the financing of expenditures authorized in late 2001, led to a net domestic financing of around 3 percent of annual GDP in that quarter. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- 17. The staff team stated that slippages in fiscal policy must be offset and further slippage avoided to ensure the achievement of the government’s macroeconomic objectives. The authorities responded that stronger actions would be taken to enforce the public sector hiring freeze, implement speedily the planned retrenchment program for civil servants, limit the release of expenditure warrants, and strictly monitor the development budget in order to ensure that funds are only allocated to high priority areas. They indicated that the numerous programs under the development program that are run under various different guidelines are being streamlined to facilitate the latter process, In view of the poor condition of public infrastructure, the staff team agreed that maintenance, especially on roads, should be increased through a reordering of priorities in the spending program. 18. The authorities stated that revenue and expenditure measures would be introduced after the election, so that the overall budgetary deficit would be held to about 4 percent of GDP. The staff team estimated that this would require adjustment measures yielding the equivalent of about 2 percent of GDP, assuming that the proceeds received in April from the privatization of PNGBC and the holding company for the government’s equity share in mining and petroleum projects (Box 2) are fully used for financing the budget (equivalent to 2 percent of GDP). The authorities’ confirmed their intention to hold domestic bank financing of the budget in line with the monetary program (equivalent to 2.3 percent of GDP). However, they were not in a position to identify the precise actions that would be implemented in the second-half year to meet this target. 19. The staff observed that the deficit should ideally be held to a level consistent with the inflation target and that privatization proceeds should not be used for deficit financing. It would be particularly desirable in view of the sharp increase in public debt as a percent of GDP in recent years and the limited fall in the debt ratio projected over the medium term to use all privatization receipts to reduce debt. The staff team, however, acknowledged that, in present circumstances, to do so would necessitate excessive cuts in public services in 2002, given the depressed state of the economy and projected net repayment of external loans (0.5 percent of GDP). The team therefore took the position that the privatization proceeds from finalized arrangements (2 percent of GDP) might need to be used to finance the deficit in 2002, but that any additional privatization receipts received this year and beyond had to be used to reduce government debt. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 20. The authorities agreed with the staff team that monetary policy should remain focused on a reduction of inflation to achieve the government’s target for 2002. Monetary management in the first quarter of 2002 was complicated by a shortage of Treasury bills. The acceleration in public spending, financed in part by the foreign support received in late 200 1, led to large increases in liquidity. In an attempt to withdraw this, BPNG sold its remaining net stock of Treasury bills, but was unwilling to issue its own securities on a net basis. As a result, excess reserves of the banking system increased, Treasury bill yields fell sharply, and sales of securities through the tap facility were suspended. Subsequently, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- BPNG increased the volume of its repurchase agreements and deposits available through the Kina Facility, which removed some liquidity from the system. 21. However, excess reserves remained high and yields on Treasury bills are currently around 10 percent. In view of the difficult fiscal position and possible swings in market confidence in the period leading up to the elections, the staff team proposed that BPNG should act immediately to tighten monetary conditions. The Bank should also move to improve the efficacy of its monetary operations, especially through aggressively using open market operations to move market interest rates into line with the Kina Facility Rate, and hence increasing the credibility of the facility as a signal of the stance of monetary policy. Further, it should announce a clear strategy for the possible issuance of central bank securities to improve liquidity control. The authorities indicated that these recommendations would be given careful consideration. While agreeing that faster growth in private sector credit is necessary to support economic activity, the staff team underscored that domestic financing of the government must be contained in order to limit pressures in the foreign exchange market. 22. The kina was relatively stable against the U.S. dollar during the first four months of 2002. However, this outcome reflected increased exchange market intervention by BPNG, aimed at offsetting the effects of seasonally low agricultural exports and higher budgetary spending. Net official international reserves declined in the first quarter to an estimated $270 million (3% months of nonmineral imports of goods and services). Even with foreign exchange inflows from privatization and exceptional financing, and the recommended fiscal measures later in the year, the government’s domestic financing requirement will lead to an expansion in domestic credit. In these circumstances, the authorities’ inflation target remains achievable, although reserves will probably not recover in the remainder of 2002. The staff team agreed with the authorities that the level of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate, taking account of the sizable depreciation of the kina in real effective terms in recent years, (Figure 2) provided that policies are consistent with meeting the government’s macroeconomic objectives for 2002. C. Structural Reform Policies 23. The authorities confirmed that public sector reform would continue to be a major element of structural policies, with focus on improved efficiency, governance, and service delivery. Priority would be given to the areas outlined in the AsDB loan agreement to build a performance-oriented public service, improve personnel management, and strengthen oversight agencies. The scope for possible outsourcing and shedding of activities would be explored. Functional department reviews that focus on the analysis of costs and efficiency would be continued, especially in the Department of Works. In view of governance problems in that department and the poor state of the road system, the authorities were considering the establishment of an independent road authority. The staff team cautioned that creating independent statutory bodies had not been fully effective in the past in preventing political interference and had on occasion weakened the control exercised by the Department of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- Treasury. The authorities shared these concerns and said that firm safeguards would be put in place, if a decision were taken to establish a new body. 24. The staff team welcomed the amendments to the pension reform law that were approved by parliament in March 2002, based on the recommendations of a high-level Superannuation Task Force that had been appointed by the Prime Minister in August 2001. Extensive reforms to the operation of the superannuation funds had been incorporated into legislation approved by parliament in November 2000, consistent with structural benchmarks under the stand-by arrangement, designed to improve the regulatory framework and increase competition. The new legislation will strengthen the financial position of the existing funds by tightening withdrawal provisions, as well as encouraging new institutions to compete for accounts. These reforms will require the development of supervisory capacity at BPNG. 25. The staff team encouraged the authorities to move ahead with plans for privatization and deregulation in 2002 and beyond. They welcomed the initiation of the bidding process for the telecommunications company and the restructuring program for the troubled electricity corporation. Legislation was also approved by parliament in March 2002 to establish the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission, which will have the sole authority to regulate public utilities and to exercise the previous functions of the price controller. The new regime, in contrast to the old system, provides a mechanism for the business community to appeal against price control decisions through an independent expert, whose rulings will be binding. While, except for the regulation of utilities, price controls have not been enforced in recent years, the staff team urged the authorities to further liberalize the system, including by removing most items from the controlled list. 26. The authorities are pressing ahead on schedule with the fundamental seven-year tariff program that commenced in July 1999. The previous six tariff rates (with a maximum of 125 percent) were initially replaced by four major ad valorem tariff rates (zero, 30, 40, and 55 percent). The first of three 5-percentage point cuts in these rates became effective in 2001 and similar further cuts are planned for 2003 and 2006. As there are no significant nontariff barriers and the simple average tariff rate is below 10 percent, Papua New Guinea is already rated 1 (least restrictive) on the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness. 27. BPNG is continuing to make progress in improving its banking supervision capacity in accordance with the strengthened legislative framework enacted in the last two years. With the aid of continuing Fund technical assistance, BPNG has developed new operating procedures, trained more staff, and increased on-site inspections of financial institutions, The banking system’s ratio of nonperforming loans has now fallen below 10 percent, reflecting write-offs and improvements in credit procedures at PNGBC, and provisioning now meets regulatory standards. In a move to reduce banks’ foreign exchange risk and curb the volatility of the kina, BPNG recently enforced a reduction in open position limits from 30 percent to 15 percent of bank capital. However, further efforts are needed to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- IO- improve financial sector supervision, especially because it appears likely that the merged BSP- PNGBC entity will remain undercapitalized until 2004. 28. The quality, coverage, and timeliness of economic statistics continue to hamper the government’s ability to conduct macroeconomic policy. Further progress is needed in developing indicators of domestic activity and improving the compilation of the national accounts, FAD also is providing a resident expert to advise on the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary reports on government financing. In this regard, improvements are necessary in the operation of BPNG’s Treasury bill registry and in its reporting of government deposits in order to provide an adequate measure of government financing. Preliminary analysis has identified some inconsistencies in the treatment of Treasury bill transactions that could adversely affect historical central bank profits. 29. Under the previous arrangement with the Fund, Papua New Guinea was subject to the transitional procedures governing safeguards assessments. These procedures required the Bank of Papua New Guinea to demonstrate, by providing certain documentation to the staff, that it published annual financial statements independently audited in accordance with internationally accepted standards. The BPNG cooperated fully in providing the required documentation, However, the staff team noted that the audited financial statements are made available with considerable delay, and certain weaknesses may still exist, MAE is currently providing technical assistance on the BPNG’s accounting operations. D. Medium-Term Outlook 30. The major medium-term policy challenge is to remove impediments to nonmineral sector growth, especially exports, while adjusting to lower exports and budget revenue from the mineral sector. The main barriers to private sector growth are the poor state of rural infrastructure, especially roads, low levels of social service provision, law and order concerns, and political uncertainty. In general, this will require a significant refocusing of government resources towards dealing with these issues. 31. The staffs baseline balance of payments scenario does not assume the early completion of any major new mineral projects (Table 8 and Box 3). The prospective gas pipeline to Queensland, which could become operative by 2007 if the project is initiated without further delay, would improve the longer-term external outlook. However, while progress is being made toward reaching gas contracts with Australia, uncertainty remains with regard to the financing and timing of the project. With declining volumes of mineral exports, the external current account is expected to record deficits in 2002-03 and only modest surpluses in 2004-07. The capital account balance is expected to remain negative, notwithstanding improvements in private sector net disbursements, because of lower loan repayments. 32. The discussions were based on a medium-term scenario that assumed 4 percent real growth in nonmineral GDP during 2003-07 (average overall real GDP growth of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - 2 percent annually) and inflation declining to 3 percent in 2006-07 (Table 9 and Figure 3). The staff team estimated that, provided the overall budget deficit could be held an average at about 1 percent of GDP annually over the next five years, the exchange rate of the kina could remain about unchanged in real effective terms, and gross international reserves could be held broadly stable at slightly more than 4 months of nonmineral imports of goods and services. In these circumstances, Papua New Guinea should have no difficulty in meeting its repayment obligations to the Fund, which amount to a peak of 2.3 percent of goods and nonfactor services in 2004 (Table 10). This scenario would also permit a gradual decline of public external debt to 43 percent of GDP by end-2007. This lower debt-to-GDP ratio would keep debt service manageable. 33. The failure of the economy to recover from the current recession or a further depreciation of the kina would have adverse implications for external public debt dynamics. If real nonmineral GDP growth averaged slightly less than 2 percent over the next five years, this would result in zero growth for the economy as a whole and budget deficits averaging about 2 percent of GDP (with the policy path currently envisaged). In this case, the external public debt ratio would remain at about its end-2001 level of 5 1 percent of GDP. Similarly, a real depreciation of 30 percent over the period would lead to a worsening of the public debt to GDP ratio by about 5 percentage points to about 56 percent of GDP, despite higher mineral tax revenues in kina terms from the depreciated exchange rate. Any attempt to mitigate the buildup of external debt through additional domestic borrowing would most likely lead to further inflation and additional exchange rate pressure with adverse effects on the external debt burden. 34. The authorities recognized that a major fiscal challenge would be to address the implications of lower budgetary revenue because of the reduced activity of the oil and mineral sector, the phasing out of the mining levy through 2005, and the progressive import tariff reductions through 2006. The adjustment needed to offset the decline in these revenues would be too large to be borne by expenditure alone. Core areas of social expenditure are a high priority, especially in view of Papua New Guinea’s very poor social and demographic indicators. The authorities would make strong efforts to identify and cut lower priority projects, and development spending could, to the extent possible, be subject to strict controls designed in consultation with the World Bank. Nevertheless, the staff team stated that substantial new revenue measures (including possibly a rise in the value-added tax rate) would be required, in combination with continued high levels of external aid, to achieve poverty alleviation objectives. The team also underscored that any fiscal slippage would likely be reflected in exchange market pressures, as well as a higher public debt to GDP ratio. 35. There are significant downside risks to the medium-term outlook. One concern would be a slackening in the commitment to attain approximate overall fiscal balance by 2007. Any weakening in this policy strategy could hinder monetary policy objectives and impede plans to reduce government debt in relation to GDP, which is essential to ensure fiscal sustainability. Sound fiscal and monetary policies are required not only to reduce inflation and promote private sector investment and activity, but also to prevent deterioration in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- external accounts and the possible threat of exchange rate instability in view of the expected weaker mineral sector performance. Another risk would be delays in the implementation of structural reforms, which are crucial to removing impediments to faster growth, improving social indicators and encouraging continuing donor support (Table 11). IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 36. The government formed in mid-1999 took decisive steps to address Papua New Guinea’s serious economic problems. These included macroeconomic instability stemming from unduly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, the deteriorating performance of the oil and mineral sectors, and deep structural impediments to growth. Accomplishments included the successful completion of an 18-month stand-by arrangement in September 200 1, the negotiation of structural programs with the World Bank, the AsDB, and continued strong support from bilateral donors. 37. The economic situation remains difficult, despite these achievements. Private sector activity is weak, inflation is still much higher than in major trading partners, and losses of international reserves have resumed. The underlying fiscal position has weakened because of lower-than-forecast world oil prices, higher-than-budgeted wage and salary costs, and unbudgeted spending on road bridges (financed in an untransparent manner through an expensive external loan). The fiscal situation could deteriorate mrther in the period around the June 2002 general elections. 38. Macroeconomic policies need to be tightened. In the absence of corrective measures, the overall budget deficit could reach 6 percent of GDP in 2002, well above the historical trend. The authorities recognize that, to help stabilize the situation, both revenue measures and expenditure cuts will have to be put in place immediately after the election. In the meantime, it is important to address shortcomings in the expenditure process. Measures should include enforcing the public hiring freeze, speedily implementing the retrenchment program which has fallen well behind schedule, and better priorization of development spending. Unbudgeted expenditure commitments should be strictly avoided. The high level of estimated expenditure in the first quarter implies the need for greater fiscal adjustment in the latter part of the year, especially to bring the wage bill under control, to meet the budget deficit target. This is particularly crucial given that the difficult medium-term outlook does not allow any delays in adjustment. 39. In current circumstances, relaxation of monetary policy could exacerbate inflationary and exchange market pressures. The central bank should use open market operations to move market interest rates into line with the Kina Facility Rate to enhance the rate’s credibility as a signal for the stance of monetary policy. Greater coordination between the Treasury and the central bank as regards short-term cash flow, debt, and liquidity management would also help to improve the efficacy of monetary policy.

In addition to near-term macroeconomic stabilization policies, the new government after the election will need to quickly formulate a medium-term strategy to foster faster real GDP growth on a sustained basis in order to raise living standards and alleviate poverty. This would require a marked upturn in private sector activity in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, especially because oil and mineral prospects are less promising than for most periods since independence. Government budgetary revenue is projected to decline sharply over the medium term, primarily reflecting lower receipts from petroleum and minerals. 41. In this context, a major medium-term adjustment effort will be required. Substantial fiscal consolidation will be needed, with strong efforts to cut and control spending and to implement new revenue measures. Moreover, existing government debt is very high, and needs to be reduced, including by dedicating all future privatization receipts to debt reduction. There are risks to sustainability with the present external public debt ratio, as noted earlier, especially if growth does not recover or the kina continues to depreciate. Taking steps to reduce these risks, especially through fiscal adjustment, is crucial to reducing external vulnerability and strengthening investor confidence in Papua New Guinea. 42. Achievement of improved fiscal performance and sustainability depends importantly on structural reforms. These should include completion of the civil service administrative reforms, enhanced transparency in the public sector, continued progress with privatization of state-owned enterprises (including the further divestiture of shares in the Bank of South Pacific). At the same time, the authorities should press ahead with improvements in public infrastructure, especially roads, and deregulation to promote private sector activities, with a view to enhancing medium-term growth prospects. 43. A cautious monetary policy stance will have to be maintained over the medium term to keep inflation in check and avoid weakening of the exchange rate, which could exacerbate debt problems. The present floating exchange rate regime, which facilitates orderly adjustment to large terms of trade shocks, should be maintained, given the continuing large share of raw materials in total exports. The level of the kina is broadly appropriate, particularly as competitiveness has been buttressed by its depreciation in real effective terms. It could remain relatively steady over the medium term provided that policies are consistent with meeting the government’s macroeconomic objectives and economic recovery. 44. The lack of timely statistics continues to hamper macroeconomic policy making. Further efforts should be made to improve the statistical base, especially indicators of economic activity. 45. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- Box 1. Papua New Guinea: Conduct of Monetary Policy The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) relies on open market operations to implement monetary policy rather than direct controls; the Cash Reserve Requirement and the Minimum Liquid Assets Ratio have remained unchanged since 1999. Its main instrument is the weekly primary auction of treasury bills-including bills issued by BPNG that are backed by holdings of treasury bills-through which it seeks to achieve a level of excess reserves consistent with its ultimate objective of price stability. Between auctions, sales of treasury bills to nonbanks are conducted through a tap facility. BPNG issues a semiannual monetary policy statement that outlines the rationale for current policy and its intended policy path. During the past year, BPNG has introduced several instruments to improve the conduct of monetary policy. BPNG introduced in February 2001 its Kina Facility Rate (KFR) to signal the stance of monetary policy. Seven-day deposits and loans are made available to banks at specified margins below and above the announced rate, which is reviewed monthly and adjusted in response to changes in economic and financial conditions. It was expected that the KFR would clearly indicate BPNG’s operating intentions and anchor the short end of the yield curve. In practice, this has not been entirely the case since: (i) BPNG has only accepted a limited amount of KFR deposits from the banks; and (ii) BPNG has allowed treasury bill yields to fall 150 basis points below the KFR deposit rate. BPNG also introduced in February 200 1 the Repurchase Agreement Facility, which allows it to conduct open market operations more frequently than on a weekly basis, by means of unsecured overnight loans and repurchases, conducted at margins above and below the KFR. BPNG finalized and executed in January 2002 Master Repurchase Agreements, which allow repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions with durations of up to five business days to be conducted for liquidity management purposes. Monetary management was complicated by a shortage of treasury bills in early 2002. The foreign financing received in late 2001 led to large increases in liquidity. In an attempt to withdraw this liquidity, BPNG sold its remaining net stock of treasury bills, but was unwilling to issue its own securities in excess of its holdings of treasury bills. As a result, excess reserves increased dramatically, treasury bill yields fell sharply, and sales of securities through the tap facility were suspended. BPNG has increased the volume of deposits available through the Kina Facility, which has removed some liquidity from the system. Complete removal of the deposit limits on the Kina Facility would be desirable, as this would cause market interest rates to rise, in line with price and external objectives, and strengthen the role of the KFR as the primary signal of the stance of policy. Further, the reestablishment of an electronic registry for securities, as recommended by a recent MAE mission, would facilitate day-to-day liquidity management and promote the development of a secondary market.

Papua New Guinea: Privatization in 2002 The budget assumed 3 percent of GDP in privatization receipts this year. Sales to date for PNGBC and Orogen Minerals Limited could yield 2 percent of GDP. Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation The December sales agreement established an amalgamated PNGBC-Bank of South Pacific which became operational in March 2002. Officially estimated cash budgetary receipts are K 91 million (0.8 percent of GDP); asset sales of K 75 million (0.7 percent of GDP) are also forecast, but details are not available. Shareholders in the merged bank are the government (25 percent), pension funds and a savings and loan association (3 1 percent); the publicly owned motor vehicle insurance agency and credit corporation (23 percent); and private landowners, church groups, and individuals (2 1 percent). Orogen Minerals Limited The merger was announced on January 21,2002 (effective from March 2002) between Oil Search, an Australian-owned energy company, and Orogen Minerals Limited, the corporation that holds the country’s rights to participate in the equity of every major mining and petroleum project in PNG. The budget is expected to receive cash of about K 130 million (1.2 percent of GDP); in addition, the government will hold 18 percent of shares in the merged entity. Telikom The government started the bidding process in November 2001. Telikom enjoys monopoly status, and while the government will permit competition in the future, the successful bidder will receive a guaranteed regulatory contract, including pricing for up to ten years. However, the government has provided no information on price estimates. PNG Electricity Commission The government has prepared a short list of preferred bidders for its 50.1 percent share, but there may be little or no interest from investors. Power outages are a continuous problem, the company’s infrastructure is run-down, and its outstanding debt is large. PNG Business Trust The government announced in January 2002 the establishment of the business trust that will hold all state assets considered unsuitable or unready for privatization. These assets are expected to include Air Niugini, Post PNG, the Water Board, and the titles of all leases held by the Habours Board. People’s Unit Trust The government aims to establish a unit trust, to be managed as an independent investment fund, that will receive a certain portion of shares under the privatization program, at a 15 percent discount from the purchase price. The unit trust holders are expected to be primarily PNG citizens, superannuation funds, and provincial governments.

Papua New Guinea: Mining and Petroleum Sector The principal mineral products of Papua New Guinea are copper, gold, and petroleum, which collectively account for nearly two-thirds of total export earnings. The sector has been a major source of private investment and government revenue since independence. The Bougainville copper and gold mine operated during 1972-89. A group of local landowners seeking compensation, a share in mine profits, and greater environmental protection then succeeded in closing the mine. Armed hostilities between the PNG government and secessionist movements occurred over the next decade. A peace agreement on the island was reached in August 2001, and legislation is expected to be enacted by the PNG Parliament in March 2002 to create an autonomous government for the province. However, the mine is not expected- to reopen. The Ok Tedi copper, gold, and silver mine has been in production since 1984, but output has been winding down for some years. BHP, the Australian majority owner, has recently agreed to give its 52 percent equity to the government of PNG to settle litigation about pollution caused by the mine. The Kutubu oil field and the Porgera and Misima gold fields became operative in the early 1990s helping to fill the void in exports caused by the closure of Bougainville. However, these fields have been subsequently depleted. Kutubu output has been falling since 1993; Porgera output peaked in 1992 and is expected to cease in 2007; and mining stopped at Misima in 200 1. The Lihir and Tolukuma gold mines and the Gobe oil project helped to limit the decline in mineral exports in the second half of the 1990s. Only Lihir is expected to maintain its production rate over the next decade. Tolukuma is expected to close in 2003, and production from Gobe is not sufficient to arrest the overall decline in the oil sector. Exploration activity has fallen dramatically in recent years because of high exploration costs, the opening of more lucrative projects elsewhere in the world, growing concerns over landowner unrest, and uncertainties about the fiscal regime. The government is removing the mining levy in four steps during 2002-2005, which reduces the taxes paid by mining companies, but it is not clear if this will stimulate exploration. Prospects for completion of the natural gas pipeline to Queensland have improved with the recently announced merger between Oil Search and Orogen Minerals. However, gas exports will probably not begin before 2007 at the earliest, and development of the Ramu nickel deposit appears unlikely in the near term. While mineral exports could again recover over the longer term, lower volumes are certainly in prospect for the next several years.

Article IV Consultation and the Stand-By Arrangement: Papua New Guinea is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions were held during February 27-March 11,2002. A 14-month Stand- By Arrangement was approved by the Executive Board on March 29,200O and subsequently extended to September 28,200l. The fourth and last review of the arrangement was completed on September 24,200 1 (EBS/O l/l 59). IX. Technical Assistance from Headquarters: FAD: A mission in February 2002 assessed progress to improve fiscal transparency. A mission in December 2000 provided advice on the reconciliation of large and volatile differences in fiscal reporting based on information provided by the Department of Finance and Treasury and the information reported by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. As a result, ongoing TA is now being provided to improve fiscal tranparency and help resolve the discrepancy between fiscal and monetary accounts. A joint FAD/PFTAC mission in March 2000 assisted the authorities in preparing a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes Fiscal Transparency Module, that was published in October 2000. LEG: A mission in November 1996 provided advice on the legal framework for the National Value-Added Tax. MAE: A mission in November 200 1 reviewed foreign exchange management in Papua New Guinea. A mission in June 200 1 assessed the monetary policy implementation framework. A resident advisor has been engaged to provide ongoing assistance on monetary policy. A mission in November 1999 reviewed technical assistance requirements. Missions in November 1997, June 1998, and January 1999 provided advice on banking supervision. Ongoing technical assistance is being provided for the current financial sector restructuring and improving the accounting framework and monetary operations of the central bank. STA: Four missions over the period August 1995 to April 1996 provided advice on the compilation of national accounts. X. Resident Representative: A post was opened in Port Moresby in May 2000 and is filled by Mr. M. Tareen.

During 1996-200 1, PNG has also sent 3 1 officials to the Centre’s regional seminars, workshops and training courses. Public Financial Management The Centre assisted the authorities to prepare a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes fiscal transparency module, which was published in October 2000. The Centre subsequently participated in the Fiscal Affairs Department technical assistance mission on the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary reports on government activity and the correct treatment of treasury bill arrangements in the fiscal accounts. Tax Administration and Policy A mission was undertaken in 1997 in coordination with the Fiscal Affairs Department to take stock of the National Implementation Plan to ensure the new VAT could be implemented by January 1, 1998. Assistance was also provided to the authorities in finding an appropriate long-term technical assistance expert to ensure the VAT implementation target date was achieved. Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision In 1996, the Centre undertook an evaluation of bank supervision policies and procedures and capacity, where it was concluded that, despite relatively developed on-site examination capabilities within the central bank, the legislative framework was no longer adequate for effective supervision and regulation. On the basis of those findings and the conclusion that the reform task was beyond the capacity of the Centre, long-term technical assistance to strengthen the supervision function was obtained from the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department. Economic and Financial Statistics In 2000, the Centre conducted a fundamental review of statistical operations, including an assessment of data needs, institutional structures, and operational procedures for the effective production of a core set of economic, financial and social statistics. Recommendations were also developed on future technical assistance requirements within the GDDS framework. Priority areas that were addressed through a February 2001 visit included the quality and timeliness of key data on production, trade and employment and the CPI; the household income and expenditure survey; and the balance of payments. ’ The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor technical assistance institution, financed by the IMF, ADB, AusAID, NZODA and, until 2001, by the UNDP, with the IMF as Executing Agency. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

There are six active loans, totaling $71.6 million in commitments. This includes the recently-approved Forestry and Conservation Project ($17.4 million with a matching grant from the Global Environment Facility). Other loans are supporting investments and capacity-building in the agriculture and mining sectors, infrastructure development, and improvement of health and education services. The $90 million Governance Promotion Adjustment Loan, approved in June 2000, has been fully disbursed, with the second tranche disbursed at end 2001. New loans under preparation will support provincial road rehabilitation and community-level development initiatives. The World Bank’s assistance strategy aims to improve the governance framework for sustainable development and support more effective rural development. This comprises: (a) analytical support to develop a coherent set of macroeconomic and structural reforms; (b) a judicious combination of balance of payments support, project, and technical assistance to facilitate reforms and build institutional capacity; (c) coordination of donor assistance through Consultative Group Meetings and bilateral arrangements with Australia, Japan, the Asian Development Bank, and other donors; and (d) work with NGOs and other civic organizations to improve service delivery, strengthen resource management, and engender broad-based ownership of reforms in the context of Fund/World Bank programs. A new three-year Country Assistance Strategy is under preparation in 2002. IFC, through the South Pacific Project Facility, has secured financing for 22 projects to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. IFC is currently reviewing potential investments in the gas and telecommunications, manufacturing and financial sectors. IFC has invested $3 million (18 percent interest) in the Port Moresby-based Kula Fund, which has made four investments in Papua New Guinea totaling $4.9 million since its establishment in 1997. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency has facilitated a total of $892 million in foreign direct investment in Papua New Guinea. MIGA currently has one guarantee in Papua New Guinea, in the mining sector, worth $51 million in gross exposure.

Of this total, 24 loans ($463 million) had been extended from ordinary capital resources and 3 1 loans ($387 million) from special funds resources. In addition, $37.0 million had been provided for 114 technical assistance projects. With the overarching objective of alleviating poverty, the AsDB strategy for Papua New Guinea focuses on improved governance, private sector development, and improved social conditions. Poor governance and ineffective public sector management being the main development problems, AsDB is focusing on strengthening public sector financial management and enhancing public sector management. For private sector development, in addition to improving the supportive performance of the central agencies, AsDB is helping to improve sector policy and institutional frameworks (especially in agriculture and fisheries), enhance factor productivity (skills development and financial services), and improve market access by selected infrastructure investments (transport) especially in rural areas. In the social sectors, AsDB will continue to assist in policy development in health and to support infrastructure investments and service delivery, especially in rural areas. In 2002, current plans now call for approval of two loans, totaling about $3 1 million. Current plans envisage annual lending averaging about $45 million during 2003-05. The current 2002 program for grant-financed technical assistance comprises four projects totaling about $2.5 million. Table 1.

The National Statistical Office (NSO) is underfunded and suffers from a lack of staff, especially those with computer training. It has been unable to obtain and collate data from businesses and other government departments, even though it does have the legislative authority to do so. As a result, the only economic release it is able to produce on a somewhat timely basis is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The NSO, with assistance from AusAid, completed the collections for the 2000 Population Census and released the preliminary results in July 200 1. Using some of the cxpertisc and equipment it acquired for this census, the NSO intends to conduct a Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) in 2002. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) and the Department of Treasury product most current data. Monetary data are not available on a regular and timely basis and the timeliness and frequency of reporting to the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) needs to be improved. However, the monetary and financial data for February 2002 will be published in the June 2002 issue of International Financial Statistics (IFS). A monetary statistics mission is planned for the second quarter of FY 2003 to: (i) review the procedures for collecting, compiling and reporting monetary data; (ii) develop an integrated database to be used by STA, APD, and the authorities; (iii) examine the national definitions of monetary aggregates; and (iv) assist the authorities in the implementation of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. National accounts: In July 2001, the NSO released a preliminary set of national accounts estimates for 1999. As these figures are still subject to revisions due to problems in compiling the GDP deflators, they have not been used to update staffs estimates. In mid-2000, the NSO released a set of national accounts estimates: National Income, Expenditure and Product, 1993-98. These estimates arc compiled using the 1968 System ofNational Accounts, however the NSO is currently working towards implementing the recommendations of the 1993 System of National Accounts. Estimates of value added are compiled using the production and expenditure approaches, with private final consumption expenditure derived as a residual in the latter approach. A Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre mission in February 200 1 identified several sources that could be used to generate measures of business activity: l Corporate income tax data from the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC); corporate profits, revenues and other financial data for 4,000 companies. l Value-added tax data from the IRC: salts and inputs data for a broad range of businesses. l Membership data from the superannuation funds: employment numbers for both the private and public sectors. These partial measures of activity would be useful for the formulation of macroeconomic policy. The government needs to ensure that the NSO is granted access to these data and that additional resources are provided to compile these series on a timely basis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - ANNEX VI Prices: The only price index currently compiled is a quarterly CPI; the main deficiencies include outdated weights that are based on consumption studies conducted in the mid-l 970s and weaknesses in data collection practices. The NSO intends to use the results of the planned HIES to rebase the CPI. However, there is a need for technical assistance to computerize the collation and production of the CPI. Government finance: While central government tax revenue statistics are generally accurate and timely, nontax revenue and public expenditure data are deficient. In particular, development budget expenditures and the utilization of grants and project loans are only recorded with large lags, and few records on the use of accrual trust accounts are available. Recently, however, the government has taken steps to improve these statistics. The timeliness of data after the end of the fiscal year and of current data throughout the year has improved. With the recent decision to pay market interest rates to all holders of government securities including the central bank, interest payment records should become more accurate. However, there are still timing issues regarding the recording of interest on discount securities. No data are available on deferred pension liabilities to civil servants, and on provincial and local government budgets, off-budget outlays and corresponding liabilities, and potentially large implicit transfers between the government and public enterprises. The weaknesses in fiscal statistics lead to large discrepancies between observed domestic financing from monetary and debt data and the domestic financing requirement derived from fiscal data. The report of the December 2000 FAD technical assistance mission’ identified the major deficiencies leading to this discrepancy. The authorities have agreed to implement the recommendations of the report and will request technical assistance from the Fund and Australia to assist them in doing so. External sector: Although aggregate quarterly data on the balance of payments are published by the BPNG on a regular basis, the data reported to the Fund for publication are not timely. (The latest data published in the IFS are for the fourth quarter of 1999.) Balance of payments data are based on the exchange record system, which is not tightly monitored despite BPNG reporting requirements. The financial account data are of poor quality because of major deficiencies in data collection, especially in the areas of private external debt. In many cases, donors and lenders disburse funds directly to contractors for the purchase of goods and services, effectively bypassing the exchange record system. Therefore, a substantial proportion of current account and capital flows are not recorded. The authorities are attempting to address the problem with the coverage of the merchandise trade statistics by moving to customs-based data. The ASYCUDA customs system being used by the IRC now electronically records about 80 percent of trade transactions, but currently neither BPNG nor the NSO have the resources to access this database. ‘Steven Symansky and others, “Papua New Guinea: Improving Fiscal Reporting,” Fiscal Affairs Department, December 2000.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea On June 5, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2002 Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea.’ Background Papua New Guinea’s economic performance deteriorated in 1997-98, reflecting the effects of drought, low commodity prices, poor governance, and a burgeoning fiscal deficit. In light of these unfavorable developments, private capital outflows intensified, leading to a depreciation in the kina and a marked decline in official international reserves. The government of Prime Minister Morauta that took office in July 1999 was successful in restoring macroeconomic stability and implementing structural reforms. The government’s program received financial assistance from the Fund, other multilateral agencies, and bilateral donors. The Fund’s Executive Board approved a 14-month stand-by arrangement on March 29, 2000 in an amount of SDR 85.5 million (65 percent of quota). The SBA was extended for four months through September 2001; it was fully drawn. Although GDP continued to contract in 2000-01, the major targets of the SBA were broadly achieved, representing the first time that Papua New Guinea successfully completed a program with the Fund. Real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 3.4 percent in 2001. Oil production fell by 16 percent, reflecting the depletion of oil reserves and the lack of spending on new exploration I Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the June 5, 2002 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Due to weakness in manufacturing, construction, and retail and wholesale trade sectors, nonmineral activity contracted by 1.7 percent, Average inflation fell to 10.2 percent in 2001 from 15.6 percent in 2000, the result of subdued economic activity and the tightening of monetary policy, although the pass-through effect of the kina depreciation of 20 percent against the U.S. dollar during 2000-01 continued to put upward pressure on consumer prices. The fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened to 3.5 percent in 2001. While tax revenues were broadly in line with expectations, expenditures rose sharply in the fourth quarter of 2001, mainly on wages and salaries and development projects, in anticipation of external assistance disbursements. Expenditure in the first quarter of 2002 continued to exceed budgeted levels as the government prepared for elections scheduled for midyear. As a result of the fiscal deficit, continued reliance on external financing and the depreciation in the kina, the external public debt to GDP ratio increased from 42 percent in December 2000 to 51 percent in December 2001. Monetary policy was gradually eased in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, reflecting the government’s decision that monetary policy stimulus was necessary to counteract the recession and the accompanying decline in private sector credit growth. Interest rates fell across all maturities. The fall in interest rates, however, had little impact on credit demand and bank lending. The external current account surplus narrowed to about 3 percent of GDP in 2001. The decline in imports more than offset weak export demand stemming from lower volumes of oil, gold, copra and logs as well as depressed coffee prices. Despite continued private capital outflows, the overall balance remained in surplus, on account of external assistance. At year-end, gross international reserves rose to $433 million (equivalent of over 5 months of nonmineral imports of goods and services). Progress was made on structural reforms in 2001. The first major accomplishment of the government’s privatization program was the sale of Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation to the Bank of South Pacific (BSP) for cash and equity; the merged bank will be the largest bank in the country. The public sector will continue have a substantial interest in the merged bank, however, mainly through the combined shareholdings of the state’s privatization commission, publicly owned commercial enterprises and superannuation funds. With regards to public sector administrative reform, functional reviews were performed for several departments; three overseas missions were closed; and contracts were awarded for a new financial accounting and management system and a new payroll and human resources management system.
