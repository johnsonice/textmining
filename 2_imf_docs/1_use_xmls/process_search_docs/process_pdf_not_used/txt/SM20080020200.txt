Economic developments and outlook Turkmenistan has benefited from increased hydrocarbon export prices and export outlets. These generated strong economic growth and large fiscal and external surpluses in 2007, which are expected to continue in the medium-term. Inflation started to pick up in late 2007 and reached 16 percent in March 2008, reflecting higher international food prices, regional weather problems, and an 8-fold increase in domestic petroleum prices. The official and commercial exchange rates were unified at the mid-point between them on May 1, 2008.  Views of the authorities  The authorities have embarked upon a program of economic transformation. In addition to reforms in the social, hydrocarbon, and industrial sectors, they envisage financial reforms with the already completed exchange rate unification as the first step toward integrating Turkmenistan into the international economy. These reforms will be accompanied by policies to mitigate adverse price and social effects, including by reducing duty and excise rates. Fiscal and monetary policies will aim to support a stable exchange rate, which could serve as a nominal anchor for the economy. The authorities plan to redenominate the manat (removing zeros) at the start of 2009, and are considering reforms to the banking system (including allowing greater competition and the gradual entry of foreign banks).  Staff recommendations  • Foreign exchange should be readily accessible for all current transactions. Duties and excise taxes, as well as non-tariff barriers to trade, should be reduced in order to limit the inflationary effects of the exchange rate unification.  • Moderate increases in public spending would be appropriate to protect real incomes, while phasing-in administered price increases. Reduce low-priority public spending if excess demand pressures emerge. Progressively strengthen public financial management, especially by expanding the coverage of the budget.   • Monetary policy should support the new exchange rate as a nominal anchor. The CBT should phase out directed credits and raise interest rates, while commercial banks expand credit and attract deposits from the private sector on market terms. • Major reforms are needed to deepen the financial sector, to create a commercial credit culture, develop competition, and strengthen accounting and auditing. • Staff encourages further efforts to improve the quality of economic and financial data and their systematic publication.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 4 I.   INTRODUCTION 1.      Turkmenistan is a landlocked country with an economy dominated by a large hydrocarbon sector (mainly natural gas). In 2007 this sector contributed about 25 percent of GDP and 90 percent of exports, and has benefited from recent successes in raising export prices and expanding outlets. Until recently, Turkmenistan maintained a state-dominated economy, lagging well behind other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries in economic reforms.  2.      In 2007, President Berdimuhamedov launched a program of social and economic reforms, and sought to improve relations with neighboring countries and international institutions. Reforms to the exchange system and administered prices began in early 2008, and initiatives were launched to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). The 2008 Article IV consultation focused on the key near-term measures to accelerate these economic reforms, and especially to support exchange rate unification, which was a key recommendation in the 2007 Article IV consultation. II.   BACKGROUND A.   Developments and Outlook in 2007 and 2008  3.      Economic conditions remain robust (Table 1) and the outlook for the hydrocarbon sector has greatly improved. Growth reached 11½ percent in 2007, driven by increased hydrocarbon output and broad-based growth in the non-hydrocarbon economy, including in the construction, transport and communication, and retail sectors.1 For 2008, real GDP growth is projected at 11 percent, based on buoyant hydrocarbon sector prospects (Box 1), and with growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector boosted by public spending on rural development and infrastructure.

Further revisions to methodologies and growth estimates are possible.

The authorities estimate that natural gas reserves amount to 24.6 trillion cubic meters (tcm) which, if confirmed, would make them the 4th largest in the world. This is substantially more than the British Petroleum (BP) estimate of 2.7 tcm. The first phase of an international audit of gas reserves, which would cover the Dauletabad-Donmez field (the main field supplying gas exports to Russia), is expected to be completed in the second half of 2008. Later phases of the audit will be prioritized by foreign interest in new gas contracts. Oil reserves are estimated to be more modest than gas reserves, at 1.8 billion barrels. Hydrocarbon production continues to be heavily dominated by state enterprises, but the new government has started to attract more FDI. Since the late 1990s, three international oil companies (IOCs) have operated off-shore oil and gas fields in the Caspian Sea under production sharing agreements (PSAs), and are now expanding these operations. Contacts with other IOCs to develop new off-shore gas fields are being intensified. In 2007, the first PSA with a foreign company—CNPC of China—to develop an on-shore gas field was approved.  Export prospects have improved significantly. As recently as 2004, lack of alternative export prospects kept export prices low, $44 per thousand cm, with half paid as barter. Subsequent negotiations have raised the prices. Recent agreements were reached with: • Russia to increase the gas export price from $100 per thousand cm in 2007 to an average price of $140 in 2008, and to switch to market prices thereafter. The capacity of the Central Asia-Center pipeline network—the main outlet for Turkmenistan’s gas exports—is being increased by 20 billion cm (bcm) from its current capacity of about 43 bcm. Construction of a new pipeline along the Caspian shore will start in 2009.1 The additional capacity of up to 20 bcm should be available starting in 2010-11. • China to build a 7,000 km gas pipeline with an eventual capacity of 30 bcm. Construction started in 2007 and is expected to be finished by 2010. The 30-year agreement provides also for a formula linking the Turkmen gas export price to the world oil price.   • Iran to raise the gas export price in 2008 from $75 per thousand cm to about the 2008 export price for Russia. There are also plans to move to international prices starting in 2009. Prospects for pipelines to export gas to Europe and Pakistan and India are advancing more slowly as a result of ongoing uncertainties about the legal status of the Caspian Sea and the security situation in Afghanistan. __________________________ 1/ Turkmenistan’s policy is to transport gas to its border and sell to buyers willing to bear pipeline investment costs beyond the border. Investments on the domestic sections of gas pipelines could be about $1 billion in 2008-10.

Reflecting the favorable market conditions for hydrocarbon exports, the current account surplus and international reserves are growing strongly. In 2007, with hydrocarbon export revenues up 30 percent, the current account surplus reached 15½ percent of GDP and gross international reserves rose to $13 billion (equivalent to about 22 months of import cover) as the authorities chose to save a large part of their hydrocarbon income. The recent growth in FDI inflows, mainly reflecting the investment in offshore oil operations in the Caspian Sea, is expected to continue. Staff projects a further increase in the current account surplus to 23½ percent of GDP in 2008, with reserves reaching $20 billion.   02468101214200220032004200520062007051015202530… and large increases in international reservesIn months of imports (right scale)In millions of US dollars (left scale)Sources: Data provided by authorities, and Fund staff estimates.-6-4-2246810200220032004200520062007In percent of GDPTrade balanceCurrent accountImports of goods and servicesNon-hydrocarbon exportsHydrocarbon exportsExport prices increases resulted in large surpluses...

Inflation was low for much of 2007, but it started to accelerate at the end of the year, due to higher international food prices2 and supply shortages caused by the extremely cold winter. Headline inflation in 2008 is being boosted further by the progressive adjustment of administered prices to market levels, with an 8-fold increase in domestic petroleum prices in February 20083 and very large increases in bus and rail fares and airline ticket prices in May and early June 2008.

The fiscal stance has generally been restrained. The 2007 budget surplus amounted to 4 percent of GDP. Revenue growth fell to only 4 percent, despite the large increase in hydrocarbon export values, due to a change in the allocation of hydrocarbon revenues in favor of off-budget revenue. Budget expenditure was lower than allocated due to the slow execution of the capital investment program (Table 2). Although the initial 2008 budget seemed expansionary with a projected deficit of 3 percent of GDP, this reflected a contingency allowance to finance projects in rural development and tourism, which would have been previously implemented off-budget, as well as conservative gas export price assumptions. Other aspects of expenditure, such as the 10 percent increase in wages, were restrained. Staff estimate that off-budget operations in 2007 showed an additional surplus of 11 percent of GDP, with extrabudgetary government spending estimated at about 6 percent of GDP.4 The fiscal stance continued to be prudent0510152025Budgetary expenditureBudgetary revenueExtrabudgetary revenueExtrabudgetary expenditure-505101520200220032004200520062007Budget balanceExtrabudgetary balanceIn percent of  GDPSources: Data provided by authorities, and Fund staff estimates.                                                  2 Although Turkmenistan is a small net food importer, domestic food prices tend to follow regional prices. 3 The direct impact on consumers was substantially offset by a free quota for a basic consumption level. 4 Extrabudgetary government revenue and expenditure have been estimated by the staff using BOP, monetary, and investment data.

(Tables 3 and 4) In 2007, credit to the economy grew by 30 percent, reflecting a large increase in directed credits to the cotton sector, partly funded by the CBT. As a result, reserve money growth reached 70 percent at end-2007, and manat broad money almost doubled. However, the partial repayment of the agricultural loans and increased sales of foreign exchange ahead of expected unification sharply reduced both reserve money and manat broad money in the first quarter of 2008. Meanwhile, nominal interest rates remained unchanged as inflation picked up. -40-20020406080100Mar-05Sep-05Mar-06Sep-06Mar-07Sep-07Mar-0812-month percent changeCredit to economyReserve moneyManat broad moneyIn late 2007, monetary policy loosened driven by credit...Source: Data provided by authorities.-10-505101520Jan-05Jul-05Jan-06Jul-06Jan-07Jul-07Lending rate  (nominal)CBT refinance rate (nominal)CBT refinance rate (real) 1/Lending rate (real) 1/1/ Based on past 12-months end of period inflation.… with real interest rates turning negative Sources: Data provided by authorities, and Fund staff estimates. 8.      The process of exchange rate unification was launched at the start of 2008 and was completed on May 1, 2008. The former dual exchange rate system comprised: (i) an official rate pegged at manat 5,200 per U.S. dollar; and (ii) a parallel market rate, 4-5 times more depreciated. Effective January 1, 2008, the authorities devalued the official rate to manat 6,250 per US dollar, and introduced a commercial rate of manat 20,000 per US dollar (some 20 percent above the earlier parallel rate) at which banks could trade freely with the public. After expeditious preparations, the two markets were unified on May 1, at the rate of manat 14,250 per US dollar. New foreign exchange regulations were issued at the start of June that continued the commitment to provide unrestricted access to foreign exchange for making payments and transfers for current international transaThese actions have eliminated certain exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice subject to approval under Article VIII Sections 2 (a) or 3, while others remain.

External Sustainability and the Assessment of the Exchange Rate The assessment of Turkmenistan’s exchange rate gives a wide variation in the size and sign of the estimates. It is severely constrained by the quality of macroeconomic data, uncertainty about the resource endowment, and the previous dual exchange rate system. Taking into account the latter, an average exchange rate with a 50-50 weighting has been assumed as the economy’s implicit exchange rate. The macroeconomic balance (MB) and equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approaches, adapted to a panel of 13 MCD oil countries, yield conflicting results: overvaluation for the former, and a substantial undervaluation for the latter. The results of the external sustainability approach vary widely depending on the assumed level of Turkmenistan’s hydrocarbon reserves: a significant overvaluation in the low case (LC) scenario, which assumes BP’s hydrocarbon reserves estimates; and a significant undervaluation in the baseline scenario, which uses a mid-point between LC and the authorities’ estimates.   The MB approach indicates that Turkmenistan’s projected current account (CA) for 2013 is about 3 percent of GDP lower than the CA norm consistent with medium-term equilibrium. This CA deviation would reflect an exchange rate overvaluation of about 13 percent.1 In contrast, the ERER approach yiea significant undervalds luation of about ach  on the e nuity.  a gnificant undervaluation Based on a trade balance elasticity (-0.23) derived from a study of trade elasticities in  MCD’s oil exporting countries.   26 percent in 2006.  The external sustainability approis based on the permanent income approach, but depends criticallylevel of gas reserves, the rate of extraction, the rate of interest, and thfuture path of oil prices. Under this approach, the net present value of the exhaustible hydrocarbon export stream over the extraction period is converted into a constant permanent real anThis annuity is then used as the sustainable nonhydrocarbon CA balance to derive a CA norm. The CA norm depends on hydrocarbon reserves: the lower the reserves (LC), the higher the need to save and the higher CA norm, here implyingsignificant overvaluation (52 percent); the baseline scenario by contrast shows a si(61 percent). ____________________________ 1  Estimated CommentsNormProj.1.

Direct monetary controls, the predominance of cash as a means of payment, and the distorted foreign exchange market (prior to unification) have limited its role in the economy. As a result, deposits are only about 5 percent of GDP, while 90 percent of commercial bank credit goes to state enterprises, often at relatively low interest rates. The financial soundness indicators reported by the authorities indicate a general compliance by the banks with existing norms. However, the CBT recognizes that this may not represent a true picture and a project to introduce International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the banking system is underway. So far, two banks (out of twelve) are participating in the pilot project.

Medium-Term Outlook and Risks (2009-13) 11.      Turkmenistan’s medium term economic and financial outlook is favorable under the current scenario for energy prices. Real GDP growth is expected to be in the              8–10 percent per year range, the budget would continue to be in surplus, and the external current account surplus would remain at over 30 percent of GDP (Table 6). However, comprehensive economic reforms are needed to diversify the economy, increase employment, and develop the private sector.  12.      The downside risks to the external outlook are fairly limited, since Turkmenistan’s gas export price is still catching up to the European market price. Thus, even if world oil prices fall $30 below the WEO trajectory and the Turkmen gas export price stays at US$140 per tcm (less than half the EU import price), the external current account balance would continue to record surpluses of about 11 percent of GDP. A further $10 per barrel decline in oil price would reduce the surplus by 2 percent of GDP. III. AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS 13.      The discussions took place as the authorities are starting their reform process. They plan to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth, improve job creation and living standards, and smoothly integrate Turkmenistan into the international economy (Box 3). The authorities are making progress in the hydrocarbon, infrastructure, and social areas. Exchange system reform is seen as a first step in developing the financial sector, while also contributing to more market-based prices and the development of the private sector. The policy discussions focused on policies to support exchange rate unification and address its social effects, as well as complementary reforms to the banking sector and to develop the private sector.

Diversifying energy exports (developing power generation and transmission in addition to gas) and developing international transport routes (especially the north-south rail link); b. Developing the oil and gas sector and expanding capacity, in accordance with the plan to 2030; c. Developing an industrial base by renovating oil refineries, and establishing petrochemical facilities, resource-based industries, and textile processing and production; d. Continuing reforms in the social sphere, including in education and health care (with voluntary medical insurance), with special emphasis on improving living standards in rural areas, under the Rural Development Program; e. Developing recreational resources, especially the Avaza tourist zone, and related free economic zone; f. Expanding international economic relations, especially mutually beneficial trade; and g. Developing the private sector, especially in agriculture and services, including by revising the legal framework for farming, the Foreign Investment Law, and the Tax Code, and reviewing licensing requirements.   A.   Exchange Rate Unification 14.      The authorities intend to keep the exchange rate stable in the current situation. They agreed that a stable exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar would serve as a nominal anchor to stabilize inflation expectations related to the pass-through effects of exchange rate unification, and adjustments in administered prices and wages. They would also use this period to develop the foreign exchange market, which could be a precursor to greater exchange rate flexibility.  15.      The authorities are committed to ensure the ready availability of foreign exchange for current transactions in the unified market. The recent changes in the foreign exchange system utilize considerable Fund input, and the new regulations aim to ensure the sustainability of the unified rate.7 Since unification, there have been some queuing as well as periodic spikes in the parallel rate, but these should gradually disappear as teething problems with the supply of currency are ironed out and as confidence in the new system is built up. Going forward, the CBT requested further Fund technical assistance (TA) for currency redenomination (removal of zeros) at the start of 2009.                                                    7 The mission presented a seminar on approaches to such regulations and market development, and provided a note with specific recommendations.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 1316.      Complementary trade liberalization measures in support of the new exchange rate are planned. Duty and excise rates will soon be cut substantially, as the unification of the exchange system greatly raised the values of import duties at existing rates. A review of non-tariff trade barriers, previously used to limit access to foreign exchange at the official rate, may also be considered to improve competition and help ensure that the appreciation of the market rate is reflected in import prices.  B.   Impact on Inflation and Macroeconomic Policies Inflation outlook  17.      The authorities expressed their desire to avoid excessive inflation that might result from exchange rate unification and price adjustments. Notwithstanding the exogenous factors driving the recent increase in prices, the authorities are seeking to contain inflation to 12–14 percent in 2008, including by limiting the pass-through of the devaluation of the official exchange rate on controlled prices in 2008.8 Fiscal and monetary policies will remain restrained to achieve this objective. Structural measures such as trade liberalization should also foster the inflation-dampening effects of the appreciation of the market exchange rate. There would be scope for further administered price adjustments in 2009. Fiscal policy 18.      The authorities recognized that fiscal policy in Turkmenistan remains key in maintaining macroeconomic stability. Notwithstanding the improvement in the country’s financial situation, they intend to maintain a prudent fiscal stance, consistent with past spending behavior. They are preparing a supplementary budget for 2008 which would reflect higher gas export prices and the effects of exchange rate unification. In particular, a surplus of about 4 percent of GDP could be expected, after explicitly incorporating the expenditures assumed in the contingency allowance in the original budget, as well the valuation impact on expenditure from the exchange system unification, and additional social spending/subsidies9 to limit the impact of unification on consumers. The authorities indicated that they would be monitoring the impact of unification on consumer prices, before deciding on an additional wage and pension increase in 2008. They were interested in working with international organizations to develop a more targeted approach to addressing the social impact of price and exchange rate reforms.                                                   8 Domestic and international airfares and public transport fares were increased substantially after the Article IV mission. These and other administrative price increases could result in a higher inflation outcome in 2008, but staff does not have sufficient information to revise  its projections. 9 Staff estimate this at about 1½ percent of GDP.

The authorities indicated that they intend to use part of the increased hydrocarbon revenue for public sector investment, especially to improve social and economic infrastructure.10 In view of the high import content of such projects, this increase in spending is considered consistent with the economy’s absorptive capacity. Staff estimate that there would be a large increase in the surplus on extrabudgetary operations, to about 21 percent of GDP. 20.      The authorities intend to reform the country’s budget system. The medium-term project (with European Union support) aims to implement comprehensive reforms in various budget areas, including macro-fiscal analysis, budget coverage and preparation, treasury operations, and accounting and reporting. As a step towards budget unification, the authorities abolished some sectoral extrabudgetary funds in early 2008. Monetary policy 21.      The CBT is committed to restraining inflation, and recognized that a successful nominal anchor would require adjustments in the monetary framework. They noted that in the near term, money demand is likely to be unpredictable, thus diminishing the signaling value of monetary aggregates. The exchange rate will therefore serve as the nominal anchor                                                   10 Historically, budget investment represented only a small share of public investment, compared with off-budget or state enterprise investments. The increase in the budget coverage started in 2007.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 15for the time being. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outlook and the impact of structural reforms, the authorities are open to considering further changes to the foreign exchange system, including greater flexibility, in due course. 22.      Reflecting its commitment to strengthen monetary policy, the CBT agreed on the need to limit the increase in directed credit. They explained that the sharp increase in CBT credit to banks and state enterprises in late 2007 and early 2008 was exceptional. They stressed that repayments of these loans had already begun, and such credit would be limited in the future. More generally, they were open to suggestions that progressively establishing central bank independence from directed credit pressures would be needed to strengthen monetary policy operations. Similarly, removal of the obligation for directed credits from commercial banks would be needed to enable them to afford market interest rates on deposits. This was a precondition for developing indirect monetary management instruments,11 in which the CBT and MOF are interested.  C.   Banking Reform 23.      The authorities identified banking sector operations as the next area of reform after exchange rate unification and currency redenomination. Key objectives would be to strengthen financial intermediation, especially in foreign exchange operations, attract savings, and provide improved banking services. The authorities are upgrading the payments system and considering options for increasing competition in the sector, including gradually allowing the entry of foreign banks.12 A pilot program is underway to introduce international financial reporting and auditing standards. This could be expedited as exchange rate unification has removed a significant impediment to achieving international standards. Also, the authorities are making progress towards establishing an AML/CFT framework, with Fund technical assistance.   D.   Other Issues 24.      Recognizing the importance of data quality for policy design and implementation, the authorities stressed their intentions to make progress in this area. The State Statistics Committee is working with the Fund sponsored advisor to improve national accounts and prices, and with the World Bank to survey living standards and assess the extent of the informal economy.                                                    11 In support of this, the staff presented a seminar about the issuance of government securities and the development of such a market, including for a country with a budget surplus. 12 Three banks with foreign shareholdings currently operate in Turkmenistan and a European bank is currently in discussions about opening a branch. The Avaza enterprise zone has been slated as the initial area for more liberal conditions for foreign banks. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 16IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 25.      Turkmenistan’s authorities should be commended for making a decisive start in reforming the economy. The early unification of the exchange system has sent the world a strong signal of their desire to move ahead with reforms. While further reforms will require persistence to face the inevitable challenges, the greatly strengthened external outlook should make the economic adjustments easier to manage. The staff encourages the authorities to reach out for international expertise in support of their reform agenda. 26.      Positioning the unified exchange rate broadly mid-way between the old official and commercial rates reflects a balance of factors in the context of uncertainties. This path to convergence reflected discussions with the staff and involved a substantial appreciation of the parallel/commercial exchange rate, permitted by the favorable external outlook. The strategy aimed to limit the inflationary impact of the unification, while at the same time having due regard for its adverse effect on competitiveness. The various methodologies for assessing the appropriateness of the level of the unified exchange rate give conflicting results, which preclude a confident assessment that the unified rate is either significantly undervalued or overvalued at the present time. 27.      The unification of the exchange system should provide a solid base for further reforms. The stability of the new exchange rate for the next year will provide a useful nominal anchor during the envisaged price reforms and currency redenomination. The authorities should implement the new regulatory framework for the foreign exchange market based on the policy of unrestricted access to foreign exchange for all current international transactions. Reductions in customs duty and excise rates and nontariff barriers to imports, in addition to other reforms to the business environment, will be needed to ameliorate the unification’s impact on inflation and competitiveness. As the reforms proceed, the operation of the foreign exchange market could be reviewed. 28.      Staff supports a moderate increase in public spending, in the context of a generally restrained fiscal stance.  It will be important to protect real household incomes while the effects of exchange rate unification and other administered price adjustments are being phased in. Staff urges the authorities to work with international organizations to develop a targeted approach to addressing the social impact of structural reform. While planned spending on productive sectors and rural development will have important economic and social benefits, the authorities should be prepared to review low-priority spending if excess demand pressures emerge. 29.      Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan and early steps in comprehensive budget reform. Following the substantial gains in fiscal management from exchange rate unification and administered price increases, upgrading budgetary management and control measures, and incorporating into the budget the government’s extra-budgetary operations, as well as Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 17reforming hydrocarbon revenue management, will be important to strengthen fiscal discipline, accountability, transparency, and project evaluation.  30.      CBT’s monetary operations should be strengthened to support the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. Notwithstanding the stability of the exchange rate, headline inflation may increase further for some time, as recent and prospective price adjustments work their way through the system following the exchange system unification. The CBT should tightly control its credit expansion, while moving to market-based instruments of monetary control and developing money and foreign exchange markets. Phasing out the requirement that the CBT and commercial banks provide credits to favored sectors and enterprises at low interest rates would provide the resources for banks to pay more attractive interest rates on deposits and promote a commercial banking culture. The financial burden of directed credits should be transferred to the budget.   31.      Efforts need to be made to address the very low level of financial intermediation in the economy. Developing more efficient account-based foreign exchange and domestic payment systems will be a start, but this needs to be complemented by more attractive interest rates and improved public confidence in banks, including perceptions about security and the privacy of client information. Although available indicators do not suggest problems in banks’ loan portfolios, the staff encourages the authorities to bring accounting and auditing up to international standards more rapidly. Staff also recommends developing more competition among the existing banks, as well as allowing the entry of reputable foreign banks to help stimulate international class services, and implementing core AML/CFT measures. 32.      Weaknesses in data quality continue to hamper surveillance and policy making. Staff welcomes the cooperative approach to addressing data issues in national accounts and prices, and encourages the authorities to consider the systematic publication of economic and financial data in statistical bulletins and other outlets. 33.      Turkmenistan maintains an exchange restriction and multiple currency practices subject to approval by the Fund under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) or 3, as described in the Informational Annex. While welcoming the recent progress, the staff does not recommend their approval and urges their elimination as soon as feasible. 34.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 18Table 1.

International Monetary Fund FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE [July – 2008] 700 19th Street, NW Washington, D. C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Turkmenistan    On July 16, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkmenistan.13 Background Turkmenistan is a landlocked country with an economy dominated by a large hydrocarbon sector (mainly natural gas) contributing about 25 percent of GDP and 90 percent of exports. Until recently, Turkmenistan maintained a state-dominated economy, lagging well behind other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries in economic reforms. However, in 2007 it launched a program of social and economic reforms, and improved relations with neighboring countries and international institutions. Reforms to the exchange system and administered prices began in early 2008, and steps were taken to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).  Economic conditions remain robust and the outlook for the hydrocarbon sector has greatly improved. In 2007, growth reached 11½ percent, driven by increased hydrocarbon output and broad-based activity in the non-hydrocarbon economy, including the construction, transport and communication, and retail sectors. Inflation was low for much of the year, but started to accelerate in the last quarter, due to higher international food prices and supply                                                   13 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

Headline inflation in the first half of 2008 was boosted further by the progressive adjustment of administered prices to market levels, with an 8-fold increase in domestic petroleum prices in February 2008, and very large increases in bus and rail fares and airline ticket prices in May and early June 2008. Inflation reached almost 16 percent in March 2008 (year on year).  The fiscal stance has generally been restrained. The 2007 budget surplus amounted to 4 percent of GDP. Revenue growth was only 4 percent, despite the large increase in hydrocarbon exports receipts, due to a change in the allocation of hydrocarbon revenues in favor of off-budget revenue. Expenditure was lower than budgeted, reflecting the slow execution of the investment program. Staff estimates that off-budget operations registered an additional surplus of 11 percent of GDP, with extrabudgetary government spending estimated at about 6 percent of GDP.  Monetary conditions loosened in the last quarter of 2007, but were tightened in early 2008. Credit to the economy grew 30 percent in 2007, reflecting a large increase in directed credits to the cotton sector, partly funded by the Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT). As a result, reserve money growth reached 70 percent, and manat broad money almost doubled. However, in the first quarter of 2008, the partial repayment of the agricultural loans and increased sales of dollars contributed to a sharp reduction in both reserve money and manat broad money.  Reflecting the favorable market conditions for hydrocarbon exports, the current account surplus and international reserves grew strongly in 2007. With hydrocarbon export revenues up 30 percent, the current account surplus reached 15½ percent of GDP and gross international reserves rose to $13 billion (equivalent to about 22 months of import cover), notwithstanding a 50 percent increase in imports. The recent growth in FDI inflows, mainly reflecting investments in offshore oil operations in the Caspian Sea, is expected to continue.  The process of exchange rate unification was launched at the start of 2008 and was completed on May 1, 2008. The former dual exchange rate system comprised (i) an official rate pegged at manat 5,200 per U.S. dollar; and (ii) a parallel market rate, 4-5 times more depreciated. Effective January 1, 2008, the authorities devalued the official rate to manat 6,250 per US dollar, and introduced a commercial rate of manat 20,000 per US dollar at which banks could trade freely with the public. Although the transition was originally planned to last for most of 2008, the two markets were unified on May 1, at the rate of manat 14,250 per US dollar, a level consistent with the country’s strong external position. At the start of June, the authorities issued new foreign exchange regulations, which allow the CBT to provide ready access to foreign exchange.  The banking sector remains very small and dominated by state banks. Direct monetary controls, the predominance of cash as a means of payment, and the distorted foreign exchange market (prior to unification) have limited its role in the economy. As a result, deposits are only Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public     27about 5 percent of GDP, while 90 percent of commercial bank credit goes to state enterprises, often at relatively low interest rates. The financial soundness indicators indicate banks’ general compliance with existing norms. To improve the accuracy of the assessment of the financial sector, a project to introduce International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the banking system is underway.  Executive Board Assessment  <Begin Typing Here>    Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
