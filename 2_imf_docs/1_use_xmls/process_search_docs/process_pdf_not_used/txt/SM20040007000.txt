The staff team met with the Governor of the Central Bank of Myanmar, U Kyaw Kyaw Maung, the Minister of Finance and Revenue,  Major-General Hla Tun, the Minister of National Planning and Economic Development, U Soe Tha, and other senior officials and private sector representatives. • The staff team comprised Messrs. Zanello (Head), Doi, Jarvis, Mercereau (all APD), and Frecaut (MFD). It was accompanied by staff of the World Bank (Mr. Matin) and the Asian Development Bank (Mr. Ganguly), and by Mrs. Rogers (OED).  Mrs. Indrawati (OED) attended the policy meetings.  • At the conclusion of the 2002 Article IV consultation, Directors emphasized the need for urgent measures to restore macroeconomic stability and sustain high growth over the medium term. In their view, even modest steps in reducing the fiscal deficit, unifying the exchange rate regime, strengthening the framework for monetary policy, reforming public enterprises, and liberalizing agriculture and trade would help reduce pervasive distortions and redress macroeconomic imbalances. Directors stressed that Myanmar needed to demonstrate its commitment to economic reform in order to regain the support of the international community. • Myanmar’s statistical base is inadequate to conduct effective surveillance. Official and independent estimates of key macroeconomic statistics differ widely. Data issues are discussed in Annex II. • Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although it has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. Myanmar maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund’s approval under Article VIII. • The authorities have not consented to publish the staff report or the PIN.  • The principal authors of this report are Messrs. Jarvis and Zanello.

High reported GDP growth is at odds with a falling investment share and the absence of structural reforms. The budgetary outturn in FY2002/03 continued a pattern of unsustainable fiscal deficits that feed inflation and currency depreciation in the parallel market. The balance of payments strengthened last year on the back of strong exports of gas and continued import compression, but import cover of reserves remains very low. • The near-term outlook has been undermined by internal and external shocks. A still-unresolved banking crisis and intensified international sanctions are likely to depress growth in 2003/04. The recent liberalization of the rice trade may not provide a significant offset. Inflation may decline with weakening domestic demand, but only temporarily.  • Pervasive structural weaknesses cloud longer-term prospects. A dual exchange rate system and associated administrative controls distort economic decisions and encourage corruption. State enterprises continue to be a drain on the budget and a drag on growth. Absent a reorientation of macroeconomic and structural policies, Myanmar is trapped in a low-income trajectory, highly vulnerable to shocks. Policy issues • The authorities are concerned that lack of external financial assistance limits the scope for adjustment. Discussions focused on modest steps that promise significant benefits even ahead of greater engagement with the international community. The reforms proposed by the staff do not require foreign financing and are mutually reinforcing. The authorities are still reluctant to embrace a coherent reform strategy. • Restoring fiscal sustainability is a top macroeconomic priority. Fiscal reform must safeguard the already low social spending. There is scope for redirecting unproductive expenditure toward social needs and reducing the drain on the budget from state enterprises. Higher revenues can be secured in the context of the existing tax structure.  • A move to a flexible unified exchange rate regime is key to an improved allocation of resources. There are several approaches to exchange rate unification that do not require foreign financial support and meet the authorities’ preference for a gradual approach. • Structural reform must complement macroeconomic adjustment to unlock Myanmar’s growth potential. There is an urgent need to resolve the banking crisis. State enterprises must face tighter budget constraints and operate on a more commercial basis. Additional steps to reinvigorate agriculture, including a flexible implementation of the new rice trade regime, are necessary. Pervasive administrative controls that impede trade and push activity into the gray economy must be dismantled.

Myanmar faces grave economic problems—the result of failed policies and increasing isolation. Per capita GDP is now significantly below that of other low-income Asian countries (Box 1). Poverty is widespread, and health and education indicators underline the precarious existence of most of the population. Reforms, started in the late 1980s without the support of an appropriate macroeconomic strategy, ground to a halt in the early 1990s. Persistent budget deficits have since resulted in macroeconomic instability. A dual exchange rate system and associated administrative controls distort economic decisions and encourage corruption. In confronting these problems, Myanmar must at present rely largely on its own resources: foreign aid and foreign direct investment have slowed to a trickle in recent years.  2.      Prospects would improve if the authorities undertook complementary macroeconomic and structural reforms. Myanmar has abundant natural resources and considerable potential for growth, especially in agriculture and tourism. A bold reorientation of policies is needed to unlock this potential. However, even modest reforms, undertaken in the context of a coherent policy framework that exploits their synergies, promises significant benefits. Such reforms would also indicate the authorities’ commitment to policy change and could set the stage for greater involvement by the international community when the political climate improves. 3.      Recent policy recommendations by the Fund have remained unheeded. Executive Directors have repeatedly stressed the need for comprehensive reforms and at the time of the last Article IV consultation also noted the potential benefits of more modest, gradual reforms. The authorities have in general not disagreed with these recommendations, but have been reluctant to embrace them because of concerns about institutional capacity and lack of foreign financial assistance. Consultation discussions have been complicated by Myanmar’s highly centralized decision making and the inability of Fund staff to have substantive discussions with the political leadership. II.   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK 4.      Official statistics point to continued robust growth, but their reliability is questionable. The authorities report four years of double-digit growth through FY2002/03 (April–March), and indicators such as electricity consumption, cement production, and the number of licensed motor vehicles suggest that growth was strong in 2002/03 (Table 1 and Figure 1). On the other hand, growth of agricultural output (which drives the bulk of economic activity) fell sharply during the year. Recent official growth figures, when set alongside developments in inputs, (e.g., capital, land, and energy consumption), imply implausible improvements in productivity, and are at odds with widespread perceptions that living standards continue to fall (Box 2). 5.      Inflation picked up and the parallel exchange rate depreciated through most of the last fiscal year. Monetary financing of the deficit and a sharp increase in private sector credit resulted in inflation rising to 50 percent during 2002/03.

Myanmar’s Performance in a Regional Context  As regards macroeconomic performance over the last decade, Myanmar does not stand out as an extreme outlier against broadly similar countries in the region (i.e., with a low level of development, a large agricultural sector, a pervasive role of the state in the economy, and a recent history of conflict).   This may reflect the likely optimistic bias in key official economic statistics. For example, the reported average GDP growth rate over the last ten years for Myanmar is difficult to reconcile with the limited progress made by Myanmar on many social dimensions (see tables). Myanmar still has the lowest GDP per capita of the group (see figure).   Vietnam is perhaps the closest comparator in terms of resource endowment and conditions at the start of its core transition (1988–89). Vietnam, at the time under international sanctions, succeeded in redressing macroeconomic imbalances, dynamizing the export sector, and promoting private enterprises. The policies behind these achievements hold lessons for Myanmar:  • Unification of the exchange rate regime: A flexible, market-oriented exchange rate policy has underpinned Vietnam’s export-led growth. Distortions associated with multiple exchange rates were eliminated by unification in 1989. At the same time, strict administrative controls on the holding and use of foreign exchange were dismantled. • Reform of public enterprises: In the late 1980s State Economic Enterprises’ (SEEs) share in GDP was about one-fourth, the share in Myanmar today. SEEs were gradually granted autonomy in decision making and subjected to hard budget constraints and increased competition. Most subsidies were eliminated. • Agricultural and trade liberalization: In 1987 the share of agriculture in GDP was about 40 percent, similar to Myanmar’s at present. The response of Vietnam’s agricultural sector to reforms was rapid: in the span of three years Vietnam turned from a net importer of food to the third largest exporter of rice, with expanded paddy production contributing over 3 percent to GDP growth in 1988–89. Key to the strong supply response were: liberalization of agricultural prices, greater competition among agricultural trading companies, the establishment of land user rights, and the removal of internal barriers to trade. The industrial and service sectors benefited from price liberalization, the unification of the exchange regime, the abolition of foreign exchange surrendering requirements, and the opening up of external trade. Access to credit and nondiscriminatory taxation and commercial legislation supported private sector development. • Macroeconomic stabilization: Monetary financing of the fiscal deficit (which in 1989 was at a rate comparable to the current one in Myanmar) was eliminated and some restructured SEEs became net contributors to the budget. As inflation fell, real interest rates became positive, enhancing the attractiveness of bank intermediation. Investment—including FDI—recovered sharply, setting the stage for sustained growth.

Looking Behind Myanmar’s GDP Figures: Anomalies and Statistical Problems  Estimates of Myanmar’s GDP are subject to more than usual uncertainty due to a number of problems in the collection and analysis of statistics. Even abstracting from methodological issues, not all contributions to GDP are captured in the official statistics. At the same time, there are indications that GDP growth may have been overestimated in recent years. Finally, the use of the official exchange rate for accounting purposes makes Myanmar’s statistics opaque both to outsiders and to those who compile them. This box elaborates on these points. There is a large informal sector which is not captured in the official statistics, which causes GDP to be understated. The informal sector includes both production of prohibited goods (e.g., narcotics) and also trade in legitimate goods, which is not reported because of avoidance of exchange and trade restrictions. In the external accounts, much of the border trade with Myanmar’s neighbors is also not reported. Thus, the staff’s estimate of per capita GDP of $175, which is based on conversion of official kyat figures at an exchange rate which gives a 70 percent weight to the free market exchange rate and a 30 percent weight to the official exchange rate, probably underestimates the level of development. On the other hand, anomalies in the GDP data suggest that GDP growth figures have been overstated in recent years. Official data show an increase in real GDP of 39 percent over the last three years. However, official data also show that over the same period the growth rates of agricultural land area and other inputs to agricultural and industrial production were much lower, and were in some cases negative. Agricultural output is reported to have increased by 24 percent, but harvested acreage only increased by 10 percent and the irrigated area by 17 percent, while use of fertilizers and pesticides has fallen since the late 1990s. Similarly, industrial production is reported to have increased by 91 percent, but industrial power consumption has only increased by 28 percent, and manufacturing use of petroleum products by 29 percent, while imports of capital goods have fallen by 33 percent. These figures imply an implausibly large increase in productive efficiency, given the lack of structural progress and technological change. The dual exchange rate system distorts the national accounts data and conceals important developments. All imports and exports are valued in the national accounts at the official exchange rate of K 8.5 per SDR. Since the parallel exchange rate is about 150 times this rate, the result is that exports and imports are systematically underestimated in the GDP figures. The national accounts appear to show a virtually closed economy. The significant increase in gas exports in recent years barely registers in the GDP figures, and the sharp fall in imports of capital goods is only partly reflected in data showing investment as a share of GDP. In the public sector, public investment is understated, and it is impossible to develop an accurate picture of the financial position of exporting and importing public enterprises, since the production of the former and the purchases of the latter are greatly understated.

In spite of some improvement, the fiscal deficit remained substantial, and continued to be financed by money creation. Preliminary data suggest that the deficit was about 4 percent of GDP in 2002/03, less than the 6 percent of GDP recorded in 2001/02 (Table 2) but nearly twice the budget target. There is a history of poor budgetary control, reflecting entrenched institutional weaknesses. Total revenue as a share of GDP (at about 5 percent in 2002/03) remains well below that of other countries in the region. The deficit is almost entirely financed by the central bank: external and domestic commercial bank financing was negligible in 2002/03. 2 Despite the deficit, low nominal interest rates (set by the government) and high inflation kept the burden of domestic public debt broadly stable, at around 20 percent of GDP.  7.      The trade balance and official reserves improved in 2002/03, but Myanmar’s external position remains precarious (Figure 2). Notwithstanding an effective appreciation of about 35 percent in the real exchange rate during 2002/03, there was a trade surplus of some $550 million, compared to a deficit of about $360 million in 2001/02 (Table 3). This reflected in part gas exporting facilities coming on stream, and in part tighter restrictions on imports. Import licenses, which are granted only to exporters against a portion of their export earnings, have become harder to obtain. Higher gas revenues were partially offset by profit transfers (most of the gas production is by foreign companies), tourist arrivals remain flat, and foreign direct investment is close to zero. Gross reserves are about $610 million (about three months of imports), but net reserves are about half this level.3 External debt is estimated to be about $6 billion.  8.      The near-term outlook has worsened as a result of a banking crisis and the intensification of international sanctions. A run on private banks started in February of last                                                   1Myanmar operates a dual exchange rate system. The official rate for the kyat is K 8.5 per SDR, and is used for transactions by the public sector, including trade by state enterprises, which is estimated at 30 percent of the total. The Foreign Exchange Certificate (FEC) rate, the rate at which the central bank makes foreign exchange available to private businesses and individuals, is currently reported to be about K 850 per U.S. dollar. 2The central bank is a department of the Ministry of Finance and Revenue.  3Gross reserves include a $200 million renewable six-month loan from Malaysia, which has been routinely rolled over.

The private banks’ troubles are not over and the impact of the banking crisis, especially on investment, has not yet been fully felt. However, businesses are already reported to have been badly affected by limits on deposit withdrawals, disruptions to the payments system, and forced early repayment of loans. State-owned banks have not been subject to runs, but they have problems of their own, notably the emergence of large open net foreign exchange positions. International sanctions were intensified in mid year. The United States imposed a ban on imports from Myanmar which has resulted in substantial job losses in the garment industry. In addition, U.S. persons have been prohibited from providing any financial services to Myanmar, including trade facilitation, banking services, and money transfers. Already low tourist arrivals are likely to remain flat in the face of continued political tension and boycotts in advanced countries.  9.      Growth is projected to be negligible in 2003/04, import cover to decline, and inflation to fall—temporarily. Growth is likely to be near zero in 2003/04, given constraints on imported inputs, structural rigidities, and the delayed effects of sanctions and the banking crisis.4 With a weaker current account and limited capital inflows, import cover of reserves is projected to fall. Increased demand for currency resulted in an appreciation of the exchange rate in the first half of 2003/04, which has since been reversed. On anecdotal evidence, inflation slowed as well. For 2003/04 it will likely be at 20 percent, or about half the previous year’s rate. On current policies, however, inflation will pick up again. Although the 2003/04 budget envisages a deficit of less than 2 percent of GDP, more realistic assumptions about public expenditure point to a less favorable outturn and continued inflationary financing. The staff projects a deficit of about 4½ percent of GDP.  III.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS The authorities’ current Five-Year Plan aims at balancing the fiscal accounts, curbing inflation, and attaining high sustained growth by 2005/06. However, the mission’s view is that these objectives will remain out of reach under current policies. The authorities view the lack of external assistance as ruling out any fundamental macroeconomic and structural adjustment. Accordingly, the focus was on gradual reforms in several areas.  A.   Macroeconomic Policies 10.      Current political and institutional realities limit the scope for a policy reorientation. The authorities stressed passionately that international isolation had forced Myanmar to develop through self-reliance for years. Daunting challenges remain, but in the absence of donor support there are limits to the economic adjustments that could be made without undermining social stability. The mission acknowledged the difficult environment but noted that much could still be achieved ahead of an improvement in Myanmar’s                                                    4The authorities are more upbeat about the impact of the shocks. They expect growth to be close to 10 percent, in part as a result of a strong pickup in the nonagricultural sectors.

Banking Crisis in Myanmar  The current banking crisis is particularly acute. Massive runs on Myanmar’s private banks began in February 2003, in the wake of the collapse of several “private services companies” that had lured investors into pyramid-lending schemes and amidst rumors of related losses by the two largest institutions.1 However, problems had been looming in the banking sector since the second quarter of 2002, when several years of sustained growth came to a sudden halt, possibly as a result of the bursting of a speculative bubble on gold and the introduction of anti-money laundering legislation. On the most recently available data, the hemorrhage of deposits has continued through September 2003. As a share of GDP, deposits in the private bank have shrunk to one-fourth of their March 2002 peak. Such a contraction in deposits is unprecedented.  The authorities’ response has relied on strong moral suasion. They suggested that banks restrict withdrawals and stop all outflow-generating operations (bank transfers, and credit cards or ATM transactions). At the same time, direct pressures were applied by the authorities and bank managers on borrowers to repay loans ahead of schedule. These proved effective, as the decrease in outstanding loans to the private sector kept broadly in line with the drop in deposits. As a result, no bank has failed, and emergency liquidity support provided by the central bank and the largest state-owned bank has been limited to about 2½ percent of GDP. The authorities have also enforced a tight news blackout on banking issues since the onset of the crisis.  Financial distress has been redirected from the banks to the real sector. The early repayment of loans has generated severe disruptions in the private sector, with a collapse in prices of real estate and other stores of value, and a sharp drop in retail sales. It might be expected that a significant share of the loans that have not been repaid in spite of the pressures will be difficult to recover.  The apparent return to banking stability is misleading. Although all banks have survived so far, some have seen their business contract by a factor of five—a probably fatal shock in an industry characterized by high fixed costs. Moreover, the repayment of the emergency liquidity support has been sluggish at best, revealing persistent financial distress.   1Private commercial banks were first permitted in 1992 and at end-2002 accounted for about 70 percent of total deposits and three-fourths of total loans to the private sector, mostly for construction and trade.

There was agreement that the root cause of macroeconomic instability is lack of fiscal discipline. Persistent deficits, caused by poor revenue mobilization and weak expenditure controls, continue to fuel a vicious cycle of inflation and depreciation of the domestic currency in the parallel market. A pervasive system of implicit subsidies and taxes, arising in part from the dual exchange rate system, also contributes to fiscal stress. The authorities reaffirmed their goal to balance the budget by 2005/06, but recognized that the necessary measures had not been fully worked out and that the budgetary process favors recurrent overruns.6 The mission stressed that a realistic consolidation strategy must safeguard the already low social spending, be supported by other macroeconomic and structural reforms, and specify upfront a path for adjustment on both the revenue and expenditure sides. In its view, fiscal adjustment was made all the more necessary by the fragility of the banking system, the likely budgetary implications of the end of forced procurement of rice, and—more broadly—the need to address vast development needs. 12.      The priority is a stronger revenue effort. The authorities and the staff agreed that this could be achieved in the short term within the current tax system. There is scope for strengthening tax compliance and limiting exemptions and loopholes. In addition, import duties could be boosted by shifting to an assessment of import values based on the market exchange rate.7 Outdated excises, whose real value has been obliterated by decades of inflation, could be restored to appropriate levels, and user charges (particularly for land, water, and timber) could be brought back to realistic rates.8 Staff calculations show that these measures could increase the revenue ratio by some 1–2 percent of GDP. The authorities noted that some initiatives were in the pipeline. The staff cautioned that any initiatives should be implemented transparently and fairly, pointing to a recent decision to impose retroactive taxes on private car owners as symptomatic of an ad hoc approach that lacks coherence and undermines public trust in the government’s economic policies. 13.      Over the longer term, tax reform should aim at overhauling the current complex and inefficient tax structure. Tax administration, now involving a plethora of agencies,                                                  5Vietnam, for example, implemented crucial reforms in price controls and foreign exchange management ahead of the end of sanctions in 1993 and well ahead of significant multilateral financial flows. 6Unbudgeted capital spending routinely takes place in the course of the fiscal year and is sanctioned ex post in a supplementary budget. 7Import duties are valued at multiple official exchange rates, which are six to nine times more appreciated than the current parallel market exchange rate. 8Reportedly, some of these charges remain at rates set by the British colonial administration early last century. For example, the yearly charge for the use of land—which is all state property—is still K 5 per acre.

The commercial tax should be replaced with a value-added tax to increase revenue and the efficiency of taxation. Agriculture could be brought into the tax net by imposing an income tax on the largest producers.9 Finally, a more transparent and predictable regulatory environment would help forestall the growth of the informal sector and broaden the tax base. In the authorities’ view, institutional capacity constraints—and lack of technical assistance—limit the prospects for progress on tax reform at present. 14.      Expenditure adjustment must focus on reductions in unproductive spending and reform of the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs). At the level of the central government, insufficient social spending and unsustainably low wages for public sector employees constrain the room for expenditure restraint.10 However, public spending can be better prioritized and realigned with social needs. Greater priority should be given to the provision of health, education, and basic social services to alleviate poverty and safeguard human capital. The authorities noted that defense spending has been on a declining trend and that the government’s ongoing drive to bolster infrastructure reflects a significant reorientation of expenditure. The mission welcomed these developments but noted that reported defense expenditure still exceeds public spending on social services and that public investment without the benefit of a multi-year investment plan lacks direction and is at the expense of maintenance outlays on existing infrastructure—undermining the objectives of the authorities. Overall, there was agreement that expenditure adjustment should rely on improved budgetary controls and a reform of the SEEs. These operate under grossly distorted incentives arising from an opaque financial framework and the dual exchange rate regime, and continue to be a large drain on the budget.  15.      The staff argued that replacement of the dual exchange rate regime by a more flexible unified exchange rate system is essential. The dual exchange rate system has distorted relative prices, adversely affected investment and production decisions, provided fertile ground for corruption, and imposed serious costs on the economy. The staff reviewed several options that meet the authorities’ preference for gradual liberalization and—in its view—will not require external financial assistance.11 While a choice between these alternatives is ultimately a political and administrative matter, a credible commitment to exchange rate reform will need a clear timetable for full unification (say, one to two years).                                                  9Income and profit tax is at present levied on only 200,000 taxpayers in the nonagricultural sectors. At present, there are no direct taxes on agriculture other than the implicit tax (now abandoned for rice) of procurement at below market prices. 10The wage scale of a civil servant is about K 7,000–15,000 per month. Additional in-kind benefits are reportedly some 25 percent of base wage. 11The proposals involve: (i) reducing over time SEEs’ access to foreign exchange at the official rate; (ii) gradually removing selected exporting and importing SEEs from the obligation to transact at the official rate; and (iii) abolishing the official rate but introducing an explicit system of subsidies (to compensate importing SEEs) and taxes (to capture the gains to exporting SEEs), which would then be phased out over time.

The authorities stressed the political sensitivity of the matter and were not ready to embrace any of the mission’s suggestions. They stressed the need for external financial assistance, fearing an adverse impact of exchange rate unification on reserves, on the budget, and on the poor. In response, the mission noted that higher exports and lower imports arising from expenditure-switching would likely improve the balance of payments in the transition to full unification. The budgetary impact could be mitigated if unification is undertaken in tandem with structural and fiscal reforms. Finally, explicit and well-targeted subsidies could be designed to address distributional concerns.  17.      The central bank needs greater operational autonomy to contribute to macro-economic stability. The mission noted that monetary policy is essentially passive at present, and interest rates are fixed at levels which are strongly negative in real terms. A radical change in monetary conduct is unlikely until fiscal imbalances are brought under control or alternative means of deficit financing are mobilized. Nonetheless, the mission urged the authorities to take steps to reduce financing of the deficit by the central bank and, in time, give the bank responsibility for controlling monetary aggregates in pursuit of disinflation. The mission recommended the gradual adoption of a more flexible interest rate policy, for example, by increasing the margin by which deposit and lending rates can exceed the central bank discount rate.12 This would be consistent with monetary targeting and could bring deposits back into the banking system. The authorities responded that some increase in interest rates was under consideration.  B.   Structural Issues Myanmar’s structural reform agenda is formidable, and the authorities’ capacity to implement it limited. Against this background, discussions focused on a few areas where measures are essential complements to macroeconomic adjustment. 18.      In the staff’s view, a strategy for resolving the banking crisis was urgently needed. The mission thought that there were still indications of continued lack of depositors’ confidence and of deep financial distress at some private banks. State banks are also facing a deteriorating loan portfolio and show other weaknesses in their balance sheets (notably a large net open foreign exchange position). The fragility of the situation is partly hidden by the restrictions still in place, inadequate prudential regulation, and regulatory forbearance.13                                                  12The authorities have in the past ruled out a sudden liberalization of interest rates, which in their view would undermine industrial development. 13The regulatory framework is unable to capture and measure banking fragilities. The reported capital adequacy ratio is misleading, because of inappropriate risk weighting, while the loan classification and provisioning norms are too lax to detect the deterioration in loan quality resulting from the crisis. Forbearance has taken the form of exceptional roll-overs of emergency liquidity assistance, which should have been fully repaid within 92 days. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 13 -  The extraordinary collapse in deposits and credit points to the likelihood of substantial disruptions to trade and economic activity in the near term, notwithstanding the limited role that financial intermediation still plays in the economy. Longer-term damage to growth prospects is also possible if the development of the nascent financial system is stunted by the loss of confidence. Thus, restoring confidence in the banking sector is an urgent priority. An effective strategy for crisis resolution would comprise lifting existing restrictions on deposit withdrawals and lending, liquidity assistance under appropriate safeguards, and intervention in insolvent institutions. These steps should be complemented by an upward adjustment in interest rates, a gradual tightening of prudential regulations, and liberalization of entry into the banking system, including for joint ventures with foreign participation.  19.      The authorities and bank representatives had a more optimistic reading of the impact of the crisis. They thought that the situation was rapidly reverting to normal. Only a handful of banks remained marginally affected and they would soon be allowed to resume operations. Informal credit channels had cushioned the impact of the loan recall campaign on borrowers at the height of the liquidity crunch. Limits on deposit withdrawals reflected cooperative arrangements between banks and their customers that were intrinsic to Myanmar’s culture of mutual support. Also, a return of depositors’ confidence was, in the authorities’ view, evidenced by a pickup in bank transfers and an increase in intermediation at the largest state bank. The mission cautioned strongly against complacency, highlighting the costs of inaction. It called for upfront steps to stabilize the banking sector.  20.      Reform of the SEEs continues to be a high priority in the structural agenda. There was agreement between the staff and the authorities that the efficiency of state economic enterprises needs to improve to reduce costs to the budget and free resources to the private sector.14 The mission noted that tightening budget constraints and putting operations on a more commercial basis will be facilitated by the start of exchange rate unification which, by making explicit the tax and subsidies provided to the SEEs, will clarify their financial position.15 The staff noted that lack of SEE reform limits the scope and hinders the implementation of the authorities’ privatization plans, thus depriving the budget of needed revenues.16 The authorities thought that the implementation schedule was on track and that its scope was constrained by the strategic importance of certain enterprises. 21.      The new policy of liberalizing the rice trade holds promise but more must be done to energize the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounts for about half of Myanmar’s GDP, and rice for about half of all agricultural land use, so effective liberalization could produce a significant impact on GDP and on household incomes. The authorities noted that                                                  14Reported SEE losses have accounted for about one-third of budget deficits over the past decade and SEEs account for about one-fourth of GDP. These figures are understated due to the valuation of SEEs’ foreign exchange transactions at the official exchange rate. 15This is currently masked to a large extent by the pooling of all SEEs’ revenues in a State Fund Account against which SEEs then draw their budgetary allocations and any additional funds needed to finance their operations. 16In 2002/03, 24 enterprises were privatized, mostly cinema halls and a few saw mills.

They had high hopes that the discontinuation of the rice procurement policy (at below-market prices) and the opening up of the rice trade will boost agricultural production and export earnings (Box 4). The mission noted that state involvement remains heavy-handed even under the revised policy which, although welcome, will likely have only a limited impact for some time to come. There was agreement that flexibility in implementation is critical. More broadly, the mission noted that other structural and regulatory constraints (including the absence of clear user rights for most cultivated land, poor infrastructure, erratic power supply, and an unpredictable business environment) hold back agricultural investment and growth, and need to be addressed to reinvigorate the sector. 22.      Trade remains hampered by ad hoc administrative measures and exchange restrictions. Myanmar has nominally undertaken tariff reforms since 1999, but pervasive nontariff barriers (NTBs) in the form of a priority import list and often opaque administrative requirements continue to hamper trade and foster rent-seeking.17 The authorities agreed on the desirability of eliminating these impediments but stressed that for now they are necessitated by the scarcity of foreign exchange. They also noted that steps toward a more liberal environment are being negotiated in the context of regional and bilateral trade agreements.18 The mission observed that the need for restrictions ultimately stems from the dual exchange rate regime and progress toward unification would ease—and be supported by—their gradual removal. Myanmar continues to maintain exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.19                                                  17Myanmar participates in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Common Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme, on a special track toward tariff harmonization. Current tariff levels range from 0 to 40 percent but the effective tariff rate is only 2 percent, as a result of widespread exemptions. At least 20 percent of approved imports must relate to goods on a priority list. Only holders of foreign exchange can import. Exporters are subject to a 10 percent export tax, payable in foreign exchange. Licenses for imports and exports are granted only to nationals. 18For example, in the context of negotiation with China on the ASEAN-China Comprehen-sive Economic Partnership, Myanmar has been receiving since January 1, 2004 special preferential tariff treatment on 110 product lines (mostly fish and oil seeds). NTB issues are reportedly being addressed in bilateral talks with Australia and New Zealand. 19Exchange restrictions arise from: (i) limits on purchases of foreign exchange by residents for foreign travel; (ii) prior approval requirements on the remittable portion of wages of nonresidents; and (iii) monthly limits on conversion of FECs for payments and transfers relating to invisible and other current account transactions. A multiple currency practice arises from the divergence between the exchange rate for official transactions and the FEC rate.

It accounts for the bulk of agricultural production and some 20 percent of household consumption. Unsurprisingly, a rice stalk graces the national flag.   In contrast to its continued domestic importance, the role of rice in external trade has shrunk dramatically. Once the world’s top rice exporter, Myanmar’s share in the international rice trade has been on a downward trend through most of the 20th century. From a peak of 3,000,000 tons in the late 1930s, exports have dwindled to 250,000 tons on average in the 1990s, notwithstanding higher production.   While the factors behind this trend are complex, the government’s rice policy has played a role. For over 40 years the government has pursued forced procurement of 10–20 percent of total production at prices some 30 percent below market. The procured supplies have been used to meet the needs of the army, civil servants, internal relief programs, and—more recently—to contribute to a strategic reserve. On some accounts, the political sensitivity of rice in Myanmar is underscored by a close historical correlation between social unrest and its domestic price.   The government announced in April 2003 that compulsory procurement would cease starting with the fall harvest and that the rice trade, including exports, would be open to all nationals, government organizations excluded.  The new trading regime will be regulated by a new policymaking body, the Leading Rice Trading Committee (LRTC), headed by the Secretary-1 of the State Peace and Development Council and comprising four ministers and representatives of the private sector. The LRTC will oversee the establishment of rice traders and millers associations throughout the country to manage the new system.   Under the new policy, these associations will be required to sell rice to the government for its own uses at farm-gate prices. Rice exports will be allowed with the permission of the LRTC only when there is a domestic surplus. There will be a 10 percent export tax on the value of exports and the remaining 90 percent of the foreign exchange proceeds will be shared equally between the government and the exporter. In return, the government will contribute (in domestic currency) 50 percent of costs incurred by the exporter, including the export tax.  Details on implementation were still under review at the time of the mission. The available information points to the likelihood that the supply response may initially be muted. The overall approach appears overly bureaucratic (for example, export licenses would need to be approved by a Rice Sub-Committee, the Myanmar Agricultural Produce Trading enterprise, the Ministry of Commerce, and the LRTC). There is also lack of clarity on the terms of the government refund to the exporters and uncertainties about traders’ access to state-owned storage facilities and producers’ access to key inputs. In addition, the banking crisis will limit the availability of trade credit. An additional unresolved issue is the likely budgetary impact of the end of compulsory procurement, which could be on the order of 0.5 percent of GDP. Concerns about implementation of the new policy have been amplified by a January 2004 decision of the government to ban all exports of rice (as well as chili, onions, sesame, and maize) for a six-month period.   Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 16 -  23.      Little progress has been made toward normalizing relations with foreign creditors. External debt statistics are incomplete but the stock of arrears is estimated at more than half of total external debt. The authorities noted that, with the drying up of concessional assistance, increasing recourse is made to commercial loans and suppliers’ credit, which receive priority in external debt servicing. There is no strategy in place to clear arrears to multilateral creditors and a memorandum of understanding with Japan (the largest bilateral creditor) to write off maturities falling due is still under discussion. 24.      The authorities issued in December 2003 regulations to implement their Control of Money Laundering Law. The regulations provide for some anti-money laundering (AML) preventive obligations (costumer due diligence, appropriate record-keeping, and reporting of suspicious transactions). They also include some provisions of criminal procedural law. However, the authorities’ overall AML framework continues to have shortcomings, including a failure to clearly define what constitutes money laundering, a failure to address directly the financing of terrorism, lack of sufficient guarantees against abuses in the reversal of the onus of proof on the origin of suspected funds, and reliance on an overly bureaucratic institutional structure. The authorities have requested technical assistance on AML matters. 25.      Shortcomings in Myanmar’s statistics and data dissemination inhibit policy formulation, Fund surveillance, and the private sector’s assessments of economic developments. An already bad situation has been made worse by the authorities’ recent decision to suspend publication of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin. Other statistical work, (a household survey, an updated consumer price index, analyses of progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals, and the Myanmar 2002 Yearbook) has been completed but has not been authorized for general release by the political leadership. The mission impressed on the authorities the urgency of reversing their disclosure policy and strengthen-ing the statistical base. The authorities agreed that efforts were needed to improve the quality and timeliness of economic statistics, and requested further Fund technical assistance. C.   Medium-Term Prospects 26.      Under current policies, the prospects are for economic stagnation, a return to high inflation, and continued external vulnerability (Table 4). Growth prospects are clouded by structural rigidities. Even with positive effects from the liberalization of the rice trade, growth in agriculture—the backbone of the economy—is likely to slow to a more sustainable pace. With continued fiscal laxity, inflation will stay high, and the exchange rate will continue to depreciate. The external position will remain precarious, with imports compressed, foreign exchange reserves limited, and arrears increasing. In this scenario, Myanmar is highly vulnerable to an adverse shock, and the room for policy maneuver is extremely limited. The authorities reiterated that they saw the short-term growth outlook more favorably, but did not otherwise challenge the thrust of the staff analysis. 27.      Reforms would raise growth prospects, bring inflation under control, and reduce external vulnerability (Table 5). The structural measures discussed in this report would boost growth through supply and efficiency effects. A stronger revenue effort and improved budgetary control would allow the authorities to make progress toward budget balance, while increasing social spending and setting public sector wages at a sustainable level. Inflation would fall and external vulnerability would be reduced, as reforms boost exports and attract Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 17 -  capital inflows. Resolution of the banking problems would support real credit growth. This scenario does not assume increased availability of external financing, which could improve prospects to an even greater extent. D.   Staff Appraisal 28.      A fundamental policy reorientation is needed to restore a sustainable policy mix and unlock Myanmar’s potential. The authorities’ objectives to regain a sound fiscal position, reduce inflation, and secure sustained growth are appropriate, but they are not attainable under current policies. Ad hoc measures do not address the underlying problems and only contribute to a further deterioration of the investment climate and the outlook.  29.      The near-term outlook has worsened as a result of imprudent policies, the intensification of international sanctions, and a still-simmering banking crisis. The authorities should not be misled by high reported growth. Medium-term prospects are for a low-level income path dangerously vulnerable to shocks. The authorities are well advised to develop an economic strategy that restores room for maneuver and sets the stage for sustainable development and durable poverty alleviation. 30.      Even modest reforms, undertaken in the context of a coherent policy framework, promise significant benefits. While bold measures would ensure a clean break from current trends, political and institutional realities support the case for a more gradual approach. The reforms proposed by the staff are feasible, do not require foreign financing, and are mutually reinforcing. They might entail some short-run costs, but these costs are far less than the costs of delaying the needed adjustment and appear manageable if the reforms are undertaken together. With a credible commitment to economic reform, Myanmar can make progress ahead of greater engagement with the international community. 31.      The authorities need a clear strategy to attain fiscal sustainability. Chronic fiscal deficits financed through money-printing are at the root of persistently high inflation and continued depreciation of the kyat in the parallel market. Fiscal reform must safeguard the already low social spending. There is scope for redirecting unproductive expenditure toward social needs and reducing the drain on the public finances from state economic enterprises. Revenue mobilization, which is hampered by inefficient tax measures and nontransparent methods of collection, is essential to achieve a sustainable fiscal position. Higher revenues can be secured over the short term in the context of the existing tax structure. 32.      Exchange rate unification remains a top priority. A move to a flexible unified exchange rate regime is key to an improved allocation of resources and a more efficient state enterprise sector. Through the distortions it creates, the current dual exchange rate system prevents Myanmar from benefiting fully from international trade and developing its areas of comparative advantage. There are several approaches to gradual exchange rate unification that meet the authorities’ concerns and do not require foreign financial support.  33.      Unification of the exchange rate will set the stage for reform of state economic enterprises by making explicit the system of implicit taxes and subsidies currently in effect. The SEEs are at present a drag on growth and a drain on the budget. State enterprise reform should aim at gradually tightening budget constraints and at putting operations on a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 18 -  more commercial basis. Privatization so far has been slow and piecemeal: state enterprise reform should catalyze a more ambitious prioritization effort. 34.      The central bank needs greater operational autonomy to contribute to macroeconomic stability. Recourse to central bank financing of the fiscal deficit should be reined in and the monetary framework should be focused clearly on the pursuit of disinflation. Interest rates should be adjusted flexibly to prevent real rates from becoming negative and restore efficient bank intermediation. 35.      A crisis resolution strategy is urgently required for the banking sector. The continuing erosion of depositors’ and borrowers’ confidence needs to be reversed by prompt action, including the lifting of current restrictions on bank activities and the provision of liquidity assistance under appropriate safeguards. Insolvent institutions must be identified and intervened, and there is a need for a clear communication of the authorities’ strategy to support the banking sector. The authorities need to do more to strengthen prudential oversight and bring the supervisory framework in line with international norms. 36.      The recent policy of liberalizing the rice trade is welcome but it must be implemented flexibly and with greater clarity. Agricultural reform in other areas, including land tenure, access to rural credit, and remaining procurement practices, should proceed apace to unlock the dynamism of the sector.  37.      Pervasive impediments to business activity need to be dismantled. Administrative restrictions and barriers to trade stunt the development of the formal private sector and create a culture of poor governance that undermines public confidence in the authorities’ economic management. Liberalization of these controls, as well as normalization of relations with foreign creditors, would encourage investment and export growth. Myanmar maintains restrictions and multiple currency practices that are subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. In view of the absence of a clear timetable for their elimination, the staff does not recommend their approval. 38.      The recent issuance of regulations to implement the Control of Money Laundering Law bears witness to the authorities’ desire to fall in step with the international community’s stance on these matters. However, further action is needed to address shortcomings in the current framework and lend full credibility to Myanmar’s commitment to combat the financing of crime and terrorism. 39.      It is regrettable that the Myanmar economy is becoming less transparent to outside observers and to its own citizens. Better collection and dissemination of economic statistics are necessary to guide policy analysis and business decisions. The authorities are urged to reconsider their policy of discontinuing publication of important statistics. 40.      It is recommended that Myanmar continue on the 12-month consultation cycle.

Myanmar compiles a range of economic and social statistics. The Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) reports a number of core statistics to the Fund on a monthly basis and provides more comprehensive data for the Article IV consultation missions.1 However, data shortcomings continue to hinder the monitoring of economic developments and the assessment of policy proposals. In addition, dissemination has been limited.  National accounts  2. National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and revisions are typically not issued before a new year starts. Private sector transactions are underestimated, as all informal sector activities are excluded. The use of the highly overvalued official exchange rate for conversion purposes results in understatement of external trade and the foreign exchange content of consumption, government expenditures, and investment.   Price indices  3. The authorities have begun to publish a new index in which the base year has been changed from 1986 to 1997 using new weights derived from the 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The new CPI comprises 135 consumption items. Its regional coverage is expanded, and the consumption items include wider coverage of items at market prices (rather than at controlled prices) as well as a larger share of imported goods. However, the index remains urban: a price index for rural areas has not yet been compiled.  Government finance  4. There is no comprehensive monthly and quarterly compilation of fiscal data. Although a flash report is produced by the CBM on a monthly basis, and the Budget Department prepares every four months a summary report based on provisional information on cash expenditures collected from the ministries, the coverage of these reports is incomplete. Annual comprehensive data are compiled with delays of up to twelve months after the end of the reference year, and expenditure is aggregated following a functional classification; expenditures by economic classification is produced with a longer delay. In addition, only consolidated data for State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) are available, and some transactions are recorded partly on an accrual basis and partly on a cash basis. Fiscal                                                  1The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) publishes the Statistical Yearbook, which includes a wide range of economic, social, and demographic time series; the latest issue was for 2001, and is also available in CD ROM format. The CSO also publishes the bi-monthly Selected Monthly Economic Indicators, which include monthly data on consumer prices, selected producer prices and output volumes, tourism, transportation, and foreign trade and investment.

Budget estimates and actuals tend to differ by wide margins in part because the approved budget allows for little, if any, inflation.   5. Annual data on the operations of the consolidated central government are reported to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The reported data, however, do not include an economic classification of expenditure. In addition, improving debt recording would enhance fiscal transparency.  Monetary accounts  6. The CBM compiles and reports a monetary survey with a lag of three to six months.  This time lag reflects the lack of technological infrastructure for timely collection and processing of data from a geographically widespread bank branch network, and the delay in compiling government accounts at the Myanma Economic Bank (MEB), which manages them (rather than the Ministry of Finance and Revenue).  7. The monetary survey compiled by the CBM in its own format covers the central bank and all commercial banks, state-owned and private. However, there exist a number of deviations from the internationally accepted methodology: (i) net foreign assets approximates net international reserves, rather than net claims on nonresidents; (ii) claims on the government exclude commercial banks’ holdings of three- and five-year treasury bonds; (iii) claims on the private sector cover only lending and exclude other types of claims, although they are small; (iv) narrow money includes currency issued instead of currency outside banks, but the Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) outside banks are excluded; and (v) broad money includes foreign currency-denominated deposits of nonresidents and of the government.  8. The quality of monetary data reported and published in IFS has improved recently, reflecting assistance provided by STA in the context of the 1998 and 1999 Article IV consultation missions. Starting with the July 1999 issue of IFS, coverage of the banking system was expanded to include private commercial banks established since mid-1992, in addition to the CBM and the four state-owned banks (data coverage of private commercial banks begins in June 1992).   9. The quality of monetary statistics could be improved further by: (i) using the market exchange rate, rather than the overvalued official exchange rate, for valuing foreign currency-denominated balance sheet accounts; (ii) reporting on a gross basis all interbank positions and the banks’ claims on the public sector; (iii) booking all debit balances (overdrafts) as claims, and all credit balances as liabilities; (iv) reviewing for consistency the interbank accounts showing positions between the CBM and the commercial banks, including the MEB’s currency and financial adjustment accounts, and (v) reviewing the recording of the Fund accounts in the CBM’s balance sheet to ensure consistency with standard procedures.

Balance of payments data have various shortcomings arising from the poor quality of data sources and gaps in coverage of the external transactions of the private sector. The use of the overvalued official exchange rate to convert private sector transactions leads to distortions because these transactions actually take place at or near the market rate. The official trade data exclude military imports, for which no adjustment is made in the balance of payments. Detailed data on services and financial flows are generally not available. There are large discrepancies in the external debt data reported by creditors and debtors. Transactions on arrears are not reported separately.   11. Overall export and import volume and price indices are not fully reported. The export volume and unit value indices computed by the Fund and published in IFS are unsatisfactory and have been discontinued. Data on exports and imports by partner country are reported for calendar years but they lack sufficient detail.   12.  Technical assistance provided by STA in 1999–2000 has resulted in progress by the CBM in improving its balance of payments compilation system. However, the system is not yet capable of producing reliable and comprehensive data. Progress has been mainly confined to streamlining collection procedures of data from various agencies broadening the classification of external transactions, correction of numerous misclassifications in the services component, and compiling data on direct investment income outflows. There have been improvements in the collection of data compiled by commercial banks and data on interest and loan repayments on external debt. No progress has been made, however, in development of the specialized surveys to compile private sector transactions.  13.  No progress has been made in improving the dissemination of BOP data within Myanmar. Other problem areas include the measurement of goods for processing, direct investment capital flows, the classification of short-term liabilities of commercial banks, external debt, and arrears.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:  The kyat has been pegged to the SDR at K 8.5057 per SDR since May 2, 1977. Myanmar applies margins of two percent in respect of spot exchange transactions. Starting in February 1993, the Central Bank of Myanmar started issuing foreign exchange certificates (FECs) at a rate of 1 FEC = US$1. In December 1995, the authorities established FEC exchange centers and allowed market trading of FECs. The FEC traded at K 660 per U.S. dollar in August 2003.

Myanmar maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund’s approval under Article VIII arising from: (i) limits on the purchase of foreign exchange by residents for foreign travel and by nonresidents for the remittable portion of wages, as well as for payments and transfers relating to invisible and other current international transactions; and (ii) the divergence between the official exchange rate used for transactions of the public sector and the parallel market-determined FEC rate.  VIII. Article IV Consultation:   The Executive Board discussed the staff report for the 2002 Article IV consultation on October 23, 2002. It was proposed that the next Article IV consultation will take place on the standard 12-month cycle.  IX. Technical Assistance:  A substantial program of technical assistance financed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) was initiated in 1989/90 in the expectation of comprehensive policy reforms. The program foresaw extensive technical assistance supported by training in the areas of bank accounting and supervision; monetary, fiscal, and price statistics; tax and customs administration; public finance; and government financial management.  As the anticipated policy reforms did not materialize, the UNDP decided to scale back assistance to Myanmar. As a result, the project on government financial management was canceled in September 1992 and the funding for the remaining projects was reduced. Following the tripartite review of the technical assistance program conducted during the 1993 Article IV consultation discussions, the authorities were informed that it would be difficult to justify an extension of the program and that the ongoing projects would come to an end by the scheduled closing date of December 31, 1993. By that time, 53 person-months of technical assistance and 172 weeks of training had been delivered. Since then technical assistance has continued only in the form of training on a reduced scale.  The Article IV consultation missions in 1998–2000 each included an STA economist, who provided assistance in the area of monetary statistics (1998) and balance of payments statistics (1999–2000).  X.

Myanmar became a member of the World Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, and IDA in 1962. During 1956–61, the Bank made three loans totaling $33.3 million (of which $0.2 million was canceled), all for transportation projects. No lending was requested during 1962–72. Lending was resumed again in 1973 and 30 IDA credits totaling the equivalent of $804 million were committed of which $752.8 million equivalent was disbursed, $92.7 million was canceled, and $64.3 million was repaid. About 26 percent of total IDA/IBRD disbursements were in support of agricultural projects, including irrigation, rubber, livestock, seed development, and grain storage. About 24 percent was for energy sector projects, 16 percent for forestry projects, 17 percent for transportation projects, and the remaining 16 percent for projects in the mining, manufacturing, construction, and telecommunications sectors.  2. There has been no new lending approved since July 1987. The last project closed on December 31, 1993. IFC had made no investments in Myanmar. Since September 1998, Myanmar is on a nonaccrual status with the Bank and the amount overdue totaled about $128 million as of mid-January 2004.  3. Up to the late 1980s, the Bank provided advice on the formulation and implementation of development policies. Policy recommendations emphasized the need for: fundamental and sustained macroeconomic policy reform, including measures to adjust the exchange rate, price liberalization, especially in agriculture, export promotion and private sector development, and steps to improve the efficiency of state enterprises. During the 1990s, the Bank prepared two economic reports (in 1991 and 1995).

In June 1999, the Bank conducted a technical mission to update its knowledge base about the country at the same time as the Fund's mission for the Article IV consultation. The resulting report, which was released under green cover to the government for comment, focuses on poverty and human development, agriculture, private sector development, and social services. The previous economic report, Myanmar: Policies for Sustaining Economic Reform, was prepared in November 1994, and was discussed with the government in August 1995. The final report was issued in October 1995. In July 2002, and then again in November–December 2003, the Bank participated in the Fund’s Article IV consultation mission.   5. Myanmar Aid Group: The last Consultative Group meeting was held on January 14, 1986 in Tokyo, under the chairmanship of the Bank. The aid pledges totaled about $1.0 billion for the subsequent two years. There have been no such formal meetings since then, though there have been two subsequent Informal Consultative Group meetings for Myanmar (ICGM) held in 2002 and 2003. The Bank participated as an observer in both ICGMs. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 -                                                     ANNEX V MYANMAR: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1  1. Myanmar joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973 and operations started the same year. The AsDB has so far provided 32 loans totaling $530.9 million for  28 projects. Of these, two loans amounting to $6.6 million were from AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR), and 30 loans amounting to $524.3 million were from its special funds resources. All of the loans to Myanmar have been closed. The AsDB has so far provided technical assistance (TA) totaling $10.7 million for 38 projects. Of these 38 TA projects, 28 were project preparatory and 10 were advisory.  2. The AsDB has not processed any new loan or TA project in Myanmar since 1988. However, Myanmar is a participating member of the AsDB-assisted Program of Economic Cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS Program). In that capacity, Myanmar participates in regional meetings and workshops. Close coordination is being maintained with the IMF, the World Bank, and the UNDP with particular emphasis being given to assessment of the government’s economic reform program and recommended policy actions. Liaison is being maintained with Myanmar’s major bilateral donors regarding the status of their assistance program. As of December 31, 2003, Myanmar’s total overdue loan service payments in respect of AsDB’s Asian Development Fund (ADF) loans were equivalent to around $137 million. Myanmar has recently repaid (on December 18, 2003) its OCR dues to AsDB amounting to EUR 1,225,200 and accordingly cleared its arrears under OCR loans. However, Myanmar did not indicate its intention to clear the overdue loan service payments under ADF loans.     3. The sectoral distribution of cumulative AsDB lending to Myanmar remains unchanged as shown below:  Sector Loans (Number) Loans  ($ million) Percent  Agriculture and agro-industry 15316.1 59.5Energy 531.8   6.0Finance and industry 441.4   7.8Transport and communication 242.5   8.0Social infrastructure 699.1 18.7   Total 32530.9 100.0     4. The majority of AsDB assistance has been provided for the development of the agricultural sector. Assistance in sectors other than agriculture stemmed from an attempt to achieve sectoral balance in lending and to avoid overextending the absorptive capacity of the country’s agricultural executing agencies.                                                 1Prepared by the staff of AsDB.
