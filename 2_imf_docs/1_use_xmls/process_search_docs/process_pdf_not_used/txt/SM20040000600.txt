With these flows declining in real terms in the 1990s, growth weakened, and real per capita income fell below the pre-independence level.  • The new 20–year Compact agreement with the United States includes a revised economic assistance package and presents an opportunity to advance economic self-reliance. The main economic provisions include a temporary increase in total grants—largely to help finance the creation of the Compact Trust Fund, which is meant to replace grant funding after FY2023. However, budgetary support from grants will decline steadily in real terms during the period covered by the agreement. The new Compact also includes a number of accountability measures to improve the efficiency of grant use.  • The economy appears to have picked up since the last Article IV consultation mission in 2001, but the fiscal position weakened. Led by higher government expenditure, annual GDP growth is estimated to have averaged about 3 percent during the two years, after weaker or negative growth the previous two years. As such, the current account surplus narrowed, reflecting strong import growth. External debt servicing now appears manageable after the retirement of high-cost commercial debt in FY2001. The deterioration in the underlying fiscal surplus mostly reflected a 25 percent increase in the government payroll during the past two years.  • The immediate priority is to ensure that the FY2004 budget outturn is better than the Parliament-approved deficit of 3 percent of GDP, by containing current expenditure and limiting overambitious capital and development spending. In particular, tight control of the wage bill and goods and services purchases is warranted to keep current spending at a sustainable level and, together with lower capital spending, would lead to an overall fiscal surplus.  • Over the longer term, the authorities will need to reorient fiscal expenditure, improve fiscal management and governance, build reserves, and continue to remove impediments to private sector growth. Fiscal expenditure needs to be focused on priority areas, including education, health, and infrastructure. Domestic revenue growth needs to be revived, and reserves need to be managed prudently and built to protect against external vulnerabilities. On private sector development, a key positive measure was the recent passage of legislation to address land tenure issues. Steps have also been taken to strengthen financial supervision, but additional efforts are needed. Progress has been limited in other key areas, including increasing wage differentiation among skill levels, trimming extensive state involvement in business, reducing constraints to foreign investment, and modernizing customs processing and revenue collection.

BACKGROUND 1.      The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), a small Pacific Island country, has depended heavily on external assistance, with grants averaging almost 60 percent of GDP since independence in 1986. The United States has provided most of the assistance through funding under the economic provisions of the Compact of Free Association (Compact). The original 15–year Compact (FY1986–FY2001), which included provisions for an extension for a two-year renegotiation period through FY2003 (October 2002–September 2003), was designed mainly to promote self-government and economic self-sufficiency of the RMI, as well as to protect the national security interests of the RMI  (a former UN Trust Territory under U.S. administration) and the United States. Since FY2000, Taiwan Province of China has also contributed substantial aid, amounting to an average of 10 percent of GDP, to support mainly development expenditure.  2.      Financed by the sizeable external grants, the public sector continues to dominate the economy. Economic activity is highly correlated with government expenditure, which is over two thirds of GDP. The RMI also suffers from development constraints common to many small island economies—such as a narrow productive base and domestic market, isolated geography, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to global weather trends (particularly, global warming). 3.      With grant flows declining in real terms in the 1990s, as envisaged under the original Compact, economic performance in the RMI deteriorated, and real per capita income fell below the pre-independence level (Table 1). Fiscal expenditure and economic growth were also constrained by the need to retire external public debt incurred on commercial terms in the early 1990s against future Compact revenues. During 1995–01 (the latest official data), economic growth was significantly weaker than other Pacific island countries, with real GDP and real per capita GDP contracting by nearly Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 6 -    25 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Employment has not increased since the late 1980s. The unemployment rate jumped from 12 percent in 1988 to over 30 percent in 1999 and is estimated to have remained broadly unchanged in recent years. Human development indicators also lagged those in other middle income countries (Box 1, Table 2), and the income distribution was uneven with a high incidence of poverty on the outer atolls. As naturally-born Marshallese can freely migrate to live and work in the United States as part of the Compact, the weak economy stimulated emigration, particularly of higher-skilled workers.  4.      Against this background, recent Article IV consultations focused on improving the quality and efficiency of public expenditure, ensuring long-run fiscal sustainability, and implementing structural reforms to enhance private sector development. Executive  Directors endorsed the need to redirect expenditure to essential areas (especially in health, education, and infrastructure), scale back the role of government in other areas, increase fiscal reserves and net government financial assets, and improve the government’s institutional capacities (in areas such as fiscal budgeting, management, and governance, and enhancing data quality and provision). They also urged the removal of key obstacles to private sector development, including by addressing land tenure issues, strengthening the financial system, and simplifying regulatory requirements. 5.      The authorities broadly agreed with this reform agenda and have taken steps in some areas. In particular, the government reduced debt service substantially by retiring all commercial debt by FY2001 and subsequently built fiscal reserves, albeit largely to meet the government’s commitment to the United States during negotiations for the new Compact. The authorities also passed legislation to address land tenure issues and began to strengthen financial supervision and improve the government’s institutional capabilities with the aid of donors and multilateral agencies. 6.      The new Compact agreement includes a revised economic assistance package and presents a further opportunity to advance economic self-reliance. The 20–year agreement—negotiated in the past two years against the background of a mutually agreed upon need for better management and accountability of fiscal resources—was signed by the U.S. President on December 17, 2003.1 The main economic provisions include a temporary increase in total grants—largely to help finance the creation of the Compact Trust Fund, which is meant to replace grant funding after FY2023. However, budgetary support from                                                    1 These issues were also stressed in reports from the U.S. General Accounting Office. The RMI Nitijela (Parliament) gave provisional approval of the new Compact in October before adjourning for the national elections in November. With the government winning re–election with a slightly expanded majority, the new Compact is expected to be given final approval when the Nitijela reconvenes in January.

Box 1. Marshall Islands: Status and Challenges in Health and Education  Human development indicators in the RMI are weaker than would be expected given income, aid, and expenditure levels. The RMI ranks in the middle among the Pacific island countries in terms of overall human development and lags behind in specific health and education indicators. For instance, despite recent improvement, the mortality rates of infants (54 per 1000 live births) and of children under five (66 per 1000 children) are high compared to middle- income group averages (31 and 38, respectively). Also, while access to both primary and secondary education has improved, 30 percent of children do not receive a secondary education, and drop out rates remain high in secondary schools. Poor results in the Pacific Islands Literary Levels test underscore weaknesses in the RMI education system.  The health and education sectors have depended heavily on U.S. Compact funding and federal programs, but this assistance was not used effectively. A U.S. General Accounting Office review pointed out that inadequate accountability, administrative capacity, and institutional support tended to limit the effectiveness of these programs.  The renewed Compact agreement includes new accountability measures to monitor the targeting of funds including in health and education. With the approval of the United States, the RMI government plans as a first step to increase substantially capital expenditure for much needed renovation of schools and medical facilities.

The new Compact also includes a number of accountability measures to improve the efficiency of grant use, with the United States reserving the right to withhold payment if the RMI fails to comply. U.S. funding will cease after FY2023, except for lease payments to landowners for U.S. military use of the Kwajalein Atoll.2 II.   RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 7.      The economy appears to have picked up since the last Article IV consultation mission in 2001. This mainly reflected increased government expenditure made possible by higher external assistance, especially from bilateral grants from Taiwan Province of China and the “bump up” in overall U.S. funding during the two-year Compact renegotiation period. Based on the available—but limited—data, annual GDP growth is estimated to have averaged about 3 percent during FY2002 and FY2003, following weaker or negative growth in previous years. Notably, electricity consumption, car registrations, bank deposits, and consumer loans grew relatively strongly. In recent years, the Majuro-based CPI inflation rate remained under 2 percent—partly due to modest growth in import prices and the increasingly competitive retail environment. 8.      Nonetheless, outside of construction, the private commercial sector generally remains stagnant. In recent years, bank loans to this sector declined sharply and a number of major retailers struggled, partly owing to the increased competition. Government purchases of contracted services decreased, particularly hurting private companies involved in transportation and facilities maintenance. Copra production plummeted, related to irregular shipping schedules and the lagged effect of weak export prices. On the positive side, the tuna processing plant expanded its operations.  9.      With the pickup in growth, the current account (including official transfers) surplus narrowed as import growth strengthened (Table 3). Exports were also relatively buoyant, albeit from a much smaller base, mainly due to                                                    2 Lease payments from the United States are sent first to the RMI government, which withholds 3 percent as tax and then forwards the rest to the landowners.

Marshall Islands: The Renewed Compact  The main economic provisions of the agreement are:  • Annual budgetary grants of about 35 percent of GDP in FY2004, but declining steadily in real terms by FY2023, before expiring thereafter;  • Rental payments for U.S. military use of the Kwajalein Atoll through FY2066, with the United States having the option to terminate payments as early FY2030, with an advance notice of seven years, or extend use through FY2086;  • Additional annual contributions of about 7 percent of GDP to the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) and to a natural disaster fund. The RMI is required to contribute US$30 million by FY2006 into the CTF, which will be supervised and managed by a joint committee with three members chosen by the U.S. government and two by the RMI. The committee will have a fiduciary relationship to the CTF and have the power to hire professional investment and money managers. Assets are expected to be managed prudently and only in qualified instruments—largely U.S. government and other securities;  • An extension through FY2023 of some federal education and disaster management services received by the RMI under the original Compact. During FY2005–FY2023, an annual supplemental grant will be made to the RMI, amounting to US$6.1 million (adjusted for inflation), in lieu of other federal programs. The RMI will remain eligible to apply for additional grants from the U.S. Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor;  • In FY2015, if the average inflation rate is higher in the preceding five years than it was in the first five years of the new Compact, an adjustment would be made to provide full inflation adjustment on all economic flows from that period onward;  • New accountability measures include conditionality normally applicable to U.S. state and local governments. General terms and conditions for the grants will include conformance to plans, strategies, budgets, project specifications, and performance standards. The RMI will have to prepare strategic planning documents that are updated regularly, annual budgets proposing sector-specific expenditure allocations and performance measures, annual reports to the U.S. President regarding the use of resources, quarterly and annual financial reports, and quarterly grant performance reports;  • Annual performance reviews and grant approvals will be conducted by a (U.S. majority-controlled) joint economic management committee.

During the past year, prices for RMI’s principal exports—copra, coconut oil, and tuna—have rebounded somewhat from lows in 2001 and 2002. In addition, travel receipts rose owing to higher (mainly business) visitor arrivals. The net income balance surged in FY2003, reflecting higher income from investments by the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration (MISSA) and, to a lesser extent, by the intergenerational trust fund.  10.      Debt servicing now appears manageable after the repayment of the high-cost commercial debt in FY2001 (Table 4). Recent increases in external debt reflected additional disbursement of loans from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). About two-thirds of outstanding debt is on concessional terms (primarily to the AsDB) with the rest owed by two utility companies—the National Telecommunications Authority (NTA) and the Marshalls Energy Company. 11.      The real effective exchange rate was broadly flat in recent years reflecting a low inflation differential with the United States—the RMI’s dominant trade partner—along with the use of the U.S. dollar as the domestic currency.  12.      The fiscal position weakened during the past two years (Table 5). The deficit in FY2002—the first in seven years—reflected budget funding to account for longstanding nonperforming loans to two public sector projects. Excluding this write down, the underlying fiscal surplus narrowed to an average of 7 percent of GDP in FY2002 and FY2003 compared with 9½ percent of GDP in the previous two years. This mostly reflected the increase in the government payroll, which rose by 25 percent over the two years, but was partly offset by lower interest payments and more buoyant domestic revenue—largely reflecting the hike in the import tariff from 5 percent to 8 percent. The government set aside US$32½ million in the intergenerational trust fund, more than required to meet the country’s commitment under the new Compact with the United States, but the benefit of increased public saving was reduced by placing US$7 million in a 15–year, comparatively low-interest deposit with the Marshall Islands Development Bank (MIDB), Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 11 -    which was then onlent at below market rates to bailout struggling retailers.3 On the positive side, the finances of the health fund improved following the increase in the medical payroll contribution rate in 2001 and a significant drop in overseas medical referrals due to better management and improved domestic medical facilities. III.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS 13.      The medium-term outlook remains uncertain (Table 6). In the near term, after a slowdown in activity related to delays in government construction projects owing to the authorities waiting for final approval of Compact funding, growth is expected to pick up with increased government expenditure in the second half of FY2004 and continue to be relatively buoyant through FY2005. However, without aggressive fiscal adjustment and structural reforms, growth is likely to falter over the longer term as larger adjustment would then be needed at a later date and financing constraints would cause capital spending to fall as external grant flows decline in real terms (Annex I). Economic sustainability would be challenged as government expenditure declines and private sector growth remains anemic. 14.      In such circumstances, the discussions focused on policies needed to achieve sustainable development. These entail substantial fiscal adjustment to build adequate reserves and ensure sustainability, improved fiscal management and governance to make certain that public resources are well spent, selective and efficient government investment in public goods, structural reforms to improve the investment and business environment, and efforts to enhance financial supervision and regulation. With this reform agenda, the productive capacity of the economy would improve, and private sector growth and employment generation would accelerate. Potential areas of growth include tourism, fishing and fish processing, and aquaculture. A.   Fiscal Policy, Management, and Governance 15.      The mission strongly cautioned that the deficit targeted in the FY2004 budget placed overall expenditure on an unsustainable path, and made no provision to continue building reserves to ensure long-run fiscal sustainability and to provide room to maneuver in the event of an economic or environmental shock. The budget—approved by Parliament in October—targeted a deficit of 3 percent of GDP (Box 3). Capital expenditure, mostly in the areas of health and education, was budgeted to increase from 6¼ percent of GDP to 18½ percent of GDP, while current expenditure was budgeted to decline slightly as a share of GDP. The mission recommended that the government should target a surplus of at least                                                    3 The rest of the assets of the trust fund have been deposited in commercial banks—mostly in the First Hawaiian Bank.

Marshall Islands: Budget Preparation and Fiscal Management Issues  Annual budget preparation in the RMI is on a cash-flow balance basis. All inflows to the government’s budget accounts, including tax and non-tax receipts, Compact and non-Compact grants, and proceeds from loans and asset sales, are treated as revenue items. Expenditure is itemized under various funds (General, Special Revenue, Capital, and Debt Service), and then across ministries. The budget presentation does not differentiate between below and above the line items. In the past, budgets have been prepared with revenue and expenditure in balance. Accounts holding budgetary funds carry only incidental balances at the end of the fiscal year (e.g., due to under-spending of budgeted funds), and no conceptual treatment is provided for identifying the stock of government reserves. Periodic transfers are made between various government funds for the purpose of cash management. On occasions when faced with a cash crunch (owing to either expenditure overrun, revenue shortfall, or both), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has arranged advances to be taken from the following year’s receipts. A major international auditing firm carries out an annual audit of the government accounts. The staff’s fiscal analysis is based on converting the audited figures into GFS format, which enables the calculation of overall and current balances. The RMI’s fiscal practices suffer from substantial shortcomings. Accounting problems include an unnecessarily complex and non-transparent account structure. Expendituremanagement is weak, with public resources frequently wasted on unproductive or subsequently abandoned projects. Also, existing tax laws are not consistently enforced, leading to substantial revenue losses. These shortcomings have been extensively documented in government audits and recent reports of the AsDB, PFTAC, and the U.S. General Accounting Office. Modest improvements in fiscal management have taken place recently owing to technical assistance from PFTAC and a US$12 million fiscal and financial management loan from the AsDB. Improvements include the adoption of a new budget accounting software and the establishment of the Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office (EPPSO). The EPPSO is expected to maintain a medium-term budget and investment framework that would form the basis for budget planning. In addition to enhancing revenue collection and improving the quality of public expenditure, the RMI needs to improve its capacity to absorb future grants and other revenue flows productively. Immediate attention is needed to make more realistic projections of capital expenditure and to improve expenditure statistics, cash management, the level of expertise of the MoF staff, and coordination between MoF and the line ministries during budget preparation.  4–5 percent of GDP in line with medium-term needs to ensure fiscal sustainability, including by reducing current expenditure (see Annex I). This would require cuts in nonessential payroll expenditure and goods and services purchases in order to expand current spending in six priority areas (as agreed to in the new Compact)—namely, health, education, capacity building, infrastructure and maintenance, private sector development, and the environment. Given that increasing capital expenditure by 12 percent of GDP may prove technically infeasible, the mission also suggested that nonpriority capital projects be delayed or scrapped, and other projects could be delayed if there is a risk that the funds will not be used efficiently. 16.      The authorities expected that the FY2004 budget outturn was likely to be in surplus. In particular, they did not expect capital expenditure would exceed 10 percent of GDP during the course of the year, given severe capacity constraints and likely delays in fund Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 13 -    disbursement and project implementation. On current expenditure, however, government officials stressed that recent increases in payroll expenditure were mostly in the health and education sectors, where pent-up needs remained.4 Moreover, they indicated that previous efforts to reduce the government payroll by contracting out various government services to the private sector had failed as the private sector was not able to fill the void created by the government’s withdrawal and hence the quality of service provided had deteriorated significantly. In response, the mission stressed that increased saving should not be solely based on cutting capital expenditure and that difficult decisions would need to be made so that current expenditure remained on a sustainable path with some trade-offs taken between maintaining government-provided services in nonpriority areas (such as communication, transportation and public works) and reducing fiscal expenditure. 17.      Over the longer term, the authorities concurred with the mission’s view that the new Compact provides an important opportunity to reorient fiscal expenditure and build reserves. As agreed with the United States, they planned to spend the increased external resources in the initial years of the renewed agreement only on the six priority areas. With Compact budgetary support programmed to decline steadily in real terms during the 20-year agreement and to be eliminated thereafter, the authorities acknowledged that continued substantial budgetary surpluses—averaging roughly 4–5 percent of GDP, based on staff estimates—will be needed to build sufficient reserves to complement the trust fund and ensure fiscal sustainability.5 They also noted, however, that the RMI is pursuing additional contributions for the trust funds from other bilateral donors, particularly Taiwan Province of China.  18.      The mission suggested that the required fiscal adjustment could be achieved through expenditure control and revenue enhancement measures that have been identified in recent years. These include: • Cuts in the government wage bill. Restoring payroll expenditure to the levels envisioned under the Reduction in Force program—designed by the AsDB—could reduce current expenditure annually by another 5 percent of GDP, although such a program would take two to four years to complete;                                                   4 The increases in these sectors stemmed from increased hiring and a retroactive pay adjustment for teachers to align their wage level with that of the civil service pay scale. The mission noted, however, that one-third of the increase in payroll expenditure was in other areas. 5 After the support ends in FY2024, staff calculations suggest that there will be a further shortfall, with nominal returns from the trust fund significantly below FY2023 support levels. Fiscal sustainability is defined as the capability to maintain a smooth path of fiscal outlays.

Subsidies to public enterprises and agriculture, including copra, could also be further reduced. Over the longer term, current spending would need to be reduced from 60 percent of GDP to under 50 percent of GDP in order to maintain capital spending near 10 percent of GDP; • Measures to revive revenue growth by bolstering tax administration and collection efforts and broadening the tax base, including by bringing government enterprises under the tariff and gross revenue tax net and removing other exemptions. Tax administration could be improved through information and data sharing by the various tax collection authorities—customs, revenue and taxation, MISSA, and local governments. Over the medium term, a more comprehensive reform of the tax system would be needed, including streamlining tax administration and perhaps the introduction of a VAT—which would remove the cascading in the current tax regime and improve compliance; • Improvements in fiscal management and governance. Some recent modest improvements include introducing a medium-term budget and investment framework (MTBIF), using new budget accounting software, and establishing the Economic Policy Planning and Statistics Office under the Office of the President. Additional attention is needed to embed the MTBIF fully in the longer-term fiscal strategy and the budgeting process (including making more realistic projections of capital expenditure) and improve expenditure statistics, cash management, expertise of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) staff, and coordination between the MoF and line ministries during budget preparation. The government should also avoid nontransparent quasi-fiscal transactions, such as the deposit with the MIDB, where there is a risk that loans will not be repaid given that many of these businesses appear to be noncompetitive; • Prudent management of fiscal reserves. To ensure that fiscal reserves are sufficiently increased, the MTBIF should continue to earmark funds for the intergenerational trust fund. It is crucial that these funds and any additional funds procured from bilateral donors are prudently managed following international guidelines established to manage foreign reserve assets. 19.      The authorities agreed with the thrust of mission’s recommendations, but made only a few specific commitments. They concurred that it was important to maintain budget surpluses and increase reserves by setting aside money earmarked to the trust funds. They noted that there was already a political commitment to increase saving in the intergenerational trust fund, which had been supported by the public. They stressed that the recent introduction of the MTBIF reflected the government’s intention to tackle critical fiscal issues, including enhancing transparency in budget preparation. They had sought technical assistance from the AsDB and the United States to integrate the intergenerational trust fund with the Compact Trust Fund. They also had made significant efforts to improve tax collection, including through more aggressive efforts by MISSA to crackdown on delinquent taxpayers.

In response, the mission stressed that the transaction had set a bad precedent, would likely lead to lost trust fund saving and moral hazard, and should not be repeated. B.   Private Sector Development 20.      The authorities noted that important progress had been made on land tenure and secure lending issues. In the past, unclear property and land tenure rights and an ineffective framework for secured lending have deterred private and financial sector development. Parliament recently passed legislation to establish the Land Registration Authority, which will maintain a national land registry with a government-backed guarantee on title registration; to allow government ownership of public land; and to improve laws relating to real property mortgages, which will now be allowed not only for leaseholds but also ownership of land, and foreclosure procedures. These should lower intermediation costs and encourage the commercial banks to reorient lending activities from personal consumer loans toward collateralized lending—particularly to the private commercial sector. The mission encouraged the authorities to make the land registry operational as soon as possible. 21.      Decisive steps are also needed in other areas to generate employment growth and remove key impediments to private sector development, including: • The high-cost business environment. A sustained effort to increase human and physical capital through investment in priority areas would lead to improved employment and productivity. While downward wage flexibility may be limited by relatively open emigration to the United States, greater wage differentiation between skill levels could help limit the brain drain. The mission suggested that this could be accomplished by changing existing minimum-wage legislation and continuing the public sector wage freeze, particularly for lower-skilled government workers. The minimum wage in the RMI is US$2 an hour—the highest among Pacific island countries, except Palau, where per capita incomes are more than three times higher. It is notable that the RMI exempted the tuna processing plant, one of the few private sector companies that has successfully expanded in recent years, from the minimum wage. The authorities acknowledged that minimum-wage legislation was approved too hastily, and given the relatively high labor cost environment, some legislators were having second thoughts. Nonetheless, while additional exemptions could be given, the government felt that the law was unlikely to be rescinded in the near future owing to concerns about the political ramifications; • Extensive state involvement in business. The mission urged the government to close unprofitable business activities; sell all or part of its share of public sector companies (including the Bank of Marshall Islands, NTA, Air Marshall Islands, MIDB, Tobolar (copra) Processing, and the Marshalls Energy Company), in some cases after establishing regulatory agencies; contract out additional government services to private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 16 -    operators, with appropriately-designed contracts awarded on a competitive basis; and move more toward managing other public enterprises on a commercial basis, including by appointing independent board members. The authorities did concur that the boards of public enterprises should be made more independent. They were, however, skeptical about the potential for privatization and also saw limited scope for the private sector to provide government services, many of which were considered essential and in some cases because they were related to national security;  • Restrictions on foreign investment. The authorities agreed to decrease administrative delays, including by establishing a “one-stop shop” to approve investment proposals, and to consider reductions in the list of areas reserved solely for RMI citizens. Areas that have drawn interest from foreign investors include tourism, fish processing, and aquaculture; • Remaining trade restrictions.6 As a first priority, the mission recommended that the tariff base be broadened by improving customs processing and revenue collection and removing exemptions—including for public sector enterprises. The authorities indicated that they had, with technical assistance, improved training and added staff at customs. To facilitate further improvements, the authorities would need to pass a new Customs Act, as recommended by PFTAC, to meet WTO requirements and international standards. The new Customs Act should also limit loopholes, introduce a full self-assessment system, and improve the efficiency of customs administration. Over the longer term, once the tariff base is broadened sufficiently and revenue collection is improved, consideration could also be given to reducing tariff rates. C.   Financial Sector 22.      The financial sector in the RMI is very small and intermediation costs are high. Lending is concentrated on short-term consumer loans and has been hampered in the past by uncertainties related to collateral and difficulties in foreclosure. With the Bank of Hawaii ceasing operations in the RMI in November 2002, only two commercial banks remain—a branch of the Bank of Guam, which is supervised by and carries deposit insurance from the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Bank of the Marshall Islands                                                   6 RMI’s trade regime is relatively open and rated a “4” on the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness. The last major change to the regime occurred in October 2001 when the general import tariff duty was increased from 5 percent to 8 percent and several items were shifted from ad valorem to unit taxation. Some products—for example, gasoline (20 percent) and cigars (150 percent)—are subject to higher rates.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 17 -    (BOMI).7 The rest of the sector includes a few low-volume insurance agencies and several other small financial service providers (credit unions, money lenders, etc.,). In addition, the unsupervised MIDB, which has been expanding rapidly in recent years, has a broad range of permitted activities, including deposit taking and lending for housing, commercial businesses, and consumer loans.8  23.      Financial sector supervision needs to be strengthened. Last year, the IMF’s Offshore Financial Centers Module 2 mission to the RMI assessed that the basic banking supervision framework was broadly appropriate, but that compliance with standards was mixed. With increased staffing and training during the past year, the Banking Commission has made significant improvements including beginning on-site and off-site supervision of both commercial banks, but acknowledges the need to continue to improve data and information collection, compilation, and assessment, including of loan quality.9 The government concurred with the mission’s assessment that improving the governance of the MIDB was a crucial priority, including by placing it under the supervision of the Banking Commission, limiting permitted activities, shifting the focus of its lending from consumer loans to more traditional lending for a development bank, and appointing independent board members. 24.      In October 2002, the RMI was removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) money laundering list. The RMI took a number of decisive steps to discourage money laundering and the financing of terrorism, including adopting a modern and comprehensive anti-money laundering law in 2000, enforcing existing regulations, and                                                    7 The Bank of Hawaii closed operations in several Pacific island countries to reduce the geographical dispersion of its operations. The net income and equity of BOMI, which accounted for about 70 percent of total commercial bank assets at end–2002, have increased substantially in nominal terms in recent years and were, respectively, 4 percent and 20 percent of assets in 2002. Net income and equity data for the Majuro branch of the Bank of Guam were not available. 8 MIDB’s asset base increased from less than US$12 million in 1999 to an estimated US$30 million (unaudited) in 2003. The expansion is attributable to increased on-lending of funds (RMI government deposits and a loan from Taiwan Province of China initially aimed to finance shipping sector development), success in reclaiming assets from large problem loans that had been previously written off, and improved earnings partly owing to healthy interest margins. 9 The final version of the new Compact agreement excluded the provision that allowed the domestic commercial bank (BOMI) to apply for FDIC supervision. The RMI government had lobbied the U.S. Congress to extend the provision for two years, so that BOMI could complete an approvable application.

D.   Other 25.      Improvements in economic statistics continue to be needed, as serious deficiencies still impede effective surveillance. Despite substantial technical assistance from the Fund, PFTAC, and other providers, the mission noted that little progress has been made in the past few years, partly owing to staffing and resource constraints. Core economic data need to be compiled and reported on a timely basis, and the quality of the data needs to be enhanced. The mission endorsed PFTAC recommendations on statistical improvements, including by joining the General Data Dissemination System. IV.   STAFF APPRAISAL 26.      In recent years, the authorities have taken preliminary steps to place the RMI on the path to sustainable development. Notably, the government has generally achieved fiscal surpluses since the mid–1990s, first to retire high-cost commercial debt and subsequently to build fiscal reserves that are saved mainly in the intergenerational trust fund. The authorities solved longstanding problems concerning the health fund by increasing the contribution rate and improving management and domestic medical facilities, leading to a significant drop in costly overseas medical referrals. Moreover, with the help of donors and multilateral agencies, the authorities have begun to augment the government’s institutional capabilities—especially with respect to fiscal budgeting, management, and governance—and enhance financial sector supervision. The RMI’s use of the U.S. dollar as its domestic currency provides welcome monetary stability. 27.      Substantial fiscal surpluses need to be maintained over the medium term and fiscal expenditure must be directed towards priority areas as budgetary support under the new Compact is programmed to decline in real terms during the length of the agreement and to be eliminated thereafter. This will require immediate and substantial fiscal adjustment. Without this, the growth outlook becomes highly uncertain. 28.      The first priority is to ensure that the FY2004 budget outturn remains in surplus, so that overall expenditure stays on a sustainable path and reserves continue to be built. Given capacity constraints and delays in fund disbursement and project implementation, capital expenditure is likely to fall short of what is budgeted. In addition to avoid any risks that the surplus will not be achieved, the government will need to reduce current expenditure on wages and goods and services purchases and curtail lower priority capital spending. It is particularly worrisome that the wage bill has grown rapidly in recent years, and this trend must be reversed. 29.      Over the longer term, additional public saving needs to be achieved through expenditure control and revenue enhancement measures. Fiscal policy should be focused Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public - 19 -    on limiting payroll expenditure and other current expenditure to more sustainable levels. Revenue growth can be revived by bolstering tax administration and collection efforts and broadening the tax base. It is disappointing that the first MTBIF did not give sufficient attention to these measures. Improvements in fiscal management and governance need to be greatly strengthened, and the government should shun repeating quasi-fiscal transactions, such as the deposit with the MIDB, which are nontransparent, risky, and inappropriate, particularly as they are likely to lead to losses of trust fund assets. Foreign reserve assets, including fiscal reserves, should be built up to protect against vulnerabilities and need to be managed prudently. 30.      On private sector development, a welcome measure was the recent passage of legislation to address land tenure issues, including establishing the Land Registration Authority, allowing government ownership of public land, and improving laws relating to real property mortgages and foreclosure procedures. These measures should help to lower intermediation costs and facilitate the reorientation of commercial bank lending activities towards the private commercial sector. 31.      Progress is needed in other areas to remove key impediments to private sector development, and implementation remains a concern. Necessary steps include increasing wage differentiation between skill levels by changing existing minimum-wage legislation and continuing the public sector wage freeze—particularly for lower-skilled government workers; trimming extensive state involvement in business through privatization, contracting out government services to the private firms (which now appear to be better-prepared to supply these services, including in shipping), and allowing for more independent public enterprise boards of directors; reducing constraints on foreign investment by decreasing areas reserved solely for RMI citizens and cutting administrative delays in the approval of investment proposals; and broadening the tariff base and modernizing customs processing and revenue collection, including by introducing a new Customs Act designed to meet WTO commitments and international standards. 32.      Further efforts are needed to strengthen financial supervision. During the past year, the Banking Commission began on-site and off-site supervision of the two remaining commercial banks, but additional steps are needed to continue to improve data and information collection, compilation, and assessment, including of loan quality. An important priority is to improve the governance of the MIDB, including by placing it under the supervision of the Banking Commission, limiting permitted activities, shifting the focus of its lending from consumer loans to more traditional lending for a development bank, and appointing independent board members. 33.      The authorities should be commended for their efforts since the last Article IV consultation that led to the RMI being removed from the FATF money laundering list—namely, decisive moves to discourage money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Key steps included adopting a modern and comprehensive anti-money laundering law in 2000, enforcing existing regulations, and creating a Domestic Financial Intelligence Unit.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the RMI will take place on the 24-month cycle.

The assumptions in both scenarios are based on the economic provisions of the renewed Compact (outlined in Box 2).  Baseline  2. The authorities run a small surplus, necessary to meet debt obligations. Fiscal reserves remain at very low levels, and the authorities make only modest headway in reducing expenditure and increasing revenue. This reflects spending pressures from a rapidly-growing population, difficulties in reducing public expenditure in a society that is characterized by traditional relationships built on the exchange of patronage, and an underdeveloped private sector. Current expenditure decreases annually by about ¼ percent of GDP, forced essentially by financing constraints. Revenue growth lags real GDP growth by ½ percentage point, roughly in line with the tax elasticity of the past decade.   3. Fiscal expenditure shrinks over the medium term as grant inflows decline. The burden of adjustment falls mostly on capital spending—including infrastructure maintenance—leading to weaker growth. At the end of the Compact, the RMI draws the entire annual returns from the trust fund, causing the fund to begin to decline in real terms. Initially, the real GDP growth rate is 2¼ percent per annum, but it gradually falls to zero as government expenditure declines and private sector growth remains anemic.  Adjustment  5. The authorities pursue an adjustment strategy including:  • Concerted expenditure control, improved tax administration and reform, and enhanced fiscal management and governance; • Public investment in priority areas—including health, education, and infrastructure; • Limited withdrawals from the trust fund to maintain its real value after FY2023.  6. A budget surplus of 4–5 percent of GDP is targeted from FY2004 onward. Despite reduced Compact inflows, the government is able to build sizeable reserves while maintaining capital expenditure at near 10 percent of GDP. It is notable that the government’s commitment to build reserves in the intergenerational trust fund during the past two years has been supported by the public. This secures long-term fiscal sustainability, improves the productive capacity of the economy, and allows real GDP growth to remain steady at around 2¼ percent (in line with the average of other Pacific islands).

The Centre’s assistance to the RMI since 1998 has included 26 advisory missions, mostly in banking and public expenditure management. The RMI also sent seven officials to regional seminars and workshops. PFTAC organized one secondment in banking supervision.  Public Financial Management  2. Since the last Article IV, six missions have covered all aspects of public financial management on the basis of an ongoing action plan. Basic improvements from a very low base included a timetable for budget preparation, enhanced internal consistency of numbers, and a simple medium-term budgeting framework. However, implementation of the action plan has slipped—especially on the use of the medium-term framework—and budget execution and reporting remain weak.  Tax Administration and Policy 3. In July 2003, PFTAC designed a modernization strategy and action plan for customs, including on the Customs Act, automation, compliance units, and training. The RMI requested PC/Trade (software developed by Statistics New Zealand) after PFTAC financed a visit of customs officials to Federated States of Micronesia where PC/Trade is used. If requested, PFTAC will assess the revenue system, design a tax administration modernization plan, and review exemptions.  Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision  4. The Centre provided substantial hands-on training to the current and previous Banking Commissioners, covering both the on-site and off-site inspections. The current Commissioner benefited from attendance at two PFTAC-sponsored regional conferences on banking supervision, and participation in a course run by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board in 2002. Following involvement with the Offshore Financial Centers assessment in 2002, PFTAC provided assistance to draw up a program to better comply with Basel Core Principles and also guided the RMI during the closure of a foreign bank’s branch operations.   Economic and Financial Statistics  5. An August 2002 review of the statistical system recommended an increase in staffing and proposed a two-year work program. Statistical work was then integrated into the new Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office. A June 2003 update recommended the use of an external advisor and the recruitment and training of economic graduates for the unit. Recent progress includes a new rebased CPI and a website for disseminating statistics. Agencies (including the U.S. Census Bureau) need better counterpart staff to make any further progress. The RMI is considering joining the GDDS as recommended by the Centre.                                                  1 PFTAC, which is located in Suva, Fiji, is a multi-donor technical assistance institution, financed by the IMF, AsDB, AusAID, and NZAID, with the IMF as the Executing Agency. The Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Pacific Island Economies: Building a Resilient Economic Base for the Twenty-First Century, June 1995.  1. The Marshall Islands joined the World Bank Group in May 1992. In 1992, a country report was prepared as part of the Bank’s Regional Energy Assessment in the Pacific island countries. In 1993, the Bank completed a country economic report on the Marshall Islands, as part of the second Pacific Islands Regional Economic Report. This focused on public sector reform, the role of the private sector in achieving sustainable growth, human resource development, and environmental issues. In May 1993, a grant of US$150,000 from the Institutional Development Fund was approved to assist the Presidential Committee on the rationalization of the public service, and a report detailing an action plan for public sector reform was prepared. This report was accepted by the government, and the UNDP assisted in the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  2. The Bank’s fifth biennial Regional Economic Report for its Pacific Island member countries, including Marshall Islands, was issued in September 2002.  The report focuses on the efforts of Pacific Island Countries (PICs) to integrate more closely with the global economy. It evaluates the strategy of PICs to enter into a regional trade agreement, and analyzes the interaction of trade liberalization with complementary reforms in other sectors of the economy. The Regional Economic Report for 2000 aimed to help the people and governments of the PICs deal proactively with the major challenges and opportunities confronting them in the areas of: growth of towns, management of ocean resources, and the impact of, and adaptation to, climate change. In 1998, the Bank’s Regional Economic Report discussed how the development agenda of governments could be enhanced by focusing on core functions, improving spending patterns, and having in place efficient budgetary processes.                                                   1 Prepared on the basis of the input from the World Bank staff.

The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved eleven loans totaling about US$71 million to the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) since it joined the Bank in April 1990.  2. In November 2003, the AsDB approved a project preparatory scheme for youth social services.  3. In October 2003, the AsDB approved an advisory technical assistance for improving the performance of EPPSO (Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics office).    4. In November 2002, the AsDB approved the Outer Island Transport Infrastructure Project for US$7 million, aimed at improving the safety, frequency, and reliability of shipping and transport services in the outer islands.  5. In May 2001, the AsDB approved a US$12 million Fiscal and Financial Management Program to: (i) ensure a sustainable income flow for future generations; (ii) strengthen public sector financial and economic management; (iii) stabilize the fiscal position; (iv) enhance the policy environment for the private sector; and (v) improve the effectiveness of the public service. The program was supported by a package of technical assistance (TA), and the loan and TA will close on schedule during the second quarter of 2004.  6. In November 2000, the AsDB approved the Skills Training and Vocational Education Project for US$6.8 million, to help implement a national skills training system.  7. As of end August 2003, TA grants totaling US$16.2 million for 39 TA projects have been approved. These comprise both project preparatory and advisory TA. Project preparatory TA has focused on public sector reform, fisheries, education, health, water, sanitation, and outer island infrastructure, whereas advisory TA has focused on institutional development, policy reforms, and capacity building.  8. The overall framework for the AsDB country strategy for the RMI is set out in A Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium (September 2000). In this paper, the RMI is grouped with other atoll countries that are severely disadvantaged by their small size, isolation, and weak resource base. The RMI economy is heavily reliant on external assistance and has limited potential for self-sustained economic growth. The core strategy identified in the Pacific Strategy is to establish and expand trusts funds to finance public expenditures, particularly for projects and services in the disadvantaged outer islands. In this regard, the AsDB will help to improve the productivity of public service delivery, strengthen the environment for private sector development, and, in support of both these objectives, strengthen governance.                                                   1 Prepared on the basis of input from the AsDB staff.

A new Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office (EPPSO) was established in February 2003 to collect and disseminate statistical data. However, EPPSO still lacks qualified statistical staff and the capacity to release timely data. The 2001 edition of the annual statistical abstract containing economic and social data was published only in 2003. The publication of the Quarterly Bulletin of Statistics was resumed in June 2003, containing mainly CPI data. However, other quarterly and monthly statistical data are not published or transmitted to the Fund. Extensive Fund technical assistance has been provided from headquarters and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, but many recommendations have not been implemented. The authorities have expressed an interest in joining the IMF General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The Marshall Islands would then be eligible for follow-up technical assistance under the Pacific Regional GDDS project funded by Japan.   Real Sector 2. National income accounts (the latest data through 2001) have been prepared on a production basis for the years since 1991, although the recommendations of STA’s August 1992 multi-sector mission have not been fully implemented. The new consumer price (CPI) index rebased in 2003 replaced the CPI index developed in the 1980s. The CPI update is based on information from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002, made possible by assistance from the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Census Bureau.   Government Finance 3. Government finance statistics are regularly compiled for budget control, but they are not consolidated into a format usable for analysis. The authorities received technical assistance on budgetary accounting in 1994 and 2001.   Monetary Accounts 4. A reporting system has been established for domestic banking institutions on the basis of monthly reporting forms and guidelines developed during the 1993 STA mission. Banks report data to the Banking Commissioner. However, monetary data have never been reported to the Fund.  Balance of Payments 5. Apart from trade statistics, balance of payments data are not compiled, although technical assistance has been provided in this area. Despite the recent computerization, compilation of import statistics has not improved in terms of timeliness and accuracy, mainly due to backlogs in data entry, and inappropriate classification and coding. With no compulsory reporting, export statistics are incomplete. Only limited data are available on services, factor income, and private transfers, and there are no data on private capital flows.

The United States has provided most of the assistance through funding under the economic provisions of the Compact of Free Association (Compact). The original 15-year Compact (FY 1986–2001), which included provisions for an extension for a two-year renegotiation period through FY 2003, was designed mainly to promote self-government and economic self-sufficiency of the RMI, as well as to protect the national security interests of the RMI (a former U.N. Trust Territory under U.S. administration) and the United States. With grant flows declining in real terms in the 1990s, economic growth in the RMI weakened, and real per-capita income fell below the pre-independence level. Fiscal expenditure and economic growth were also constrained by the need to retire external public                                                            1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [January, 26, 2004] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

During 1995–2001 (the latest official data), real GDP and real per-capita GDP contracted by nearly 25 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Employment has not increased since the late 1980s. Between 1988 and 1999, the unemployment rate jumped from 12 percent to over 30 percent and is estimated to have remained broadly unchanged in recent years. Human development indicators also lagged those in other middle income countries, and the income distribution was uneven with a high incidence of poverty on the outer atolls.  The new 20-year Compact agreement includes a revised economic assistance package and presents a further opportunity to advance economic self-reliance. The main economic provisions include a temporary increase in total grants—largely to help finance the creation of the Compact Trust Fund, which is meant to replace grant funding after FY 2023. However, budgetary support from grants will decline steadily in real terms during the period covered by the agreement. The new Compact also includes a number of accountability measures to improve the efficiency of grant use.  The economy appears to have picked up since the last Article IV consultation mission in 2001. This mainly reflected increased government expenditure made possible by higher external assistance. Based on the available—but limited—data, annual GDP growth is estimated to have averaged about 3 percent during FY 2002 and FY 2003, following weaker or negative growth in previous years. In recent years, the Majuro-based CPI inflation rate remained under 2 percent—partly due to modest growth in import prices and the increasingly competitive retail environment. Nonetheless, outside of construction, the private commercial sector generally remains stagnant. In recent years, bank loans to this sector declined sharply and a number of major retailers struggled, partly owing to the increased competition. Government purchases of contracted services decreased, particularly hurting private companies involved in transportation and facilities maintenance. Copra production plummeted, related to irregular shipping schedules and the lagged effect of weak export prices. On the positive side, the tuna processing plant expanded its operations.  With the pickup in growth, the current account (including official transfers) surplus narrowed as import growth strengthened. Exports were also relatively buoyant, albeit from a much smaller base, mainly due to increased re-exports of diesel fuel for foreign fishing fleets. Debt servicing now appears manageable after the repayment of high-cost commercial debt in FY 2001. The fiscal position weakened during the past two years. The deficit in FY 2002—the first in seven years—reflected budget funding to account for longstanding nonperforming loans to two public sector projects. Excluding this write down, the underlying fiscal surplus narrowed to an average of 7 percent of GDP in FY 2002 and FY 2003 compared with 9½ percent of GDP in the previous two years. This mostly reflected the increase in the government payroll, which rose by 25 percent over the two years, but was partly offset by lower interest payments and more buoyant domestic revenue. The government set aside $32½ million in the intergenerational trust fund, more than required to meet the country’s commitment under the new Compact with the United States, but the benefit of increased public saving was reduced by placing $7 million in a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 -      ANNEX VII   15-year, comparatively low-interest deposit with the Marshall Islands Development Bank (MIDB), which was then onlent at below market rates to bailout struggling retailers. On the positive side, the finances of the health fund improved following the increase in the medical payroll contribution rate in 2001, and a significant drop in overseas medical referrals due to better management and improved domestic medical facilities.  Executive Board Assessment       Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
