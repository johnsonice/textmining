Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Panama were held in Panama City during January 25-February 9, 1995. u The mission also initi- ated discussions with the authorities on a program for 1995-96 which could be supported by a stand-by arrangement (SBA), but negotiations were not com- pleted because the authorities required more time to define their structural reform program. The staff is planning to return to Panama in May/June 1995 to continue discussions as substantive progress has now been achieved in implementing structural reforms and in reaching understandings with the World Bank and IDB. On December 20, 1993 the Executive Board concluded the 1993 Article IV consultation with Panama, and approved the modification and extension through September 23, 1994 of the 22-month SBA approved in February 1992, with access reduced from the equivalent of SDR 93.7 million to SDR 74.2 mil- lion (EBS/93/193 and SUR/93/131). U At that time, Directors expressed concern about the slippages in the implementation of structural reforms, which had contributed to a weakening in the public finances. They welcomed the authorities' renewed efforts to,restore the basic thrust of their origi- nal program through adoption of a tighter fiscal stance and intensification of structural reform efforts, as reflected in the modified arrangement. On March 23, 1994 the Executive Board concluded, on a lapse-of-time basis, the second review of the financing assurances under the SBA (EBS/94/46). This, together with the observance of the December 1993 performance criteria, allowed Panama to make the second purchase for the equivalent of SDR 9.9 million under the modified arrangement. Although Panama observed all perfotnzance criteria for March and June 1994 (Table l), the mid-term review under the SBA was not completed because slippages in the implementation of the structural reform program delayed disbursements by the World Bank and the IDB and raised concerns about the financing of the program for the remainder of the year. 2/ The arrangement was allowed to lapse without further purchases taking place. u The staff team consisted of A. M. Jul (Head), F. Frantischek, J. Gons, A. Morales, and M. Torres (all WHD). u Panama has accepted the abligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Relations with the Fund, the World Bank Group, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are summarized in Appen- dices I, II, and III, respectively. 1/ The structural reform program is supported by an Economic Recovery Loan (ERL) from the World Bank, and a Public Enterprise Reform Loan (PERL) from the IDB. To date, only first tranche disbursements have taken place, with US$60 million remaining under the ERL and US$70 million under the PERL. Co-financing from Japan under the ERL of US$50 million remains available.

II. Backeround The economic recovery that started in mid-1990 continued in 1994, although the pace of activity slowed to 4.7 percent compared with 5.6 per- cent in 1993, and inflation remained below 2 percent (Table 2). The main sources of growth continued to be construction, the Colon Free Zone, and financial services. After declining from 20 percent in 1990 to 13.2 percent in 1993, the unemployment rate increased to 13.8 percent in 1994. The per- sistence of high unemployment is associated with rigidities in the labor market and reflects the low labor absorption of some of the more dynamic sectors in the economy. The overall fiscal balance improved from a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 1993 to a surplus of 0.3 percent in 1994, with the improvement shared equally by the Central Government and the rest of the public sector (Table 3). The strengthening of the fiscal position reflected mainly the one-time effect of settlements of backpay JJ in 1993, containment of public sector employment, moderate increases in wages, and a decline in expenditure on goods and services and investment outlays. There was a further accumula- tion of interest arrears (3.7 percent of GDP) in 1994, mainly to commercial banks (Table 4). This, together with divestment proceeds (0.9 percent of GDP) more than offset net repayments of foreign debt, and contributed to a buildup of public sector net deposits at the National Bank (BNP) of about 3 percent of GDP. The decline in the central government deficit reflected lower "on- interest expenditure, which more than offset a significant increase in external interest obligations owing to higher interest rates (Table 5). Government revenue barely kept pace with nominal GDP owing to a reduction in corporate tax rates and a decline in nontax revenue from rental fees and miscellaneous services. The increase in the surplus of the rest of the public sector resulted from an improved performance by all entities. The improvement in the Social Security Agency (SSA) reflected higher revenues on account of intensified collection efforts. The decentralised agencies benefitted from the decline in transfers due to the discontinuation of a temporary retraining program for workers introduced in 1993. The strengthening by the public enterprises 1/ A one-time payment retroactive to 1988 stemming from the reactivation in 1992 by the Supreme Court of special laws that grant automatic wage in- creases to a large portion of public sector employees. The payment, which amounted to B 65 million in 1993 and B 6 million in 1994, was made with negotiable lo-year government bonds carrying a 4 percent interest rate and redeemable in 20 equal installments.

Revenues of the electricity company (IRHE) and the Port Authority (APN),expanded rapidly as a result of increased output and efforts to strengthen collections, while those of the telecommunications company (INTEL) grew in line with GDP, as a decline in long distance tariffs was offset by a significant increase in the number of lines and volume of calls. Also, transfers (mainly from INTEL) to the Central Government and to the decentralized agencies for the retraining program (from IRHE and APN) declined substantially. Broad money continued to expand rapidly by 16 percent in 1994, while credit to the private sector decelerated to 13.5 percent in 1994 from 19 percent in 1993, reflecting the slowdown in activity and uncertainty regard- ing the outcome of the May elections (Table 6). Together with the accumula- tion of public sector deposits in the BNP, the trends of broad money and credit permitted a further strengthening of the net foreign assets of the banking system by US$550 million (about 8 percent of GDP) in 1994, with the BNP accounting for more than one fourth of the increase (Table 7). Regarding the public financial institutions, the BNP continued to improve its position in 1994, with a further reduction in nonperforming assets and efforts to contain costs. There was little improvement in the financial position of the Savings Bank and the National Mortgage Bank (BHN), while that of the Agricultural Development Bank (BDA) deteriorated further, mainly due to high operating costs and an increase in external debt service resulting from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-A-vis the yen. u At end-1994 the private banking system comprised of 107 banks, with 19 banks starting operations during the past 5 years while 24 banks ceased operations. u Banks have experienced a sharp recovery in their domestic market operations, with private sector deposits expanding from B 2 billion (34 percent of GDP) in 1990 to B 4.6 billion (61 percent of GDP) in 1994 and credit to the private sector growing from B 2.2 billion to B 5 billion over that period. This recovery reflected the restoration of confidence and return of capital flight following the resolution of the political crisis, the rapid economic recovery, competitive interest rates on deposits, 2/ and lending rates which were being reduced due to competition among banks. Despite these developments, the recovery of the banking system has been con- strained by existing legislation which has not permitted the introduction of new financial instruments and banking innovations such as cash management *cc0u*ts ( certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances, private sector bonds u The BHN and BDA intermediate resources provided by the Central Government and are not permitted to take deposits from the public. 2J Reductions in operations, reorientation of activities to other regions, and changes in home country legislation making operations abroad less profitable have been the main factors explaining the decline in the number of banks in Panama. 3J Interest rates on time deposits were on average 1.6 percentage points above LIBOR in 1992 and 1993. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4 and electronic transactions. Also, prudential regulations have not evolved in the manner required to ensure the solvency of the system and its standing abroad. lJ By end-1994 offshore operations partially recovered to their pre-crisis levels with deposits reaching B 17.8 billion and loans B 14.4 billion, compared with B 20.5 billion and B 16.7 billion, respectively, by end-1987. Panama does not have an independent exchange rate policy since the U.S. dollar is legal tender. Reflecting Panama's low inflation rate, the b&boa, which is used as the unit of account at a rate of B 1 per U.S. dol- lar, depreciated in real effective terms by about 5 percent in 1994, and by 16 percent since 1989 (Chart 1). Gross fixed capital formation declined by 1 percentage point of GDP to 24.2 percent in 1994, reflecting a reduction in both public and private investment, while gross national savings fell by 3.2 percentage points of GDP to 17.8 percent in 1994. After a sharp increase in 1993, private sav- ings fell by 4.4 percentage points of GDP to 14 percent, more than offset- ting an increase in public savings to 3.8 percent of GDP. The external current account deficit widened from about 4 percent of GDP in 1993 to 6 percent in 1994, mainly reflecting a deterioration of the trade account (Table 8). Exports grew by only 4.5 percent as banana exports (about 40 percent of merchandise exports) declined further by 1 percent as a result of the imposition of quotas by the European Union on banana imports from Latin America, and as exports of manufactures and seafood stagnated. Merchandise imports rose by 11 percent in 1994, largely due to an increase in private consumption of durable goods. The services account also weakened in 1994 as higher interest rates pushed up interest obligations while other services improved by about 7 percent. The substantial strengthening in the capital account was not sufficient to finance the current account deficit as net repayment by the official sec- tor partially offset a large inflow of private capital. The overall balance of payments deficit of US$99 million, or 1.4 percent of GDP, was financed by the rescheduling of external bonds (see below), which also accommodated the clearance of arrears to external bond holders and an accumulation of net foreign assets by the BNP of about US$145 million. Panama made further progress in re-establishing relations with external creditors in 1994. An external bond exchange to settle arrears of about US$425 million was completed, involving a cash payment of 25 percent of the interest arrears and the exchange for notes at par of the principal and remaining interest arrears. Also, the BNP settled US$103 million in inter- bank deposits outstanding since 1984.

The new Administration presented a proposal to the banks in December 1994, and active negotiations ensued in January and March 1995. There were also further discussions with Mexico and Venezuela on the rescheduling of the petroleum debt in 1994; the new Administration intends to present a proposal to Mexico and Venezuela after concluding nego- tiations with commercial banks, along similar lines. Panama's external public debt dropped from about 100 percent of GDP at end-1991 to about 80 percent (USS5.5 billion) at end-1994, of which about 65 percent was in arrears. u This reflected repayment of arrears to the multilateral agencies in 1992, and lower interest rates in 1992-93 which slowed down the accumulation of arrears to commercial banks (Table 9). Total external debt-service obligations in 1994 amounted to 24.5 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services, of which about 40 percent were actually paid. Panama is servicing on time all payments due to multilateral institutions, Paris Club creditors, and the Support Group. Progress in the implementation of the structural reform program in the first half of 1994 was limited. There were further delays in the implemen- tation of public enterprise reforms, particularly with regard to the tariff structure of INTEL and leasing of ports to the private sector. Also, there was virtually no progress on trade and price liberalization, privatization, and on an action plan to eliminate the deficit of the Complementary Pension Fund. As a result, conditionality on World Bank and IDB program loans was not met, and the second tranche disbursements under these loans envisaged in the program for June 1994 did not materialize. Implementation of structural reforms accelerated following the May election. In June, the National Assembly approved legislation on a career stream for the public service, which will facilitate the modification of the special laws and help identify areas where labor redundancies exist. Long distance telephone rates, international and domestic, were reduced in June and July. Also, 95 percent of the shares of the cement company (US$60 million) were sold in the stock market in August. III. policv Discussions Discussions with the authorities centered on an economic program for 1995-96 that could be supported by a SBA and on structural reforms required to achieve fiscal viability and increase competitiveness over the medium term. With the support of multilateral creditors, the authorities expect to complete a debt-reduction package with commercial banks by end-1995, and reschedule the petroleum debt fn early 1996. u Of these, 93 percent were to commercial banks, 6.7 percent to Mexico and Venezuela, and the remainder to suppliers and external bond holders.

The public sector is large and ineffi- cient, and the tax system unable to generate the resources to finance the investment in infrastructure required to stimulate private investment and increase productivity to allow Panama to compete in the world market. In the absence of wide-ranging changes geared at increasing the role of the private sector as an engine of growth, there is concern that the growth of real GDP in per-capita terms could stagnate now that the economic recovery has been completed. The authorities have formulated a program aimed at achieving fiscal viability in the context of a debt package with commercial banks, improving resource allocation and external competitiveness, stimulating private invest- ment, and ensuring that maximum economic benefits will be derived from the reversion of the Canal Zone areas, which is to be completed by end-1999. The program also seeks to alleviate poverty and step up efforts to protect the environment. The authorities' broad objectives for 1995-96 were to attain a rate of growth of real GDP of about 4 percent a year, while reduc- ing unemployment and maintaining inflation below 2 percent. 1. Fiscal uolicv The authorities presented to the Assembly in February 1995 a compre- hensive package of fiscal measures which eliminates tax breaks and subsidies for import-substituting activities and nontradables, while enhancing fiscal viability and reforming the trade regime. These measures are projected to be revenue neutral in 1995, and increase collections by 0.4 percent of GDP in 1996 and by an additional 0.2 percent of GDP in 1997. The measures include: (a) reduction of tax incentives on capital reinvested in the industrial sector; (b) an increase in the corporate income tax from 8.25 to 25 percent on operations in the Colon Free Trade Zone; (c) a withholding tax of 1.5 percent on the CIF value of imports into the Colon Free Trade Zone other than by the subsidiaries of multinational corporations, to be credited against income tax liabilities, with a view to reduce income tax evasion; (d) a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 30 and 34 percent to 25 percent and elimination of the tax on dividends so as to attract private investment; (e) an increase in the tax base on agricultural income by reduc- ing nontaxable income from US$lOO,OOO to US$75,000; (f) an extension to all users of the preferential import tariff of 3 percent on raw materials, to eliminate discrimination against small producers; and (g) a reduction in interest rate subsidies on low income housing. On the expenditure side, the authorities froze employment at end-1994 levels except in the health and education sectors and the security forces; have prohibited the replacement of staff at higher wages than those of posi- tions that are vacated; and intend to hold expenditure on goods and services and transfers to the private sector below the 1994 level. These measures would yield savings of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1995 and 0.8 percent of GDP in 1996. Also, the authorities have started the work required to introduce a career stream in the public service and modify the special laws. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicThe authorities expect to finalize a debt-reduction package with commercial banks by end-1995, and clear remaining arrears by early 1996 with the rescheduling of the petroleum debt. However, because the secondary market price for Panamanian debt dropped notably since December 1994 as a result of developments in Mexico, the buyback equivalent of the alternative proposals being discussed now exceeds that price by a significant margin, thus raising questions about the efficiency of the proposals. Moreover, these developments have made the par bond option relatively more attractive and the upfront cost of the package could increase markedly should most banks select this option. Panama may need to modify some of the terms of the options so as to keep the cost of the package within acceptable bounds and to ensure its overall efficiency, which could affect the timing of the conclusion of an agreement. The medium-term scenario assumes that the debt package is concluded by the end of the year and that external interest obli- gations would be reduced by about 2 percent of GDP in 1996, with an upfront cost of IJS$260 million, 45 percent of which would be financed by Panama. On the basis of the measures noted above, and the completion of a debt package with commercial banks by end-1995, the public sector position would deteriorate to a deficit of about 2 percent of GDP for 1995, but would return to a small surplus in 1996. 1/ The deterioration in 1995 would result from a sharp increase in external interest obligations and a planned increase in investment outlays. External interest obligations rise by about 1.5 percent of GDP reflecting an increase in interest rates from 5.1 percent in 1994 to 7.5 percent in 1995. At the same time capital expenditure, mainly by the SSA and the public enterprises, are planned to increase by over 1 percent of GDP to more than recover the decline experi- enced in 1994. Interest obligations decline by about 1.9 percent of GDP in 1996 as a result of the implementation of the debt package with commercial banks. The external financing of the nonfinancial public sector in 1995 is projected at about 5 percent of GDP, and to decline to less than half a percentage point of GDP in 1996. The financing for 1995 is largely com- prised of interest arrears (accumulated mainly by the Central Government) and includes financing for the bank debt package equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP. The public sector would improve its net creditor position with the BNP by US$265 million (3.6 percent of GDP) in 1995 and US$70 million (0.9 percent of GDP) in 1996. In the staff's view, the fiscal measures being implemented by the authorities appear to be sufficient to achieve a viable fiscal position in 1995-96. provided a debt-reduction package is agreed with the commercial banks. However, Panama would continue to face structural impediments to fiscal viability stemming from the lack of buoyancy of the tax system; 1/ The projections also assume that the sale of INTEL is completed by mid-1996 (see below), and that APN would have contracted out the operations of the port of Cristobal by end-1995 and of Balboa by end-1996.

In addition, Panama faces uncertainties regarding domestic and external developments over the medium term. These refer to the time required for the structural reforms to bear results; the impact on tax collections entailed by Panama's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO); and the impact on the economy of the integration of the reverted areas and the withdrawal of U.S. personnel. All these issues point to the need for additional measures in order to reduce the risk to the financial position of the public sector, in particular that of the Central Government. In this connection, the mission discussed with the authorities the need to examine the tax system to increase its buoyancy; introduce sddi- tional cost-recovery measures in the education and health sectors; reduce central government expenditure further, particularly by cutting public sector employment, containing wage increases by modifying the special laws, and eliminating the deficit of the Complementary Pension Fund; strengthen the financial position of the SSA by broadening its revenue base and limit- ing growth of benefits; increase further private sector participation in public enterprises and investment outlays, including infrastructure; and accelerate the implementation of an action plan for the reverted areas. The authorities were in general agreement with the mission's assessment. They noted that they were reviewing the tax system and studying measures to strengthen tax administration; however, they did not consider it viable to extend the sales tax to services as recommended by the mission. On cost- recovery measures, the authorities said that steps had been taken to that effect in the 1995 budget and that they were reviewing possible additional measures in this ares. Also, the authorities agreed with the mission on the need to cut and not just contain the public sector wage bill, and expressed confidence that once a career stresm is adopted in the public sector and the rate of unemployment declines further, they would be in a position to imple- ment actions to this effect. On the deficit of the Complementary Pension Fund, the authorities were aware of the problem posed by the widening of the deficit of the Fund, but in light of the heavy reform agenda, they planned to address this issue later in the year. u The authorities acknowledged the need to broaden the contribution base of the SSA and contain the expansion of benefits, but were not in a position to discuss specific actions at this time. On private 1/ This deficit, which amounted to 0.4 percent of GDP in 1994, is financed by the Central Government. u The authorities undertook, in discussion with the World Bank on extending the ERL, to prepare an action plan for the elimination of this deficit to be agreed with the Bank prior to disbursement of the second tranche, and will submit such a plan to the Assembly by third tranche disbursement.

Structural nolicies The authorities have agreed with the World Bank on an action plan end schedule of implementation of the structural reforms envisaged under the ERL, and the loan has now been extended by 15 months through June 1996. Substantial progress has been achieved already in meeting second tranche conditionality under the ERL and also regarding implementation of the reforms agreed with the IDB under the PERL. Second tranche disbursement under the PERL is envisaged to take place by September 1995, end under the ERL in November 1995. In addition, the IDB has commenced the preparation of a US$120 million Investment Sector Loan (ISL) to support the Government's medium-term economic program. The authorities have moved swiftly in the area of privatization, end in February 1995 the Assembly approved the incorporation of INTEL end the modification of the charter law of IRHE to allow private sector par- ticipation in the expansion of generation cepacity. u The authorities expect to bring 49 percent of INTEL's shares to the point of sale by end- 1995, with 2 percent of the shares to be reserved for the employees, and the rest retained by the Government. A management contract for 20 years will be grented to the company that acquires the shares, which will be required also to fund the investment: needed to upgrade and expand INTEL's capital equipment. Proceeds of the sale will be deposited in a special fund for financing public investment. Cellular phone services will be contracted out to the private sector by end-1995. Regarding APN, the authorities intend to contract out to the private sector the operations of the port of Cristobal by end-1995 and those of Balboa by end-1996; APN will retain a supervisory function. Pending a decision on the modalities of private sector participation in the water and sewage company (IDAAN), measures are being implemented to reduce waste end increase revenue by installing meters, and the tariff structure is being revised. During 1995, the authorities plan to submit to the Assembly a draft bill to permit private sector participation in the area of insurance of agricultural activities, with a view to prtvatizing the Agricultural ~nsur- ante Institute (ISA). Also, a consulting firm will be hired to prepare the prospectus to bring the sugar company La Victoria to the point of sale. To improve implementation of the publfc sector investment program, procedures have been emended so es to reduce the time required to process procurements end disbursements, and the fiscal code has been modified to 1/ The law also calls for the creation, within a year, of a regulatory agency to govern energy policy.

Also, a unit has been created in the Ministry of Planning to develop investment projects for the public sector or for offer to the private sector. The authorities also have moved decisively regarding Panama's acces- sion to the WTO, and starting November 1994, they have conducted rounds of bilateral and multilateral discussions. The authorities expect to submit to the Assembly the Protocol of Accession to the WTO by end-1995. In addition, all price controls are to be eliminated in the context of a Law for the Protection of Consumers, which is expected to be approved by the Assembly by October 1995. With this law, the authorities also intend to identify and sanction practices that restrict free competition, protect consumers, and introduce anti-dumping regulations compatible with WTO standards. The authorities are preparing bills to amend the Labor Code and the Banking Law. The amendments to the Labor Code would seek to achieve more flexibility regarding the dismissal of workers, relocation of workers within a firm, compensation for higher productivity, and elimination of government intervention in labor disputes. The reform of the Banking Law (consistent with the norms of the Basle Committee) would include the restructuring of the National Banking Commission to provide it with administrative indepen- dence and enhance its supervisory functions. AlSO, to further strengthen banking supervision as well as to improve Panama's standing abroad, a unit has been established to collect and analyze information to monitor the financial activities of private firms at the national level. The Authority for the Interoceanic Region (ARI), which was created in May 1993, is in charge of managing and determining the use of the reverted areas, and aims to have a plan for the development of these areas completed by mid-1996. The reversion will lead to the incorporation into the economy of large tracts of land and facilities, but also to the loss of the con- tribution to the economy by U.S. troops, wages paid to the Panamanian civil personnel who work in the military bases, and expenditures on goods and services in the local economy. The AR1 has the crucial role of developing these areas as to achieve not only a positive effect but a substantial contribution to sustaining a high rate of growth. While awaiting completion of the global development plan, and for the use of the areas that reverted in 1994 and those to revert in 1995-96, AR1 is conducting feasibility studies for the development of an international educational cater, a tourism complex, alternative uses for one of the military airports, and the privatization of one of the hospitals. Also, AR1 is negotiating with international investors the expansion and management of one of the ports and the construction of a highway between Panama City and Colon. With the modification of the Forestry Law in December 1994, the agency in charge of protecting the environment (INRENARE) was given the authority to suspend projects detrimental to the environment.

To alleviate poverty, the efficiency and equitability of social spend- ing will be improved through sector reforms, especially in education and health. Also, through the strengthening of the Social Emergency Fund (FES) and with funding from the IDB, the authorities intend to target directly those groups that are most susceptible to malnutrition and disease. 3. Medium-term outlook The projections reflect the adjustment efforts described above and are based on the maintenance of the broad policy thrust discussed with the authorities in subsequent years, including the structural reforms. The projections also assume implementation of a debt-reduction package with commercial banks (including short-term debt) lJ at end-1995 and a reschedul- ing agreement with Mexico and Venezuela in early 1996. The fiscal position would turn from a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP in 1995 into a small surplus in 1996, which increases to 2.5 percent of GDP by the year 2000 (Table 10). This largely reflects lower investment and higher corporate income tax revenues as the privatization program proceeds, a decline in the central government wage bill due to a reduction in employ- ment and automatic wage increases, and lower external interest obligations by about 2 percentage points of GDP through 1997 and 3 percentage points by the year 2000 due to the debt package with commercial banks. Private sector investment is expected to grow from 18 percent of GDP in 1995 to 22 percent by the year 2000, and economic growth is projected to accelerate from 4 percent a year in 1995-96 to 5 percent thereafter. The relatively high level of private investment is based on an anticipated favorable response to the structural reforms aimed at increasing the coun- try's competitiveness and creating new investment opportunities. The external current account deficit is forecast to remain at 6 per- cent of GDP in 1995 and to decrease to less than 4 percent by the year 2000, reflecting relatively conservative assumptions regarding export growth at some 7 percent a year. The current account could improve more rapidly than forecast if the structural reforms produce early results leading to a more buoyant export performance. The current account deficit would also be smal- ler if the required external financing required to support the assumed pri- lJ For illustrative purposes, in. was assumed that the debt-reduction package would consist of four options: a discount bond, a par bond, a temporary interest-reduction bond, and new money. The options were constructed to have roughly a similar market value. Also, it was assumed that the past-due interest would be normalized through a cash downpayment and through a bond carrying a market interest rate.

As a result of the debt package, external interest obligations would decline from 6.6 percent of GDP in 1995 to 4.7 percent of GDP in 1996 and to 3.8 percent by the year 2000 notwithstanding an assumption that interest rates remain at 7.5 percent throughout the period. External debt in rela- tion to GDP would decline from over 80 percent of GDP in 1995 to 52 percent by the year 2000 while the debt-service ratio would fall by about 10 per- centage points to 17 percent. IV. Staff Aouraisal Since 1990, Panama has adopted policies which have produced a broad- based economic recovery, and a substantial strengthening of the public finances. Real GDP growth averaged 7 percent a year, inflation remained below 2 percent, and the unemployment rate declined from 20 percent to 14 percent. The fiscal position improved from a deficit of about 2.5 per- cent of GDP in 1990 to a small surplus in 1994. Panama also made substan- tial progress in normalizing relations with external creditors, including multilateral agencies, Paris Club creditors, external bond holders, and commercial banks on short-term debt. Some progress was also attained in the implementation of structural reforms. HOWC?Vt?l-) the authorities fell short of complying with agreements undertaken with the World Bank and IDB in this area, raising questions about the financing of the program and resulting in the lapsing of the SBA with two purchases outstanding. Moreover, although Panama's economic performance continued to be satisfactory in 1994, the deceleration in economic growth and the persistence of a high unemployment rate are cause of concern. The new Administration, that took office in September 1994, has pre- pared a comprehensive program which, in the context of achieving fiscal via- bility and normalizing relations with external creditors, seeks to broaden and accelerate the implementation of structural reforms with a view to mak- ing the economy more competitive. The program also aims at facilitating the integration of the reverted areas, addressing the problem of unemployment, and reducing the incidence of poverty. The fiscal measures being contemplated, together with the implementa- tion of a debt package with the commercial benks, are considered sufficient to achieve the needed fiscal improvements in 1995-96. However, further mea- sures may be necessary to correct remaining fiscal bottlenecks, and to safe- guard against other risks to the successful implementation of the program. These include uncertainties as to the effects of some of the reforms being proposed, including the fiscal implication of trade liberalization and tax reforms, and the impact on the economy resulting from the reversion of the Canal areas. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - In this connection, the staff recommended additional fiscal measures to be implemented in 1995-96. These included steps to increase the buoyancy of the tax system: cost-recovery measures in the education and health sectors; further reduction of central government expenditure, particularly the wage bill and the deficit of the Complementary Pension Fund; strengthening of the financial position of the SSA; increased private sector participation in public enterprises and investment outlays, including infrastructure; and acceleration of the implementation of an action plan for the reverted areas. In the absence of an independent exchange rate policy, cost-reducing measures that improve resource allocation and stimulate private investment are required to increase external competitiveness. Reform of the incentives system and of the labor code, enactment of anti-trust legislation, privati- zation, accession to the WTO, and price liberalization adopted by the author- ities constitute important mechanisms to achieve this objective. The staff also welcomes the authorities' efforts to reform the Banking Law in line with the norms of the Bale Commitcee and introduction of financial innova- tions ( including the restructuring of the National Banking Commission to enhance.its supervisory functions and give it administrative and financial independence. The staff welcomes the understandings reached by the authorities with the World Bank on an implementation schedule of the structural reforms under the Economic Recovery Loan, which have resulted in the extension of the loan through June 1996, and the progress being attained under the Public Enterprise Reform Loan of the IDB. These reforms are critical for the achievement of a financially viable public sector and higher rates of growth. Agreement on an Investment Sector Loan which is being sought actively by the authorities with the IDB is important also to ensure viability of the program proposed by the authorities. The progress achieved by the new Administration in the implementa- tion of financial and structural policies, the awareness expressed by the authorities on the remaining areas of concern, and their receptiveness to the staff's recommendations bode well for a successful implementation of the economic program and attainment of its medium-term objectives. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Panama be held on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Real sectoz Data on wages and employment are prepared with a considerable lag and the coverage of real sector statistics in m is poor. 2. Public finance Data on the public enterprises and agencies are compiled only on a cash basis and with some lag. Monitoring financial developments in the public sector would be facilitated if these data would also be provided on an accrual basis end in a more timely manner. Also, information on intra- public sector transfers needs to be provided in a more consistent fashion. The coverage of government finance statistics for monthly and quarterly data published in m is inconsistent with the corresponding annual data, since the latter include the operations of decentralized agencies and social security funds. 3. MOnetaN accOUntq Data on the operations of the commercial banks are prepared by the National Banking Commission with a lag of two to three months. There also is a problem with obtaining timely information on interest rates. There are no consistent data prepared on the financial position of the public banks, particularly the two smaller ones, the National Mortgage Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank. 4. Balance of uavments There is a need to improve the timeliness of balance of payments (BOP) data, particularly that of the capital account. The Office of the Comptroller publishes preliminary annual BOP data only in September although current account data are made available in the first quarter of the year. There also is a need to improve coverage of the external transactions of enterprises operating in the Colon Free Zone and to include data on flows of direct investment income and capital of the banking sector. Errors in these areas cause considerable distortions in the BOP.
