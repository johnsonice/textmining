Economic activity declined again (3.1 percent), primarily on account of depressed port activity and lower domestic demand. The fiscal situation remained critical. The consolidated deficit, although declining, necessitated further government borrowing from commercial banks and "forced contributions" from public enterprises. Still, arrears (mostly domestic) continued to build up. Also, the external payments position deteriorated leading to a loss in gross international reserves. 0 The authorities initiated an adjustment and reform process with the adoption last October of a supplementary budget for 1995, within the context of a medium-term adjustment and reform strategy that they had started to elaborate earlier in the year. Key elements of the strategy are: (i) substantial financial policy tightening, with emphasis on prompt budgetary adjustment and restructuring; (ii) continued full adherence to the present currency board arrangement; (iii) maintenance of a restriction-free exchange and trade regime and prudent external debt policy; (iv) compre- hensive structural reforms to promote competitiveness and enhance the supply responsiveness of the economy; (iv) adequate concessional external financing; and (vi) technical assistance to strengthen the macroeconomic database and administrative capacity. 0 Fiscal adjustment holds the key to the restoration of macroeconomic stability in Djibouti. Accordingly, the authorities' program relies primarily on a significant frontloaded and sustained reduction and restructuring of budgetary expenditures, to be achieved primarily through measures to reduce permanently the wage bill (equal to over 80 percent of government revenue) starting in 1996. To this end, the authorities intend to implement: (i) cutbacks in the nominal wage bill in 1996; (ii) a demobilization program involving over 9,000 defense and security personnel starting in June 1996, for which World Bank assistance has been requested as well as from other donors; and (iii) a civil service reform over the medium term. 0 The staff regards the policy objectives and measures in the program as appropriate for reducing the macroeconomic imbalances and making headway for addressing Djibouti's deep-seated structural weaknesses. If fully implemented, the program should provide the foundation for a comprehensive medium-term program that could be the basis for an ESAF arrangement.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in conjunction with negotiations on an adjustment and economic reform program that could be supported by a 14-month stand-by arrangement (SBA). u In concluding the last Article IV Consultation on June 22, 1994, 2/ Executive Directors expressed concern about Djibouti's deteriorating economic and financial performance, as evidenced by negative per capita income growth, mounting domestic payments arrears, widening external imbalance, and declining reserves. To prevent such developments from endangering Djibouti's current fixed exchange rate regime and its role as a regional transit and financial center, Directors called for the prompt implementation of a comprehensive adjustment and reform program, based in particular on strong corrective financial policies, and supported by external financial assistance on appropriately concessional terms. In the attached letter to the Managing Director accompanied by a Memorandum of Economic Policies (Appendix II, Attachment), the Government of Djibouti requests a 14-month SBA starting April 1996, in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.6 million (40 percent of quota), in support of its structural adjustment program for 1996. 3 1/ Discussions were held in Djibouti during July 16-20, 1995 and September 20-October 3, 1995, and continued at Fund headquarters during the Annual Meetings in early October and in Djibouti during November 15-21, 1995. Negotiations on the program were completed at headquarters during February 26-March 3, 1996. The staff representatives were Miss Valdivieso (Head), Messrs. Thai, Mongelli, Rizavi, and Treichel (all MED), and Mrs. Sylla, staff assistant (BLS). Messrs. Bell and Chauffour (both MED) participated in the July 1995 mission. The staff representatives met with the President and the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Finance and Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Ministers of Transport and Defense, the Chief of the Presidential Cabinet, other senior government officials, and donors' and creditors' representatives. World Bank missions were in the field at the same time as Fund missions during 1995 and World Bank staff participated in some of the policy discussions. u SM/94/129 and SM/94/135. Djibouti has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current and capital international transactions. Djibouti is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Djibouti's relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are provided in Appendices III and IV, respectively, and statistical and technical assistance issues are discussed in Appendix V. 1/ Djibouti has made no use of Fund resources to date. It is proposed that purchases under this first arrangement with Djibouti be made in five installments (Table 1). Djibouti's projected position in the Fund during the period of the requested SBA is presented in Table 2.

Conclusion of the negotiations took longer than anticipated due to technical difficulties associated in part with the weak institutional structure, staffing constraints, and the need to obtain more precise information on financing assurances from key donors. The authorities initiated the adjustment and reform process with the adoption last October of a supplementary budget for 1995. A package of additional measures was incorporated in the 1996 budget, which will be accompanied by a number of structural reforms. Moreover, th'e authorities are currently formulating a set of medium-term structural reforms and policies, in close consultation with Fund and World Bank staff, in the context of a macroeconomic framework, which could form the b$asis for a three-year program that could eventually be supported by an arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, in the latter part of 1996. The authorities have provided core data to the Fund missions, but have been slow in responding to information requests subsequent to missions reflecting the weak--albeit improving--institutional base. Monetary aggregates, including data on international reserves, are published promptly and are generally considered to be reliable, even though thely do not distinguish the residency of the holders of foreign currency deposits. There are no official estimates of national income accounts and no consumer price index, except for expatriates. Other statistical data, particularly in the fiscal and balance of payments areas, pose problems as to periodicity, coverage, timeliness, and quality. Increased efforts are required to improve this situation, thereby facilitating policy formulation and providing a firmer basis for surveillance. II. Backzround and Recent Economic DeveloDments 1. Background In the last few years, Djibouti's economic and financial performance has been adversely affected by: regional instability, influx to Djibouti of about 100,000 refugees (out of a total population of 600,000), a domestic armed conflict (1991-94), and, more recently, declining foreign assistance and increased competition from the neighboring ports of Assab and Berbera. The adverse effects of these factors have been compounded by an inadequate domestic policy response and deep-seated structural weaknesses and cost rigidities. As a result, there has been a continuous compression in economic activity in the context of high unemployment (40 percent) and weak social indicators (Table 3). At the same time, inability to reduce government expenditure has led to the emergence of sizable fiscal and balance of payments imbalances and a rapid accumulation of the government's domestic rirrears and domestic public debt. In turn, these developments, together with "forced contributions" to the budget, have led to a substantial deterioration of the financial position of the public Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- Table 3.

Recent economic develoDments Preliminary information points to a further deterioration in the economic and financial situation in 1995. Economic activitv declined further (3.1 percent), primarily on account of depressed port activity and related services and lower domestic demand (Table 3 and Chart 1). u However, inflation (as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for French expatriates) slowed somewhat to 5 percent, reflecting a stabilization in the prices of services, transport, tourism, and utilities. 2/ The consolidated fiscal deficit declined in 1994 and during January- September 1995 as a result of the cessation of the armed conflict and a continued forced expenditure compression imposed by unpaid suppliers. w Nevertheless, the fiscal situation remained critical (Table 4, Chart 1). Expenditure remained high owing to the weight of the wage bill. Faced with a marked decline in external grants, the government deficit in both years was covered by borrowing from commercial banks and further resort to forced contributions from public enterprises. 4/ Still, domestic and external payments arrears were incurred (Table 5 and Chart 2). In response to these developments, a supplementary budget (Table 6) was adopted in October 1995 aimed at reducing the consolidated fiscal deficit to 11.7 percent in 1995 (from a trend of 20 percent of GDP) and the pace of arrears accumulation, and at improving fiscal management. 5/ On the revenue side, there were additional receipts estimated at about 0.8 percent u GDP is estimated by the staff on the basis of some indicators of sectoral production provided by the authorities. 2/ These account for about 45 percent of the consumer basket. Price movements in Djibouti largely reflect prices in France and the variations of the U.S. dollar/French franc exchange rate. 2/ Unless otherwise indicated, the consolidated fiscal deficit referred to in this report is on a payment-order basis and excludes official grants. k/ Under the existing currency board with full currency cover, the Government does not borrow from the National Bank of Djibouti (NBD). u These included: (i) appointing the Minister of Finance as the sole expenditure comptroller to centralize all expenditure authorizations; (ii) undertaking a comprehensive survey of all government personnel and all wages, salaries, and related benefits paid to them, to ensure a transparent and monitorable wage bill and detect irregularities through the audit of the results currently being carried out by the Ministry of Finance; and (iii) conducting a survey of housing allowances (both in the form of cash and leases paid by the Government) to eliminate unjustified housing payments.

J/ Interest rates are market determined; while interest rates on one-month deposits remained unchanged (at about 3 percent), lending rates increased at the upper end of the range (from 12.5-16 percent at end-1994 to 12-18 percent at end-September 1995) consistent with growing risk premium and the banks' higher provisioning against non-performing loans. 4J In 1994-95, the expansion of domestic credit (mainly to the Government in 1994 and to the private sector in 1995, on account of a resumption of trade activities in neighboring countries) exceeded the growth in money demand, leading to a loss of net foreign assets. As a result, broad money grew by about 3.3 percent in 1995, compared with 1.5 percent in 1994 (Table 7). The composition of broad money changed during 1995, with an increase in the share of time and foreign currency deposits (Chart 3), reflecting a growing preference for bons de caisse (an instrument denominated in U.S. dollars in bearer form), and erosion in confidence. The overall external oavments position weakened further in 1995 notwithstanding a reduction in the external current account deficit (excluding official grants) to 17.9 percent of GDP (Table 8 and Chart 4). The deficit reduction, mostly on account of a sharp contraction in imports of goods and services, masked the adverse impact on re-exports and receipts from services of the redirection of trade to neighboring country ports and the scaling down of foreign intervention in the Somalia conflict. With higher amortization payments and short-term capital outflows, the overall balance switched from a surplus (0.2 percent of GDP) to a deficit (4.9 percent of GDP) in 1995, and gross official reserves fell to US$71 million or 4.8 months of imports for domestic consumption. 5J External debt and debt service indicators remained relatively low, reflecting the I-J The revenue measures included: an increase in the reference base for excise taxation on khat (DF 34 million); a rise in the patriotic contribution rate (DF 234 million); payment by civil servants benefitting from free housing of 20 percent of the market rental value (DF 64 million); and contributions and dividends from public enterprises (DF 374 million). 2J The expenditure measures included: a 60 percent reduction in the benefits paid to all employees covered by the budget (DF 380 million); and a cutback in outlays in materials and supplies (DF 30 million). 3J The main features of monetary management in Djibouti are described in the Recent Economic Developments report. 4J The share of non-performing loans relative to total claims on the private sector (excluding the two banks currently under liquidation) declined from an estimated 20 percent in 1993 to 18.8 percent in 1994, before rising again to 19.4 percent by end-October 1995. 5J Net international reserves were equivalent to about 115 percent of the liabilities of the currency board.

III. Report on the Discussions and Medium-Term Adiustment and Reform StratePv The policy discussions were held in the recognition that, in the absence of prompt and forceful adjustment and reform efforts backed by adequate external financing, Djibouti faced the prospects of a further contraction of economic activity, unsustainable fiscal and external imbalances, disorderly expenditure compression, and a further accumulation of domestic and external arrears. The authorities' program is predicated on regaining control of the fiscal situation in the short run and implementing medium-term far-reaching reforms to address the deeply embedded structural problems of the economy. The authorities started in early 1995 to outline the new orientation of their medium-term economic adjustment and reform strategy. As the gravity of the situation could not await the full formulation of such a strategy, the Government undertook immediate corrective actions, consistent with the orientation of their strategy. Specifically, measures taken in October 1995 supplementary budget not only reduced fiscal imbalances but provided an important stepping stone for the more comprehensive 1996 program of economic adjustment and reform. 1. Medium-term strategv and macroeconomic framework. 1996-2000 The authorities' medium-term strategy aims at returning the country to a more stable macroeconomic environment while creating the conditions for the resumption of sustained growth and employment, external payments viability, and poverty alleviation. Attainment of these objectives is expected to contribute to preserving the integrity of the currency board and maintaining the fixed exchange rate of the Djibouti franc, to which the authorities attach high priority as a means to safeguard Djibouti's role as a regional transit and financial center. u Total external debt outstanding declined from about 57 percent of GDP in 1994 to 54 percent in 1995, reflecting largely the impact of debt forgiveness of some US$18 million granted by Saudi Arabia in July 1995. However, external debt service payments continued to rise reaching 7.4 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services during 1995 (Table 9).

Main obiectives The medium-term strategy envisages: (i) a recovery in real GDP growth to an average annual rate of 3 percent in 1997-2000, after a stabilization in 1996; (ii) a gradual decline in the external current account deficit (excluding official grants) from 17.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 12.5 percent by 2000; and (iii) an improvement in gross official reserves to 5.7 months of imports by 2000, together with a phased normalization of the domestic and external payments situation (Table 10). b. Macroeconomic framework and oolicies The targeted recovery in economic activity is predicated on the resumption of investment activities, initially accounted for by the largest public enterprises (electricity, water, airport, port, and telecommunications) and supplemented subsequently by the private sector (telecommunications and banking and insurance). Gross fixed investment would increase from 12 percent of GDP in 1995 to close to 16 percent by 2000. To this end, gross national savings are projected to :rise from 4 percent of GDP in 1995 to 10 percent by 2000, resulting principally from the Government's fiscal consolidation efforts. The termination of the Government's practice to preempt financial resources through forced transfers to the budget and buildup of arrears, and the improved economic and regulatory environment, resulting from the sustained implementation of the adjustment and structural reform policies enunciated below, are expected to contribute to the attainment of the higher projected levels of savings, investment, and production. The kev elements of the strategy are: (i) substantial financial policy tightening, with emphasis on prompt budgetary adjustment and restructuring; (ii) continued full adherence to the principles of the present currency board arrangement; (iii) maintenance of a restriction-free exchange and trade regime and prudent external debt policy; (iv) comprehensive structural reforms to promote competitiveness and enhance the supply responsiveness of the economy; (v) adequate concessional external financing to support the adjustment and reform effort; and (vi) technical assistance to address the weakness in the macroeconomic database and administrative and institutional capacity. IV. The Program for 1996 1. Macroeconomic obiectives and policies Consistent with the medium-term strategy, the program for 1996 envisages a stabilization of real GDP, reduction in the external current account deficit (to 15.3 percent), and higher gross international reserves (to the equivalent of 5.2 months of imports). To achieve these objectives, the program calls for a reduction in the consolidated government deficit (on a payment-order basis and excluding official grants) from 11.7 percent of GDP in 1995 to 6.1 percent in 1996.

Fiscal Dolicv and reform The program calls for early implementation of broad-based measures to effectively address the major budgetary constraints (Box 1). To this end, fiscal adjustment will rely primarily on: (i) a significant front-loaded and sustained reduction and restructuring of budgetary expenditures, to be achieved predominately through measures to permanently reduce the wage bill starting in 1996; (ii) structural reforms to improve fiscal management; and (iii) the initiation of a comprehensive medium-term reform of the tax system. Box 1. Djibouti - Budgetary Constraints Key budgetary constraints include: (i) the heavy burden of personnel costs and military outlays, inherited from the civil strife (1991-94), which contributed to inflating the wage bill to 24 percent of GDP or over 80 'percent of revenue in 1994, and military and security outlays to al:most 14 percent of GDP, with the personnel component representing 53 percent of the 1994 wage bill; (ii) the prevalence of expenditure overruns and non-transparency, reflecting the lax observance and the inadequacy of existing expenditure control procedures; and (iii) a complex tax system reflecting the simultaneous presence of a relatively high tax revenue to GDP ratio (28 percent in 1994) and extensive exemptions, both limiting the scope for further revenue increases. (1) The budget for 1996 The targeted reduction in the fiscal deficit for 1996 is to be achieved mainly through the revenue and expenditure measures incorporated in the 1996 budget (Box 2), which emphasizes a reduction of current outlays, particularly in the wage bill. On the expenditure side, net savings to be generated by the adopted measures are estimated at 4.9 percent of GDP (Table 6); reducing total expenditure to 35.3 percent of GDP in 1996. This reduction, however, takes into account the need to protect budgetary allocations for priority sector and investment outlays.

Djibouti - Main Measures of the 1996 Budget Exoeoditure The main expenditure-reducing measures (5.5 percent of GDP) are: 0 reducing the wage bill (by 4.5 percent of GDP) through: (1) elimination of irregularities in employment and cash allowances survey; (2) withholding of 10 percent on all salaries, wages, and related benefits exceeding DF 60,000; aod (3) cutback in benefits aod salaries of embassy personnel and elimination of overtime work; 0 cutting expenditure on materials and supplies through: control of utilities consumption and phased elimination of housing rental payments by the Government, to be based on the results of the March 1996 survey of housing allowances; and 0 lowering maintenance and transfers outlays. The savings will be partially offset by increases (0.6 percent of GDP) in: recruitment for education aod health sectors; other PIP-related current expenditures; and in capital outlays. Revenue side. The main revenue-enhancing measures (2.5 percent of GDP) are: 0 enlarging the profit tax base by lowering the threshold of taxation; 0 increasing the tax rate on wages and salaries exceeding DF 25,000; and enlarging the tax base through inclusion of all wage-related benefits; 0 increasing the reference value for the taxation of khat from DF 550 to DF 750 per kilo; 0 replacing the ad valorem by a specific tax on cigarettes; 0 introducing a 5 percent tax on registration; and 0 raising oootax revenue, reflecting: public enterprises’ reimbursement of earlier onlending by the Government of proceeds of external debt which was canceled; the differential between the administered and import prices of oil products; and the proceeds of sales of real estate. The main revenue-reducing measures (loss of 1.8 percent of GDP) are: 0 reducing the patriotic contribution rate from 15 percent of GDP to 10 percent (the level prevailing before October 1995) for all wage earners except for Government employees, for whom it is replaced by an equivalent salary withholding; and 0 lowering the consumption tax 00 a number of basic products.

The measures reflect the priority attached by the Government to enhance equity, including through protecting the most vulnerable sectors of the population. The authorities have also decided to take measures to prevent any further accumulation of new arrears, including adherence to the practice of timely cash payments for utilities consumption and acquisition of goods and services from private suppliers. In addition, they intend to implement a plan to start eliminating in 1996, existing arrears on external debt and nondebt obligations, and salaries to be followed by other categories of arrears. As part of this plan, they envisage to implement a settlement program by end-April 1996, through the compensation of cross-debts between the State and public enterprises, and to formulate a medium-term plan to reduce the remaining arrears to all suppliers, including pub'lic enterprises. The objective is to eliminate the stock of Government's domestic arrears and debt over a five-year period starting in 1996. This would help restore the normal functioning of the economy and the credibility of the Government. After taking into account the programmed reduction in arrears (6.1 percent of GDP), scheduled payments to public enterprises and commercial banks, and the expected use of the local currency counterpart of the purchases from the IMF, the resulting financing gap for 1996 would be equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP. This gap, which does not take into account the cost of the demobilization program, would be fil:Led through concessional external financing from the EU, France, and bilateral donors that has already been committed, and through the expected rescheduling of overdue nondebt obligations owed to France, being sought by the authorities. (2) The wage bill The achievement of the permanent reduction in the wage bill requires early implementation of both a demobilization program and a civil service reform. While recognizing the importance of both measures, the authorities emphasized that priority had to be given to the ilemobilization program, which they saw as a means not only to reduce the overall level of expenditure but also to modify its structure, by releasing resources that could be redirected toward the provision of priority social services. The demobilization program, which has been under discussion with World Bank staff since October 1995, is scheduled to be finalized by June 1996. It will cover the demobilization of over 9,000 defense and security personnel over an 18-month period starting in June 1996. The cost (consisting of severance pay only) is tentatively estimated at 2.4 percent of 1996 GDP, of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - which 1 percent of GDP would be incurred in 1996, 1/ leading to corresponding increases in the fiscal deficits. Starting in 1998, however, the deficit would be lower by about 1.8 percent of GDP excluding any additional savings that may arise from nonsalary-related expenditure. To finance the program, the authorities have requested World Bank assistance to seek foreign donors' financing, the availability of which will determine the pace of the demobilization. As to the civil service reform, the October 1995 survey of government wages provides a sound starting point for such a reform pending the elaboration of an action plan, for which World Bank assistance has been requested. Its implementation would ensure, over the medium term, a leaner, motivated and efficient administration and would need to be accompanied by a social program to assist retrenched civil servants, and a strategy for private sector development. Such actions are expected to form an important part of a fully elaborated medium-term reform program. (3) Fiscal management and other structural reforms A number of structural measures to improve the efficiency of expenditure and strengthen fiscal management have been implemented. u The measures include: (i) a reallocation of public expenditures on the basis of clearly established priorities (toward social services), which were discussed with the World Bank in the context of the Public Expenditure Review (PER); (ii) improvements in capital expenditure programming, execution, and monitoring, including agreeing with the World Bank on a core list of projects oriented mainly toward infrastructure and social services, for inclusion in the annual tranche of the PIP; (iii) strict observance of the budgetary and expenditure control procedures and imposition of sanctions, if needed, to avoid expenditure overruns; and (iv) strengthening budgetary control procedures, by expanding the coverage of the 1996 budget to include all government financial operations (including all investment expenditures) whether externally or domestically financed. The aim of accompanying tax reform is to increase the elasticity, efficiency, and equity of the tax system by simplifying it, reducing tax- induced distortions, combatting tax evasion, and eliminating ad hoc and illicit exemptions. The authorities also intend to improve Customs administration with technical assistance from France starting in June 1996 and to hire the services of a pre-shipment inspection company in April 1996. A plan of action for tax reform will be elaborated with Fund technical assistance scheduled for end-March 1996. u Taking into account the 3,300 demobilized soldiers since late 1993, the size of the remaining defense and security personnel is currently estimated at 16,000 persons as compared with a pre-war level of roughly 5,000. The medium-term scenario does not include the cost of the demobilization program. u See Annexes II and III of the Memorandum of Economic Policies.

Monetary nolicv Consistent with the output and inflation targets for 1996 and assumed broadly unchanged velocity, the program envisages an expansion of broad money by 5.0 percent, with net domestic assets projected to increase by 2.7 percent (in terms of beginning money stock) and net foreign assets by 2.3 percent. Further to the strict observance of the budgetary targets to help protect the integrity of the currency board, the authorities are committed to: (i) avoid further borrowing from commercial banks; (ii) continue to allow interest rates to be market-determined; and (iii) safeguard the soundness of the banking system. They will also avoid a repetition of the 1994 practice of central bank provision of guarantees for government borrowing from commercial banks. In line with past practice of maintaining a margin of net international reserves over the full cover for the currency board, the authorities indicated that they intended to use the bulk of the IMF purchases under the SBA to maintain a margin close to 9 percent for 1996 as a whole. To this end, they have set quarterly floors on net international reserves in excess of such cover. The authorities viewed a sound and dynamic banking system as being of key importance to avoid jeopardizing adherence to the currency board and for maintaining Djibouti's attractiveness as a regional commercial and financial center. To this end, the central bank will continue to strictly enforce existing prudential regulations and provision for problem loans, and intends to strengthen further its supervisory capabilities through personnel training, supported by external technical assistance. lJ In this regard, the Central Bank has announced that while the tradition of a liberal banking environment will be maintained, on-site inspections of commercial banks will start in the second quarter of 1996. At the same time, steps will be undertaken to expedite the judicial process for bank recovery of nonperforming bank loans. C. External sector policies The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to narrow to 15.3 percent of GDP in 1996 on account of the expected reduction in imports resulting from tighter fiscal policies, a more favorable performance on the services account, and an increase in re-exports. The capital account, although remaining negative due to the low level of long-term net capital inflows, and commercial banks' overseas placement of their excess liquidity, is also expected to improve in 1996. Taking into account scheduled amortization payments, the projected increase in gross official reserves, the programmed reduction of arrears on public debt, and the projected use of Fund resources (USS5.7 million) under the proposed SBA, the financing gap (of about US$28 million) would be covered by concessional external financial assistance from bilateral and multilateral L/ Including from the Fund in the form of a resident MAE expert. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - donors already committed (USS10.1 million), the bilateral rescheduling from France being sought by the authorities (USS18.1 million), and the use of IMF credit. The authorities will maintain the currency board system and an exchange and payments system free of restrictions. They emphasized the predictability of their exchange rate system as the critical contributing factor to the comparative advantage of Djibouti as a regional transit and financial center. Given the narrow domestic production base, the limitations of the size of the domestic and regional markets, and uncertainty in the regional market, there is little scope to actively use exchange rate policy for promoting the domestic tradable goods sector. The authorities recognize that the sustainability of the peg would require a decisive degree of demand restraint, together with actions to correct existing cost rigidities and structural weaknesses. Consistent with the authorities' continued adherence to a prudent external debt management policy, steps were taken in 1995 to improve public external debt management, notably through the requirement of the signature of the Minister of Finance on all loan and grant contracts of the public sector. The authorities are committed to settle during the second quarter of 1996, arrears vis-a-vis bilateral creditors; moreover, they will not: (i) accumulate new external payments arrears; (ii) contract or guarantee any new nonconcessional borrowing other than short-term import credits during the program period; and (iii) introduce or intensify restrictions on the exchange and external payments system. As regards trade reform, the staff recommended that trade taxation be reviewed in the context of the envisaged tax reform. lJ 2. Regulator-v framework and other structural nolicies There is an urgent need for the reform of the public enternrises, with the aim of rendering them more efficient, including by restoring their capacity for self-financing and allowing private sector participation in their capital. To this end, a special unit was set up in the Ministry of Finance at end-November 1995 to centralize the financial oversight of the public enterprise sector; this unit will carry out the reform of the sector as well as the monitoring and evaluation of its results, with assistance from the World Bank. The reform of the sector will initially focus on the five largest enterprises, 2J with particular emphasis on the port, which has been losing traffic because of generally higher tariffs, administrative obstacles, and the lack of an efficient land transport between Djibouti and Addis Ababa. In this connection, the authorities have revised the port's lJ The authorities are aware that the increase in the reference value for excise taxation of khat might be inconsistent with the regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO); they intend to seek clarification on this matter during the first months of 1996. 2J These enterprises are: the port, the airport, the electricity company, the water company, and telecommunications.

Moreover, advice has been requested from the World Bank to develop, by end-September 1996, an action plan to improve the efficiency of the transport sector on a regional basis; France will also provide technical assistance in this area. Other actions envisaged for implementation during 1996 include: (i) completion of a survey of cross-debts between the Government and the public enterprises and settlement of this debt by compensation; (ii) the formulation and implementation of an action plan for the port enterprise; (iii) financial diagnosis for the targeted enterprises, as a basis for formulating enterprise-specific action plans; (iv) modifying the legal framework to enhance managerial autonomy and permit privatization; and (v) complete divestiture of four smaller enterprises between March and November 1996. 1/ The labor market is handicapped by outdated legislation, which seriously restricts hiring and firing decisions and adds to the high cost of labor. The authorities are also aware that in the context of Djibouti's fixed exchange rate regime, prices and wages need to respond quickly to external and domestic shocks to preserve the economy's competitiveness. To this end, they will undertake during 1996 a comprehensive revision of the labor code and formulate a private sector development strategy, with assistance from the World Bank. The authorities emphasized the need for social safetv net provisions to mitigate the impact of adjustment on the most vulnerable sectors of the population, particularly in view of the weak social indicators and the projected retrenchment of military and security personnel. To this end, the allocations for basic education and health services have been protected in the 1996 budget, and an evaluation of poverty will be conducted in June 1996, with World Bank assistance, to identify the most vulnerable segments of the population and their needs so as to better target humanitarian aid. There is an urgent need to strengthen Djibouti's economic management canacitv. In this context, further extensive technical assistance will continue to focus on reinforcing fiscal management and the capacity to analyze, formulate, execute, and monitor macroeconomic policies, as well as on improving the quality and availability of the macroeconomic database (Appendix V). To achieve meaningful progress in this area, the authorities established a committee in charge of monitoring the implementation of adjustment policies, which started operations in November 1995, albeit with limited staff. lJ For more details, see Memorandum of Economic Policies, paragraph 40 and Annex II.

Medium-term balance of navments outlook The baseline balance of payments projections suggests a gradual strengthening of the external accounts over the medium term (Table S), with the current account deficit (excluding official grants) falling from 17.9 percent in 1995 to 12.5 percent of GDP by 2000. Re-exports and export of services are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 6 percent of GDP during 1996-2000, reflecting mainly a recovery of the port, airport, and telecommunications sector activities. Imports for domestic use are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 3 percent in volume terms. These projections are predicated on the following assumptions: (i) sustained implementation of the financial policies and structural reforms embodied in the economic program; (ii) gradual economic recovery in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Yemen as a result of economic reform efforts currently underway; (iii) no aggravation in the sociopolitical situation in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somalia; (iv) an unchanged level of current expenditures by the French military base; and (v) a gradual decline in external grants and external assistance relating to technical cooperation. Taking into account net inflows of capital, based on available commitments, the projected increases in the gross foreign assets of the Central Bank, the above-mentioned reduction of overdue obligations in 1996, and the expected use of Fund resources under the proposed SBA, financing gaps in the order of US$28 million in 1996, US$9 million in 1997, and US$6 million in 1998 are envisaged. These gaps are expected to be filled by additional disbursements of foreign assistance in support of the authorities' adjustment efforts. Public external debt is projected to fluctuate about 54 percent of GDP from 1996 to 2000, while the debt service ratio is expected to decline from 8.6 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services to 8 percent over the same period. 2. Sensitivity analvsis and canacitv to renav the Fund The balance of payments projections are highly sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions regarding potential developments in the import- export business activity and in the services accounts, where the French contribution is particularly important. For instance, if exports of services and re-export trade were to be 6 percent lower than in the baseline scenario, the attendant financing gaps over the medium term would be larger by about US$53 million, necessitating the adoption of further adjustment measures and the mobilization of additional exceptional financing. The authorities acknowledged that any deviation in the implementation of adjustment policies would have immediate adverse effects on the medium-term economic outlook and that contingency measures would need to be immediately adopted to reverse to the original adjustment path. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 -. In order to assess the capacity to repay the Fund, projections have been extended until 2002. Assuming full disbursement under the requested SBA, Djibouti's outstanding obligations to the Fund would peak at 20 percent of quota in the year 2000. L/ The projections show that debt service to the Fund in percent of exports of goods and services would rise from 0.1 percent in 1996 to 1.5 percent in the year 2000 under the baseline scenario and to 1.6 percent under the pessimistic scenario (Table 11). In view of the strength of the program, the commitment of the authorities to take contingency measures in response to deviations from the program objectives or in the face of adverse exogenous shocks, and the Fund' modest share in Djibouti's low debt and debt service, the staff believes that there are reasonable assurances that Djibouti will be able to discharge in time its financial obligations to the Fund. VI. Prozram Monitoring The implementation of the proposed program will be monitored with reference to: (i) performance criteria, which have been set for end-June and end-September 1996, and quantitative indicative targets; these are summarized in Table 12; and (ii) the structural performance criteria, benchmarks, and other measures provided in Annex II of the Memorandum of Economic Policies. Two reviews of the program are scheduled for completion by end-November 1996 and end-February 1997, respectively. The areas to be covered by the reviews are described in the Letter of Intent of the Djibouti authorities. Proposed access, conditions, and the schedule of purchases available to Djibouti under the SBA are set out in Table 1. The program includes adjustors to the ceilings on the consolidated deficit financing and stock of arrears whenever net external financing is at variance with program assumptions. 2/ In particular, in the event net external financing exceeds the amounts assumed in the program, the excess will be used to reduce arrears on goods and services in amounts that will be agreed with the staff of the IMF so as to avoid any undesirable monetary impact. Conversely, in the event net external financing falls short of the amounts assumed in the program, a less ambitious target of arrears reduction is envisaged up to the limits stipulated by the program; a shortfall over these limits will entail offsetting revenue or expenditure adjustments.

The recurrence of large government deficits, financed through the accumulation of arrears and forced transfers from public enterprises seriously impaired the financial health of these enterprises and of the private sector; they also led to reduced levels of investment and economic activity, high levels of nonperforming loans, and an erosion of the tax base. These imbalances raised doubts as to the sustainability of the currency board and of the fixed exchange rate system, which has served Djibouti well and to which the authorities attach high priority. The staff welcomes the authorities' decision to undertake a substantial corrective effort in a medium-term context and to consider the 1996 program as the means for laying the foundation for a comprehensive medium-term adjustment and reform program that they hope to implement starting in late 1996/early 1997. Of particular importance in this endeavor is the adjustment process initiated in October 1995, with the adoption of a supplementary budget and a number of structural fiscal measures, which is further strengthened in 1996. The 1995 supplementary budget and the strengthened policy stance embodied in the 1996 budget are promising steps toward fiscal sustainability over the medium term. The fiscal efforts rightly emphasize expenditure reduction, including difficult decisions, such as a cut in the nominal wage bill. Furthermore, the authorities should be commended for having undertaken a comprehensive survey of wages and benefits of all personnel covered by the budget as it will facilitate the formulation of wages and employment policies consistent with achieving fiscal sustainability. In the view of the staff, the needed wage adjustment measures must be applied uniformly, pressures to do otherwise must be resisted, and the intended physical audit of the results of the survey and elimination of remaining irregularities must be completed as scheduled. Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation calls for a permanent reduction in the wage bill through the expeditious adoption and implementation of the demobilization program and reform of the civil service. In addition to reducing the fiscal imbalance, this would facilitate redirecting resources toward priority sectors, in particular health and human resource development, and to address the needs of the most vulnerable segments of the population. Fiscal adjustment also needs to be supported by strict adherence and enforcement of the expenditure control procedures, particularly to avoid expenditure overruns. The consolidation of domestically and foreign- financed investment projects into the budget, starting with 1996, and the centralization of information on external financing and public debt should improve the transparency, formulation, implementation, and monitoring of fiscal policy. The effective implementation of the investment program prepared with World Bank assistance should contribute to increasing the efficiency of expenditure. Finally, the scope for enhancing revenue needs to be increased. To this end, the staff urges the authorities to formulate, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - with Fund technical assistance, a medium-term action plan for tax reform, with a view to eliminating exemptions, reducing tax-induced distortions, and strengthening tax and customs administration so as to expand the tax base, reduce fraud, and increase the elasticity of the tax system. The phased elimination of the Government's large stock of domestic arrears, is a welcomed step towards restoring Djibouti's financial integrity. The program will help restore the financial health of public enterprise and private sector and improve the quality of the banking system's portfolio. Moreover, fiscal consolidation efforts should help release bank credit resources in support of productive activities. The staff commends the authorities' reiterated commitment to the currency board arrangement, supported by the pursuit of a freely determined interest rate policy and a liberal financial system; the emphasis given to strengthening banking supervision should also contribute to ensuring the soundness of domestic financial intermediation. The authorities' continued commitment to an open exchange and payments system, along with a stable and predictable exchange rate, have been key contributing factors to the effectiveness of Djibouti's role as a regional transit and financial center. It is encouraging that the authorities acknowledge that the sustainability of these elements depends crucially on the steadfast implementation of tight demand management policies and acceleration of structural reforms, particularly those aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of the economy. The economy's response to the macroeconomic policies envisaged for stabilization will crucially depend on the acceleration of structural reforms. The authorities' decision to reform public enterprises, with emphasis on the port, is welcome. Implementation of the initial structural steps envisaged for 1996 should contribute to the growth of foreign exchange earnings. In this connection, it is of utmost importance to maintain the competitiveness of the port tariff structure and to eliminate all de facto barriers on transit trade. Progress in the liberalization of the labor market is a sine qua non for securing the needed flexibility in prices and wages to better adapt to changing economic conditions. The revision of the labor code with a view to reducing the existing cost rigidities should be expedited. Even with the full implementation of the policies envisaged in the adjustment scenario, the economy will remain fragile and Djibouti will continue to need concessional assistance from the international community especially to implement the demobilization program. To justify the needed external financial support, the authorities will need to demonstrate an unwavering commitment to carrying out their policy intentions. The severity of the imbalances, the size of the arrears and domestic debt, the scale of present structural weaknesses, and the vulnerability of Djibouti's economy to external shocks leave little room for delays in implementing policy actions, let alone slippages. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - The staff supports the authorities' emphasis on addressing the weaknesses of the macroeconomic data base and economic management. Strong cooperation from all units of the Government is required to provide timely data to help the authorities' monitoring of economic developments and policy implementation as well as to meet the reporting requirements of the Fund, especially in the context of a program. The staff urges full adherence to the recommendations set forth under the technical assistance programs currently in place and continued stress on training to ensure self- sufficiency over the medium term. The staff considers Djibouti's program a difficult one that faces many risks, but one that is feasible if rigorously implemented. Only on this condition will confidence in government policies and a solid foundation for a comprehensive medium-term program that could be the basis for an ESAF arrangement be established. The authorities' commitment to take prompt corrective action should developments deviate from the program objectives or adverse external developments modify the policy setting, is therefore welcome. Based on this commitment, on the strength of the program, and the Fund's modest share in Djibouti's debt and debt service payments, the staff considers that there is a reasonable assurance that future financial obligations to the Fund will be met in a timely manner. The staff regards the policy objectives and measures in the program as appropriate for reducing the macroeconomic imbalances and making headway for addressing Djibouti's deep-seated structural weaknesses. The staff recommends approval of Djibouti's request for a stand-by arrangement. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Djibouti be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

To support these objectives and policies the International Monetary Fund grants this stand-by arrangement. 1. For a period of 14 months from April --, 1996, Djibouti will have the right to make purchases from the Fund in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.6 million, subject to paragraph 2, 3, 4, and 5 below, without further review by the Fund. 2.

The attached Memorandum of Economic Policies contains a description of the economic and financial policies that the Government of Djibouti intends to implement during the period March 31, 1996-May 31, 1997, and those that it has started to implement since October 1995. These policies are consistent with the Government's medium-term adjustment and reform strategy, which seeks to address the deteriorating economic and financial situation of the country. The key elements of the adjustment and economic reform program for 1996-97 are: a substantial tightening of financial policies, with emphasis on budgetary adjustment and reform; continuation of full adherence to the principles of the present currency board arrangement; acceleration of structural reforms regarding demobilization of military personnel, civil service, and restructuring of public enterprises, especially the port enterprise; liberalization of the labor market; and strengthening of the social safety net. To carry out the envisaged structural reforms, the Government is seeking the technical and financial assistance of the international community. It has started discussions with the World Bank in a number of areas with priority given to the demobilization program, and has been in contact with the UNDP, EU, and bilateral donors. 2. In support of these policies, we hereby request a stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.6 million (40 percent of quota) over a fourteen- month period starting on the date of approval of the arrangement by the Fund's Executive Board. 3. Most of the prior actions to be undertaken before our request is considered by the Executive Board have already been implemented. The Government of Djibouti will inform the Managing Director of the IMF of the date of effective implementation of the remaining ones. All prior actions are listed in Annex I to the attached memorandum. Performance under the 1996-97 program will be closely monitored by the committee and technical unit created to this end by the Government. Benchmarks and performance criteria for the implementation of the structural policies (other than those that constitute prior actions) that are outlined in the memorandum are presented in Annex II. Quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks proposed for the 1996 program are described in paragraphs 23, 27, 28-30, 32, 33, 37, and 40 of the attached memorandum and Annexes IV-VI. Two reviews of the program are scheduled during the program period, the first is expected to be completed no Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIX II later than November 30, 1996 and the second is expected to be completed no later than February 28, 1997. The first review will focus on progress in: (i) achieving the budgetary objectives, including in particular the demobilization program and the implementation of an action plan for reforming the tax system; (ii) reducing the nominal wage bill, including through the completion of the final audit of the survey of all personnel and benefits covered by the budget; (iii) reducing rental payments by the Government on housing provided free of cost to its personnel; (iv) the reform of public enterprises, with particular emphasis on the port enterprise; and (v) implementing the recommendations set forth under the technical assistance programs that are already in place. The first review mission, scheduled for October 1996, will establish performance criteria for end-December 1996 and end-March 1997, consider any additional measures that might be needed to attain the objectives of the 1996 program, seek understandings on the key elements of the 1997 fiscal budget and accompanying financial :measures as well as on other economic policies for 1997, and assess the technical assistance needs that remain to be fulfilled. The second review mission scheduled for January 1997, which will be combined with the 1997 Article IV consultation, will assess, inter alia, the conformity of the voted budget with the macroeconomic objectives agreed for 1997 and progress in the demobilization program, reform of the public enterprises, revision of the lab,or code, and the improvement in the quality of economic statistics. 4. In support of its adjustment effort and to help achieve its targets for economic growth, inflation, and balance of payments, the Government of Djibouti is also seeking the support of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to enable it to mobilize the needed financial assistance. 5. The Government of Djibouti believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may prove necessary for this purpose. During the period of the arrangement, the Government: will consult with the Managing Director of the IMF, either at its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director requests such consultations, on the adoption of any additional measures that may be appropriate in accordance with the Fund's policies on such consultations. The Government of Djibouti will provide the IMF with such information as it may request in connection with monitoring the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and in achieving the objectives of the program.

Introduction 1. Djibouti's economic and financial situation has suffered a continuous deterioration during the last several years, in the context of a weak institutional structure, limited natural resources, and basic social indicators that are below the averages for Sub-Saharan Africa. Economic performance has been characterized by negative per capita income growth, mounting domestic payments arrears, and a decline in reserves. Major contributing factors have been the outbreak of an armed domestic conflict in mid-1991, which has now ended, and the unstable regional situation. The military buildup led to massive increases in the wage bill and other defense outlays, which outpaced the growth in government revenue and weakened the Government's financial position. In addition, regional developments resulted on the one hand, in a large influx of refugees estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000 (relative to the country's population of about 520,000) that continue to pose a burden on already scarce resources and on the other hand, in a temporary loss of the markets in neighboring countries. These factors have contributed to an aggravation of the economic and social situation of the country. 2. Although the Government adopted a number of corrective fiscal measures in the budgets for 1993-95, the reduction in the budgetary deficits proved insufficient to address the fiscal situation. The structure of the budget remained heavily influenced by defense-related expenditures which contributed to the large weight of personnel costs, amounting to 80 percent of total revenue in 1994. In the face of lower external grants and the commitment of the Government to refrain from borrowing from the central bank (Banque Nationale de Djibouti (BND)), under the present currency board system, the budgetary deficits were financed to a large extent by an accumulation of domestic arrears and increased forced transfers to the budget from public enterprises, and to a lesser extent, by borrowing from local commercial banks. These actions have adversely affected the financial activities of traditionally profitable public enterprises. In addition, the continued accumulation of arrears to private enterprises by the Government has weakened their financial situation and ability to pay taxes, repay loans to commercial banks and invest, thus depressing the overall level of economic activity and eroding the tax base. Furthermore, the Government as well as some public enterprises have recently been unable to meet on time their external debt service obligations. At the same time, cost rigidities have prevented Djibouti from reacting rapidly enough to keep its edge in the provision of commercial and transit services in the region. The deterioration of Djibouti's economic situation has affected private sector confidence, a development which is not favorable to the maintenance of an external regime characterized by a restriction-free exchange system, full Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT capital mobility, and a fixed peg of the Djibouti franc (DF) to the U.S. dollar. These constitute the three key factors underlying the effectiveness of Djibouti as a regional transit and financial center. 3. Djibouti's economy also faces a number of structural problems that are reflected in the country's limited supply responsiveness and employment generation potential. The regulatory framework governing the activities of the private sector is complex and requires more transparency for better implementation. The labor code, dating from the French colonial period, limits entrepreneurs' discretion in hiring and firing decisions. Public enterprises' capital is not open to private sector participation, some hold monopoly positions, and their competitiveness has been adversely affected by high operating costs, particularly in personnel. Basic social indicators point to the need of human capital development and emphasis on social sector expenditure. 4. Weaknesses in Djibouti's statistical base and the difficulties in the collection, coordination, and dissemination of economic data hamper economic analysis and policy formulation and implementation, and prevent the regular monitoring of the functioning and evolution of the national economy. II. Background and Recent Economic Developmen& 5. The economic and financial situation continued to deteriorate in 1994 and in 1995. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices is estimated (by International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff) to have declined by 2.9 percent in 1994 and by more than 3 percent in 1995. The decline in economic activity in the sectors of electricity and water and the concurrent adverse consequences for the manufacturing and construction sectors have been compounded by a further slowdown of port activity due to competition from the neighboring ports of Assab and Berbera in 1995. The continued accumulation of government's arrears vis-A-vis public and private enterprises has contributed to weaken economic activity, thereby, aggravating the unemployment problem. 6. Price movements in Djibouti are primarily determined by 'variations in the prices of imported goods. Annual inflation, as measured 'by the price index for French expatriates, rose to 6.5 percent in 1994, due mainly to sharp increases in the domestic prices of petroleum products, but indications are that it declined in 1995 as prices in services, transport, tourism, and utilities stabilized. 7. The public finance situation remained weak, although the consolidated fiscal deficit (on a payment-order basis and excluding grants) was reduced from 21.8 percent of GDP in 1993 to 13.4 percent in 1994. This reduction was due mainly to a drop in expenditure, which was reinforced by a revenue increase mainly on account of receipts from indirect taxes. However, in the face of a significant reduction in external grants and loans, the Government had to continue to draw down its deposits with commercial banks and to resort increasingly to contributions from public enterprises to finance the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT deficit. Despite the high level of financing from these sources, domestic arrears continued to build up and small external payment arrears emerged, bringing the stock of domestic arrears to the equivalent of 5 percent of GDP at end-1994 and that of domestic debt to the equivalent of 17.4 percent of GDP. During the period January-September 1995, payment arrears, notably on salaries, continued to accumulate, as external grants and borrowing declined further, and borrowing from public enterprises became more difficult to obtain. 8. In response to this situation, the Government adopted a number of measures incorporated in an amended budget for 1995, which was approved in October 1995. The implementation of these and other supporting measures (Annex III) contributed to a reduction in the consolidated fiscal deficit from 13.4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 11.7 percent in 1995 and to limit the pace of accumulation of domestic arrears during the last months of the year. As a result, the stock of arrears as of end-1995 was contained to the equivalent of 12.7 percent of GDP. 1/ The consolidated deficit, on a cash basis and including grants, declined from 6.2 percent of percent of GDP (or DF 5.3 billion) to 3.4 percent (DF 3.0 billion) during the same period. 9. On the revenue side, the measures yielded during the last three months of 1995, about 0.8 percent of GDP (DF 700 million), with total revenue reaching 28.4 percent of GDP. These measures included: (i) an increase in the reference base for excise taxation on khat from DF 450 per kilogram to DF 550 (yield: DF 34 million); (ii) an increase in the patriotic contribution rate from 10 percent to 15 percent; this applies to all wages, salaries, and related benefits earned from Djibouti sources of income above DF 60,000 (yield: DF 234 million); (iii) payment by civil servants and employees of state enterprises benefitting from free housing of 20 percent of the market rental value (yield: DF 64 million); and (iv) exceptional contributions of DF 374 million from STID (a telecommunication company) as dividends to the State. 10. On the expenditure side, the measures are estimated to have generated savings equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP during the last three months of the year: (i) personnel costs are estimated to have been reduced by DF 380 million (0.4 percent of GDP), by cutting 60 percent of the benefits paid to civil servants, police, and military personnel; and (ii) outlays on material, supplies, and other non-interest goods and services that had not been committed during the period January-September 1995 were curtailed by DF 988 million (1.1 percent of GDP). However, the savings arising from the latter measure became almost negligible (0.1 percent of GDP); a review of outlays on materials and supplies recorded during the period revealed that u Consisting of 3.4 percent of GDP or DF 3.0 billion in salaries, 4.4 percent of GDP or DF 3.8 billion in goods and services, and 4.7 percent of GDP or DF 4.3 billion in foreign liabilities, of which 0.2 percent of GDP or DF 193 million in external debt service payments. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT they did not include a number of commitments, which the Government proceeded to regularize during the last three months of the year, so that commitments in 1996 could cover the minimum expenditure requirements of the Administration and be recorded on a regular basis. 11. The Government's borrowing from commercial banks, combined with an expansion of credit to the private sector, contributed to an increase in net domestic assets in 1994 and 1995, which exceeded broad money expansion leading to a decline in net foreign assets. The share of foreign currency deposits rose from 44 percent in 1994 to 49 percent at end-1995, reflecting in part an increased preference for bons de caisse, an instrument aimed at attracting short-term time deposits, which is denominated in U.S. dollars and is anonymous. Interest rates have continued to be market-determined; while interest rates on one-month deposits remained at about 3 percent, lending interest rates slightly increased from 12.5-16 percent in 1993 to 12-18 percent at end-1995. This development reflected in part the cautious approach to lending that might be due to the emergence, in recent years, of significant non-performing bank loans. More recently, however, despite some delays in loan repayment from enterprises, the financial position of the commercial banks has improved, following the strengthening of the enforcement of prudential banking regulations and the provisioning for bad debts. 12. The external position deteriorated notwithstanding a reduction in the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) in 1994 (from 25 percent of GDP in 1993 to 21.2 percent) and in 1995 (17.9 percent). The deficit reduction was primarily the result of a decline in imports of goods and services, largely attributable to a contraction in the public investment program (PIP), which more than offset the lower level of re- exports and receipts from port services on account of the redirection of trade toward ports in neighboring countries. While in 1994, the decline in long-term capital inflows, arising from the contraction in the PIP, was exceeded by higher short-term capital inflows, in 1995, it was reinforced by short-term capital outflows. Consequently, the overall balance of payments, which had registered a modest surplus in 1994 (US$l million), deteriorated in 1995 and gross international reserves fell by about US$7 million, to about US$71 million or the equivalent of 4.8 months of imports. Following an increase of about US$3 million in 1994, external arrears declined by over US$l million in 1995. Djibouti's external debt and debt service indicators have remained relatively low, reflecting the prevalence of concessional financing at an average interest rate of only 1 percent. Total external debt outstanding rose from 52.8 percent of GDP in 1993 to 57 percent in 1994 but declined to 54 percent in 1995. Debt service payments are estimated at 6.1 percent of locally produced exports and non-factor services in 1994 and at 7.4 percent in 1995. In 1995, the Saudi Arabian Government forgave debt in an amount equivalent to USS18.4 million.

The Government's Medium-term Adjustment and Reform Strategy and the Program for 1996-97 13. The country's economic problems and deep-seated structural rigidities require far-reaching reforms over the medium term. The urgency of the situation calls for major actions starting immediately. Accordingly, the major objectives and policies of the economic and financial program for 1996-97 are cast in a medium-term macroeconomic policy framework. The latter seeks to address the imperative need to return to a more stable macroeconomic environment in a difficult situation characterized by growing regional port competition, population pressures, high unemployment, and weak social indicators, as well as uncertainties regarding prospective external assistance. For these reasons, the Government's medium-term strategy for economic adjustment and reform emphasizes a substantial financial policy tightening with emphasis on budgetary adjustment and reform, which is supported by strong structural reforms aimed at improving the country's supply responsiveness, employment generation potential, and social conditions. 14. The Government is determined to implement in full the adjustment and economic reform policies described in this memorandum. However, this determination and the propitious conditions for implementing such policies, which have been occasioned by the termination of the domestic armed conflict in December 1994, can only succeed if they are supported by additional concessional external assistance, in particular to help finance the demobilization program. In addition, technical assistance, including logistics support, to address weaknesses in the macroeconomic database and administrative capacity is also an important ingredient to ensure the successful implementation of the Government's program. 15. The medium-term adjustment strategy seeks: (i) a recovery in real GDP growth to an average annual rate of 3 percent per year during 1997-99, after a stabilization in 1996; (ii) a reduction of the inflation rate to about 3 percent on average during 1996-99; (iii) a gradual decline in the external current account deficit (excluding official grants) from 17.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 12.6 percent by 1999; and (iv) an improvement in the gross official reserves position from the equivalent of 4.8 months of imports in 1995 to 5.7 months by 1999. A phased reduction of the Government's personnel costs and stock of domestic debt and arrears, on the basis of a well defined timetable, is also an important medium-term goal. The recovery in economic activity is predicated on the resumption of investment activities by the traditionally profitable public enterprises, once the preemption of their resources through deposit transfers and arrears has ceased. Moreover, private sector activities should see a recovery, as a result of the planned improvements in the transport system and a resumption of financial intermediation. Total investment is projected to gradually recover from an estimated 12 percent of GDP in 1995 to over 14 percent of GDP by 1999. This recovery is expected to be initially brought about mainly by the public enterprise sector and reinforced over the medium term by the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT private sector. Gross national savings are expected to rise from 4 percent of GDP in 1995 to about 9 percent of GDP by 1999, resulting primarily from the improvement in the public finance situation. 16. To reach the medium-term macroeconomic objectives, the consolidated fiscal deficit (excluding grants) will need to decline from 13.4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1.1 percent by 1999. Fiscal adjustment will rely primarily on a significant reduction and restructuring of budgetary expenditures, given the already relatively high tax revenue to GDP ratio and the burden of wage and military outlays. In 1994, personnel expenditure accounted for 24 percent of GDP and 80 percent of budgetary revenue; defense and security- related expenditure accounted for almost 14 percent of GDP and 31 percent of expenditure and the personnel cost component absorbed 53 percent of the wage bill. The stock of government arrears and domestic debt will be eliminated through a combination of cash settlement, rescheduling and compensation of cross-debts. As regards monetary policy, the Government will continue to adhere fully to the principles governing the present currency board arrangement. On the external front, the Government will continue to pursue a prudent external debt policy by refraining from contracting or guaranteeing non-concessional external borrowing, and will continue to maintain an exchange and trade regime free of restrictions on current and capital transactions. Structural policies will focus on the demobilization of military personnel, reform of the civil service, restructuring of public enterprises, with emphasis on the port enterprise, liberalization of the labor market, and strengthening of the social safety net to protect the most vulnerable sectors of the population, as detailed in paragraphs 24 and 38-42. IV. The Proaram for 1996 Economic nolicies for 1996 17. Consistent with the medium-term strategy, the Government has decided to strengthen fiscal adjustment through a package of measures (see paragraph 20 and 21) agreed as part of the economic and reform program for 1996. 18. The program seeks to stabilize real GDP in 1996, after an estimated decline of 3.1 percent in 1995, and reduce the external current account deficit (excluding official grants) from 17.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 15.4 percent of GDP in 1996. Gross international reserves are targeted to increase from the equivalent of 4.8 months of imports in 1995 to 5.2 months in 1996. To achieve these objectives, the program calls for a reduction in the consolidated deficit of the Government's financial operations (on a payment-order basis and excluding foreign grants) from 11.7 percent of GDP in 1995 to 6.1 percent in 1996. Taking into account an increase in arrears of 2.8 percent of GDP in 1995 and their programmed reduction of about 6 percent of GDP in 1996 (paragraph 27), the consolidated deficit, on a cash basis and-excluding grants, is projected to increase from 8.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 12.2 percent of GDP in 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT Fiscal nolicv and reform 19. The program for 1996 aims at rapidly arresting the increasing fiscal imbalances and restoring the conditions for a sustainable fiscal stance in the medium term, while reducing the Government's preemption of financial resources to avoid an increased crowding out of the private sector. This policy will contribute to a reduction of inflationary pressures and the preservation of the integrity of the currency board. To this end, the Government adopted in the 1996 budget a package of revenue and expenditure measures with emphasis on reducing current outlays, particularly the wage bill. Decisions regarding the latter have been based on more reliable information obtained from the survey of government employment and wages. y 20. On the expenditure side, the measures are expected to generate net savings of 4.9 percent of GDP, which will reduce expenditures to 35.3 percent of GDP in 1996. The savings measures are: (i) a reduction in the wage bill after taking into account the repeal of the 60 percent reduction in benefits decreed in October 1995 (estimated savings: 4.5 percent of GDP); (ii) a reduction in expenditure on materials and supplies by limiting water and electricity consumption through strengthened controls, and reducing by half all housing rental payments undertaken by the Government (estimated savings: 0.4 percent of GDP); and (iii) a reduction in maintenance and transfers (estimated savings: 0.8 percent of GDP). The cutback in the wage bill is expected to result from: (i) the elimination of irregularities detected through the survey; (ii) the effective reduction in the wage bill by withholding 10 percent on all salaries, wages, and related benefits exceeding DF 60,000; and (iii) the cutback of benefits and salaries of embassy personnel as well as the elimination of overtime work. However, the savings from the above measures equivalent to 5.7 percent of GDP are to be partially offset by the addition of 150 budgetary positions for teachers and 40 for nurses on account of the Government's priority assigned to health and education (0.2 percent of GDP), and increases in other current expenditure (0.1 percent of GDP), and in investment (0.5 percent of GDP). 21. On the revenue side, the combined impact of revenue-enhancing and revenue-losing measures is a net gain of 0.7 percent of 1996 GDP, raising revenue to 29.1 percent of GDP. The revenue-enhancing measures would yield 2.5 percent of GDP, arising mainly from: (i) an enlargement of the profit tax base by lowering the threshold of taxation (estimated yield: DF 246 million); (ii) an increase in the tax rate on wages and salaries exceeding DF 25,000; at the same time, the tax base has been expanded to include all wage-related benefits (estimated yield: DF 316 million); (iii) an increase in the reference base for excise taxation of khat from DF 550 per kilogram to DF 750 starting on January 1, 1996 (estimated yield: DF 411 million); (iv) the replacement of the 70 percent surcharge on the c.i.f. value of u In e^arly October 1995, a survey was undertaken of the number of the personnel, including military and security personnel as well as their wages, salaries, and benefits.

The revenue gain is expected to be offset by a revenue loss of 1.8 percent of GDP, resulting from: (i) the reduction in the patriotic contribution rate from 15 percent to 10 percent, the level prevailing before October 1995 ( estimated loss DF 1,130 million). This rate applies to all wage earners, u but for government employees, it is replaced by an equivalent withholding, which effectively reduces the nominal wage bill; and (ii) a reduction in the consumption tax on milk, wheat flour, and butane (estimated loss: DF 241 million). The programmed revenue does not take into account the additional efforts that will be siolultaneously undertaken to collect tax arrears and to better monitor and control the declared customs value of trade, through the services of a pre-shipment inspection company that the authorities intend to hire by April 1, 996. 22. Since the wage bill weighs heavily in the budget and has rapidly increased in the last few years, the Government has made the difficult and courageous decision to make its reduction a priority, as this is central to bring the public finances on to a more sustainable basis. 23. In order to ensure a permanent reduction in the wage bill in such a way as to minimize the expected social impact, the Government launched a survey in October 1995 to determine the number of all personnel covered by the budget, with a view to separating those employees that do not correspond to the budgetary positions and assessing the extent of the cash allowances illegally granted. The accuracy of the preliminary results of the survey has been reviewed and certified by the personnel department of each ministry, pending the completion of the ongoing audit by the Ministry of Finance, scheduled for end-September 1996. u At the same time, this audit will be supplemented by a separate control to be undertaken by the Treasury at the time of salary payments, no later than May 31, 1996. The irregularities will be penalized, consistent with a circular from the President sent to ministries on November 30, 1995. The final results of the survey will be evaluated during the review of the program; preliminary results suggest that savings on personnel of at least 0.5 percent of GDP could be generated, without reducing the benefits, wages, or the number of employees. The cumulative quarterly 1/ As regards public enterprise employees, the patriotic contribution is replaced by a salary withholding of 10 percent, which is to be transferred to the budget. u The audits of the Ministries of Health and Education were completed in January 1996, those of the Ministries of Defense and Interior are scheduled for completion by July 31, 1996 to be followed by the remaining ministries by end-September 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 51 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT ceilings on the wage bill (DF 17.5 billion for the year as a whole) will constitute performance criteria under the program. To observe these, the Government will stabilize the total personnel level at 10,032 persons during 1996, excluding those to be demobilized; within this limit, the number of personnel in education and health sectors has been discussed with the World Bank in the context of its public expenditure review. 24. To ensure that the reduction in the wage bill stipulated in the 1996 budget is sustainable over the medium term, it must be accompanied on the one hand, by a civil service reform, which will include a review of the wage policy of the public sector, and on the other, by the demobilization of 9,086 defense and security personnel. The demobilization is expected to be completed over an 18-month period (June 1996-December 1997), at a cost consisting of severance pay only, tentatively estimated at a minimum of DF 2.2 billion (or 2.4 percent of 1996 GDP). As a result, the consolidated fiscal deficit, excluding grants, would increase by 1.0 percent of GDP in 1996 and 1.2 percent in 1997. From 1998 onward, the consolidated deficit as currently projected would be reduced by about 1.8 percent of GDP on account of savings related to salaries, resulting from the implementation of the demobilization program. In view of the limited financial resources of the country, the Government is examining, with World Bank assistance, the implementation of such a program and the possibility of setting up a fund to finance its cost. The pace of demobilization will depend on the availability of foreign financing. 25. To promote equity in the adjustment process, in 1996 the Government will reduce by half the outlays representing rental payments to provide free housing to government officials, with a view to eliminating them upon completion of the construction of social housing scheduled for March 1997. The census of free housing allowances provided to the Armed Forces will be completed before end-March 1996 in order to implement saving measures. 26. The census of employees legally entitled to other housing rentals paid by the Government was completed on January 5, 1996; this will allow the Government to determine the extent of the savings to be generated and evaluate their impact. The progress achieved in reducing by half the rental payments in 1996, which constitutes a crucial element for the observation of the DF 4.2 billion limit on outlays on materials, will be examined during the review mission. In addition, the eventual compensation for the elimination of the rental allowance must be lower than the savings generated by the latter measure and should not affect the ceiling on the wage bill fixed for 1996. 27. To restore as soon as possible normal relations with domestic and external creditors, the Government intends to reduce arrears by at least DF 5.5 billion in 1996 (6.1 percent of GDP), despite the existing financial constraints, through cash settlement: or debt relief. During the second half of 1996, the Government will clear, as a matter of priority, its arrears on external debt service payments, then those on salaries with priority given to those incurred in 1995 followed by those incurred in preceding years. Arrears on goods and services will be reduced next by compensation, subject Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT to prior verification, as part of the phased reduction in the stock of government gross arrears toward suppliers. The completion of an inventory of cross-debts and settlement by compensation of cross-debts between the State and public enterprises will take place at the end of April 1996, as a step toward the resolution of the cross-debt situation. On the same date, an action plan for the settlement of the remaining debts to all suppliers, including public enterprises, will be established. These actions, together with the reduction in domestic and external arrears, as well as the non- accumulation of new arrears, will be performance criteria unlder the program (see paragraph 37 and Annex V). In the event total net external financing (as defined in Annex IV) exceeds the levels assumed under the program, the excess will be used to reduce arrears on goods and services, including external non-debt arrears, in amounts that will be agreed with the staff of the IMF (see paragraph 28). 28. The Government will not resort to borrowing from the central bank (except for a credit in an amount equivalent to the counterpart in Djibouti francs of purchases from the IMF, which will be expressed in SDRs to prevent the central bank from assuming the exchange risk) or from commercial banks; this will constitute a performance criterion under the program. The program in 1996 assumes a total net external financing of DF 11.3 billion (about US$64 million) as defined in Annex IV. The Government will continue to reduce its debt to public enterprises. Given the expected level of net external borrowing and the expected use of the local currency counterpart of the purchases from the IMF, a financing gap equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP in 1996 will remain; this gap is expected to be filled mainly by highly concessional external financial assistance, including debt relief, from the EU, France, and other bilateral donors. This gap does not take into account the cost of the demobilization program. The ceilings on the financing of the consolidated fiscal deficit in 1996 will be performance criteria under the program. Any excess in total net external financing (consisting of budgetary and net external project financing as defined in Annex IV) over the levels assumed under the program, will entail a revision of the ceilings on the financing of the consolidated fiscal deficit and on the stock of domestic arrears, after consultation with the IMF staff on the use of the excess amount (including for reducing arrears and government debt over and above the targets set in Annex V; see paragraph 27). 29. Any shortfalls in total net external financing below the levels assumed under the program, will reduce the ceilings on the financing of the consolidated fiscal deficit by the same amounts. 30. Any shortfalls in net external budgetary financing up to the limits defined in Annex V, will reduce the payments of arrears on the wage bill by the same amounts; any shortfalls in excess of those limits will entail an offsetting adjustment of revenue or expenditure to compensate for the difference. 31. To strengthen fiscal consolidation, the Government attaches the highest priority to expenditure control through the strict observance of existing regulations and procedures. In this respect, a number of crucial measures Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX II ATTACHMENT have been adopted: (i) expenditure may not be committed outside the normal process of expenditure control; this will apply to all levels of the Government; (ii) the Minister of Finance has been appointed as the sole comptroller of civilian and military expenditure to strengthen expenditure control through the availability of more comprehensive information, previously dispersed by the existence of one comptroller for each category of expenditure; (iii) the strict observance of the deadlines under existing regulations for wage payments has been reestablished to end the practice of long delays in sending the required supporting documentation to the Treasury and, thereby, avoid the emergence of new wage arrears; non-observance of the deadlines will be penalized; and (iv) an action plan for the public investment program (PIP) has been established so as to increase the efficiency of investment projects through improved appraisal, implementation, and monitoring (Annex III). Consistent with the action plan, the annual tranche of the PIP has been integrated into the 1996 budget, to permit a more comprehensive assessment of all the financial operations of the Government. Also, as agreements on external loans and grants for financing the PIP require the signature of the minister of Finance, improved monitoring and control of investment and its financing should be secured, as well as improved debt management through the establishment at the Ministry of Finance of a more comprehensive data base. Furthermore, the following measures will be implemented starting with the 1996 budget. First, embassies spending on salaries and supplies will be paid in Djibouti francs, Second, observance of the deadlines for remittance of expenditure commitments by embassies and government offices in regions near the borders (districts) will be strictly enforced. Third, measures to reduce expenditure will be applied uniformly to all personnel. 32. To ensure a more flexible conduct of fiscal policy, strengthened expenditure control must be complemented by a tax reform aimed at rendering the tax system more elastic, efficient, and equitable. The Government has requested technical assistance for reforming the tax system, from the IMF, and for strengthening customs administration, from France. Agreement on a plan of action for tax reform by end-June 1996 is a performance criterion. The above efforts will be accompanied by a restructuring of the Ministry of Finance, so that it can more adequately respond to the need for a more efficient management of the public finances and the economy. To this end, the Government has requested technical assistance from France, which it also expects to receive during 1996. Monetarv nolicy 33. The Government has maintained the integrity of the currency board since its inception in 1949, and remains committed to full adherence to the present principles governing the board arrangement. The Government acknowledges that the successful maintenance of the present currency board arrangement is contingent upon restoring strict fiscal discipline. To this end, the Government will, as noted above, continue to refrain from borrowing from the central bank (except as indicated in paragraph 28), as well as from commercial banks and ensure that its schedule of loan repayments is strictly observed. The Government will continue their policy of allowing interest Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX II ATTACHMENT rates on both deposits and loans to be market-determined. The Government will continue to ensure that liquid international reserves exceed the required 100 percent coverage of currency issue and other currency board liabilities, by retaining part of the profits earned on foreign exchange reserves. The floor on the net international reserves defined in Annex VI will constitute a performance criterion under the program. 34. The Government is cognizant that a sound and dynamic banking system is of key importance to avoid jeopardizing the authorities' resolve to adhere to the currency board and to maintain Djibouti's attractiveness as a regional commercial and financial center. To this end, the central Bank will ensure strict enforcement of existing prudential regulations and provisions for problem loans, will start on-site inspections of commercial banks in the second quarter of 1996, and will further strengthen its supervisory capabilities (see Appendix II) through personnel training and technical assistance from the Fund. In addition, the Government will undertake all the necessary measures to expedite the judicial process for bank recovery of non-performing bank loans. The coverage of commercial banks' deposits by net foreign assets plus reserves voluntarily held has not fallen below 45 percent for each bank in the last four years. In addition, banks have well established credit lines available from their headquarters. Accordingly, the central bank does not see the need to set legal reserve requirements for commercial banks. However, it will continue to monitor the situation of commercial banks, and if necessary, it will use its authority as provided for in an existing agreement, to ask for additional cash contributions from them. External sector nolicies 35. The Government acknowledges that the reduction in the fiscal imbalances sought by the program to lessen aggregate demand pressures must be accompanied by steps to deal with cost rigidities and structural reforms, if the current peg to the U.S. dollar is to be maintained. In this context, the Government has decided to undertake a number of actions to preserve Djibouti's competitiveness as a regional commercial and transit center. The port of Djibouti, which is the backbone of economic activity in the country, has recently experienced a weakening performance with the emergence of the port Assab in Eritrea as an important competitor. At the same time, the recent privatization of state-owned enterprises and the abolition of restrictions on private entrepreneurship in Ethiopia have reopened opportunities for the port of Djibouti to recuperate the role that it played as a regional transport center in the early 1970's. To this end, the Government has decided, on the basis of the conclusions of a recently completed study on comparative costs with neighboring ports, to simplify and lower tariffs for port services starting in January 1996 and establish promotional tariffs for ships that carry transit cargo for Ethiopia. In addition, efforts have been undertaken to simplify administrative procedures for road transport of goods from Djibouti to Addis Ababa, including a substantial reduction of customs controls for goods in transit to Ethiopia. In this connection, the implementation of the expected agreement from Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT negotiations through the Ethiopia-Djibouti Commission should lead to an improvement in the network of regional transportation services, including modemizing and increasing the capacity of the railway to make it a cost- effective means of transport to Ethiopia. 36. The program for 1996 seeks to improve Djibouti's position as a competitive trade and financial center. Adherence by the Government to the above-mentioned policies should contribute to strengthening the balance of payments position over the medium term. On this basis, the external current account deficit, excluding official grants, is projected to decline to 15.3 percent in 1996 and further to 12.6 percent by 1999. These projections are predicated mainly on a steady strengthening in the activities of the transport sectors, owing to the restructuring of the port enterprise and the implementation of the regionally-based action plan, aimed at improving the efficiency and promoting the viability of the transport sector. This plan has been communicated to the World Bank in February 1996 for comments and formulation of recommendations. The recovery of these activities is expected to be reinforced by increased receipts from telecommunications and banking services. Given already committed loans and amortization payments, decreasing financing gaps are expected to emerge in the order of US$34 million in 1996, US$ll million in 1997, and US$6 million in 1998. me gap for 1996 is expected to be filled through the expected use of IMF credit (USS5.7 million) and through highly concessional external financial assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors, including the rescheduling of non-debt external overdue obligations (about US$19 million). For the subsequent years, the Government intends to request additional financial support from the IMF and, with the cooperation of the Bretton Woods institutions, seek renewed assistance from a number of donors and multilateral lenders. 37. The Government will continue to pursue a prudent external debt management policy. It will also settle, during the second quarter of 1996, the small external payment arrears vis-a-vis bilateral creditors that re- emerged in 1995 owing to a lack of domestic resources. During the program period, the Government will not: (i) accumulate new external payments arrears; and (ii) contract or guarantee any new non-concessional borrowing. These two commitments will be treated as performance criteria under the program. However, the Government may incur short-term trade credits. In order to improve the management of the public external debt, further to the requirement of the signature of the Minister of Finance on all loan and grant contracts of the public sector, the Government has recently adopted the following measures: (i) strengthening of the unit at the Ministry of Finance in charge of managing the debts of the Government and Public Enterprises, as well as of the mobilization of the external resources, and establishment of a unit to monitor the financial operations of public enterprises; (ii) strengthening of the Planning Department for the evaluation and monitoring of public investment projects; (iii) issuance of a decree requiring that all disbursements related to foreign loans and grants be authorized (for issuing payment order) by the Minister of Finance, on the advice of the Minister of Planning; and (iv) submission by the external debt management unit to the Minister of Finance of the payment schedule on Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT interest and amortization of government debt, prior to their maturity, for their payment authorization. As regards the exchange and external payments system, the Government will not: (i) impose new or intensify existing restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions; (ii) introduce or modify multiple currency practices; (iii) impose new or intensify existing import restrictions for balance of payments purposes; and (iv) enter into new bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII. These commitments will constitute performance criteria throughout the program period. Structural nolicies 38. The Government has communicated to the World Bank in early December 1995 a draft program of demobilization of military and security personnel for which the cost (severance pay) has already been established. Before submitting the program in its final form to donors in June 19'96, the Government intends to undertake all the necessary administrative actions with assistance from the World Bank (see paragraph 24). With1 the return of peace conditions, the maintenance of such personnel at the current levels is no longer justified and is unsustainable from a budgetary standpoint. However, at this juncture, such a demobilization is rendered difficult by the lack of employment opportunities in the economy, the low level of education of the soldiers to be dismissed, and the shortage of funds to encourage their voluntary departure. 39. Currently, the high cost of labor and rigid labor regulations reduce the competitiveness of the economy and its capacity to absorb additional labor. Some companies with plethoric labor force encounter difficulties to downsize it, and others are discouraged from hiring on account of problems due to administrative regulations. The Government recognizes that in the context of Djibouti's fixed exchange rate regime, it is essential that prices and wages respond quickly to external and domestic shocks to preserve economic competitiveness. To this end, the Government has decided to liberalize the labor market by revising, with the assistance of France, the current labor code. 40. The public enterprises have played an important role in the economic development of Djibouti. Several of them such as the port, the airport, the electricity company, the water office, and the telecommunication companies have been the engines of growth of Djibouti. These companies bad been largely profitable for most of their operations and still have the potential for sustained future profits. However, in recent years they have been compelled to finance the budget in direct and indirect ways, with the result that their ability to pursue the required investment projects and meet on time their external debt service payments has been adversely affected. These difficulties are endangering the long-term growth prospects of the economy. To correct this situation, the Government has requested World Bank assistance to develop, by end-September 1996, an action plan for the reform of key public enterprises. Special importance is attached to restructuring the port, which together with the envisaged labor market reform is expected to contribute to increase its competitiveness. The unit charged with Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - APPENDIX II ATTACHMENT monitoring the financial operations of public enterprises--which has been established in the Ministry of Finance-- will undertake the financial diagnosis of the largest enterprises prior to the Bank's mission scheduled for end-September 1996, and will contribute to an orderly implementation of the reform plan. The latter envisages the following actions: (i) all public enterprises will be subject to normal commercial law as of May 31, 1996; (ii) the law on privatization will be revised, to facilitate opening the capital of public enterprises to the private sector; and (iii) an inventory of cross-debts between public enterprises and the State will be completed by end-April 1996, when settlement by compensation will take place (see paragraph 27 and Annex V) and an action plan established to regularize the remaining debts; and (iv) three enterprises are scheduled for complete divestiture by end-March 1996 and another by end-November 1996 (see Annex II). 41. The Government acknowledges that its program of fiscal consolidation and structural reform will in the short-run increase the need for social safety net provisions to protect the most vulnerable sectors of the population. In this regard, the Government has reduced the taxation on the consumption of a number of basic products (paragraph 21); will continue to attach priority to expenditure in social services; and will conduct an evaluation of poverty in 1996, in coordination with the World Bank, to identify the most vulnerable sectors of the population and their needs in order to assess the adequacy of the delivery system and to improve the targeting of humanitarian aid. 42. To correct the weaknesses in the statistical data base, the authorities will attempt to update it as soon as possible in cooperation with the IMF, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the World Bank, the UNDP, and other donors. In this respect, technical assistance has already been requested from the AfDB and France in the areas of national income and prices, respectively, Ongoing efforts are giving priority to improve the timeliness and comprehensiveness of fiscal and balance of payments data--particularly the integration of foreign grants and loans and the corresponding investment, and the recording of imports --so as to provide a firmer basis for the conduct of public finance and external sector policies. In addition, as noted earlier, the authorities have requested technical assistance from the IMF to reform the tax system and from France to strengthen public expenditure control, customs administration, and the monitoring of budget execution V. Prior Actions. Performance Criteria. and Program Review 43. The Government of Djibouti will, before the IMF's Executive Board meets on Djibouti's request for a stand-by arrangement, undertake the prior actions specified in Annex I that remain to be implemented. Progress under the program will be assessed, based on a number of structural benchmarks (Annex II)' and performance criteria for end-June and end-September 1996 (Annexes IV-VI).

The Bank Group's assistance strategy has focused on development and maintenance of essential infrastructure needed to maintain Djibouti's external competitiveness as a regional service center, in addition to human resource development and poverty alleviation. Eight IDA credits have been approved for a total of USS51.6 million, of which USS5.7 million remain undisbursed. The approved credits were: Technical Assistance (1984); Urban Development (1984); Education (1985); Geothermal Development (1989); Manpower Training (1989); and Second Urban Development 1991). In terms of charges, 53 percent of the total approved amount has been allocated to human resources and urban development, 30 percent to geothermal energy, and 17 percent to road maintenance and technical assistance. With the exception of the Technical Assistance and Geothermal Development credits, project implementation has been satisfactory. The Technical Assistance project, the first IDA operation in Djibouti, did not meet its objectives due to weak Government commitment and lack of clear benchmarks for institutional capacity improvement. The Geothermal Development project, designed to meet a supply need resulting from the retirement of old diesel plants, experienced start-up difficulties. The one ongoing project, Second Urban Development, is being implemented satisfactorily. IDA has been engaged in a dialogue with the Government in the areas of structural reforms: public enterprise and public administration, armed forces demobilization, and public expenditure allocation. In addition, preliminary work is underway on a poverty assessment for Djibouti and support to the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) process. Assuming continued implementation of economic reforms, IDA activity in Djibouti could be expected to expand, with the areas of emphasis being improved economic management, and poverty alleviation through social sector investments in health, education, and the establishment of a social sector fund.

Outstanding statistical issues Economic statistics in Djibouti are compiled by a number of different institutions in an uncoordinated way and data reconciliation among these sources is limited. The quality and timeliness of the data remain poor. Some important series are not compiled while others lack comprehensive coverage or are subject to long lags. Table 1 surveys the reporting of statistical information on basic indicators for surveillance. To improve the quality of core data for continuous surveillance, the authorities are currently starting the preparatory work for estimating the national accounts with the assistance of the African Development Bank. Increased efforts are required to ensure the timely availability of fiscal data. The Statistical Office publishes information on external trade and other economic indicators, albeit with a one-year lag. The Central Bank has recently started to publish timely data on monetary developments. a. Real sector Djibouti currently does not compile statistics on real sector. Data on GDP and deflators are estimated independently by the World Bank and Fund staff. The consumer price index only covers the consumption of the expatriate community and is compiled by the French statistical service (INSEE). b. Government finance Fiscal data in general are not available on a timely basis. Expenditure on wages and salaries is not clearly separated from expenditure on goods and services. Although the 1996 budget includes for the first time foreign-financed capital expenditure, such expenditure is not systematically recorded in general. The latest data published in the 1990 GFSY are for 1988. A GFS technical assistance mission in 1988 discussed the resumption of reporting to STA but no further data have yet been received. Staff estimates contained in Fund reports are based on information gathered from a number of sources in Djibouti, C. Monetary accounts In general, the quality and timeliness of monetary statistics are good. The National Bank of Djibouti (NBD) maintains a computerized system for compiling monetary statistics. The NBD is making efforts to reconcile monetary and balance of payments data. Commercial banks do not provide information on the residency of holders of foreign exchange deposits. The NBD has started to publish a monthly bulletin, which includes data on the Central Bank'balance sheet and the monetary survey.

Commercial banks report only the minimum and maximum deposit and lending rates as of the end of each year. e. Balance of payments Trade data for Djibouti that appear in IFS are drawn from DOTS and are compiled entirely from the trade statistics of partner countries. A framework for the compilation of balance of payments statistics has been established in Djibouti with technical assistance from the Fund. However, they continue to exhibit numerous deficiencies. Data on external trade are compiled by the Statistical Office (DINAS) on the basis of information received from the Customs Office. Imports appear to be under-reported. Data on private capital flows are seriously deficient as commercial banks do not provide information to the NBD on the nature of the transactions on foreign exchange deposits and transfers, and the residency of the operators. Data on foreign grants and loans received by different ministries, public enterprises, and other entities are not centralized and coordinated, therefore lacking comprehensiveness and reliability. 2. Technical assistance missions in statistics Short-term technical assistance on balance of payments statistics (February 1993 and May 1994). 3. Resident Renresentative: None II. Technical Assistance Issues The staff identified with the authorities several key areas where technical assistance (TA) would be urgently needed to: (i) strengthen the country's capacity to collect, analyze, and report economic statistics; and (ii) ensure proper formulation, execution, and monitoring of leconomic policies. Technical assistance is being provided or considered by multilateral organizations or bilateral donors as follows: Topic Multilateral Organisations/Bilateral Donors 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.
