Ua/ The mission met with the President, the Prime Hinister, ministers of economic ministries, the Governor of the Bank of Lithuania (BOL), and private sector representatives. The last Article IV consultation with Lithuania was concluded in April 1994. At that time, Executive Directors welcomed the progress in economic stabilfzstion and structural reform under difficult circumstances, an4 praised the authorfties' commitment to maintain &he currency board. At the same time, they stressed that further tax reform was needed, expressed concern about progress Fn reform of &he social safety net, and highlighted delays in enterprise reforms. in the EFF-supported program currently in place.

Inflation was affected by higher than usual increases in winter food prices and greater than expected real appreciation of the ruble. The adoption of the Agricultural Law (see below) may have contributed to higher inflation, as farmers increased their prices in anticipation of a fLxing of these prices by the Government. The lower inflation in early 1995 was mainly related to deceleration in food prices; in May, monthly inflation increased slightly under the influence of higher prices on electricity and gas. The CPI increased by The external current account deficit declined from 6 percent oE GDP in 1993 to 4 percent of GDP in 1994, well balow expectations (Table 5). The lower-than-projected deficit tnninly reflected a stronger nonenergy tradb balance vio-&-vis eastern countries, The capital account; registered a lower surplus than had been projected because of delayed disbursements of G-24 loans (US$SS million of the US$l10 million shortfall was due to delays in G-24 disbursements, reflecting Lithuania's limited absorptive capacity). The net short-term capitol outflows were larger than expected. Overall, the balance of payments registered CL surplus in 1994 in line with the program. The reorientation of trade toward the West continued; in 1994, exports to the West accounted for about half of total exports, while imports from the West accounted for about a third of total imports, effective exchange rate has remaFned brond1.y unchanged during the program period, although it has concinuod to rise against non-PSU countriee (Chart 2) I Lithuania's real 3. ~iscit sou and rcfarm The Government has managed to pursue a tight fiscal policy, in spite of weak revenue performance wer the last few years, through cash rationing of expenditure, While the end-December 1994 performance criterion on the financial deficit was missed by a small amount, due. to large one-time salary bonuses that were paid at the end of ehe year (Table 6), the end-March 1995 ceiling was observed by a wide margin, This was accomplished in spite of a sharp drop in revenue in che first quarcer of 1995 as the Government cut expenditures. However, the expenditure compression was achieved in part by accumulating arrears to domestic suppliers, including to energy companies (domestic arrears increased by Llt 30 million in the first quarter of the year); nevertheless, the amount of incurred arrears was less than the margin by which the end-March performance criterion an the financial deficit was observed. - ~~ &/ Both import ar.3 export walumes dropped sharply in 1994. as interruptions in energy imparts Led to a decline in exports of refined energy products.

Key reasons €or the poor underlying revenue performance have been numeroiJs exemptions, problems in customs collection, and lax enforcement. Also, outstanding tax arraurs increased by Llt 280 million (or some 9 percent of total revenue) in October-March; expectations of a generous Tax Postponement Law may have contributed to this increase.

Pressures 4. devaloment S Since April 1, 1994, exchange rate and monetary policies have been determined by the currency board arrangement. Under chis arrangement, the litas is fixed at an exchange rate of 4 litai per U,S. dollar, and the monetary operations of the BOL are limited in principle ta purchases and sales of foreign exchange. Following the establishment of the currency board and through November 1994, sizeable inflows of foreign exchange occurred and interest rates declined sharply (Chart 3). foreign exchange inflows, reserve money and broad money increased strongly (Table 7). As a result of the However, beginning in December 1994, net foreign exchan&e outflows occurred amidst devaluetian rumors. To some extent, these rumors were caused by an ambiguous stance toward the currency board arrangement among some senior officials. Also, some actions by the BOL, aimed at securing financing for the energy sector, undermined confidence. These actions were: (i) the inclusion oE treasury bills sold in one auction in the definition of required reserves; (ii) the exempelon from the reserve requirement for one state-controlled commercial bank, to enable this bank to extend a loan to the energy system; and (iii) the pledging of official foreign exchange reserves as collateral for foreign borrowing by the energy system. While none of these actions were in violation of the performance criteria relating to the currency board arrangement, they undermined confidence in the currency board.

However, in a few critical areas pressures have built up that could undermine future macroeconomic stability and slow down the reorientation of the economy; this relates in particular to the agricultural and energy sectors. Calls for increased intervention in Uultyra have been made against the background of the hardships of transition suffered by farmers. Agricultural Law was adopted in December 1994, calling for threshold prices for agricultural imports, credit subsidies, and guaranteed minimum prices. The threshold prices, as specified in the Law, were to be based on domestic prices of agricultural products, in effect acting 8s variable import levies. So far, however, the only provisions of the Law that have been introduced are indicative minimum prices for beaf and milk set by a committee with government reprsssntation. In the context of negotia~kng an agricultural project, the World Bank has indicetad that alternatives to credit subsidies and price support need to be found, and that agrixultural import tariff reform should move ahead as envisaged under the EFF program. An The financial situation in the ~.~~TPIY sector has remained fragile, posing a threat to overall financial stability. been caused by weak payments discipline among energy consumers and the fixing of some energy prices below the cost. of production.

As a consequence, the energy companies have been unable to meet their scheduled payments out of their own resources for importation of crude oil, gas, and nuclear fuel cassettes. The import supplies have been reduced and the authorities have taken actions, as described above, that undermined confidence in the currency board. The financial problems have Arrears of energy customers for electricity, h/ While a reductfon in the reserve ratio to 10 yercent had been foreseen under the program, the timing had not been determined.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Economic Policies for 1995 Lithuania has successfully implemented the initial phase of stabilization, and the discussions took place against the background of a nascent recovery in economic activity and relatively modest inflation. At the same time, financial difficulties in the energy sector concinued to pose a threat to macroeconomic stability. Moreover, growth-oriented structural policies in regard to privatization and the financial sector had been delayed, and pressures for agricultural protection persisted.

When the BOL Also, there is little evidence to indicate that the nominal exchange rate needs to be adjusted. Changes in the exchange rate could call into question the Government's commitment to maintaining the simple and transparent "rules of the game" which are the core of the currency board arrangement. Furthermore, while the higher-than-expected inflation does imply that the catch-up from the initial undervaluation of the litas has been more rapid than anticipated, the level of wages in Lithuania relative to neighboring countries in transition suggests that chc litas remains undervalued (Chart 6). To signal the Government's firm commitment and fut:tLer strongthen confidence, the BOL is committed henceforth to operate the currency board in a steady and consistent manner. The authorities have initiated the reversal of one-third of the pledge of the BOL foreign exchange reserves, that was made as collateral for foreign borrowing by the energy sector; this step is to be concluded by end-June 1995. 1;/ included in the letter for the review (paragraph 4) are expected to bolster confidence. will be completed by end-1995. applied equally to all banks and changes in the reserve ratio will be avoided.

Energy __ sector To address the financial problems of the energy sector, the Government has started to cut off the supply of energy to delinquent customers. In addition, electricity and natural gas prices were increased by 35 percent on May 1 and heating tariffs doubled on June 1 (the latter step implies full cost recovery for energy compacies, which was planned for mid-1996 under the program). Also, personnel changes have taken place in the energy sector--importantly, the appointment of a new Minister of Energy. Notwithstanding these actions, the financial problems in the energy sector remain a risk to macroeconomic stability. made so far have been mixed. To follow up on the initial steps, the Government is committed to strengthening payment discipline among consumers by more consistent cut-off of the supply to delinquent customers, by applying financial penalties, and by discontinuing the practice of granting temporary exemptions from the payment of energy bills to individual companies. Also, budgetary organizations will not incur any new arrears to the energy sector. The results of the efforts Looking further ahead, the Government is working to establish firmer control over the finances of energy companies, including through an audit of the Lithuania State Power System and the establishment of performance targets for the companies, In the longer run, privatization will be pursued as a way of promoting financial discipline; so far, 10 percent of energy assets have been earmarked for privatization, C. aivatization. enterprise reform. and lenal reform The Government is committed to start cash privatization immediately following the completion of voucher privatization (on July 1, 1995). Legislation for the next phase of privatization was presented to Parliament by the Government in May 1995; the Government expects this legislation to be adopted by mid-year. However, competing legislation has been introduced by a member of Parliament, which could jeopardize this time schedule. The Government's proposed legislation envisages that line ministries and municipalities will continue to manage state assets and that the Privatization Committee, with the Ministry of Economics as the secretariat, JJ These include raw hides and skins, feathers, organs fox medical use, and timber exports to certain countries. 2J The increases in electricity and natural gas prices were designed to maintain, in the face of increasing costs, the full cost recovery that had been established earlier.

In February 1995, Parliament The authorities indicated their commitment to promote an accelerated restructuring of enterprises, The equal treatment of foreign and domestic investors, envisaged in the new privatization legislation, would help in this regard. Also, a proposed constitutional amendment to allow foreign land ownership Is before Parliament. In addition, enforcing hard budget constraints requires progress in legal and institutional reform. So far, the practical difficulties involved, as well as the limited legal expertise within Lithuania, have delayed advancement in this area, and this is likely to continue to be the case. Nevertheless, the Government aims to put in place a new Bankruptcy Law by end-1995 and is seeking to improve the court system's capacity to deal with bankruptcy cases. registers needed for the collaterizetion of bank loans are being improved, Also, the legislation and d. Financial sector reform The reduction of government ownership in the three state-controlled banks to a minority status has been postponed for the time being. With assistance from the World Bank, the Government is developing a comprehensive plan for recapitalization and privatization of the three banks; this plan would address the insolvency of the banks. International audits for 1994 have been commissioned for all three banks, and capital increases for the banks will not be permitted until the audit results are final. While acknowledging that progress in financial sector reform had been slow, the authorities pointed to initiation of bankruptcies for several smaller banks and ongoing efforts to strengthen prudential supervision, and expressed their resolution to move ahead with financial sector reform as planned. The World Bank is providing technical assistance and financial support for these reforms. 5. Economic management - and data issues The Government has strengthened its capacity to collect, analyze, and report economic statistics.

These achievements remain fragile, however, and full implementation of the EFF-supported program will be critical to ensure that economic growth is sustained. The basic reform and stabilization strategy of the EFF-supported program should remain unchanged, with progress in structural reform underpinning the stabilization effort. In this regard, the staff 1s heartened by the actions being taken to protect the integrity of the currency board arrangement, improve fiscal management, avoid further setbacks in trade reform, improve the financial position of the energy companies, and embark on the second stage of privatization. Given the underlying pressures for policy actions that could undermine economic stability, it will be critically important that the currency board arrangement remains in place. confidence could easily be undermined. remain, to build trust in the Government's commitment to clear "rules of the game" concerning the operation of the currency board arrangement.

In the short term, the Government shotlld stand ready to cut expenditure as needed to stay within the financial deficit ceilings. However, a continued weak revenue performance would undermine the Government's scope for expanding much needed expenditure on infrastructure. Thus, the staff welcomes the adoption of the General Law on Taxes and the improvements in the staffing and structures of the tax authorities. These actions need to be complemented by firm application of existing tax regulations, collection of existing tax arrears and no accumulation of new arrears, and the cessation of the practice of tax deferments. Also, the VAT exemptions should be allowed to expire as planned, The Government will also need to address the financing problems of the social security fund.

However, significant risks remain, notably in regard to the financial situation in the energy sector.
