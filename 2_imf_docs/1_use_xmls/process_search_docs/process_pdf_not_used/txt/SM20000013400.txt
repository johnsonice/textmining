INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND MALAYSIA Staff Report for the 2000 Article IV Consultation Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2000 Consultation with Malaysia Approved by Mario I. Blejer and Leslie Lipschitz June 23,200O 1 The Article IV consultation discussions were held in Kuala Lumpur during April 20-May 4, 2000. B In concluding last year’s Article IV consultation, Executive Directors observed that the breathing space provided by the temporary capital controls was used well to push ahead with financial sector reforms, and supported expansionary macroeconomic policies to reverse the sharp contraction of economic activity. Directors also agreed on the need for more flexible fiscal management and a less rigid interest rate structure that would help Malaysia cope more readily with the changing environment. They welcomed the improvements made in the prudential and supervisory framework for the financial system and stressed that continuation of the financial and corporate sector restructuring would help to transform the recovery into sustained growth. n Against that background, the discussions in 2000 centered on further adjustments that Malaysia needs to make in order to secure high and sustainable growth and reduce its vulnerability in a more globalized environment. . The mission met with Dato’ Mustapa Mohamed, Economic Advisor, and Dato’ Othman bin Mohd. Rijal, Secretary General, Ministry of Finance; Mrs. Latifah Merican Cheong, Assistant Governor, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM); Tan Sri Noordin Sopiee, Member of the National Economic Action Council; other senior officials; and labor and private sector representatives. . The staff team was led by Ms. Meesook, and included Mr. 11 Houng Lee, Ms. Liu, Mr. Khatri (all APD), Ms. Tamirisa (PDR), and Mr. Krysl (consultant, MAE), and was supported by Mr. Moore (MAE) at headquarters. Ms. Siti Yusof (OED) participated in some of the discussions. . Malaysia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Controls are applied to a number of capital account transactions. n The staff report was prepared by the team and coordinated by Ms. Meesook and Mr. Lee.

While domestic consumption has shown signs of strengthening, private investment continues to be sluggish, reflecting some excess capacity and cautious private sector activity. Macroeconomic policies have been supportive of tbe recovery, while stability has been maintained. A sizable fiscal impulse in 1999 partly offset slowing private demand. Significant declines in interest rates have helped alleviate the burden on the corporate sector and improve prudential indicators for the banking system. Market confidence is cautiously growing in response to the recovery and gradual easing of capital controls. Malaysia was upgraded by various rating agencies and reincluded in the Morgan Stanley Capital Market Index. As a consequence, portfolio inflows have resumed, which also helped the Kuala Lumpur Stock Market Composite Index to move back closer to the pre-crisis level. The outlook for 2000 is favorable, although there are risks. Real GDP growth is conservatively estimated at 6 percent. However, if demand from major trading partners weakens, growth prospects could be jeopardized, given Malaysia’s heavy reliance on exports in the recovery process. The outlook is also predicated on more adaptable macroeconomic policy and continued momentum in structural reforms. Near-term macroeconomic policy needs to strike a balance between tbe need to strengthen domestic demand and a rapidly closing output gap. Fiscal expansion planned for 2000 is appropriate under the current circumstances, but its size may need to be cut back if private demand strengthens beyond expectations. The maintenance of low interest rates is appropriate, but there is also a need for flexibility, so as to respond in a timely manner to any change in the environment. Over the medium term, the government aims for a smooth return to a higher and sustainable growth path. To this end, monetary and exchange rate policy would need to adapt readily to maintain stability. Growth should rely more on productivity gains which should result from structural reforms rather than huge investment of the kind seen in the past. While much progress has been made to develop more resilient and competitive financial and corporate systems, together with more effective regulatory frameworks, the effort needs to be sustained. Tbe government has embarked on a long-term strategy to adjust to a tecbnology- oriented and more globalized environment. It aims to transform Malaysia to a knowledge-based economy, relying more on high skill sectors based on information, communications and technology. A key issue in this context is an appropriate role of the public sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- I. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS A. Developments in 1999-20001 1. The Malaysian economy has recovered from the sharp output decline experienced in 1998. Like the other Asian crisis counties, the recovery was first led by exports that benefited from both strong external demand and the undervalued exchange rate. Although domestic demand has lately played an increasing role, private investment is still lagging behind in some of these economies because of excess capacity and the continued caution of the private sector. Different initial conditions and policy responses have paved different recovery paths. In particular, Malaysia was affected by the crisis later than the other countries, and the recovery in its domestic demand lags somewhat behind them (Box 1 and Figures 1-6).2 15 0 -15 -30 2.

The manufacturing sector expanded by over 13 percent in 1999, as the production of electronics was boosted by buoyant export demand. There are indications that output expansion is becoming more broad-based, including in the services sector, and that capacity utilization in several export-oriented industries has risen to near pre-crisis levels. Yet, reflecting the remaining spare capacity overall, wage pressures have not emerged and inflation remains below 2 percent (year-on-year). 3. The recovery has been supported by a fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policy. The federal government deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 1999 provided a fiscal impulse estimated at over 3 percent of GDP and helped offset the decline in private ‘The National Front Coalition, led by Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, won the general elections (held on November 29, 1999) with a reduced majority. Malaysia’s pro-business policies were reiterated, and key economic ministers were retained. 2See Chapter I, “Asian Crisis Countries: A Comparative Review of Policies and Performances, 1997-Present,” in the forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

A Comparison of Economic Recovery and Policies in Malaysia with Other Asian Crisis Countries (1997-2000) The Asian crisis countries experienced a marked turnaround in 1999 after suffering severe contraction in 1998. Real GDP grew from less than % percent in Indonesia to as high as about 10 percent in Korea. Patterns of ‘ecovery have been similar in most Asian countries, which were led initially by exports that benefited from the :ompetitive exchange rates, continued strong demand from the United States, and strengthened intraregional rade. increased exports have also benefited from the bottoming out of world commodity prices. Yet exports were replaced by domestic demand in Korea and Thailand as the main engine for growth in 1999 (even after adjusting for restocking in the case of Korea), while the recovery in domestic demand itill lagged behind in Malaysia, reflecting a continued decline in private investment which was partially :ompensated for by an increase in public investment (Figures l-2). 3utput decline occurred later in Malaysia, and countercyclical macroeconomic policies were adopted later, which might explain the delayed response in domestic demand (Figure 3 and Box 4): Fiscal policies, which had been contractionary at the eve of the crisis, were eased in Korea and Thailand, and subsequently shifted to expansionary stances in late 1997 for Thailand and early 1998 for Korea. In Malaysia, by contrast, the fiscal stance remained signifi- Overall Fiscal Eiahms of Selected AsianComtrics, 1997-99 cantly contractionary (InpercentofGDP) throughout most of 1997 (i.e., a negative fiscal impulse of 61 16 1.5 percent of GDP). The shift 4 4 in fiscal policy took place in mid- 1998.

Monetary policy responses to the crisis were similar in all Asian crisis countries to the extent that nominal interest rates were raised, although Korea and Thailand initially raised interest rates more sharply than Malaysia. Eventually, all countries allowed a decline in the rates to below crisis levels (Figure 6). Similar to other Asian crisis countries, the output gap remains in Malaysia. In view of the difficulties in estimating potential growth when an economy’s growth rate falls well below the previous long-term trend, the precise magnitude of the gap is uncertain. There are also uncertainties associated with the speed with which the gap will be closed, the pace of recovery in private investment, and sustainability of external demand, particu- larly from the United States. Fiscal expansion is expected to continue in 2000 to further stimulate domestic demand in the absence of inflationary pressure. Budgeted fiscal impulse, estimated at about 0.8 percent of GDP, was somewhat higher than that of Korea and Thailand, although much smaller than the outturn in 1999. Off-budget spending, through privatized infrastructure projects, is estimated to add about % percent of GDP to the fiscal stimulus in 2000, similar to the size of last year.

However, the transmission of lower interbank rates to bank lending rates has been slow. Net credit growth (adjusted for nonperforming loans (NPLS) sold to Danaharta, the asset management agency) was weak (Table 3). 4. The weak credit growth did not appear to have constrained the hi alaysia: Total Loans Disbursed and Repaid, 1997-99 Loan disbursed in 1997=100 recovery, in light of the still low demand for large-scale investments. 100 Although outstanding bank credit 80 expanded little, gross bank loan disburse- ments (and repayments) increased 60 significantly, reflecting shortened 40 maturity of bank loans and possibly ample supply of funds for working 20 capital.

There was a marginal I Repaid shift to nonbank debt financing and equity issues by the corporate sector. 5. The external current account surplus increased to 16 percent of GDP in 1999, from 13 percent in 1998 (Table 4). Export volume increased by 19 percent., in line with strong demand from the United States and the Asian region. Import volume rose by only 12 percent even after a 20 percent decline in 1998, consistent with the weak domestic demand and the undervalued ringgit (Box 2). The services account deficit rose further as foreign companies repatriated their earnings. 6. The capital account deteriorated in 1999, reflecting mainly short-term outflows. Commercial banks and the private sector reduced their foreign liabilities in response to the relatively low domestic interest rates.4 These outflows were partly offset by official borrowing, including a ten-year Malaysian government bond of $1 billion issued in May 1999~the first in nine y ears-aimed at establishing a sovereign benchmark in the international capital markets, and a five-year dollar-denominated bond of $650 million issued by Petronas. Net foreign direct investment remained modest, largely accounted for by higher retained earnings in some export sectors. 31nvestment spending under the Seventh Development Plan (1996-2ooO) was augmented in 1999; significant amounts of unused allocations remain and are to be utilized in 2000. The Eighth Development Plan (200145) is currently under preparation. 41n addition, some $2 billion of portfolio funds left in September 1999 upon the expiration of the one-year holding period, as captured in the external accounts and special external accounts (which are bank accounts that nonresidents are required to use for payment of goods and services, and securities and other assets in Malaysia.)

Since July 1997, the REER of the ringgit has depreciated by around 23 percent (which is -oughly the same as the other Asian crisis countries). Since September 1998, the exchange rate has )een pegged at RM 3.8 per U.S. dollar and the REER has remained fairly constant. Large inflows ;hrough the external accounts have not created pressures for the currency to appreciate as Bank Vegara Malaysia (BNM) intervened in the foreign exchange market, which were then sterilized. 4u assessment suggests that the ringgit could be undervalued by 12-15 percent.’ This is based In an underlying current account surplus of around 10-13 percent of GDP (the balance that arises ,vhen domestic and foreign output gaps Fall to zero and the lagged effects of ,zo I20 -ecent real exchange rate movements Real Effective Exchange (July 1997=100) Rates lave been fully passed through).

Since early 2000, market confidence has recovered in response to the stronger I,200 economic performance and the easing of capital controls, and portfolio inflows have resumed.’ The inflows have been l.ooo aided by the upgrading of Malaysia’s ratings and the reinclusion of Malaysia in the Morgan *O” Stanley Capital Index (MSCI) at end-May, and have boosted the stock market.

The large external account surplus has facilitated Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) in raising international reserves and reducing interest rates. BNM has absorbed excess foreign exchange from the market to maintain the peg, while partially sterilizing its monetary impact. The decline in domestic interest rates has given rise to a negative interest rate differential vis-&vis U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets which might reflect the effect of the remaining exchange controls and/or possible market expectations of a revaluation of the exchange rate. 9. Performance of the banking and corporate sectors has improved. The banking system’s NPLs as percent of total loans, declined from a peak of 19 percent at end-1998 to below 17 percent at end- 1999; the system’s risk-weighted capital ratio improved from 11.7 percent to 12.5 percent during the same period; and banking and corporate profits recovered (Table 5). Consequently, Danamodal (the bank recapitalization agency) required 51n February 1999, the one-year holding period on repatriation of portfolio capital was replaced with a graduated system of exit levy, with the rate applicable to investment made prior to September 1998 becoming zero starting on September 1, 1999. On September 2 1, 1999, the measures were eased and simplified, whereby only profit remittances on portfolio capital brought in after February 14, 1999 remained subject to an exit levy of 10 percent. ‘?he Singapore over-the-counter offshore market for Malaysian equities (i.e., Central Limit Book Order (CLOB) securities) were closed as part of the September 1998 capital control measures, freezing the shares of some 170,000 investors. An agreement was reached between Malaysia and Singapore in March 2000, with most investors opting for the scheme offered by Effective Capital Sdn. Bhd., under which the CLOB securities will be released over a 13-month period commencing in July 2000.

Achievement of Danaharta can be attributed, in part, to the legislative power vested in the agency to pursue collection of default loans, and to require restructuring of assets it acquires, including by appointing special administrators to manage the borrowing entities. Restructuring of the nonbank sector has also proceeded in the context of debt restructuring under the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee (CDRC). B. Medium-Term Outlook 10. In 2000, real GDP growth is conservatively projected at 6 percent, continuing to benefit from a favorable external environment for Malaysian exports, but with domestic demand playing a more central role. Macroeconomic policies are geared to providing a further stimulus in order to ensure a full recovery of the demand. The recent increase in private consumption, as well as continued brisk exports, are envisaged to lead to a deployment of the excess capacity followed by a pickup of private investment and imports7 Thus, the current account surplus is projected to narrow, and inflationary pressures are expected to begin building up by late 2000. 11. The overall balance of payments is projected to record another large surplus in 2000, with the capital account strengthening from last year. Short-term portfolio flows have already shifted to net inflows. However, the immediate impact of the reinstatement of Malaysia in the MSCI at end-May was subdued, as many investment funds had already repositioned themselves in expectation of the action. Foreign direct investment flows are projected to decline slightly, consistent with project approvals during 1998-99, and demand for new external borrowing is projected to be low given the ample liquidity and low domestic interest rates. 12. Malaysia’s potential growth over the medium term is envisaged to be around 6-7 percent, but there are risks in the outlook. The staff team prepared two medium-term scenarios to illustrate the impact of Malaysia’s vulnerability to one of those risks in the light 120 90 60 Real GDP Growth and Output Gap, 1995-2001 1!497=100 7’” - Actual . - - -. . . bentid -Output Gap (8; RHS) 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 locrcmcntalCapital0utpu1RatD 3 RealGDP gw& (RHS) +ICOR (cu fned capialfamabn 7The staff estimates that the output gap will close by end-2000 (see Chapter II, “Potential Output and Inflation,” of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper).

In the baseline scenario, the lower potential growth relative to the level realized pre-crisis reflects a smaller capital formation than in the past, to be partly offset by productivity gains as Malaysia moves to a K(nowledge)-economy. The current account surplus is expected to decline as imports recover in tandem with rising domestic demand. Eventually, Malaysia is expected to be a net recipient, although small, of foreign savings. The real exchange rate is expected to appreciate closer to its long-run equilibrium level (Box 2).* In the alternative scenario, it is assumed that demand of Malaysia’s trading partners weakens over the next two years. Private investment, which has so far not recovered, would be adversely affected. Accordingly, it would take Malaysia longer to reach its potential output of 6-7 percent. The degree of actual output decline, relative to the baseline scenario, will depend partly on how domestic demand would respond to the slowdown in exports. 13. The concept of a K-economy relates to the generation and use of knowledge to create wealth, and the government is preparing a master plan for its development (Box 3). The aim is to shift from low-skill manufacturing to high-skill sectors such as information technology, focusing on areas where Malaysia has a comparative advantage (such as biotechnology and agrotechnology). An initiative already under way is the Multimedia Super Corridor, which is designed to act as a seed for the development of high- tech companies in Malaysia. II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 14. Policy discussions focused on the management of the economy post-crisis in the face of challenges of globalization. The following topics were highlighted: (i) the 2000 budget and current monetary policy; (ii) flexibility in fiscal operations, interest rate determination, and the exchange rate regime that may help Malaysia cope more readily with a changing environment; (iii) progress in financial and corporate reforms aimed at reducing Malaysia’s vulnerability; and (iv) Malaysia’s strategy toward a K-economy. Fiscal policy A. Macroeconomic Policies 15. Fiscal stimulus in 2000 was designed to help stimulate private domestic demand without jeopardizing economic stability. The authorities broadly accepted the staff team’s estimate of the federal government deficit at 4% percent of GDP, about one percentage point lower than the budget, with the difference reflecting higher revenue outturn in 1999 than had been expected when the budget forecasts were made, and the effect of a shift in income tax assessment from the previous year to the current year basis.’ The stimulus is expected to come from both the expenditures and revenue measures, providing an additional fiscal ‘Both scenarios assume that adjustments in the exchange rate will be made as necessary to correct for significant misalignments. 9A slow revenue collection observed in the first quarter was attributed by the authorities to problems associated with the introduction of self-assessment in the income tax, and was expected to reverse itself later this year.

Malaysia: The K(nowledge)-Economy Underlying the “knowledge” or “new” economy is the concept of generating and using knowledge to create additional value in the economy. However, there is no standard definition of the K-economy as yet, and it is generally conceived in terms of its attributes, which include: l The key aspect that technological change is more rapid in the “new” economy than in the “old” (production-based) economy. Thus, the growth of the K-economy is associated with an increase in the rate of sustainable output growth for a given level of investment. l The implied l%ndamental changes in the structure and operation of the economy. Examples of “new ways of doing things” include e-commerce, e-banking, distance learning, and remote conferencing. l The increase in the relative value of intangibles, such as human capital, databases, and intellectual property rights. The government is planning to transform Malaysia into a K-economy, relying less on low-skill manufacturing and more on high-skill sectors such as information technology. The fundamental rationale for a transition to a K-economy is that it will be the most prudent and effective strategy for promoting sustainable real economic growth. The Institute for Strategic and International Studies (ISIS, a government think-tank) is currently preparing a master plan to formulate a framework for the transition to a K-economy. The master plan document is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Developing appropriate human capital, information structures, and a technology base will be central to the transition. Research and development expenditure will increase and focus on developing areas where Malaysia has a comparative advantage: initial areas identified include biotechnology and agrotechnology. Cooperation between academia and industry in research and development undertakings will also be developed. Currently, compared to neighboring and more advanced K-economies, Malaysia has a low level of information technology (IT) skills (relative to the labor force) and a very low level of intemet (around 5 percent) and PC use. An initiative already under way is the Multimedia Super Corridor (a development zone set up to attract foreign high-tech industries and to encourage development of domestic technology companies) which is designed to act as a seed for the development of high-tech companies in Malaysia. The focus will shift from big multinationals (such as Microsoft) to attracting and nurturing small domestic companies. The Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing and Automated Quotation (MESDAQ), commenced trading on April 30,1999. It hoped to follow the NASDAQ in the United States or KOSDAQ in Korea, in bringing together high growth and technology companies with potential investors. Currently, there is only one company (Supercomal Technologies Bhd.) listed on the exchange, but recently, two others were given approval for listing. This bourse may become an important source of financing K-economy firms in the future. Of the emerging market regions, Asia has made the most progress toward the new or K-economy. The K-economy is often taken to be embodied in technology, media, and telecommuni- cations (TMT) and the importance of the K-economy in a country or region might be proxied by the relative importance of these sectors, measured by the share of stock market capitalization. Comparing regions using IFCI indices, Asia’s TMT sector accounts for over 50 percent of its market capitalization, and is skewed toward IT and electronics sectors (35 percent) which have grown rapidly in recent years and currently account for six of the largest ten companies in Asia. In Latin America, the TMT sector (which comprises mainly telecommunications) accounts for 39 per- cent of the region’s market capitalization (compared to 27 percent two years ago); Emerging Europe has a TMT sector of only around 18 percent.

Given the uncertainties in the size of the output gap, the speed at which it might be closed, and possible wage increases in the private sector in line with those in the civil service, the team emphasized that the authorities should be prepared to withdraw the stimulus if it appeared that economic growth was strong and self-sustaining. 16. The authorities were less concerned about the possibility of inflationary pressures in the near term, noting that excess capacity remained sixable in some nontradable sectors, and private investment had yet to pick up. However, they recognized the need to monitor the budget execution closely, and agreed that, were signs of overheating to emerge, noncore development spending should be scaled back; they noted that the scope for adjusting revenue and current expenditure would be limited. They also explained that the budgeted 10 percent wage increase was to compensate for the wage freeze over the past few years, and a further increase was not expected in the near future. 17. Tax measures introduced in the 2000 budget were intended primarily to stimulate domestic spending, but would also serve to improve tax buoyancy in the long run through rationalixing the tax structure and reducing protection. The measures included the lowering of income tax rates and thresholds, the reduction in a number of import tariffs, and the shift from specific to ad valorem rates for selected items. The shift in the income tax assessment to the current year basis would also provide the fiscal system with a built-in stabilizer. The staff team encouraged a move to increase further the buoyancy of indirect taxes, including the consideration of a value-added tax (VAT). Regarding the measure to grant tax holidays to venture capital companies, the team cautioned that abuse of tax exemptions had been a common experience elsewhere, but the authorities believed that the design of this measure incorporated adequate safeguards. 18. The authorities concurred that fiscal policy could be used more effectively as a countercyclical tool, but saw little scope in making the fiscal rule more flexible. They would be particularly reluctant to relax the rule of maintaining an annual operating surplus, lest that set a bad precedent. They also maintained that unemployment and social security benefits (which would act as built-in stabilizers) could generate disincentives to work, and that the existing informal social safety net was adequate. They argued that discretionary measures could be used to offset the lack of built-in stabilizers, such as the activation of projects on a backup list if revenue turned out stronger than expected. The staff team recommended that the horizon of budget formulation be extended to cover the course of a business cycle, so that annual targets, for example, could be adjusted to reflect demand conditions. Furthermore, off-budget activities should be included in the analysis of the fiscal stimulus and sustainability.‘0 Such multi-year planning and a fully consolidated fiscal position would allow annual budget policy to respond readily to short-term events while preserving Malaysia’s fiscal prudence. More realistic revenue estimates (instead of ones with a conservative bias) would also add to the effectiveness of this process. ‘%uther analysis of fiscal-related issues is given in Chapter III, “Challenges in Fiscal Management,” of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

Fiscal Policy in Malaysia The fiscai stimulus in 2000 is to come from both expenditure and revenue measures, and is estimated to provide about % percent of fiscal impulse. Expenditure measures amount to 3.3 percent of GDP and include: a 10 percent increase in the wage bill; larger subsidies and transfers to public enterprises; large development expenditures, mostly in agriculture, transportation, and communication sectors. Tax measures amount to 0.4 percent of GDP and consist of: cuts in personal income tax rates; an increase in personal income tax threshold; full tax exemption for a period of ten years on income of venture capital companies; and reductions in tariffs of a large number of imported goods as well as shifts from specific excises to ad valorem rates for selected goods.’ The fiscal impulse, aimed at stimulating demand, was injected later in Malaysia than in other Asian crisis countries, but has 7 Cumulative Fiscal Impulse of Selected Asian Countries 1997-2000 (In percent of GDP) been higher over the course of the crisis. M.hYSis s Although the fiscal impulse in 1999 c (3.9 percent of GDP, including estimated off-budget stimulus) was less than the ; budgeted target and backloaded to the 3 second half of the year, it brought 2 Malaysia’s cumulative impulse (1997-99) 1 above that of the other countries. Fiscal 0 expansion planned for 2000, when the -1 other countries are taking a more neutral -2 I stance, would raise the relative cumulative impulse even higher.3 Off-budget spending has provided additional fiscal stimulus mostly in the form of privatixed infrastructure projects. Planned off-budget stimulus is estimated at about 3 percent of GDP for 1998-2000, two-thirds of which have been finalized and about % percent of GDP is expected to be disbursed annually during 1999-200 1. These projects are to be financed mostly from domestic private and semi-government sources with explicit government guarantees. Terms of loans are favorable with interest rates in the range of 6-8 percent, an average grace period of six years, and a repayment period of 15-l 8 years. Off-budget spending is expected to be scaled back after 200 1. The government’s explicit contingent liabilities have increased in recent 8. years (by about 8 percent of GDP), albeit starting from a low level.

Since 1998, the authorities have relied on privatized projects to provide additional fiscal stimulus, and explicit guarantees on their financing have raised contingent claims on the government. Several of the projects have also been granted concessional loans from the budget. In addition, there are a number of privatized projects implemented prior to 1998-involving provision of transport and social services-that are in financial difficulties and being negotiated under the CDRC framework. Although the government did not provide them with any explicit guarantees, consideration is being given to provide government support in some form. The staff team advised that such support be extended only as a last resort to those projects with clear social benefits, and with terms consistent with market principles. 20. The authorities plan to begin strengthening the position of the federal government starting next year, which will lower the public debt ratio over time. The pace of consolidation will be consistent with the reduction in capital expenditure arising from a shift away from transports and other large-scale infrastructure to education and technological infrastructure in line with the K-economy master plan. The staff team noted that public sector debt remained manageable based on fiscal operations that have been identified so far, and that half of 3 2 1 0 -I -2 -3 -4 -5 Malaysia: Total Public Debt and Fiscal Deficit (IO pcrcen~ of GDP) the increase in the debt ratio since end-19% was explained by the exchange rate impact on external debt.” However, in order to measure accurately the degree of fiscal sustainability, all fiscal and quasi-fiscal operations (including activities and financing of Danaharta, Danamodal, and the privatized projects) should be consolidated in a transparent manner, and public debt data should be extended to cover nonguaranteed domestic debt of public enterprises.” The authorities noted that the accounting and auditing system of the government accounts was in line with best practices, but acknowledged the merit of more complete information on off-budget activities.13 “Including identified contingent liabilities of the government, the public debt ratio at end-1999 amounted to 64 percent of GDP. “?he authorities indicated that those projects that have not yet taken off would most likely be cancelled. 131n this connection, the staff team encouraged Malaysia to undertake a self-assessment against the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency with a view to identifying areas where improvement can be made in fiscal accounts and practices.

The staff team noted that greater flexibility in the interest rate structure could help achieve the monetary policy objectives in a more eilicient mariner.... It recommended that the intervention rate reflect more closely market conditions (implying a lower intervention rate, and consequently lower BLR in the current environment). The ceiling on lending rates should also be raised-so as not to constrain lending to marginally riskier, yet potentially profitable, customers-and eventually abolished, as banks should be allowed to determine lending rates based on their risk assessment under the framework of improved credit risk management by banks and risk-based supervision (paragraph 37). The staff team also expressed concern about possible distortions stemming from the rigidity of deposit rates, as suggested by deposit rates moving with rather long lags (during the second half of 1999) above the falling interbank rate. 23. The authorities indicated their intention to remove the lending rate ceiling in the long run, in conjunction with the development of risk-based supervision of the banking 141n the presence of some capital controls, and to the extent that domestic financial assets are less-than-perfect substitutes for foreign assets, BNM has some degree of, although limited, monetary policy independence. ‘“The intervention rate, however, has become de facto detached from market conditions since mid-1999, as can be observed from the widening spread with the Klibor. 16BNM influences the Klibor rate through its transactions in the interbank market (in the current environment, BNM has been purchasing to absorb liquidity). The base lending rate (BLR) is set by a formula that allows some margin over banks’ costs of funds, defined as the BNM intervention rate plus the cost of holding the statutory reserve requirement. Banks’ lending rates are not permitted to exceed the BLR plus 2.5 percentage points; or banks can opt to charge customers actual cost of funds plus the same allowable margin. A large share of banks’ lending is reported to be priced between the BLR and the margin. The staff report for the 1999 Article IV consultation (M/99/141) gives a fuller description of available monetary instruments and their implementation.

Nevertheless, they did not consider the ceiling to be a constraint on bank lending, and emphasized that data on outstanding credit did not provide an accurate indication of the strong lending by banking institutions because they were distorted by-high repayments, write-offs, and debt conversion. The authorities also expected the gap between the Klibor and the intervention rate to narrow once demand for bank credit picked up. They noted that, although some rigidity prevailed in the past, deposit rates have now declined to below the Kbbor; nevertheless, they intended to retain positive deposit rates in real terms to ensure adequate deposit base and protect small savers. 24. The staff team noted that, while the pegging of the exchange iate might have helped to stabilize market expectations (Figure 7), persistent undervaluation could have adverse implications over the medium term. In view of a relatively large misalignment of the exchange rate from its long-term equilibrium (Box 2), a correction would be made eventually through higher domestic prices if the current level of the nominal exchange rate is maintained. Accordingly, the team argued for an early move to a more flexible exchange regime, noting the usual lag of policy effects in dampening inflation, and the narrowing output gap, which could induce wage pressures.17 Moreover, a delay could attract short-term capital inflows, and discourage the corporate sector from building up the ability to hedge risks. A persistently undervalued ringgit could also lead to less-than-optimal allocation of resources. The team noted that the nature of potential shocks facing Malaysia also argued for greater flexibility. l8 25. The authorities responded that the exchange rate was being monitored very closely, and would be adjusted if, and only if, it became inconsistent with economic fundamentals. Any change would be executed with the appropriate risk management measures adequately in place. In any case, the authorities believed the extent of undervaluation to be relatively minor (6-8 percent). They also argued that under the current monetary policy, inflation was expected to remain moderate over the medium term and, therefore, the exchange rate would not necessarily appreciate in real terms. Continued sterilization efforts would dampen emergence of any inflationary pressures coming from the external sector. External debt and vulnerability 26. Malaysia’s external vulnerability position is manageable (Box 5 and Tables 6 and 7). Liquidity risk indicators (e.g., reserves) and balance sheet risk indicators (e.g., total and short-term debt ratios) point to reduced external vulnerability; and various macro-risk indicators remain favorable. External debt at end-2000 is projected at about 49 percent of GDP, of which 23 percent is short-term (on a remaining maturity basis, excluding bonds with put options coming due, which is estimated to be less than $100 million in 1999 and about 17Specific modality regarding the shift to a more flexible exchange regime was not discussed, as the authorities considered it to be premature. ‘%Ire medium-term monetary and exchange rate policy options were discussed in detail in the 1999 Article IV reports (SM/99/141 and W/99/145, Supplement 1).

Malaysia: External Vulnerability rotal external debt outstanding declined from $43 billion (59 percent of GDP) at end- 1998 to ;42 billion (53 percent of GDP) at end-1999. Of this, medium- and long-term debt amounted to ;36 billion and (gross) short-term debt by original maturity to $6 billion. The maturity profile of lxtemal debt lengthened, with the share of short-term debt by original maturity declining from !O percent in 1998 to 14 percent in 1999. The currency composition remained broadly stable, with lollar-denominated debt accounting for about 72 percent of total debt outstanding at end- 1999. ihort-term debt (net) by remaining maturity declined by about 19 percent to $8.7 billion over the rear to end- 1999, of which $2.3 billion was owed by Malaysian resident financial institutions, i2.4 billion by the nonbank private sector, and $4 billion related to amortization of medium- and ong-term debt coming due in 2000 (Table 6). Bank Negara Malaysia requires approval of external borrowing by the nonbank private sector for amounts exceeding RM 5 million, and grants such lpprovals typically only to projects that generate foreign exchange. Companies are also encouraged to aise long-term funds and, in particular, not to use short-term f?mds for financing of long-term Brojects. To a large extent, short-term debt is naturally hedged, with the currency composition of iadilities closely matching that of foreign exchange earnings.

The market appears to concur broadly with this assessment, as suggested, for example, by the low sovereign spread. 27. The authorities affirmed that reserve management continued to be fully in line with international best practices. The reserves are invested in high quality sovereign paper, or deposited with financial institutions with strong credit ratings; there are no investments in off-balance sheet instruments and no pledging or collaterizing of the assets. Thus, the reserves are fully usable. lg Malaysia has begun to publish data on official reserves and foreign exchange liquidity in accordance with the SDDS reserves template requirements. B. Structural and Regulatory Reforms Trade and capital account regime*’ 28. Since 1999, the trade regime has been liberalized further, including in the context of Malaysia’s commitments under the WTO and the mA.*l Following those measures, the average tariff rate is estimated at about 9 percent, comparable to other countries in the region. Import licensing, primarily used to address national security and environmental and social objectives, covers about 17 percent of tariff lines and is concentrated in the forestry sector. Export promotion schemes and a range of investment incentives are important instruments of Malaysia’s industrial policy, aimed at promoting high value-added activities. The July 1998 measure to relax restrictions on foreign equity holdings in a manufacturing company will expire at end-2000;** the authorities intend to review the appropriateness of extending the deadline. lgThere is a nominal amount of contingent claim on reserves arising from guarantees provided on deposits of Malaysian banks abroad. “OMalaysia’s trade regime is characterized as “relatively open” and is rated at 4 on the Fund’s lo-point trade restrictiveness index. This reflects the rating of 1 (“open”) for trade barriers, and the rating of 2 (“moderate”) for nontariff barriers. *lTariffs on 55 products were reduced in 1999, and on a further 485 products in the 2000 budget (both in compliance with the WTO obligations and unilaterally). Under the AFTA, Malaysia had reduced duties to less than 5 percent on 90 percent of products and, of these, eliminated them on 60 percent of products, as of January 1,200O. However, Malaysia requested a deferment of tariff reductions for finished automobiles under the AFTA from 2003 to 2005 on the ground that the restructuring of the automobile industry, viewed as a critical national industry, had been delayed by the crisis. Export duties are levied on crude petroleum and palm oil, and export licensing is required on a few products. 22Except in specified sectors, foreign equity up to 100 percent was permitted without having to meet any export requirements previously in place.

Steps are also being taken to level the playing field for domestic and foreign providers of financial services. Foreign banks are now permitted to relocate branches, subject to BNM’s approval. The limit of 40 percent maximum lending by foreign banks to foreign-controlled companies is expected to be relaxed to 50 percent later this year. In the context of the General Agreements on Trade in Services (GATS), aggregate limits on foreign shareholdings of each stockbroking and financial leasing company will be raised from the current 30 percent to 49 percent, effective July 2000. The authorities also announced that foreign banks would be allowed to compete with domestic banks in the provision of Internet banking services in two years. 30. The authorities stated that further capital account liberalization would be reviewed only in the context of a long-term plan for fmancial system development. In the foreseeable future, they intend to retain the levy on the repatriation of profits from portfolio investment, arguing that the measure-while incurring relatively little cost- provided safeguard against speculative capital flows as it encouraged investors to focus only on fundamentals. 31. The authorities underscored their intention to keep the restrictions on the international use of the ringgit, maintaining that these have proved effective in ensuring stable financial conditions. The authorities acknowledged potential benefits of the improved access of nonresidents to ringgit funds at lower costs, and of a broader range of sophisticated instruments for risk management. Nevertheless, they considered that those benefits would be far outweighed by the risks of market instability that could arise from increased opportunity to speculate on the currency. They noted similar measures in place in a number of countries in the region. In this connection, the authorities reiterated their concern that the regulation of hedge funds was at present limited, and requested that the Fund take a proactive approach in promoting the enhancement of public disclosure by hedge funds. 32. The staff team agreed that the capital account should be liberalized in a well- sequenced and cautious manner. Nevertheless, it was the team’s view that the levy on the repatriation of profits from portfolio investment would not help protect the economy from potentially destabilizing short-term flows. Also, the levy imposes additional administrative costs on foreign investors and domestic banks, complicates the pricing of financial instruments and portfolios, and could raise the country risk premium. An early removal of the levy would signal an end to controls imposed as a temporary response to the crisis and improve the environment for foreign investors in general. The staff team concurred that the international use of the ringgit could bring about both risks and benefits. The benefits included the improved access of residents (as well as nonresidents) to more diversified financial instruments at lower costs, and greater liquidity in the foreign exchange markets. The team advised that the authorities keep the matter under review, in the context of regional development, with due consideration given to the adequacy of prudential regulation and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- surveillance, the exchange rate regime, and the general strategy of financial market development.23 Financial sector reform 33. A financial sector master plan, to be completed by mid-2000, will articulate the strategic direction of the financial sector for the next ten years. BNM’s vision is to develop a core of resilient and dynamic domestic banking institutions, able to compete in a dynamic environment of technological advances and increasingly sophisticated consumer demands. The plan focuses on the new structure of the banking system and optimal framework for its regulation and supervision.24 34. The merger program for domestically controlled financial institutions, scheduled to be concluded by end-2000, is a key component of this plan. Under the program, the 54 banking institutions currently in operation will be merged into ten banking groups, each consisting of a commercial bank, a merchant bank, and a finance company. The staff team noted that several issues in the merger process required close attention by BNM: the groups’ strategic plans; integration of systems, cultures, and product lines; and staffing. The team supported BNM’s requirement that each banking group employ an investment advisor to assist on management issues. BNM intends to closely monitor the performance of the banks’ management teams to ensure that any identified weaknesses would be addressed in a timely manner. 35. The authorities are taking steps toward the possible introduction of a deposit insurance scheme. BNM is actively studying its implications, and assessing the effectiveness of such schemes in other countries. In this context, BNM is considering establishing a deposit insurance fund to be managed by BNM, with a view to reducing moral hazard problems inherent in the current system of explicit government guarantee.25 However, a detailed proposal has yet to be prepared. 36. Improved economic conditions and the progress in the bank merger program would permit Danamodal and Danaharta to wind down operations earlier than planned (Box 7). Of the ten financial institutions having received capital injections from Danamodal, five made early repayments through retained earnings and recapitalization by shareholders; Danamodal expects to divest fully its investments and subordinated capital loans in the five remaining institutions upon completion of the bank merger program. The removal of NPLs ‘3See further details and analysis of recent capital account measures in Box 6 and Chapter IV, “Capital Controls During the Asian Crisis and After,” of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

Malaysia’s Recent Experience with Capital Controls’ In September 1, 1998, Malaysia imposed controls on portfolio outflows and restrictions on offshore -inggit activities, and pegged its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. These controls, which included a one-year lolding on repatriation of portfolio investments, were relaxed in February 1999, when the holding period was ,eplaced by a system of graduated exit levies. Further relaxation took place in September 1999 when this system was replaced with a flat 10 percent levy on repatriation of profits from portfolio investment. fhere is no evidence to suggest that capital controls were circumvented on a large scale or that a parallel )r nondeliverable forward market has emerged. Capital controls appeared to have had a relatively minor impact on restraining portfolio flows in 1999. ;or the year as a whole, the balance of payments recorded a small inflow ($0.3 billion). Some outflows occurred in February-March after the controls were eased ($0.3 billion) and in August-October when the one- fear lock-in period expired ($0.7 billion). Several reasons explain why the short-term impact on portfolio flows was limited. First, significant portfolio outflows Cumulative and Net Capital Flows: Jan. 1997-Mar. 2000 dready occurred du&g 1997198, when about 610.4 billion left the country. Second, IS00 he easing of controls allowed investors to .epahiate capital in February 1999, loo0 :hereby dampening the exodus of funds .ater in September. Third, the regional 500 sentiment improved in late spring-early nmuner, and credit rating agencies 0 upgraded Malaysia’s ratings.

However, many other factors influenced FDI flows, including regional developments and each country’s policies on foreign equity participation in domestic activities. Capital controls may also have affected financial markets. In 1999, foreign participation declined by 33 percentage points at the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange (KLOFFE), 13 percentage points at the Commodity and Monetary Exchange of Malaysia (COMMEX), and 2 percentage points at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).’ Nevertheless, KLSE increased by 39 percent in 1999, owing largely to the regional recovery, an easy monetary policy, and a one-time effect of Malaysia’s reinclusion in the MSCI indices toward the end of the year. Activity in the foreign exchange market declined by about 6 1 percent, although this may have been largely due to the pegging of the exchange rate. Activity in American Depository Receipt (ADR) markets also declined, albeit temporarily. Reflecting their subsequent easing, the controls bad only temporary adverse effects on Malaysia’s access to short-term financing and international capital markets, as suggested by the dynamics of the sovereign bond spreads and ratings. Restrictions on the international use of the ringgit eliminated the offshore ringgit market, contributing to an abatement of speculation against the currency. However, the restrictions are likely to have reduced risk management, investment, and financing opportunities for Malaysian residents and foreign investors. ‘For further details, see Chapter IV, “Capital Controls During the Asian Crisis and After,” of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper. ‘Both KLOFFE and COMMEX are relativelv thin markets. -- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - Box 7.. Malaysia: Summary of Financial and Corporate Sector Restructuring, 1998-99 Asset management and recovery Danaharta, a wholly government-owned entity, was established in June 1998. l Financial institutions with gross nonperforming loan (NPLs) ratios in excess of 10 percent are required to sell NPLs with a principal of RM 5 million or more to Danaharta. l Financial institutions seeking recapitalization from Danamodal are required to sell their NPLs to Danaharta as a precondition to recapitalization. l Assets (worth about RM 19 billion) were purchased at market values as determined by independent auditors, and averaged 56 percent of their face values. Financial institutions may avoid the immediate recognition of any loss that would normally result when an asset is sold below its book value as they are allowed up to five years to amortize the difference between the book value and the sale price. l Danaharta has RM 1.5 billion in capital provided by the Finance Ministry, and is authorized to issue up to RM 15 billion (face value) in zero-coupon bonds; so far, RM 7.5 billion such bonds have been issued. l Danaharta’s window for acquiring NPLs is now closed. The volume of assets acquired and under management is RM 45.5 billion (RM 36 billion from the banking system). Results from asset disposition have been favorable with Danaharta experiencing an 80.2 percent recovery rate of loan rights received. Bank recapitalization Danamodal was established in July 1998 with the main objective of recapitalizing the banking system. Capital injections from Danamodal will enable institutions to restore their capital adequacy ratios to 9 percent. l The initial set of banks chosen for capital injections was guided by Bank Negara Malaysia’s (BNM) watch list of weak institutions. l The “first loss” principle, by which original shareholders’ equity is written down, is applied strictly to all transactions. l Institutions requesting capital injections are to submit recapitalization plans and will be subject to monthly reporting of performance against a list of targets. l Danamodal exercises control over management by appointing at least two members to the Board of Directors; at least one is to be an executive director or chairman of the board. l To date, Danamodal has raised some RM 10.7 billion to fund its needs, comprising RM 3 billion in paid-up capital from BNM, and RM 7.7 billion raised through issuing zero-coupon bonds to financial institutions. l Ten institutions had received a total capital injection of RM 6.2 billion, initially in the form of tier two subordinated debt that per definitive agreement will be converted into equity, debt, or a hybrid capital instrument. l Five of the ten institutions receiving assistance have fully repaid. Danamodal’s excess funding has gone unneeded because undercapitalized institutions were able to restore capital on their own. Debt restructuring under the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee (CDRC) l Debt restructuring under the CDRC is for viable businesses and not those in receivership or liquidation. Total aggregate bank loans must be RM 50 million or more, with at least three lending institutions participating, and the creditor committees representing the interests of at least 75 percent of total debt of all creditors. (See also Box 10.) l Sixty-eight companies with debt of RM 36.5 billion have applied for workout arrangements under the CDRC. The majority are property, construction, and diversified holding companies. Of these, 13 applications with debt of RM 2.8 billion have been withdrawn or rejected; 9 applications with debt of RM 1.8 billion have been transferred to Danaharta; 20 applications with debt of RM 16.5 billion have been completed or resolved with assistance from Danaharta; and 26 applications with debt of RM 16.4 billion are outstanding.

Danaharta expects to wind down operations in 2005. 37. Substantial progress has been made in strengthening the prudential regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial system (Box 8). Risk management processes already in place include the new liquidity framework (to be fully operational by end-2000) and requirements for derivative products. The impending requirements for banking institutions to develop formalized risk management systems emphasize internal controls and corporate governance. BNM is also working out an early warning system (EWS) to provide leading indicators for supervisory attention. Consolidated supervision, which includes the holding company, will help contain overleveraging by financial groups, and become more important once the merger program is completed. To this end, the staff team emphasized the need for BNM to have a supervisory mandate over holding companies and affiliates that have interest in fmancial institutions. The supervisory framework has also been strengthened by the recent measure to allow home country supervisors, including BNM, to conduct onsite supervision of their country’s branches in the Labuan Offshore Financial Centre. 38. The authorities recently announced the plan to consolidate the stockbroking industry by end-20W2’ The objective of the consolidation is to form a group of well- capitalized universal brokers that can provide efftcient and cost-effective intermediation for investors, and are robust enough to withstand the pressures from risks inherent in the stockbroking business. Under the plan, the number of companies will be reduced from the present 63 to 15, in conjunction with reduced transaction commissions2* The staff team welcomed prospective increased foreign participation in the industry (paragraph 29), noting that benefits of experience gamed in other markets could help it prepare to face the challenges of globalization. 39. Efforts are continuing toward the development of a corporate bond market, which has now been placed under the responsibility of a high-level National Bond Marketing Committee established in June 1999. Recent initiatives included: the relaxation of the *6To allow for greater comparability across time and to other countries, the NPL level is calculated on a gross basis in this report.

Malaysia: Toward Improved Supervision and Regulation 4s part of the ongoing financial sector restructuring, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is undertaking ;everal initiatives to improve supervision and regulation. An optimal regulatory framework for bank supervision will be provided in the context of a financial sector master plan. The plan, which will provide a blueprint on a new structure of the banking system, aims to develop a more resilient, competitive, and dynamic banking system with best practices. Consolidated supervision will be introduced to provide a vehicle for BNM to assess the entire holding company from a safety and soundness perspective as well as an opportunity to prescribe limits on double leveraging and maintenance of an adequate level of capital. Risk-based supervision will be implemented to enhance BNM’s ability to better employ its examiners’ resources, provide a mechanism to measure risk on an individual company basis, and provide a mechanism to measure and stratify risk across the entire population of banks and banking companies.’ Formalized risk management practices are being strengthened so that BNM can supervise all institutions on a consistent basis. The practices provide a vehicle for each banking company to continually self-assess its own risk appetite, and a mechanism for self-supervision. The implementation of risk management guidelines for derivative products, liquidity framework, and soon-to-be implemented credit risk management practices are all steps that will assist in moving the industry to formal risk management programs. It will be important to closely monitor the implementation processes through a quality control process to ensure that actual practices are implemented. Evaluation of bank management becomes more critical as Malaysia moves forward from the crisis. The consolidation of the industry into ten groups would create larger and more complicated banking companies which would require even closer monitoring of the performance of the senior management teams in the new banks. Area for additional work’ . Additional risk management guidelines could be developed for each area of risk. This would ensure that each banking company has the basic framework for each risk area and becomes familiar with factors that will be considered in regulatory evaluation, e.g., interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, transaction risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, price risk, or others deemed by BNM to be significant to the management of risk. ‘Prior to the crisis, BNM had begun to introduce risk-based supervision to its staff and to the banks. As the crisis developed and worsened, resources were reallocated to the evaluation of credit, and the implementation of the program was postponed. ‘Details were discussed with BNM staff during the workshop organized by the Fund’s Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department in Kuala Lumpur during February 17-l 8,2000, as well as during the Article IV consultation mission.

The government has announced that the Malaysian Government Securities will be issued on a more’regular and transparent basis to provide a benchmark yield curve; to that end, an auction calendar has been announced. Corporate sector reform 40. Recent improvements in corporate performance can be attributed to the strong external demand, increasing asset prices, low interest rates, and debt restructuring. Corporate profitability improved in 1999 over the losses in 1998, and corporate financial ratios indicate higher returns on assets and a more stable level of corporate leverage; however, corporate liquidity worsened as measured by the ratio of current assets to current liabilities (Box 9).29 The staff team agreed with the authorities’ view that the corporate sector would be susceptible to changes in external circumstances and emphasized the importance of pushing ahead with corporate reform, including through continued debt restructuring under the CDRC and operational restructuring through Danaharta, to ensure that any weaknesses did not lie dormant until tested under future stress. 41. Corporate debt restructuring has been accompanied by the restructuring of corporate operations and management (Box 10). Debt restructuring has taken a number of forms: the sale of NPLs to Danaharta; voluntary out-of-court restructuring under the CDRC; and restructuring or liquidation through the courts. Operational restructuring has proceeded, inter alia, through the asset rehabilitation under Danaharta, the elimination of noncore businesses as part of CDRC-coordinated agreements, and debt restructuring under Section 176 of the Companies Act. Significant steps have been taken toward implementing the recommendations in the Finance Committee’s Report on Corporate Governance, including: the updating of rules and regulations to keep in line with international best practices; amendments to the listing requirements of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (including stricter reporting requirements and policy on suspension of trading); and the development of accreditation programs for existing directors of listed companies. Social issues 42. The impact of the crisis on vulnerable groups appears to have been relatively contained. Foreign workers played an important role in insulating the domestic workforce from the adverse effects of the crisis. Specific measures, such as allowances for the hardcore poor and microcredit schemes, were taken to alleviate the plight of the remaining groups. As Malaysia reduces reliance on the foreign unskilled labor over the medium term (Box 1 l), the cushion they provide will be eroded. In this connection, the staff team noted that a well- defined safety net (paragraph 18) could address the needs of a more affluent society over the %ee further analysis in Chapter VI, “Corporate Performance and Reform,” of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

Malaysia: Corporate Sector Performance In Malaysia, there are indications that corporate performance has benefited from the strong economic recovery and low interest rates. The level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) fell to around 17 percent of total bank loans by end-February 2000, compared with 19 percent at end-1998. Financial ratios indicate (subject to the caveat of a relatively small number of financial accounts available for 1999) that: corporate profitability in 1999 increased significantly after the losses in 1998 (see net profitability, RSF and ROA); returns on investment have improved (see EY and NDY); the level of leverage (DER) has stabilized; but the measure of liquidity (see CR) has continued to worsen.

In all the Asian crisis countries, except for Indonesia, net profit margins have recovered and the share of distressed corporates has declined. Malaysian corporates appeared to have been less vulnerable prior to the crisis according to these two measures and in terms of their relatively low foreign debt and deeper development of the domestic capital market. However, the indicators of profitability and corporate stress indicate that, coming out of the crisis, Malaysian corporates are currently not performing any better than the other crisis countries. The lack of a differentially better post-crisis performance, given the more favorable starting conditions, may reflect the more gradual pickup in domestic demand in Malaysia than in the other countries. Also, as Malaysia has a significantly larger market capitalization relative to GDP, the stock market declines during the crisis are likely to have resulted in a larger wealth loss and increase in leverage, thus enhancing corporate stress. Corporate performance in Malaysia and the region is still likely to be highly sensitive to external factors (particularly developments in the United States and Japan) and domestic factors (including the stance of macroeconomic policies).

Malaysia: Progress with Corporate Sector Reform Debt restructuring in Malaysia has taken a number of forms. The Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee (CDRC) provides a platform-based on London rules- for voluntary out-of-court corporate debt restructuring and deals with loan restructuring agreements involving more than RM 50 million and more than three creditors. The CDRC expects to complete remaining restructuring agreements and to wind down operations by the end of 2000. Restructuring is also occurring out-of-court and out of the formal CDRC (or Danaharta) framework, which supplements government efforts and has the advantage of not adding to the fiscal burden. As of end-March 2000, more than 192 companies had filed for court protection under Section 176 of the Companies Act. Of these, 18 percent of the applications relate to the first quarter of 2000, and thus the rate of applications does not appear to be slowing. Firms in the sector described as “Finance, Insurance, Property, or Trading” have dominated, representing nearly 40 percent of each year’s (and of the total) applications. Petitions to liquidate companies exceed 1,000, and there has also been an increase in mergers and acquisitions. Of the Asian crisis countries, Korea and Malaysia have made the most progress in restructuring debt (mainly out-of-court). By August 1999, Malaysia and Korea had completed restructuring of around one-third of the debt registered under the respective programs. In-court restructuring through formal bankruptcy procedures accounted for a small proportion of total restructured debt: the process of going through the courts can be slow and is constrained by the capacity of the courts; and the debt restructuring agencies have tended to focus on cases with huger corporate debt involved (in the case of CDRC, it handles only corporates with debts greater than RM 50 million and more than three creditors).

I/ This ligure for Korea only refers to restructuring in the 64 largest chaebol; other restructuring has taken place among small and medium-sized enterprises. Operational restructuring in Malaysian corporates has proceeded partly through the resolution by Danaharta of its acquired NPLs (through rehabilitation of businesses, liquidation, and foreclosure of collateral) and the elimination of noncore businesses as part of CDRC-coordinated debt restructuring agreements. Danaharta has appointed special administrators to oversee management of more than 50 companies under its control to assist in stabilizing and restructuring the companies. It is too early to gauge the extent and success of any operational restructuring that has accompanied debt restructuring. It is also difficult to untangle the improvements in performance relating to operational restructuring from those relating to external factors (such as economic recovery). Significant progress has been made in implementing the recommendations in the Finance Committee’s Report on Corporate Governance. The report was made public in March 1999 and the Finance Committee established an implementation project team (consisting of the Ministry of Finance, the Securities Commission, the Registry of Companies, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), the Federation of Public Limited Companies, Bank Negara Malaysia, and Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing and Automated Quotation) was established. Implementation of the recommendations is taking the form of: updating of laws, regulations and rules to keep in line with international best practices; amendments to the listing requirements of the KLSE; and development of accreditation programs for existing directors of listed companies. Malaysia also led the APEC Finance Ministers’ initiative on corporate governance; in May a report on Strengthening Corporate Governance in the APEC Region was submitted to the APEC Finance Ministers.

Developments in the Malaysian Labor Market The decline in employment in 1998 of 2.5 percent was much less than the decline in output of 7.5 percent, as the displacement of foreign workers bore the brunt of the ad.justment. However, there was also labor hoarding where alternatives to retrenchment were adopted, Malayaa: Output and Employment. 1995-W including pay-cuts, lay-offs, and part-time and flexi-time (Percent Change) I2 practices. During the crisis, labor shedding in publicly quoted companies in Malaysia was only around 7 percent s - compared with more than a quarter in Korea and 12 percent in Thailand. In 1999, employment in Malaysia increased by 4 2.1 percent while the labor force increased by around 2 per- cent. Unemployment thus fell from 3.2 percent in 1998 to O 3 percent in 1999, which is below the authorities’ estimates -GDP of the full employment rate of 4 percent. -‘- ....... LaborForcc -Employment Total vacancies increased significantly in 1999 and early -8 i I 2000, mainly in the agricultural and manufacturing I995 1996 1997 I998 1999 sectors. Although the number of vacancies may understate the true number of jobs available (as firms are not obliged to report job vacancies to the Manpower Department), changes in the vacancies are a usehI indicator of the demand for labor. The total number of vacancies increased by 45 percent in 1999, with agriculture accounting for 26 percent of the increase and manufacturing accounting for 19 percent (although over 60 percent of the total vacancies were in the manufacturing sector). The number of vacancies in agriculture increased markedly from 5,000 to 24,000 (reflecting the decline in the number of foreign workers). The number of retrenched workers shrunk significantly, from a peak in July 1998 of over 12,000, to less than 2,000 in March this year. While new vacancies have been significantly higher than retrenchments since the beginning of 1999 and growth has picked up, there has been little wage pressure. Remaining excess capacity in various sectors of the economy, in particular the hoarded labor and the stock of previously retrenched labor, may explain why wage increases were moderate in 1999. A Malaysian Employers Federation survey indicated that private sector wage increases slowed further to 5.9 percent in 1999, from 6.2 percent in 1998 and 8.9 percent in 1999. Other factors suggested to explain the lack of wage pressure include: good labor relations; the collective agreement system (where wage increases are negotiated on a three-yearly basis); price controls on basic foodstuffs; and a willingness of workers to defer pay increases until the recovery becomes entrenched. While there have been discussions of a minimum wage, it is unlikely to be adopted in the near future. The official number of foreign workers fell significantly from 1.2 million in 1997 to 777,284 in 1998 and 763,704 in 1999. There still exists a demand for foreign workers: in 1999, over 10,000 expatriate posts were approved and over 122,000 posts approved for workers in plantations, construction, manufacturing and selected services. The number of new approvals, however, is lower than those displaced during the crisis (as reflected in the increase in reported vacancies in the agricultural sector). The actual number of foreign workers is thought to be much higher than the official figure, with the upper range of estimates suggesting around two million (compared to a total labor force of around nine million). Government policy with respect to foreign workers has been flexible; these workers are essential in various sectors, particularly expatriate “knowledge” workers which will be key to the transition to the K-economy (see Box 2). However, there is an active policy to reduce reliance on low-skilled foreign workers and more generally to reduce the relative size of the unskilled force to encourage the reallocation of labor and resources to more productive sectors. The government has introduced various measures aimed at increasing mobility and training. Emerging skills imbalances and the objective of increasing productivity have highlighted the need to increase training and (both geographic and sectoral) mobility. In the immediate future, employment in the financial sector will be displaced by the bank and broker mergers, while in the medium term, the transition to the K-economy will affect more fundamental changes in the structure of the economy and employment. Government initiatives include: a program organized by the Ministry of Human Resources to increase labor mobility from surplus to deficit areas; the promotion of productivity-linked wages; and various fiscal initiatives provided in the 2000 budget (such as an allocation of RM 14.1 billion to finance the development of quality infrastructure for education programs and RM 1.2 billion to build and equip facilities in existing training institutions). Further initiatives may be announced as part of the K-economy master plan currently being prepared. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- longer term. The substitution of price controls with cash compensation or payments to specific target groups would also provide a more efficient means of subsidy. Statistical issues 43. The overall quality of Malaysia’s macroeconomic statistics has improved in recent years, but deficiencies remain in the quality of national accounts, prices, and balance of payments data. To the staff team’s suggestion that coordination be strengthened among the main producers of official statistics, the authorities noted that they planned to present the quarterly balance of payments data based on the fiflh edition of the Balance @Payments Manual in 2000, including an annual international investment position statement. Work was also under way to improve external debt statistics in line with recommendations of the recent Statistics Department (STA) mission. m. STAFF &‘PRAISAL 44. The Malaysian economy is recovering strongly in the context of macroeconomic stability. Better economic performance has boosted confidence and helped improve banking and corporate balance sheets. However, the private sector remains cautious and, together with excess capacity, investment remains weak. Against this background, the authorities’ policy priorities have shifted from crisis management to adjustments that Malaysia would need to make post-crisis-and in a changing global environment-to achieve high and sustainable growth and reduce its exposure to market instability. In this connection, the authorities’ long-term vision is to transform Malaysia into a K-economy that concentrates on high-skill sectors. 45. A key issue in the short run is how to foster further recovery, and achieve full employment of productive capacities while keeping inflation firmly under control. The staff are of the view that the fiscal stimulus planned under the 2000 budget is broadly appropriate. However, in light of the uncertainties surrounding the size of the output gap and the speed with which it will close, implementation of the budget will have to be monitored closely, so that the stimulus may be withdrawn as needed. In view of the limited scope for adjusting the operational balance, this requires early identification of noncore expenditures that have not commenced and can be postponed at short notice. 46. More generally, greater flexibility in the budgetary process would promote a more effective use of fiscal policy as a countercyclical tool. The staff support the change in the income tax assessment year, which will provide some built-in stabilizers, and the rationalization of the tax structure contained in the budget. Looking ahead, a shift to a more buoyant indirect tax regime, such as a VAT, is encouraged. The staff advise that the horizon for the budget formulation, including the application of the various rules designed to preserve fiscal discipline, be extended to cover the course of a business cycle. The staff also suggest that, over the long run, unemployment and social security benefits be considered; beyond their primary objective of providing social safety nets, they also act as automatic stabilizers. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- 47. The lack of full transparency in the operations of privatized infrastructure projects complicates fiscal management. Explicit recognition of the role of these projects (and other off-budget activities) in providing fiscal stimulus would facilitate demand management, and the identification of potential claims on the government arising from the operations would help improve public debt management. The staff thus welcome the plan to identify these potential liabilities more comprehensively. Based on partial information regarding these projects, together with the authorities’ plan to begin strengthening the fiscal position next year, the staff consider the level of public debt to be manageable. 48. Accommodative monetary policy in the current environment is appropriate to shore up domestic demand, but less rigidity in the interest rate structure would sharpen the efficacy of the policy. The staff support the authorities’ intention to remove the ceiling on interest rates in the longer term in conjunction with the development of risk-based supervision. In the interim, the staff recommend that the ceiling be raised so that lending to higher-risk, but productive, activities are not constrained; that the BNM intervention rate-which sets the BLR-be reflective of the market-determined Klibor; and that deposit rates more freely reflect market conditions. 49. The staff are of the view that Malaysia would benefit from an early move-while being in a position of strength-to a more flexible exchange regime. The ringgit appears to be significantly undervalued compared with its longer-term equilibrium, and the current peg is not compatible with maintaining low inflation over that timeframe. The staff are concerned that it would be increasingly difficult for BNM to keep up sterilized intervention-in order to dampen inflationary pressures-as external surpluses continue and the output gap narrows. Furthermore, persistent undervaluation of the exchange rate could lead to inefficient resource allocation, attract speculative capital inflows, and could have negative spillover effects on other countries. 50. Financial performance of the banking and corporate sectors has improved, attributable to both better economic conditions and restructuring efforts. In this setting, it is appropriate for Danamodal and the CDRC to plan early exits, and for Danaharta to shift its focus from NRL purchases to management of acquired assets, requiring debtor entities to restructure or liquidate as warranted. The staff would caution that improved financial performance should not allow operational restructuring of corporates to lose momentum, and that government support should be extended to privatized infrastructure projects only as a last resort and in a transparent manner. 51. The financial master plan, which aims at bringing about a resilient banking system better able to compete in a global market place, appears to be on the right track. The bank consolidation program is proceeding at a fast pace; and BNM will need to monitor closely the performance of each bank’s management team to ensure that any identified weaknesses are addressed in a timely manner. At the same time, efforts should continue to ensure that the merger process is completed in a transparent and market-based manner. The staff endorse the authorities’ priority placed on strengthening the prudential regulation and surveillance framework, and welcome rapid progress in this area. Consolidated supervision, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - risk-based supervision, and enhanced supervision of offshore banks are important tools to reinforce the system’s management of risks, including those from cross-border transactions. 52. The staff support efforts to raise standards of corporate governance and disclosure requirements consistent with best practices, and to develop the domestic bond market. A more developed bond market is expected to achieve a more diversified corporate debt profile in terms of maturities and sources; and the strategy toward a self- regulating market is also appropriate in the framework of full disclosure and integrated supervision. Overall, these efforts are expected to enhance corporate governance and lessen corporate vulnerabili ties. 53. Recent trade liberalization and plans to level the playing field for domestic and foreign providers of financial services are welcome. The latest round of tariff reductions went beyond Malaysia’s commitments under the AFTA and WTO, and brought the average tariff rate to the level comparable with other countries in the region. The stafT considers a strengthening of the stockbroking industry to be desirable, and is encouraged by the plan to permit increased foreign participation. 54. Malaysia’s external vulnerability indicators do not raise concern. Official reserves are more than adequate to cover Malaysia’s modest short-term debt, and their management is fully in line with international best practices. The strengthened prudential framework, once in place, is expected to help safeguard Malaysia from adverse effects of market volatility, and should facilitate gradual liberalization of remaining capital controls. The staff encourage early removal of the levy on profit repatriation of portfolio capital. Malaysia should also continue to review the implications for financial market development of the policy to restrict the international use of the ringgit. 55. The overall quality of Malaysia’s economic statistics is good, and has improved in recent years. The staff welcome the upgrading of national income accounts data over the past year, the recent publication under the SDDS of data on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity, and progress envisaged in the compilation of the balance of payments and external debt data. Malaysia is encouraged to enhance further the quality of the national income accounts and price statistics, and to compile and publish information on the government off-budget activities and contingent liabilities. 56. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Malaysia be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

A number of additional measures were introduced aimed at preventing heavy capital outflows by residents and nonresidents: l Approval requirement for nonresidents to convert the ringgit held in external accounts into foreign currency, except for purchases of ringgit assets, conversion of profits, dividends, interest, and other permitted purposes (no such restrictions previously); there is also no restriction on conversions of ringgit funds in external accounts of nonresidents with work permits, embassies, high commissions, central banks, international organizations, and missions of foreign countries in Malaysia. l A 12-month waiting period for nonresidents to convert ringgit proceeds from the sale of Malaysian securities held in external accounts (excluding FDI flows, repatriation of interest, dividends, fees, commissions, and rental income from portfolio investment) (no such restrictions previously). l A prior approval requirement beyond a certain limit for all residents to invest abroad in any form (previously applied only to corporate residents with domestic borrowing). l A specific limit on exports of foreign currency by residents and up to the amount brought into Malaysia for nonresidents (previously, no restriction on export of foreign currency on person or in baggage of a traveler; export by other means required approval regardless of the amount). Commercial banks and finance companies were allowed to extend loans to nonresidents for the purpose of purchasing residential, commercial or industrial property, or office space in Malaysia for the period from December 12, 1998 to January 12, 1999, subject to certain conditions.

No exit levy is imposed on profits during the 1 a-month holding period; thereafter a 10 percent exit levy is imposed on profits arising from dividends and interest earned. l A graduated exit levy on the repatriation of the profits from investments made after February 15,1999 in shares, bonds, and other financial instruments, except property investments, with the levy decreasing in the duration of investment (the levy is 30 percent if repatriated in less than 12 months after the profit is realized and IO percent if repatriated after 12 months).

This growth rate, which is consistent with lower private investment, is below the average growth rate observed before the crisis. Inflation rate is expected to remain around 34 percent. Net export demand, which was the main engine for growth in 1999, is expected to be replaced gradually by consumption and then investment. With favorable prospects in the region and regained confidence, the private sector is expected to reduce its precautionary savings, and this would help sustain a higher consumption-to-GDP ratio. After adjusting for over-investment in the past, private investment is expected to pick up as excess capacity is reduced. Although the investment-to-GDP ratio in the medium term is projected to be well below the pre-crisis level, the quality of investment is expected to improve in light of the ongoing restructuring of the financial and the corporate sector, as well as the authorities’ new emphasis toward the K-economy. The current account is projected to decline as growth in imports would keep pace with increasing domestic demand, which will be accompanied by an appreciation of the real exchange rate. Underlying policy assumptions . Rapid fiscal consolidation will take place after 2000 and, over the medium term, the fiscal balance will move to a small surplus. The consolidation will come mainly from induced capital expenditure. . Monetary policy will be geared toward maintaining inflation below 4 percent. It is assumed that the exchange rate will be adjusted as necessary to correct for any significant misalignments.’ l Further progress in financial and corporate sector reform is assumed. . Initiatives under the K-economy are expected to speed up technological changes and, thereby, contribute positively to productivity. Exogenous risks Risks to the medium-term outlook, which are likely to be region wide, pertain to: . A possible weakening in demand by Malaysia’s trading partners, especially from the United States without a compensating increase in demand from Japan; ‘The scenario assumes real appreciation of 10 percent over five years for illustrative purposes. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-51- ANNEX 1 = Terms-of-trade shocks relating particularly to electronics; . Swings in world equity markets, which may affect Malaysia through lower export demand or capital inflows, including FDI. Alternative scenario For illustrative purposes, the alternative scenario assumes a sharp drop in US. demand. Policy assumptions are maintained to illustrate only the effect on the economy of a lower demand for Malaysia’s exports, given its heavy dependence on the U.S. economy. Malaysia’s growth rate of manufactured exports (in U.S. dollar terms) is assumed to be reduced by 2 percentage points during 200 l-02 relative to the baseline scenario, and to recover gradually as the exports find alternative destinations. Under this scenario, real GDP growth will be lower, consistent with a slower recovery of private investment which, in turn, reflects the smaller export growth. Consumption demand is also expected to be somewhat lower, at least initially, through wealth effects. The external current account will adjust more gradually than in the baseline scenario, owing to weaker domestic demand. Capital inflows, reflecting weaker confidence in the Malaysian economy, will also be lower. As a result, the increase in reserves will be smaller. Inflation will remain broadly similar, although slower economic activity will tend to exert less pressure on wages and prices.

Malaysia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). National accounts: As a result of the Fund’s Statistics Department’s (STA) technical assistance project, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) has developed good quarterly National Accounts Statistics that meet the SDDS requirements. Currently, DOSM compiles and publishes annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure at current and constant 1987 prices, and annual estimates for gross disposable income, saving and net lending for the economy based on the 2968 SAL4. The quarterly data are released within 2-3 months of the reference quarter. In addition, DOSM has developed experimental institutional sector income and outlay accounts in accordance with the I993 SNA. The 1993 SAU institutional sector accounts project was undertaken with UNDP funding, and with technical support from UNSD. There are significant numerical differences in the estimates for key aggregates, particularly for GDP, Final Consumption Expenditures (Government, Household, NPISH, and Gross Capital Formation) common to both the 1968 SNA-based GDP compilation system and the 1993 WA-based institutional sector accounts system. For that reason, the institutional sector accounts data have not been officially released, and the report from the project has been given a limited circulation. Prices: The CPI and the PPI are available on a timely and comprehensive basis. As part of the PPI program, an import price index is compiled,. but not an export price index. STA has encouraged DOSM to start developing an export price index and has provided some assistance in this respect. Problems remain in domestic price statistics that do not properly reflect the changes in the prices of exported and imported products following the large exchange rate fluctuations of the last two years. Labor market statistics: Data on labor force, employment, unemployment, and wages/earnings are disseminated quarterly. Monetary statistics: Over the past year, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and STA have made a joint effort to bring Malaysia’s monetary statistics reported to the Fund into conformity with the Fund’s new reporting format. Publication according to the new format began with the April 1999 issue of IFS. Coverage of the monetary data has recently extended to Islamic banks, but there remains a need to expand the coverage of the “Other Depository Corporations Survey” to include saving and development institutions as well. However, there appears to be a need for harmonizing the weekly (RDALl) and monthly (RDAL2) reporting system. A follow-up money and banking statistics mission has been scheduled for FY2001.

The December 1999 mission also recommended that, given the decision of the Inter-Agency Planning Group to delay publication of the BOP presentation in the BPA45 format until a full year’s data are available in the new format (targeted for June 2000) an attempt should be made in the interim to publish quarterly data in the BPM4 format. This recommendation was ’ implemented in January 2000, although the release of quarterly data still lags about six months after the end of the reference quarter. l Fiscal accounts: Progress has been made in improving the consolidation of accounts across various levels of government. An effort has been made to broaden the coverage of major nonfinancial public enterprises (NFPEs). Existing major weaknesses pertain to the quantity of data on NFPEs and accounting of quasi-fiscal and off-budget operations. As recommended by the multisector STA mission in 1997, increased efforts are necessary to obtain more detailed data on their domestic and foreign financing by type of debt instrument and debt holder. In addition, a joint effort is necessary from the Economic Planning Unit (EPU), Treasury, and BNM to compile the data on quasi-fiscal and off- budget operations, improve the reliability of the data, and consolidate them into the fiscal accounts of the public sector.

This middle rate is quoted by the central bank, with the maximum spread between the buying and selling rate fixed at 2 percent for the U.S. dollar, the deutsche mark, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Hong Kong dollar, and the Singapore dollar. The spread is 3 percent for all other currencies. Malaysia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4. Malaysia maintains bilateral payments arrangements with 24 countries. As of 1998, 19 of these arrangements potentially gave rise to exchange restrictions which, since these were set up before July 1994, had been temporarily exempted pursuant to Decision No. 10749-(94/67). The authorities have since indicated that the restrictive features of these arrangements have been eliminated. On the capital account, foreign borrowing above RM 5 million is subject to approval, and foreign ownership of Malaysian equity is limited in some sectors (notably banking). Capital control measures imposed in early 1994 have all been lifted, with the exception of reserve requirements on foreign liabilities of banks, which is viewed as leveling the playing field with sources of domestic funding.

The restrictions were relaxed in steps in February and September, 1999: repatriation of portfolio capital is now permitted, but capital gains therefrom are subject to a 10 percent exit levy; investments in property and MESDAQ (stock exchange which lists growth and technology shares) are exempt from the levy. (ii) Ringgit funds abroad were required to be repatriated by end-September 1998, following which it was prohibited to bring in more than RM 1,000 per person per trip. The import and export of ringgit by travelers, both resident and nonresident, are restricted, also to that amount; in February 1999, the ceiling allowed for the import and export of ringgit was raised to RM 10,000 for border trade with Thailand. (iii) Extension of ringgit credit facilities to nonresident correspondent banks and stockbroking companies is prohibited; conversely, residents can no longer obtain credit facilities in ringgit from nonresidents. (iv) All export and import settlements must be made in foreign currency. (9 Trading in Malaysian shares on Singapore’s Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) were de facto prohibited as a result of strict enforcement of the existing law requiring Malaysian shares to be registered in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange prior to trade. The issue of the blocked CLOB securities has now been resolved, and the securities are to be gradually released. These restrictions (including the recent modifications) do not contravene Malaysia’s obligations under Article VIII, but their implementation will need to be kept under review. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation Malaysia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation took place during April 20-May 4,1999.

As a first step in this process, the Bank fielded a mission in February/March 1998 to begin preparation of a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), which focused on: the social impact of the recent economic turmoil and the adequacy of the social safety net; the role of contingent government liabilities in infrastructure development; competition policy and the financial viability of the corporate sector in light of recent market developments; and past and future trends in saving, investment, and consumption. The CEM was subsequently trans- formed into a Structural Policy Review (SPR) paper, with an emphasis on crisis-related and medium-term constraints to development (see below). In addition, the World Bank provided technical input into the financial sector strategy that was elaborated by an MAE mission in February 1998. The World Bank also provided a fast-disbursing Economic Recovery and Social Sector Loan of $300 million in June 1998; Fund staff participated in the preparation of the loan. In February 1999, the World Bank completed its SPR and shared it with the government. The SPR focused on: social safety nets; financial and corporate sector restructuring; macro- economic policies for growth; and public sector management. The SPR is a new vehicle in World Bank relations with counties, and Malaysia is a pilot case. The SPR also provides a basis for a performance monetary framework. Moreover, the Bank’s Board of Directors discussed a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) paper on March 30, 1999. The CAS proposed a program of lending and nonlending services designed to mitigate the social consequences of the regional economic crisis and support medium-term social development, and to restore short-term growth and medium-term competitiveness. In conjunction with the CAS, the Bank’s Board approved the following projects on the same date: (i) Social Sector Support Project ($60 million); (ii) Education Sector Support Project ($244 million); and (iii) Year 2000 Technical Assistance Project ($100 million). Given the strength of the recovery, however, it is unlikely that the government will draw against the Social Sector Support Project loan. The World Bank has completed a Public Expenditure Review (PER) which has been reviewed by the government, and is being distributed under grey cover. The PER: (i) assesses the government’s performance in allocating and using public funds during the crisis; (ii) addresses selective fiscal challenges in the social sectors and infrastructure facing Malaysia over the medium term; and (iii) assesses public expenditure management.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Malaysia On July 24, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Malaysia.’ Background The Malaysian economy has recovered from the sharp output decline experienced in 1998. Real GDP growth, led by exports, recorded 5% percent in 1999 and has maintained its momentum so far this year. The manufacturing sector expanded by over 13 percent in 1999, as the production of electronics was boosted by buoyant exports. There are indications that output expansion is becoming more broad-based, including in the services sector. However, private investment remains subdued, and consumption has only recently shown signs of recovery. There are no apparent wage pressures reflecting the overall excess capacity, notwithstanding the fact that capacity utilization in several industries has risen to near pre-crisis levels, and inflation remains below 2 percent (year-on-year). The recovery has been supported by a fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policy. The federal government deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 1999 provided a fiscal impulse estimated at nearly 4 percent of GDP and helped offset the decline in private demand. On the monetary side, the 3-month interbank market rate (Klibor) declined from 9 percent in 1998 to 4 percent in 1999 (year average). However, the transmission of lower interbank rates to bank lending rates has been slow. Net credit growth (adjusted for nonperforming loans (NPLs) sold to Danaharta, the asset management agency) was weak, although it did not appear to have constrained the I Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Market confidence is cautiously growing in response to the recovery and gradual easing of capital controls. Although the commercial banks and the private sector reduced their foreign liabilities in response to the relatively low domestic interest rates in 1999, thereby weakening the capital account, portfolio inflows have resumed since early 2000, aided by the upgrading of Malaysia’s ratings and the reinclusion of Malaysia in the Morgan Stanley Capital Index at end- May. Partly aided by these developments but also on account of domestic retail investors, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Composite Index recovered by 39 percent during 1999, and rose further by 10 percent by end-May this year while most neighboring countries’ indices fell. Performance of the banking and corporate sectors has improved as evidenced by indicators such as the banking system’s level of NPLs, risk-weighted capital ratio, and banking and corporate profits. Consequently, Danamodal (the bank capitalization agency) required considerably less funding than originally envisaged, and Danaharta has ceased purchasing assets and is now focusing on the workout phase of managing the acquired assets. Restructuring of the nonbank sector has proceeded including in the context of debt restructuring under the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee.
