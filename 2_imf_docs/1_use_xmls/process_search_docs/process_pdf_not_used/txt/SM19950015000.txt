Loser and Jack Boorman June 20, 1995 I. Introduction A staff team visited Managua during March 27-April 6, 1995 to hold discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and assess performance under the program supported by the first annual ESAF arrangement. L/ The staff met with the Minister of the Presidency, who is the head of the Cabinet, the Ministers of Finance and of External Cooperation, the President of the Central Bank, other senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector. On June 24, 1994 the Executive Board concluded the 1994 Article IV consultation and approved a three-year ESAF arrangement in the amount of SDR 120.12 million (125 percent of quota) and the first annual arrangement (SDR 40.04 million), (EBS/94/116). 2/ Executive Directors welcomed the authorities' renewed efforts at macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform. They noted that fiscal policy was central to the stabilization effort, and encouraged the authorities to keep firm control over current outlays and to proceed with the planned public employment reduction. In the structural area, Directors stressed the importance of progress on property rights, privatization, labor market reform, and restructuring of the state-owned banks. A mid-term review under the first annual ESAF arrangement originally was scheduled for end-February 1995, but could not be completed because of deviations from program policies. The first annual arrangement will expire on June 23, 1995. u The staff comprised Messrs. Cardemil (Head), Barajas, Bevilaqua, Caetano-Filho, Terrones (all-WHD), and Ross (PDR), and was assisted by Mr. Gil-Diaz, the Fund's Resident Representative in Managua. 2/ Nicaragua has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Relations with the Fund and the World Bank are described in Appendices II and III, respectively.

The staff is monitoring closely new developments and a mission is expected to visit Managua in August/September 1995 for a new assessment of program performance and discussions on the conditions to resume support under the ESAF. II. Background and Developments Under the Program 1. Background Nicaragua's economy deteriorated significantly in the second half of the 1980's because of inappropriate policies and the civil war; in this period, the country became one of the poorest and most indebted of the Western Hemisphere. In 1.990-92 substantial progress was made in macro- economic stabilization and in the transformation to a market based economy, but the adjustment and reform process slowed in 1993, and the economy continued to stagnate. In early 1994, the Government adopted a compre- hensive medium term program, supported by the ESAF arrangement, aimed at setting the stage for growth and advancing toward external viability. The program focused on raising public sec;:or savings and deepening structural reforms. 2. Developments under the program Economic performance improved in 1994 as activity picked up, inflation declined, and international reserves rose by more than programmed. However, the public finances were weaker than envisaged and structural reforms proceeded at a slower pace than planned. In the first four months of 1995, the public finances improved but there was a relaxation of credit policy and international reserves fell substantially. Real GDP grew by 3.i! percent in 11994, despite a severe drought during July-September, reflecting a recovery in agriculture and construction. This is the first year of significant growth in a decade and compares with an increase of 2 percent assumed in the program. Domestic investment rose strongly and unemployment, which had risen steadily since the late 198Os, fell slightly to about 20 percent. The 12-month rate of inflation fell from 20 percent at the end of 1993 to 12.4 percent at the end of 1994 (compared with 10 percent in the program) and to 11.7 percent in the first four months of 1995. Following a satisfactory performance in the first half ofl 1994, the public finances deteriorated in the second half, in part because of the effects of the drought. The operating position of the state-owned power company (ENEL, formerly INE) weakened because of power cuts and the switch from hydro to more expensive thermal generation. In addition, government current outlays rose by more than programmed because of slow progress in the employment reduction program and higher transfers. Savings of the nonfi- nancial public sector fell from 3.3 percent of GDP in 1993 to 2.9 percent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - in 1994, compared with an increase to 5.1 percent of GDP envisaged in the program. Moreover, public investment was higher than anticipated while project-related foreign aid fell short of the program assumptions. I/ As a result, the December 1994 program ceilings on government current expend- iture and on the net domestic financing of the combined public sector were exceeded (Table 1). In early 1995 the authorities adopted some corrective measures, includ- ing a minimum tax on coffee exports, cuts in government spending for goods, services and transfers, and the elimination of certain extraordinary outlays incurred in 1994. The performance of the Central Government improved in the first quarter of 1995, as higher than programmed current outlays were more than offset by a strong increase in tax revenues, reflecting largely the strength of the economy and improved tax and customs administration (the coffee tax is expected to yield only about 0.3 percent of GDP in 1995). This improvement was partially offset by a lower than programmed operating surplus of the power company, but the target for the domestic financing of the public sector was met at the end of March. Credit policv was in line with the program in 1994 as the net domestic assets of the Central Bank declined and net international reserves rose by US$69 million, compared with a target of US$31 million. A higher than programmed increase in net central bank credit to the public sector was more than offset by a reduction in the net credit to commercial banks and lower central bank losses. Commercial banks' reserve deposits at the Central Bank rose faster than programmed reflecting a strong increase in private inflows from abroad and private sector deposits (broad money rose much faster than projected in the program). In the first quarter of 1995 there was a sharp acceleration in credit expansion by the state-owned banks that was financed by a large drawdown of their deposits at the Central Bank. Private commercial banks' credit also rose rapidly while the growth of broad money slowed somewhat. In this ' period, the benchmark on the expansion of net domestic assets was exceeded, and net international reserves fell by US$40 million, although at the end of March they were just above the program floor because of the overperformance in 1994. In April net reserves declined further by US$14 million, and gross reserves fell to the equivalent of 1.5 months of imports, compared with 2.2 months at the end of 1994 and the programmed level of 2.6 months at end-1995. In late April the authorities raised reserve requirements on domestic currency deposits of commercial banks from 10 to 15 percent and expanded the . coverage to deposits with maturities of more than one year. However, the IJ The last public sector expenditure review conducted by the World Bank staff was in 1992.

The external current account deficit in 1994 was somewhat higher than projected in the program,. Exports ro.se faster than anticipated because of a sharp rise in the international price of coffee and a rapid growth in nontra- ditional manufacturing exports, but this gain was more than offset by a strong recovery of imports. Private capital inflows rose substantially and more than compensated for lower than projected official external assistance. The World Bank disbursed the first tranche of its Economic Recovery Credit, but postponed the second tranche disbursement because of delays.in privat- ization and public employment reduction. In December 1994 the IDB increased the disbursement under the Public Utility Reform Loan by US$14 million to finance part of the fiscal costs associated with the drought. On structural reforms, advances were made in 1994 and the first months of 1995, but there were slippages relative to the program. More than 50 small enterprises managed by a state agency, CORNAP, were divested or offered for sale in 1994 and an additional four in early 1995 (Table 2). However, the partial privatization of TELCOR, the telephone company, was not carried out because of delays in approving legislation by the National Assembly. The delay on TELCOR affected progress on property rights as the sale proceeds were to be used to compensate confiscated property. In other areas of property rights, progress was made in the resolution of titling of urban and rural holdings, but the resolution of claims of confiscated property evolved at a slower pace. Little progress has been made on labor market reform; in January 1995 the Government vetoed the Assembly's modifi- cations to the draft labor code submitted by the Administration because such modifications were seen as increasing market rigidities (e.g., increased costs of layoffs). Public employment reduction in 1994 amounted to about half of the 7,000 envisaged in the program, owing in part to the delay in the sale of TELCOR. In early 1995 the Government changed the employment reduction program from voluntary to mandatory, and began making severance payments up front, in a lump sum, instead of on a monthly basis as previously programmed. L/ Public employment was reduced by an additional 1,400 during January-May 1995. The authorities have continued with the crawline. pep svstem under which the cordoba is depreciated vis-a-vis the US dollar by about 1 percent a month. In real effective terms, the cordoba depreciated by 6.5 percent in 1994 and by 1.9 percent during January-April 1995 (Chart). The restrictions on the making of payments through the official market were lifted for educa- tion expenses in February 1995 and for health and travel payments in May. Remaining restrictions on current international transactions subject to Fund I/ Under the original plan, indemnization averaged 30 months of salary, and under the lump-sum payments system it will average 25 months of salary.

In March 1995 Nicaragua obtained from Paris Club creditors a conces- sional rescheduling (under the Naples terms for low income countries), which provides 67 percent reduction in net present value terms on most of the debt consolidated. In addition, moratorium interests and part of the obligations under the 1991 rescheduling were deferred. This agreement provides somewhat greater relief than the terms that had been assumed in the program. The provision and timeliness of statistical information required to monitor developments under the program has improved since late 1994; however, further improvement is needed in the estimations of the public sector financing (e.g., reconciling financing items with the balance of revenue and expenditure) and of the external debt and debt service. As indicated in the Statistical Appendix, the authorities are working closely with the staff in addressing these issues, including through technical assistance. Following a period of political stability in 1994 difficulties between the Administration and the Assembly reemerged in early 1995 when the Assembly approved certain constitutional reforms that have been rejected by the Administration. 1/ Tensions between the two powers has resulted in the virtual paralyzation of legislation. On the initiative of represent- atives of certain donor countries, discussions have started between the Administration and the Assembly aimed at resolving the crisis. III. Reuort on the Policy Discussions The discussions with the authorities centered on the policy actions that would be needed to correct past policy slippages and return to the original path of the program. In this context, and taking account of developments in the first quarter of 1995, new quantitative targets were discussed for 1995 on the fiscal and monetary programs, as well as the actions required to further advance structural reforms. The authorities agreed on the need to reverse the recent sharp deterioration in the reserve position of the Central Bank and a revised target was set at a gain of US$40 million in net reserves in 1995, compared l/ The reforms include, among other things, the transfer to the legislature of some powers in the area of economic policy (including approval of agreements with international organizations), the increase in budgetary earmarking, and the introduction of certain restrictions for presidential candidates.

This objective seemed appropriate in light of the strong but temporary increase expected in coffee exports. The authorities are maintaining the target on inflation (a decline from a 12-month rate of 12 percent at end-1994 to 8 percent at end-1995) and have revised the real GDP growth assumption from 3 percent to 4 percent. The authorities have taken several steps consistent with the above objectives. However, in part because of recent slippages, additional actions would be needed to ensure attainment of the authorities' revised targets for 1995. In particular, corrective measures are required to strengthen control over credit expansion of the state-owned banks and to improve the financial position of the state-owned power company. Moreover, further advances in the area of privatization are important to facilitate progress on property rights as well as to improve economic efficiency and the investment climate. The staff is in close contact with the authorities and is assisting them in strengthening program implementation. The mission in August/ September will review progress in addressing the above issues as well as the overall program performance, and on this basis it will assess the conditions for resuming support under the ESAF. 1. Fiscal volicy The authorities are aiming to raise savings of the nonfinancial public sector from 3 percent of GDP in 1994 to 5 percent of GDP in 1995 (Tables 3 and 4). This savings objective falls below the 6 percent of GDP of the original program, but the authorities justified the deviation as it would be about equivalent to the effect of last year's drought on the operating cost of the state power company in 1995. The authorities said that this was a temporary problem that should be corrected in 1996. Capital expenditure is‘ projected to remain at about 15 percent of GDP in 1995, or somewhat higher than anticipated earlier, and the overall deficit is expected to exceed the original target by 3 percentage points of GDP. External grants and loans (mostly on concessional terms) also will be higher than estimated earlier, but net domestic financing is projected at 1.7 percent of GDP above the lev,el originally programmed. This additional domestic financing reflects, in addition to the lower than programmed savings, higher capital outlays financed with domestic resources. The staff I/ In addition, the authorities agreed to tighten the program definition of international reserves by including as reserve liabilities the legal reserve requirements on foieign currenc,y deposits of commercial banks and any placement of short-term central bank bonds denominated in foreign currency. Under the new definition of international reserves the program target of US$35 million would be equivalent to only about US$25 million. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - strongly encouraged the authorities to limit capital outlays as much as possible to the level financed by grants and concessional loans to avoid increasing pressure on domestic resources. Savings of the Central Government in 1995 are projected by the authorities to be a little higher than projected earlier (2.2 percent of GDP compared with 1.9 percent) because of improved tax revenue performance. Current outlays of the Central Government are projected at'the original program level (20 percent of GDP). Higher wages and additional outlays associated with the employment reduction program (PML) would be offset by lower purchases of goods and services and interest obligations. The higher wage bill in 1995 (estimated at 6.1 percent of GDP, compared with a previous 5.5 percent) results from delays in the PML as well as higher salaries in the education and health sectors. All other public wages are to remain under the freeze introduced in early 1994. Lump-sum payments under the PML will result in an additional fiscal cost in 1995 estimated at nearly 1 percentage point of GDP. This additional cost would be compensated by a similar amount of lower than originally esti- mated interest obligations that results mostly from the interest deferment of the Paris Club rescheduling. Under the original program, savings of debt service were to be accumulated as additional foreign reserves, but the autho- rities stressed that the additional cost was unavoidable if the PML was to be accelerated. They added that severance payments would be reduced in 1996-97 from those originally programmed by the amount of the additional payments incurred in 1995. Improvement in the performance of the power company, ENEL, will be key to achieving the authorities' target for public sector savings in 1995. ENEL's savings performance has been weakened in part by the higher fuel costs associated with last year's drought, but also revenue shortfalls reflecting both low tariffs and severe collection deficiencies. At the time of the mission, higher than normal fuel costs were estimated at about 0.8 percent of GDP for 1995, and on this basis the authorities set their aim to contain the deviation in public savings (with respect to the original program) to no more than 1 percent of GDP, as noted above. However, since late March the use of fuel has been higher than projected and the international price has risen somewhat. ENEL's tariff rates have been adjusted by one percent a month since early 1994 to maintain them unchanged in real terms, but rates remain rela- tively low compared to other countries in the region. During the mission it was estimated that ENEL would need a step increase in tariffs of some 15 percent beginning in the second half of the year to achieve an operating balance in 1995 consistent with the revised public savings objective. In addition, to cover temporary fluctuations in fuel costs, the staff suggested introducing a variable fuel factor in electricity rates. The authorities indicated that it would be difficult to implement an increase of 15 percent in one step, but ratec could be increased in two stages; they added that the fuel factor would be studied. They also noted that collection procedures would be tightened, including through power cuts to customers in arrears, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - and that ENEL planned to hire a private foreign company to handle its revenue collections. On May 1, 1995 ENEL announced a step increase in rates averaging 9 percent, and the authorities indicated that revenue performance would be monitored closely and would decide at a later stage whether a new increase was needed. The staff is of the view that a further step increase in rates likely will be needed to avoid subsidization, particularly in light of the recent upward trend in ENEL,'s fuel costs. The authorities have made efforts to strengthen the operations of the Social Security Agency (INSSBI). 1/ INSSBI has been burdened with a large number of pensions awarded in the 1980's that had no relation to past social security contributions, and the authorities are in the process of reducing these payments. Medical services are being improved by contracting the services of private health clinics and hospitals, and the higher costs are being covered with improved collections from contributions. INSSBI recently has been using part of its small surplus to finance low income housing through a state-owned bank at below market interest rates. The staff encouraged the authorities to discontinue such financing to protect the savings of INSSBI. 2. Monetarv policy The discussions focused on the credit policies in 1995 to achieve the authorities' new target on net international reserves while reducing infla- tion to 8 percent. The credit program discussed was based on a slowdown in the growth of broad money from 54 percent in 1994 to less than 20 percent in 1995 (Table 5). The large increase in broad money observed in 1994 was viewed by the authorities as an increase in the demand for domestic finan- cial assets and in the repatriation of US dollar deposits, reflecting increased private sector confidence as economic performance improved and the political situation stabilized. The key elements to achieve the monetary program targets were a con- traction in the central bank net claims on the state-owned banks (through both stepped up loan recoveries and a reduction in new credit lines), and full compliance with the increased reserve requirements that were imple- mented last April. The net credit contraction to the state banks was to be facilitated by increased loan repayments from coffee growers, given the strong rise in export earnings. As noted earlier, the initial effec.t of the increased reserve requirement was somewhat limited because the state banks, particularly the 1/ INSSBI recently was streamlined of most of the social welfare services for children and the elderly, which were transferred to a new institution (Fond0 National para la Nitiez y Familia, FONIC).

However, the increased reserve position of private commercial banks at the Central Bank contributed to stabilize net international reserves, although they have not recovered as projected under the revised program targets. During the discussions the authorities indicated that the Central Bank planned to initiate open market operations to improve control over credit expansion. However, to develop open-market operations may take time as the Central Bank has little experience with indirect instruments of monetary control. Therefore, the staff indicated that a substantial improvement in the loan recoveries by the state banks in the months ahead was essential to reduce these banks' debt with the Central Bank and achieve the targets of the monetary program. The staff also recommended to begin phasing out the Central Bank's role of intermediating external resources to the state banks. The authorities acknowledged the need to improve loan recoveries but efforts in this area since the mission appear to have been insufficient. The Superintendency of Banks is intensifying supervision of the state banks. BANADES has been burdened by the poor quality of its portfolio, and since December 1994, it has been operating under a quarterly financial plan prepared with the technical assistance of the IDB. While its financial per- formance has improved slightly with respect to 1994, it fell short of the plan's targets for the first quarter of 1995. The second largest state bank, BANIC, under a new management, recently has been able to reduce its operating losses by increasing loan recoveries, but its financial position remains fragile. During the forthcoming staff mission the performance of these banks will be reviewed again, in particular their compliance with reserve requirements, progress in improving their loan recoveries and loan payments to the Central Bank, and the implementation of the financial plan for BANADES, which is being monitored by the Superintendency of Banks and the IDB. 3. Structural reform and social nolicies The authorities expect that the public emclovment reduction program will be advanced sufficiently this year to make up for the delays of 1994 and meet the original target for 1995 (11,000 staff or about 10 percent of public employees). The main pending issue of the privatization Program remains the offer for sale of TELCOR (at least 40 percent of the shares and a management contract). The legislative process has been delayed, but likely would move forward if the recent political difficulties between the Assembly and the Administration are resolved. The authorities indicated that in order to gain legislative approval they would have to consider earmarking~part of TELCOR's sale proceeds for certain social expenditure instead of using them entirely to redeem the bonds that have been issued to compensate confiscated property, as originally envisaged. With regard to prouertv rights the authorities noted the progress in resolving the titling of urban and rural properties (more than 90 percent of cases had been resolved through March 1995), and expressed their intention to accelerate the pending resolution of claims by previous owners of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - confiscated property (36 percent of cases have been resolved). In 1994 about US$lSO million in compensation bonds were issued to previous owners, and an additional US$25 million were issued in the first quarter of 1995; total claims amount to mo're than US$600 million. Currently, these bonds are trading in the secondary market at 15 to 20 percent of the face value. l/ The Government's program on poverty alleviation is being strengthened mainly through the activities of the Social Investment Fund (FISE) which are oriented mostly toward social infrastructure and rural employment. In 1994 FISE doubled its expenditures to nearly US$30 million (1.6 percent of GDP) tied to external aid, fro;m the average annual level of 1991-93. 4. External sector policies and the medium-term balance of navments a. Balance of vavments prospects and policies for 1995 The external current account deficit, excluding accrued interest obligations, is projected to decline from 26 percent of GDP in 1994 to 21 percent in 1995 owing to a strong increase in merchandise exports. Coffee export earnings are estimated to rise by 70 percent in 1995, despite lower shipments, because of the full year effect of the sharp rise in inter- national prices during 1994; coffee export prices in 1995 are estimated at three times their level in 1993, resulting in additional export earnings equivalent to 3.5 percent of GDP. Other exports, including nontraditional agricultural and manufacturing commodities, are projected to continue to grow at a strong pace, al’beit somewhat slower than in 1994. The value of imports, which recovered strongly in 1994 following a decline the previous year, are expected to grow at a moderate pace (Table 6). Official capital inflows are projected at some US$525 million, or in line with the original program assumptions, including close to US$lOO mil- lion by the IDB and the World Bank in balance of payments support. Private capital inflows are projected to slow down substantially from the high level of 1994. The authorities plan to continue with the crawling peg system. The spread between the official and free market exchange rates widened to more than 3 percent during January-February 1995, reflecting the relaxation of credit policy as well as uncertainties surrounding the crisis in Mexico; the spread subsequently fell to less than 1 percent. z/ The authorities indi- cated that while they still were committed to unification of the exchange r/ In September 1994 the terms of the bonds were improved by reducing their maturity from 20 to 15 years, raising the yield from 3 percent a year to 4.5-5 percent during years 5 to 15, and limiting capitalization of interest to the first two years rather than to the entire maturity of the bond. 2/ As there is no mechanism in place that would prevent the spread from exceeding 2 percent the exchange rate system gives rise to a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - markets, they might postpone implementation at this time given the weakening in the reserve position during the first months of the year (the program contemplated full unification by mid-1995). They felt that the issue of unification would need to be reviewed in the near future in the context of progress in the implementation of the monetary program. The staff stressed the importance of moving toward unification of the exchange markets as soon as possible, and indicated that the recent narrowing of the spread presented a good opportunity to act promptly in this area. The authorities intend to proceed with the scheduled reduction of import tariffs within the context of the agreement with the Central American Common Market. The top rate of the current lo-40 percent tariff range will be reduced to 37 percent on July 1, 1995 and further to 35 percent in January 1995 and 32 percent in January 1997. Progress toward normalization of relations with external creditors is being made in the context of Paris Club rescheduling, and through bilateral negotiations. Discussions with the Russian Federation on debt and debt service reduction were resumed in July 1994; in May 1995 there were new contacts between both countries' authorities and a new round of negotiations is expected in the near future. The authorities said that they intended to deal similarly with debt of other official bilateral creditors and of private suppliers. Also, discussion have been held with regional (Central American) multilateral institutions on ways to eliminate debt arrears to them. Recently Nicaragua has held negotiations with commercial bank cred- itors on a buy-back operation; the World Bank and the IDB have given indica- tions that they would contribute to such operation by providing most of the financing on concessional terms. b. Medium-term-balance of payments An updated medium-term balance of payments scenario has been prepared on the assumption of fiscal consolidation, prudent credit policy, and completion of structural reforms (Tables 7-10). Domestic investment is assumed to remain at about 20 percent of GDP over the next few years with the private sector steadily increasing its relative share (currently at about 5 percent of GDP); real GDP growth is projected to rise from 4 percent in 1995 to 5.5 percent in 2000. On this basis, the external current account (excluding interest obligations) would decline from 21 percent of GDP in 1995 to 11 percent in 2000 reflecting a sustained growth of exports (average 10 percent a year in U.S. dollar terms), although the current high coffee prices would abate gradually over the period. Restrained import growth is projected throughout the period, albeit gradually increasing to stabilize at the rate of overall economic growth. Gross official external aid is expected to decline to around US$470 million in 1996 and to remain at that annual level subse- quently, while private inflows are assumed to stabilize at the projected 1995 level. Exceptional financing needs in 1995 and over the medium term are assumed to be covered through new rescheduling agreements, including Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - with Paris Club creditors under terms similar to those obtained in March 1995. For illustrative purposes an alternative scenario was prepared assuming debt stock reduction (67 percent from Paris Club creditors and 95 percent from other official bilateral creditors), assumed to take place in 1997. Under these assumptions Nicaragua's financing gaps would be virtually eliminated. IV. Staff Appraisal In early 1994 the Nicaraguan authorities adopted a comprehensive program, which was supported by ESAF arrangements approved in June 1994 that aimed at consolidating the gains achieved in macroeconomic stabilization, deepening structural reforms, and advancing toward external viability. Central to the attainment of these objectives were a targeted improvement in public sector savings and a restrained credit policy. The performance of the economy improved in 1994 as real GDP growth accelerated, inflation fell, and international reserves rose. However, the public finances weakened in the second half of the year and structural reforms proceeded at a slow pace. In the first months of 1995 the public finances showed some improvement, but there was a relaxation of credit policy that resulted in a substantial d,ecline in international reserves. In the past few months the authorities have taken important actions aimed at correcting policy slippages and have set revised program targets for 1995. However, additional actions will be needed to achieve the autho- rities' revised targets and to bring the program back on track. Real GDP growth assumptions have been raised for 199s (from 3 to 4 percent), and the authorities are aiming at further strengthening net international reserves, while maintaining the originally envisaged reduction in inflation. Public sector savings are targeted to increase to S percent of GDP, from 3 percent in 1994 (somewhat less than in the original program), while central bank credit is to be tightened 'to absorb part of the increase in domestic liquidity resulting from higher coffee exports. Fiscal actions taken by the authorities in early 1995 and improvements in custom administration have contributed importantly to raise tax revenues and improve the savings position of the Central Government. The programmed increase in severance payments appears to be justified as it would permit to accelerate implementation of the public employment reduction plan, and the higher fiscal cost is expected to be offset by lower interest payments resulting in part by the deferment obtained from Paris Club creditors. Other current outlays would need to be monitored closely, particularly the wage bill, and the authorities are encouraged to maintain the coverage of public sector wage freeze as broad as possible. The improved position of the central government finances, however, has been more than offset by the weakening in the operating surplus of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - state-owned power company, ENEL. The strengthening of ENEL's position during the remainder of 1995 will be crucial to achieving the authorities' revised public saving target. Part of ENEL's weakening is temporary, as it is related to the residual effects of last year's drought, but another part has resulted from low tariffs and severe collection deficiencies. The recent increase in tariff rates is a welcomed move in the right direc- tion, although another rate increase likely will be needed later this year. Furthermore, as recent upward revisions in the cost of fuel may erode this year's effect of the recent rate increase, the authorities would need to consider introducing a variable fuel factor in electricity rates. The authorities also should press ahead with their actions to strengthen collection procedures and their plans to contract a private company to handle revenue collection. The authorities' revised fiscal program for 1995 calls for higher capital expenditure than previously envisaged. While part of this higher level is being financed by additional external grants and concessional loans, other outlays would add to the pressure on domestic resources resulting from the weaker than originally programmed public savings. The staff encourages the authorities to limit capital outlays financed with domestic resources as much as possible to high priority projects. The authorities' credit program appropriately targets a further reduction of inflation as well as the recovery and further increase in net international reserves, given the substantial loss in the first months of 1995. To achieve these objectives requires a contraction in the Central Bank's net claims on commercial banks, and the recent increase in reserve requirements was a proper step in this direction. However, the monetary effect of the increased requirements has been limited so far owing to the reserve deficiency position of the state-owned banks at the Central Bank. While net foreign reserves appear to have stabilized, they have not recovered as expected. The continuing expansion of the lending activities of the state banks, financed in part by central bank credit, is a matter of serious concern given the financial weakness of these institutions and the poor quality of their portfolio, and it raises doubts about the authorities' ability to attain the monetary program's objectives. The staff urges the authorities to reduce substantially the net central bank claims on these banks by curtailing gross financing and stepping up loan recovery. Further- more, lending by the state banks also needs to be curtailed and their financial position improved by increasing their own loan recoveries. The authorities should give full support to the recent increased supervision of these banks by the Superintendency of Banks and, in the case of the largest bank, BANADES, should press for the full compliance of its financial plan prepared with the technical assistance of the IDB. Finally, the authorities would need to consider phasing out the intermediary role played by the Central Bank in transferring resources to the state banks. In the area of structural reforms, the privatization program needs to be further advanced with the divestment of the telephone company (TELCOR). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- :14 - In addition to improving efficiency with private management, the sale of TELCOR would facilitate progress on property rights as the sale proceeds are used to compensate confiscated property. In this regard, the authorities are urged to limit as much as possible the diversion of TELCOR's sale proceeds for other expenditures as such diversion could weaken the progress on resolving the property issues. Progress is being made in reducing external payments arrears through reschedulings and the authorities are encouraged to conclude pending nego- tiations with official non-Paris Club creditors as soon as possible. The authorities plan to maintain the crawling peg exchange system and the staff urges them to move promptly toward unification of the official and free market exchange rates. The staff views the unification of the exchange markets as an important policy action before proceeding with the second-year ESAF arrangement. In the absence of a timetable for the elimination of remaining exchange restrictions (i.e. those evidenced by external payments arrears) and multiple currency practice the staff does not recommend approval for their retention by Nicaragua. The staff would stress the importance of improving further the statistical information required to monitor developments under the program, particularly in the areas of public sector financing and external debt and debt service. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Nicaragua be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: On January 10, 1993, the exchange rate was adjusted from C$5 to C$6 per U.S. dollar and a crawling peg system was adopted with an annual rate of d'evaluation of the cordoba of 5 percent. In November 1993 the annual rate of devaluation was increased to 12 percent. Nicaragua maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions as evidenced by external payments arrears and on certain payments for invisibles. Private exchange houses that operate at market-determined exchange rates give rise to a multiple currency practice. The Executive Board approved the retention by Nicaragua of (i) the exchange restrictions on payments for invisibles until end-February 1995 or until the completion of the review under the first annual ESAF arrangement, whichever was earlier; and (ii) the restrictions on payments for private debts and the multiple currency practice, until end-June 1995 (EBS/94/116). As of May 31, 1995, the buying and selling rates in the official market were C$7.45 and C$7.53 per U.S. dollar, respectively, while the buying and selling rates at the Iprivate exchange houses were CS7.50 and C$7.56 per U.S. dollar, respectively.

IBRD/IDA/Loan Commitments and Disbursements In the period 1992-93 the Economic Recovery Credit I was fully disbursed, and disbursements related to the Social Investment Fund and the Agriculture Technology and Land Management Project, approved in FY 1993 and FY 1994, respectively, were initiated. An Institutional Development Credit (US$23 million) and a Basic Education project (US$34 million) were approved in March. The Institutional Credit will aid in the institutional reforms of the public sector, including the implementation of the Employment Reduction Program. 2. Recent technical assistance Technical assistance in agriculture has been provided on a regular basis through the Bank-supported Regional Unit for Technical Assistance (RUTA) located in Costa Rica and as a part of the Agriculture Technology and Land Management Project. IDA continued supporting the Government in the reorganiz- ation of the institutional framework for external debt management and in improving its data base. It is also supporting the Government in the review of the legal and regulatory framework for natural resource management and in Public Sector reform. 3. Recent economic and sector missions The supervision mission for second tranche disbursement of ERC II took place in February 1995. In addition, agriculture, technical assistance, and social sector missions will be undertaken during 1995. 4. Plans for the next 12 months A second Social Investment Fund is currently being negotiated. Also, the staff is currently working on a Transport project as well as a Rural Credit financing project within the Agricultural Technology and Land Management project. Missions to prepare possible credits in the areas of natural resources and water and sanitation will be conducted during 1995.

Coverage and timeliness of basic statistical information Information on certain basic statistics (i.e. international reserves, exchange rates, balance sheet of the Central Bank, interest rates) is provided by the Central Bank for purposes of monitoring the program on a weekly basis and generall,y with a short delay. In addition, consumer price index and public sector accounts are provided monthly, exports and imports, quarterly (albeit irregularly), and GDP, yearly. All this information also is available during staff missions. However, as indicated below, some of these statistics have not been provided for publication in the IFS. 2. Outstanding statistical issues for monitoring _develoDments under the DroEram a . Public sector finances I,arge discrepancies are found in reconciling financing items (from domestic and external sources) with the balance of revenue and expenditure. These discrepancies have large variations from month to month, and are observed in the accounts of the Central Government as well as of the overall nonfinancial public sector. During recent missions the staff has been working closely with officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nicaragua to address the problems in reconciling fiscal data from above the line with financing items. b. External debt statistics Improvement is needed on the estimation of outstanding external debt, debt arrears, and debt service obligations (accrual basis). Efforts are being made to reconcile debt service and balance of payments statistics. The authorities would need to develop a periodic system of information provided by creditors. 3. Outstanding statistical issues for Dublication a. Real sector and balance of payments Efforts have been made to improve real sector and balance of payments statistics, but weaknesses remain regarding coverage and currentness. The last complete year data reported for IF’S publication on national accounts and balance of payments is 1993, and for trade values is 1992, although monthly data reporting for 1994 on trade values was recently resumed. Because of certain methodological weaknesses, data on consumer prices have not been reported for IFS publication since 1992. A new price index with new weights is being used in 1995, but it has not been linked yet with the previous index. The U.S. AID has recently been providing technical assist- ance in this area. No data are reported on producer prices, wages, employment, or trade price and volume indices.

STA will manage the statistical component of the second phase of this joint project, in which a national accounts expert will undertake a short-term resident assignment, to develop an index of economic activity consistent with a system of national accounts. An expert on balance of payments statistics and external debt funded by the Japan account and supervised by STA provided long-term technical assistance to the Central Bank of Nicaragua during 1992-94. Presently, he continues to provide technical support on a short-term basis with IDB funding. b. Government finance The GFS database of STA includes annual data for Nicaragua through 1993. No monthly data on government operations are reported for publication in IFS. From August 1993 to April 1994 a STA panel expert assisted the Nicaraguan authorities at the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nicaragua in improving the compilation of fiscal statistics. In this period several methodological problems were addressed and the data coverage for central and local governments was expanded. A short technical assistance mission on GFS in April 1995 reviewed progress made by the authorities in the implementation of the expert's recommendations. C. Monetary accounts The November 1994 mission on money and banking statistics found that substantial progress had been made in improving the reliability and quality of CBN accounts since 1992., but a number of methodological issues remained. The mission's recommendations included improving the sectorization of public sector accounts. A new plan of accounts for the CBN, which incorporates appropriate principles of sectorization, classification, and valuation of accounts, has now been developed and soon will be introduced on a parallel basis. However, the catalog of economic agents by sectors that was developed for the new plan of accounts needs revisions. Monetary data reported by the deposit money banks are highly aggregated and lack sufficient sectorization. CBN will need to prepare a document describing the supplementary information needed from the deposit money banks to produce sectorized monetary accounts.
