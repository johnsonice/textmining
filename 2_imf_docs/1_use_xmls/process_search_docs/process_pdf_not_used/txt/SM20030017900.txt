Inflation in most recent years has been modest. a The fiscal and balance of payments positions worsened significantly in 2001, and although they improved in 2002, there are risks of a tirther deterioration this year. l Kiribati’s external reserves in the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) have fallen due to world equity market reverses, but still amount to nearly five years of 2002 imports. a The political situation is fluid, and Kiribati is currently operating under an interim government, pending parliamentary elections in May and a presidential election, probably in July. Key Policy Issues The discussions focused on the policies needed to maintain macroeconomic stability and on measures which could promote private sector development and stimulate growth. The government that takes office aRer the new elections should aim to preserve the fiscal consolidation achieved in 2002. This is essential if the authorities are to achieve their goal of preserving the RERF’s real per capita value. This would require current expenditure to be cut further, and the authorities should rely mostly on grants and concessional loans to finance development expenditure. Kiribati’s longstanding use of the Australian dollar as its domestic currency has helped to underpin economic stability and remains appropriate. Faster medium-term growth depends largely on private sector development. The government should remove subsidies to public enterprises that compete with companies in the private sector and concentrate its resources on improving infrastructure for private businesses and individuals. The government should also remove other obstacles to private activity and investment. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 1. INTRODUCTION 1. Kirihati’s economic development has been held back by geographical and structural constraints. The population of less than 100,000 is spread over 33 islands, and over 3% million square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean, making it difficult to generate economies of scale and manage problems of communication. Only about 20 percent of the workforce are formally employed-the rest work in subsistence agriculture and fishing-and the public sector accounts for more than two thirds of formal employment. Poor infrastructure and competition from subsidized public enterprises in many areas of economic activity have impeded private sector development. 2. The current political situation is fluid, with Kiribati currently operating under an interim government. The Article IV consultation discussions took place just after the re- election of the incumbent President Tito, and afier the appointment of a new government. However, shortly after the mission the government lost a vote of confidence in Parliament. New Parliamentary elections were held in May and a presidential election will also be held, probably in July. Meanwhile, an interim government consisting of the speaker of the last Parliament, the chief justice and the chairman of the Public Service Commission has approved a temporary budget to carry the government through August 2003. 3. At the time of the last Article IV consultation, in June 2001, Directors commended Kiribati’s record of macroeconomic stability while noting recent fiscal slippages. They endorsed the authorities’ prudent management of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) and urged them to use its resources judiciously to ensure the RERF’s long-term viability, and to frame their macroeconomic policies accordingly. Directors urged the authorities to curb spending on wages and subsidies while redirecting spending to education, health and environmental protection, and to broaden the tax base. They also urged the authorities to reform public enterprises and provide a supportive environment for the private sector and for foreign investment, and to improve the weak statistical base. The authorities succeeded in reducing the deficit in 2002 after fiscal loosening in 2001, but government spending in almost all categories has increased, and there has been almost no progress on public enterprise reform or private sector development. The authorities’ decision to increase government spending and to maintain a large role for the public sector reflects, in part, their concern about the limited capacity of the private sector in the short term to promote growth and create employment. Education has been developed through construction of junior secondary schools. The statistical base remains weak. II. RECENTDEVELOPMENTS 4. There was little economic growth during 2001-02, and per capita incomes have fallen (Table 1, Figure 1). Despite increases in government services and in construction related to development expenditure, GDP grew by less than 2 percent in each year. Growth has been held back in part by poor performance of agriculture, especially a sharp decline in copra production since 1999. The modest growth also reflects limited growth in the private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- Table 1.

GNP grew significantly in 2001, due to increased fishing license revenues, but fell back in 2002. Kiribati remains one of the poorest of the Pacific Island states (Box 1). Box 1: Kiribati’s Income from a World and Regional Perspective As a result of its low income and economic vnlnerabilities, Kiribati is included on UN’s list of least developed countries (LDCs). Although Kiribati ranks at the higher end of the list of LDCs in terms of both income and economic vulnerability, its income is well below most of the other small islands in the Pacific. Kiribati also remains well below the graduation thresholds that are used to determine the list of LDCs. Kiribati’s GDP per capita is low, at only around 40 percent of the Pacific Island countries’ average (figure).’ Kiribati’s substantial foreign income make GNI a better measure for income comparisons, but even on this measure its income is only about 60 percent of the average. 2500 2000 g 1500 1000 500 0 GDP per capita in I995 U.S. dollars, GNI in current US. dollars.

Inflation is not a problem, thanks to Kiribati’s use of the Australian dollar as its domestic currency. With the exception of 2001, inflation has been below 5 percent in each of the last five years. Inflation was 7.3 percent in 2001, reflecting the pass-through effects of a depreciation of the Australian dollar against other major currencies, but fell to about 1 percent in 2002. Prices of food items were unchanged over 2002, after an initial increase in ’ Development spending has been substantial in recent years, but growth has so far remained low, in part because much of the spending has been on replacement of the existing capital stock.

The profit margins on sales of basic commodities such as rice and sugar are controlled and price movements in petroleum products are smoothed by the state owned oil company (which lets its profits absorb some of the international price movements). 6. After pursuing a prudent fiscal policy throughout the late 199Os, the authorities loosened fiscal policy significantly in 2001 (Table 2, Figure 2). Total revenue including grants increased by about 20 percent of GDP in 2001, to 122 percent of GDP, due mostly to record revenues from fishing license fees which amounted to over 50 percent of GDP. However, spending increased by even more. Current spending increased by over 35 percent, due to increased personnel costs following an increase in both public sector wages and the workforce, higher subsidies to public enterprises, and higher expenditure on locally purchased services.2 Development expenditure increased by about 85 percent, without a corresponding increase in external grants, and total government spending in 2001 amounted to 139 percent of GDP. About one-third of the overall deficit of 17.5 percent of GDP was financed by external loans, with the remainder being financed by use of income from the RERF, the first such use in four years (Box 2).3 7. In 2002, the authorities succeeded in reducing the deficit, but there are troubling underlying trends. Total revenue and grants reached 135 percent of GDP, due to an increase in grants equivalent to about 25 percent of GDP that more than offset a small decline in fishing license fees. Expenditure was cut to 136 percent of GDP, mostly due to cuts in spending on government services, which offset a further increase in development spending. (See Box 3 for a comparison of tax revenues, grants, and expenditure in Kiribati with those in other Pacific Island countries.) The overall deficit was very small and was entirely financed from concessional external loans. However, it is likely that the deficit will increase again in the absence of policy measures. Tax revenue has fallen by some 2% percent of GDP since 2000 and personnel costs have increased by 5 percent of GDP. Revenue from fishing licenses in 2002, while lower than in 2001, was also well above historical averages. 8. The government’s draft budget envisaged a deficit for 2003 equivalent to 30 percent of GDP. The budget assumed a fall in revenue amounting to 19 percent of GDP, due to a fall in revenue from fishing licenses of 11 percent of GDP and falls in tax and other nontax revenue. In response, the authorities planned to cut current expenditure by some 2 Many public enterprises receive budgetary support through subsidies and government loans, which are included in the budget. Since commercial loans to public enterprises are almost non-existent, contingent liabilities are limited (about 1 percent of GDP). 3 The RERF is Kiribati’s main external asset. At the end of 2002 its value was equivalent to nearly five years of imports of goods and services. The 2001 drawing from the RERF was $A 12.6 million, equivalent to about 14 percent of GDP, which was believed to be the maximum drawdown that would be acceptable to parliament. Not all of the money was used: there were deposits to other government finds amounting to 4 percent of GDP.

In 1979, when Kiribati gained independence and the phosphate mine closed, the value of the f&d was $A 68 million. At end-2002, the fund had grown to $A 576 million (US$326 million, or six times GDP). Purpose: The fund’s main objective is to provide sustainable financing of government expenditure for the benefit of current and future generations. In 1996, Parliament adopted a policy of limiting use of income from the RERF to amounts which would maintain the expected real per capita value of the RERF in Australian dollars. The National Assembly approves the annual authorized maximum drawdown in the budget debate. Administration: The fund is administered by a committee of senior government officials who file quarterly reports on the fund’s operations with the National Assembly. Management: The fund is managed by two international brokerage firms, and held by a custodian. Comprehensive audits are held periodically. The fund is well diversified, with investments in 22 currencies (25 percent in U.S. dollars, 33 percent in Australian dollars, and 19 percent in both Japanese yen and euros), and evenly split between equities and bonds. From 1987 to 2000, the financial performance of the fund and the government’s policy of reinvesting the profits led the per capita value of the fLnd to grow by 61 percent in terms of 1996 Australian dollars, and by 26 percent in terms of 1996 U.S. dollars. Since 2000, the value of the Fund has fallen by 22 percent in real per capita Australian dollars and by 18 percent in real per capita U.S. dollars, mainly reflecting price declines in international equity markets. At the end of 2002, the real per capita value was 5,532 in 1996 Australian dollars and 3,217 in 1996 U.S. dollar terms.

However, they planned to increase locally financed development spending by some 20 percent of GDP, mostly on infrastructure projects.

Parliament was dissolved before voting on this budget, and the interim government has approved a budget through end-August which involves much lower government expenditure (about $A 5 1 million, equivalent to about 50 percent of projected 2003 GDP), which will cover current spending and some locally financed development spending. The new Parliament is expected to convene in August and vote on a budget for the full year soon thereafter. Box 3: Kiribati’s Fiscal Indicators From a Pacific Island Perspective Kiribati’s public sector in relation to GDP is very large. Due to the country’s substantial foreign income, ratios in terms of GNP may be more relevant when comparing with other countries, but even using this measure current expenditure is still at the higher end of the spectrum compared to other Pacific Island countries. Tax revenues compare at the lower end of the scale when put in relation to GNP. The large difference between tax revenues and current expenditure in Kiribati is due in part to substantial non-tax revenues in the form of fishing license fees, on the order of 30- 50 percent of GDP over the last few years. Note: Data for 2002, except Rh4I which is 2001, An even more striking difference compared to other PICs is the high level of development expenditure, even when measured as a ratio to GNP. In 2002, this was largely matched by substantial external grants. 9. The balance of payments position remains vulnerable, given Kiribati’s reliance on income from fishing licenses (Table 3, Figure 3). The current account, which had a strong though declining surplus in the years since 1997, worsened to a position of near balance in 2001, despite record income from fishing license fees. This was largely a result of increased imports related to development expenditure. In 2002, the current account recorded a small surplus, due to increased transfers to the government. However, the trade deficit increased further to 88 percent of GDP. The stock of external debt was about 17 percent of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- Table 3.

Debt service was about 2 percent of exports of goods and services in 2002. There is no data on private external debt, but the authorities believed it to be small. 10. Kiribati’s financial sector is small and financial intermediation limited, but the main bank appears to be healthy. The financial system in Kiribati consists of one commercial bank (the Bank of Kiribati, BOK), one development bank (the Development Bank of Kiribati, DBK), a state-run pension fund (the Kiribati Provident Fund, KPF), and a large number of small village banks. There is no central monetary institution. The bulk of deposits with the two main financial institutions- BOK and KPF-are invested overseas. In 200 1, the majority ownership of the Bank of Kiribati was transferred from the government to a private foreign bank.5 Credit to the private sector remains very limited, and has fallen over the last two years. Overall credit increased slightly in 2002, however, as the BOK agreed to a loan to a state enterprise (the telecommunications company, TSKL), marking a departure from previous practice. Nonperforming loans ofBOK are low (about 2 percent of loans) but nonperforming loans of the much smaller DBK have recently reached 20 percent (equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP). The KPF has recently strengthened its financial position by raising contribution rates and reducing the annual rate of return on investments offered to its members. Finally, the previous government had proposed a Guarantee Corporation to support loans to small businesses, but plans for this have not yet been finalized. 11. There has been only limited progress on structural reform. Legislation on procurement and the environment was enacted in 2002, and the government’s investments in education began to bear fruit with completion of the junior secondary schools. However, the new Environment Act has not been enforced yet, and little progress has been made in translating into action the government’s intention to promote private sector development, as expressed in the National Development Strategies for 2000-2003. Majority ownership of the Bank of Kiribati was transferred to the private sector, but in other areas the scope of government expanded: TSKL reverted to a wholly owned government corporation, and government activity increased in the agriculture sector (construction of a publicly operated copra mill) and in transport (leasing of a new jet by Air Kiribati). Notwithstanding plans to “right size” the civil service, the number of government employees increased by 7 percent between 2000 and 2002. The condition of infrastructure remains poor, in large part due to failure to maintain both existing and new capital investments.6 4 New external borrowing from the AsDB in 2001 and 2002 was offset by debt forgiveness by the People’s Republic of China in 2002. 5 The Bank of Kiribati had been 55 percent owned by the government and 45 percent by an Australian bank which managed the institution. In 2001, the partner withdrew, and the government sold a 75 percent share in the Bank of Kiribati to another Australian bank. The BOK follows Australian regulatory standards. 6 For example, many of the newly-constructed junior secondary schools are reported to be in disrepair.

The main challenges that will face the new government are improving the fiscal position to maintain macroeconomic stability and stimulating economic growth. Based on analysis of medium-term prospects on the basis of the policies included in the draft 2003 budget, the staff argued that a fiscal policy which relied on increasing recourse to use of RERF income was not sustainable. Kiribati’s vulnerability to adverse developments in revenue from fishing licenses and possible costs arising from environmental damage also reinforced the need to maintain the per capita value of the RERF, and to limit the fiscal deficit in most years to what could be financed from external grants and concessional loans. Growth prospects are constrained by Kiribati’s geography and by the limited availability of cultivable land and fresh water. However, there is some scope for the development of a productive base in Kiribati, and for this the government should create an environment conducive to private sector development and concentrate its own resources on improving and maintaining health, education and infrastructure. Structural reform along these lines, coupled with fiscal restraint, could produce higher growth and a sustainable macroeconomic outlook. A. Fiscal Policy 13. The staff expressed concern about the budget which the government had proposed, and recommended that the government prepare a budget which did not rely on a rundown of government financial assets to finance the deficit. The proposed deficit implied a substantial deterioration of the fiscal position and would have been financed mostly by a rundown of government funds and a use of income from the RERF which was projected to cause a fall in its real per capita value in 2003. The RERF is an essential protection for Kiribati against adverse developments, and it has been a longstanding policy of successive governments to preserve its real per capita value. This policy still allows for some use of RERF income (see Annex I), but not as much as had been implied by the budget. Moreover, important parts of Kiribati’s budget revenue come from volatile sources, especially fishing licenses. Thus, it would be best to limit use of RERF income to years in which revenues from fishing licenses were low, and in 2003 fishing license revenue, while lower than in the last two years, was still projected to be above historical average levels (Box 4). External grants and loans were also projected to be unusually high in 2003, which should reduce the need for the government to accelerate its own spending on development projects. For these reasons, the staff recommended that the government rely on only very limited use-or preferably no use-of RERF income in 2003. 14. The staff underscored that this would require current expenditure to be cut beyond what had been proposed in the budget, and the financing of most development expenditure by grants and concessional loans. In the past, revenue had comfortably exceeded current expenditure, whereas the two were in balance in the proposed budget. Given the significant increases in expenditure over the last two years, and the limited scope for increasing revenue in the short-term, most of the fiscal effort would need to be made on the expenditure side. The staff recommended that the authorities should allocate Curds for maintenance and replacement costs, but should cut ad hoc spending in this year’s budget; Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- Box 4: Fishing License Fees Kiribati has a very large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), covering over 3% million square kilometers of tuna-rich waters. Given the country’s very limited fishing capacity, revenue is mainly derived from fishing license fees. The license fees come from both bilateral and multilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements are made with all countries except the United States. In general, the license fees are around 5 percent of the value of the catch, but in some cases fees are negotiated together with grant aid, and may thus be lower. The multilateral agreement with the U.S. covers the fishing waters of sixteen nations. Most of the fees are paid at the end of the year based on where the fish was actually caught. Several exogenous factors , influence the amount of fishing license fees received in a year. Since 1990, there has been a Kiribati: Fishing License Fees, 1990-2002 (In millions of Australian dollars) m El Niio 1990 1992 1994 Source: Kiribati authorities. 1996 1998 2000 2002 strong growth in revenues, but also substantial volatility. For example, revenues increased from $A 4 million in 1990 to a record of $A 47 million in 2001. However, the volumes caught depend on climatic conditions. In general, El N&o years (which can be more or less pronounced) produce larger catches in Kiribati. International prices also determine the value of the catch and thus revenues, and contribute to the volatility of fees. To safeguard long-run revenues and the environment, due regard needs to be given ta changes in fish stocks. In the near term, over-fishing is not a major issue, since the bulk of the catch is skipjack tuna, which has not shown signs of declining stocks. However, the more highly priced yellowfin and bigeye tuna stocks have been declining, which may eventually lead tc reduced revenue. Regional cooperation is key to safeguard the sustainability of fish stocks. Over the medium-term, there may be scope for Kiribati to develop its own fishing capacity based around private commercial fishing businesses. The value of fish caught in Kiribat waters amounts to more than $1 billion, so that there is scope for substantial profits. Experiment: in state-run fishing enterprises, both in Kiribati and in other Pacific Island countries, have no been successful and have resulted in substantial losses. However, there may be scope foi development of private fishing businesses. Over 1,000 I-Kiribati work on board foreign fishing boats, and have substantial experience in fishing. The government could also promote commercial fishing by attracting investment in onshore fish processing by reputable foreigr enterprises with market access. should limit the government wage bill by maintaining salaries at current levels in nominal terms, and reducing the size of the civil service by an examination of government activities to identify inefficiency and over-manning; and should reduce subsidies to public enterprises, especially those that compete with the private sector. Also regarding subsidies, the price paid by the Copra Society to growers had recently been increased from 45 cents to 50 cents per Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- kilo. This should not result in an increase in subsidy costs, since the world price had increased significantly during 2002, but on both financial and economic efficiency grounds it was important that the guaranteed copra price not be increased further. These measures could reduce current expenditure by about 3 percent of GDP. However, most of the savings needed to reduce the deficit would need to come from the government forgoing large proposed increases in development expenditure and instead relying mostly on grants and concessional loans to finance investment projects. Specifically, development expenditure could be reduced by the government deferring or seeking donor finance for planned construction projects and for an ambitious telecommunications development program. Finally, the staff recommended that the capital budget be set within the context of a well-formulated medium-term investment program. 15. The government took the view that some use of RERF income in 2003 was justified, and proposed exploring alternative mechanisms for increasing revenue rather than cutting expenditure. The authorities noted that they were applying conservative fiscal accounting principles by treating investment income from the RERF as financing rather than as revenue. They also suggested that the fall in the capital value of the RERF since 2000 strengthened the case for using some of the proceeds rather than reinvesting all of them, because of the risk of further losses on investments, and said that they were under some pressure from donors to use RERF income alongside or instead of donor resources. They indicated that they were also considering options to increase investment income from the RERF, including diversifying its holdings into higher-return assets and appointing a third fund manager. The government saw scope for raising revenue by charging rents for use of high altitude airspace above Kiribati, selling the country’s internet domain name, selling leases on small islands for tourism development, and selling fishing rights in the EEZ to a single buyer to maximize revenue. 16. The staff stressed the need for caution in using the RERF. Income from the RERF has consistently been classified as financing in the past, and any change in the treatment would give the impression of a loosening of policy on the RERF. The staff also saw the fall in the market value of the RERF in recent years as a reason to be more, rather than less, conservative on its use. The authorities should also avoid speculative schemes, like using part of the RERF to purchase real estate in an attempt to increase returns on it.7 17. With regard to revenue, rather than relying on ad hoc revenue schemes the authorities should consider reforming the tax system and replacing tariff revenues that will be lost under new trade agreements. While some of the government’s ideas, such as selling leases for tourism, were worth exploring, the authorities should not base budget projections on uncertain revenues. Over the medium-term, the main priority is finding alternative sources of revenue to replace tariff revenues which would fall when new trade agreements came into full effect (see paragraph 25). To this end, the staff urged the authorities to consider adoption of a Value Added Tax (VAT) or general sales tax, and to 7 Recent developments and policy issues on the RERF are discussed further in a Selected Issues paper which will accompany this report. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- improve tax administration. PFTAC has offered technical assistance on both of these recommendations, The authorities said that they would consider this. They welcomed the offer of assistance, but remained concerned about their capacity to implement a VAT. On other revenue issues, the staff noted that there had been a significant increase in revenue from the issuance of Green Passports in 2002.’ Procedures for issuing these may not be adequate to ensure that these are not bought by criminals, and the staff recommended that the government cease selling them. 18. Plans for the budget have been put on hold because of the dissolution of Parliament, but the new government and Parliament will face similar issues to those faced by their predecessors. Kiribati is currently operating on a restrained budget, with nongrant financed expenditure approved for the first eight months of the year equivalent to only about 55 percent of the expenditure proposed for the full year in the draft budget. The authorities should be able to finance this from current revenues, possibly with modest drawdowns from the Consolidated Fund and the Development Fund. However, the new government will need to decide whether it gives priority to increased spending, or to setting expenditure based on projected revenues, grants and concessional loans, and avoiding use of income from the RERF this year. B. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies 19. Kiribati’s longstanding use of the Australian dollar as its domestic currency has helped to underpin economic stability and remains appropriate. Australia is the largest trading partner and the largest aid donor, as well as the headquarters of the country’s sole commercial bank. Competitiveness is not presently a matter of concern, given the depreciation of the REER since 1997, provided that macroeconomic stability is maintained.’ Kiribati maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. There are no significant restrictions on capital flows. Kiribati does not have a central bank. There remains a large spread between deposit rates (which average about 2 percent) and average lending rates (which average about 10 percent). This probably reflects a reasonable assessment of commercial risk on domestic lending. * Green Passports are investor passports which can be purchased from the Kiribati government by foreign nationals and used to establish residency in other countries. They are mostly bought by Chinese nationals to establish residency in Macao, Province of China. The sale of Green Passports generated revenue equivalent to 6 percent of GDP for the government in 2002, but has not resulted in any additional investment. Kiribati Green Passports are not recognized by many countries, including Australia and the United States. 9 Data on unit labor costs and changes in market share are not available. However, as the prices of most of Kiribati’s sources of income (fishing licenses, seamen’s remittances and copra) are set in U.S. dollars, the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2000 helped competitiveness.

The staff broadly supported the government’s policies and reform agenda in the financial sector. The government’s intention to submit the draft Financial Institutions Act to Parliament this year and to consult affected institutions in preparation for this was welcome. lo The government’s decisions to reduce the guaranteed rate of return on KPF assets from 11 percent to 7 percent, in line with developments in global financial markets, and to raise contribution rates to ensure the financial solvency of KPF also appear sound. The commitment of the authorities to combat money laundering and ensure that terrorism is not financed through Kiribati is also welcome. Specifically, the staff welcomes the government’s preparation of draR legislation on money laundering, on which the Fund is planning to advise the authorities. 21. Some steps could be taken to improve management of financial institutions in which the government has a stake. The staff would advise the government not to agree to further BOK loans to public enterprises like that approved recently for TSKL. Government- guaranteed loans to public enterprises risk poor project evaluation, and the resulting contingent liability for the government could be substantial. The proposed Guarantee Corporation raises similar issues, although it could provide useful support for small businesses. Finally, the rise in the nonperforming loans ratio of DBK is a source of concern, and DBK should tighten its procedures for evaluation of loans. D. Structural Policies 22. The most pressing need is for policies that will encourage private sector development and investment. The staff stressed that the government should withdraw from activities normally carried out by the private sector, especially in sectors such as manufacturing, hotel management, and retail sales (Box 5), and privatize public enterprises where possible. Private sector development was a key element of the government’s policy framework for 2000-2003, as outlined in the National Development Strategies. However, the authorities were concerned about the limited capacity of the private sector to increase employment and about the effect of a government withdrawal on the provision of services, and the prices that would be charged for those services by the private sector. In response, the staff argued that public enterprises had not been able to supply services efficiently and at reasonable prices without large subsidies, and that these subsidies undermined the development of private sector companies. If the authorities were to withdraw, especially from areas such as retail sales, competition among private companies would be more likely to develop and prices and services offered to consumers to improve. Withdrawal could be gradual in areas where the private sector was not already active. The government could also make it easier for foreign businesses to invest in Kiribati by simplifying investment procedures and by extending the maximum length of leases on land which can be held by lo The draft law provides for the licensing supervision and regulation of financial institutions. It also sets conditions for the entry of new financial institutions to the system.

This raises the effective tax rate on repatriated earnings from 30 percent to 5 1 percent. Box 5: Public Enterprises Kiribati has many public enterprises that span a large part of economic activity. There are 28 fully owned public enterprises (PEs), one joint venture with a majority government interest and three with a minority interest. Some of these PEs have statutory monopolies (the Public Utilities Board (PUB), the Solar Energy Company, the Kiribati Insurance Corporation, and the Kiribati Provident Fund), while others are in practice monopoly suppliers (the Bank of Kiribati, Air Kiribati for domestic air transport, the Plant and Vehicle Unit). Several PEs are large: the Kiribati Ports Authority and Kiribati Shipping Services both have assets which exceed 10 percent of GDP, and the financial PEs have assets exceeding 50 percent of GDP. Several PEs operate in areas that in many other countries are left for the private sector, and where there is no clear public policy purpose served by their presence. For example, there are eight PEs involved in various aspects of wholesale and retail trade, covering trade of anything from ordinary household goods to handicrafts and petroleum products. PEs are also involved in running hotels, shipping, production of seaweed and producing biscuits. A number of the PEs receive significant support from the budget. Subsidies from the budget for current spending have varied between 5 and 10 percent of GDP over the last decade, and there are also transfers through the development budget. One notable example is the PUB’s new power generator financed by a $A 20 million grant from Japan. Government subsidies and other preferential treatment, including through government purchasing policies, provide PEs with an significant advantages in relation to private sector competitors. PEs often do not operate on a commercial basis, and supervision is limited. Several PEs have negative returns despite being sheltered from competition and receiving subsidies. This may in part be justified by policy mandates that restrict their operations or oblige them to supply services (e.g., transport) at below-market prices. However, the budgets of many PEs are left without public or parliamentary scrutiny, and the boards of the PEs (rather than the Public Service Office) decide on hiring and salaries. In addition, audits are conducted with significant lags. For example, at the end of 2002, more than half of the PEs had not been audited in the previous two years. Scrutiny of operations is also limited, the service provided by many PEs is poor, and maintenance of infrastructure by PEs is a commonly cited problem. In part this may be caused by PEs having limited funds for maintenance, but being able eventually to get ageing equipment replaced by the government or donors. 23. The authorities should make strong efforts to maintain and improve infrastructure. Despite substantial donor support in recent years, power and water supply in ” Foreigners are not allowed to own land under Kiribati law.

Some projects currently underway-notably improvements to the water and sewerage system financed by the AsDB-were likely to result in improvements in the situation. However, these gains would only be preserved if the authorities allocated sufficient funds for maintenance of new facilities. This should be given priority in the new budget. 24. The staff welcomed recent government initiatives and a proposed AsDB project to promote development of the outer islands. Recent initiatives by the government, with donor support, to provide infrastructure for seaweed and pearl farming in the outer islands were good examples of public and private sector cooperation. The proposed AsDB project (which is described in more detail in Box 6) also had the potential to create significant improvement in the prospects of the outer islands. However, the staff cautioned that government cofinancing of the project would need to be consistent with macroeconomic and budget priorities. E. Trade and Statistical Issues 25. Average tariffs are likely to fall as new trade agreements become effective, and Kiribati’s trade policy is liberal in other respects. Kiribati does not have any significant nontariff barriers and its overall trade restrictiveness rating is 3.12 The average tariff rate is 19 percent, with a range from 0 to 80 percent. Kiribati endorsed the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) with 14 other PICs in 200 1. The agreement has now been ratified by the six countries needed for it to come into effect, and will reduce the tariff rate within the region to zero over lo-12 years. In addition, countries in the region (including Kiribati) are negotiating WTO-consistent reductions in tariffs with the E.U. under the Cotonou agreement to become effective in 2008 and tariff reductions with Australia and New Zealand under the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER). The authorities reported that Kiribati did not face any significant market access barriers in its major export markets. 26. The quality of statistics remains poor. The weakness of the statistical base is in part due to understaffing of the National Statistics Office. l3 Last year the authorities published the Kiribati Statistical Yearbook, a notable achievement. However, the deficiencies in the available statistics limit the authorities’ ability to use statistics in economic planning. The staff encouraged the authorities to give more weight to statistics in allocating resources, and to work towards producing quarterly Economic Indicators, as recommended by PFTAC in 2000, to develop a country page for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics and Government Financial Statistics, and to submit GDDS metadata, in preparation for subscription to the GDDS. The staff also requested that the authorities increase the coverage and frequency of data sent to the IMF area department. l2 On a scale from l-10 where 1 is the most open trade regime. l3 The statistics department has seven staff, and the three most senior staff members were away on extended study leave at the time of the mission. A Selected Issues chapter on statistics contains a more detailed analysis of this issue.

Almost half of the population of about 85,000 lives in Tarawa, but the rest is dispersed among many islands. All islands other than Tarawa are known as the “outer islands”. They are generally poorer and less integrated into the cash economy, though the quality of life on them may be in some respects higher, as pollution and overcrowding are problems on Tarawa. Government policies are designed to promote development of the outer islands in a number of ways. There is cross-subsidization of shipping to the islands; the government buys copra (the islands’ main product) at a guaranteed and subsidized price; efforts are underway to improve roads and telecommunications in the islands; and in recent years the government has created a number of village banks to bring financial infrastructure to the islands, as the main financial institutions only have branches on Tarawa and Kitirimati.’ However, migration to Tarawa has continued in recent years, in part because of better services on Tarawa, in part because of the centralization of government activities there, and because the government is still the main employer in Kiribati. The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) also plans to give assistance through its Outer Islands Development Program (OIDP). This will involve the creation of a trust fund, with contributions from the AsDB (US$10.5 million) but also with an equal contribution from the Kiribati government and contributions from local communities, to support projects which will be proposed and managed on each island by a community committee. At present, the OIDP is still at the planning and evaluation stage, but the substantial finance and assistance in project evaluation from the AsDB suggests that there is scope for implementation of projects which will significantly improve the quality of life in the outer islands. However, the AsDB project will have to overcome a number of problems, which have beset earlier attempts to develop the outer islands, and the government may not be able to afford the contribution which the AsDB plans to seek from it. An absence of community ownership has in previous cases led to failure to maintain capital projects funded by donors or the central government. It will also be difficult to design local decision-making structures which are representative and which can operate alongside informal-and largely patriarchal-local government bodies based around the Maneaba (community meeting place). Finally, the government and local communities may not have the financial resources to contribute to the project in the way that the AsDB envisages. A government contribution of the order currently being considered, which could fall due in 2004, would either preempt most other government-funded development spending in that year or would need to be financed from RERF income, in amounts which would not be consistent with the policy of limiting drawings to levels which maintain its real per capita value. ‘The village banks are discussed further in a Selected Issues paper which will accompany this report.

If policies were to be as proposed in the recent draft budget the staff would project continued low growth, the emergence of large budget deficits, and a fall in the real per capita value of the RERF’. Table 4 shows projections of the medium-term scenario on the basis of these policies. l4 There is some improvement of the budget balance in 2004 due to a decline in government-funded development expenditure, but thereafter fiscal deficits increase steadily, and substantial drawings on the RERF are needed to finance them, resulting in a decline in the per capita value of the RERF. In the absence of structural reforms to promote private sector development, growth would continue to be low and per capita GDP would fall. The still substantial value of the RERF would allow the authorities to pursue these polices for some time, but at a cost of reducing the resources available for future generations. 28. If the new government takes steps to improve the budget position and implement structural reforms to promote growth, prospects will be brighter. Table 5 shows the staffs projections of the medium-term scenario on the basis of reform policies, The scenario is illustrative, as it is difficult to quantity the effects of reform on growth. Fiscal adjustment would lower the growth rate in 2003, but the effect on domestic output would be limited, because most government spending results in higher imports. After 2003 there would be higher growth and increases in per capita income as structural reforms stimulate private sector activity to take the place of government spending. In these projections, the real per capita value of the RERF is preserved with average annual drawings of about 3 percent of GDP, consistent with the analysis in Annex I, with the remainder of the fiscal deficits being financed from projected available external financing on concessional terms. Revenues exceed current government spending (which was the case throughout most of the 1990s) but most development spending is still funded from grants and external concessional loans. External financing is expected to be higher than it would be under less ambitious policies, as donors respond favorably to reform initiatives. The debt level would increase, but as all borrowing is on highly concessional terms, debt service would remain manageable (less than 3 percent of exports of goods and services). The balance of payments improves, although by less than the budget, as higher private investment results in some increase in imports. 29. Even under the reform scenario there are risks arising from Kiribati’s dependence on revenues from fishing licenses and on external grants and from environmental changes. Vulnerability indicators are shown in Table 6. However, the most immediate vulnerabilities arise from weather-related variations in income from fishing licenses. Income has been exceptionally high in the last two years, but in addition to shifting weather patterns is also vulnerable to over-fishing. Donor assistance has also been substantial in recent years, but there is some concern among donors about aid dependence. Finally, l4 The authorities’ medium-term policies are set out in successive National Development Strategies, which generally cover a four year period. The most recent was prepared in 2000 and covers the period through 2003. It is expected that a new National Development Strategy will be prepared by the government which emerges from the elections.

On the latter, enforcement of key provisions of the Environment Act, especially the prohibition against “sand mining” for construction, would help. 30. However, there are also opportunities for medium-term development. Marine development and tourism are potential sources of growth. The authorities informed the staff of their intention to seek an extension of Kiribati’s EEZ to the continental shelf, to take advantage of possible mineral deposits in the unclaimed area. The Japanese government is also providing assistance for a marine survey of the existing EEZ for mineral deposits. On tourism, the government could explore the possibility of leasing land, especially in the Line Islands closest to Hawaii. However, in both marine development and tourism, the authorities should concentrate on developing infrastructure and creating an enabling environment for private sector development, rather than expanding the role of government further in pursuing economic opportunities. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 31. Kiribati’s growth has continued to be low since the last Article IV Consultation, and fiscal and balance of payments weaknesses have emerged. Growth was low despite a fiscal stimulus in 200 1, and two years of high revenue from fishing licenses and substantial external assistance. This was largely because most of the higher government expenditure, whether on public sector salaries or development spending, resulted in a corresponding increase in imports and hence a deterioration of the current account. The fiscal and balance of payments positions improved in 2002, as more of development expenditure was covered by external grants, and nontax revenues remained high. However, the prospects for 2003 and the medium term are clouded, since the increase in revenue is likely to be temporary, while the increase in expenditure over the last two years, especially that arising from higher public sector salaries and employment, will be difficult to reverse. 32. The government which takes office after the new elections should aim to preserve the fiscal consolidation achieved in 2002. The 2003 budget prepared by the last government, which involved a deficit of 30 percent of GDP, mostly financed by a rundown of government funds and use of income from the RERF, was not appropriate. The government which emerges from the elections to be held over the next three months should take a different approach, limiting overall expenditure to what can be financed from revenues, external grants and concessional loans, and should make room for locally-financed development expenditure by cutting current expenditure. This could be achieved by cutting subsidies to public enterprises, maintaining public sector salaries at current levels in nominal terms, and reducing government employment and the size of the public sector. 33. The government’s external assets provide a great deal of security, but the authorities need to resist pressures to allow their value to be eroded. The RERF has fallen in value over the last two years, mostly because of falls in the global equity markets in which about half of the fund is invested, but also because of some use of the income from the fund to finance the 2001 fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, its value remains very substantial, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - the authorities should not react by attempting to raise income by redirecting the investment policy towards high-risk areas such as property development. The current policy of reinvesting most of the income from the fund in bonds and stocks to preserve its real per capita value so that both current and future generations can benefit from it is appropriate. Implementing this policy will require that the government limit drawings on income to finance the fiscal deficit. Given the potential for adverse shocks (especially lower than average fishing license fees, and possible environmental problems) it remains prudent for the authorities not to rely on use of income from the REFCF as part of normal budgets. 34. The best way to improve the medium-term growth prospects is to maintain macroeconomic stability, and promote private sector development. The authorities have done a good job over the last several years in maintaining a low-inflation environment, in avoiding government borrowing which crowds out private sector credit, and in developing a small but sound financial sector. However, there is an imbalance between the public and private sectors. The public sector accounts for most formal employment and is engaged in activities in many sectors which are normally considered the domain of the private sector. The government should withdraw from areas such as retail sales and manufacturing, where there is no clear public policy purpose served by its presence, and promote competition among private companies to improve the services offered to consumers. Given the small size of the private sector, the authorities’ concern about its capacity to create sufficient employment is understandable, and withdrawal of the government could be gradual in areas where the private sector is not already active. However, developing the private sector is necessary for higher growth. Other steps that the authorities could take to promote private sector development include improvements in infrastructure, simplification of investment procedures, and eliminating distortions in the tax system which discourage investment. 35. Over the medium-term, there are risks but also opportunities for development. Kiribati remains heavily dependent on volatile revenues from fishing, which are dependent on the weather and on world prices. Environmental changes also pose risks for Kiribati. There is a chance that global warming could produce losses of land and a worsening of other environmental indicators such as availability of fresh water. There is also a more immediate risk of coastal erosion and pollution arising from poor environmental practices. Technological improvements which permit the identification and extraction of mineral resources from the deep ocean may provide Kiribati with an additional source of rents over the long term. More immediately, the authorities could, in conjunction with the private sector, seek to develop a productive base in small-scale manufacturing for domestic consumption, in tourism, and in marine development. 36. There is a need to improve the quality and timeliness of economic statistics. While data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes, statistical deficiencies hamper economic planning. Allocation of increased resources and more efficient use of existing resources in this area would pay dividends. 37. The staff recommends that Kiribati remain on the 24-month cycle.

This Annex presents an update of the analysis of the sustainable use of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) presented in the framework of the previous consultation (SM/01/164, Annex III). Specifically, the analysis aims at determining the maximum annual use of income from the RERF under which the per capita real value of the RERF, expressed in 1996 Australian dollars, would remain constant. This would also ensure that a similar level of resources from the RERF, in terms of per capita GDP, is available to current and future generations to provide a cushion against adverse developments or to finance public expenditure. 2. To determine maximum allowable drawdowns over the long run, projections of the real per capita value of the RERF were made out to the year 2050, based on the following assumptions: 0 An annual nominal portfolio rate of return (including interest, dividends, and trading gains) of 5 % percent, based on the World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections of long-term bond yields in industrial countries. This is somewhat lower than in the previous simulation, owing to expected lower global yields in coming years. . Real GDP growth in line with the medium term scenario, which stabilizes at 3 percent per annum at the end of the projection period. a Inflation of 2 % percent per annum, in line with the medium term projections. 3. Using the above assumptions, three scenarios are presented in the table: a zero-use scenario where no drawdowns are made, a high-use scenario where drawdowns are projected at 10 percent of GDP annually, and a scenario which conserves the real per capita value of the fund-the sustainable scenario. 4. In the sustainable scenario, the annual use of income equivalent to around 3 percent of GDP, or $A 3.2 million in 2003, preserves the real per capita value of the fund at a broadly constant level. The zero-use scenario leads to an increase in the per capita value of about 40 percent. In the high-use scenario, which is equivalent to drawings of around $A 10 million in 2003, the value of the fund declines by 85 percent over the projection period. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the real per capita value of the fund in the three scenarios. 5. The analysis is highly sensitive to the assumptions, especially on the real rate of return and population growth. Figure 2 illustrates the effect on the real per capita value of the RERF of different returns on investments. It demonstrates the importance of monitoring trends in key indicators closely, especially since significant uncertainty surrounds the projections.

The REW, although by far the largest, is not the only government fund with external assets, and Kiribati also has some external loans. Using the government’s net foreign asset position of $A 583 million (i.e. increasing the fund by about $A 7 million) as the starting point for the analysis, the sustainable drawdown is virtually unchanged (3.3 percent of GDP). This analysis is equivalent to the government paying off the external debt with its available funds. Since external borrowing is on concessional terms (1 percent service charge) and the projection uses a return on the fund of 5.5 percent, this would not be a recommended policy but the calculation is presented to get a sense of the government’s consolidated asset position.

Kiribati also sent 8 officials to regional seminars and workshops. PFTAC organized 5 attachments (i.e., temporary posting/training positions) for tax and customs officials to sister institutions in other Pacific Countries. Public Financial Management Since 2000, two missions have focused on reviewing the implementation of performance budgeting and familiarizing the authorities with the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency. The advisor also helped prepare an action plan to prioritize and sequence reform plans in the public expenditure management area. Tax Administration and Policy A short-term visit took place in February 2003 in the tax area, after three missions between 1997 and 2001 on customs. The advisor suggested that a formal request be made for a full TA mission to undertake an in-depth review of current organization process and procedures and design the modernization of the Tax Department. PFTAC was concerned by the low level of compliance, the lack of audit and equipment, and the absence of a uniform TIN. Customs modernization is hampered by the desire of the authorities to implement ASYCUDA if they find the financing. While ASYCUDA appears large for the low level of customs traffic (one boat a month and four flights a week), modernization and automation could be achieved at low cost by extending the PC/Trade software currently used by Statistics only. Attachments organized and training included two senior officers at the Commonwealth Tax Administrators Management Courses, one at an Integrity workshop operated by Australian Customs for the Oceania Customs Organization (OCO), and two wil the Fiji Inland Revenue Department. ch Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision PFTAC took part in a LEG mission (July 2002) to draft legislation on supervision and regulation of banks and financial institutions (private and public). The draft is still under review by the authorities. An advisor also took part in a “road show” organized by the Forum (in 1998) on undesirable financial activities.

The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved six project loans to Kiribati amounting to US$l5.1 million, all from Special Fund resources. In addition, technical assistance amounting to US$10.3 million has been provided for 36 projects. The first loan for Kiribati since 1990 was approved by AsDB on December 1998 for a Sanitation, Public Health, and Environment Improvement project. No loans were approved since then. A US$10.5 million loan for Outer Islands Development Program to reduce poverty, strengthen local governance, and enhance sustainability in Kiribati’s outer islands is expected to be approved in late 2003. The loan and its associated technical assistance projects will assist the Government in: (i) strengthening local governance and community participation in development decisions, especially for disadvantaged groups; (ii) improving economic and social services on the outer islands; (iii) providing an additional and steady flow of development finance for island communities; (iv) improving the institutional environment for island development; and (v) building capacity for island development project management. 2. AsDB’s strategy for Kiribati focuses primarily on promoting good governance, enhancing social development, and creating the conditions for pro-poor economic growth. The strategy includes ways to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the public sector and strengthen the Government’s strategic planning capacity for sustainable poverty reduction. It will also ensure access to safe water and proper sanitation in South Tarawa; improve living conditions and access to basic social services on the outer islands; promote greater domestic use of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund resources for priority sectors; and create an enabling environment for private sector development. 3. AsDB will remain engaged in its assistance in improving its water and environmental management in South Tarawa and in identifying policy changes for outer island development. Ongoing policy dialogue with the Government will continue to focus on good governance, services delivery, and sound economic policy and management. Discussions on establishing a community-based outer islands trust fund and the poverty partnership agreement will also continue.

No data are currently provided to the Fund on a regular basis. Kiribati has few statistical publications, and weaknesses remain in the statistics on government finance, national accounts, and balance of payments. Technical assistance is needed in these areas, including from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC). 1. Real Sector Technical assistance in national accounts was provided by the Asian Development Bank (1989), PFTAC (1994), and Statistics Department (STA) (1995). Estimates of GDP at constant prices by industry are available for the period 1979 to 2002; however, the quality of the deflators and of the survey data needs further improvement. There are no expenditure- based estimates of GDP. The monthly retail price index (October 1996=100) is produced with a lag of about two months, based on a survey in Tarawa. The weights were updated in 1999 to reflect the 1996 household survey. There are no producer, wholesale, or trade price indices. 2. Government Finance Kiribati does not report any government finance statistics (GFS) data to STA for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The latest available data based on GFS classification is for 2000, with the data for 2001 under compilation. A provisional budget outcome is available for 2002. 3. Balance of Payments The latest balance of payments statistics reported by Kiribati are for 200 1, but some data are missing. The large net errors and omissions in the balance of payments data appears to reflect the underestimation of private transfers, including seamen’s remittances and other foreign exchange receipts. Quarterly trade statistics are available with variable and long lags, while monthly foreign reserves data are available with a lag of about one month. Consistency between the balance of payments data and budget and financial sector data is variable. 4. Monetary Accounts Kiribati does not report monetary accounts to STA. During the 2003 Article IV consultation, 2001 and 2002 annual balance sheets for the Bank of Kiribati, Development Bank of Kiribati and Kiribati Insurance Corporation and the 2001 annual balance sheet for the Kiribati Provident Fund were provided.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati On June 16, 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Kiribati.’ Background GDP grew by less than 2 percent annually in 2001 and 2002, below the estimated increase in population. GNP grew significantly in 2001, due to an increase in revenues from fishing license revenues, but fell back in 2002. GDP growth has been held back in part by poor performance of agriculture, especially declines in copra production. Growth was also slowed by continued infrastructure problems and lack of progress in creating an enabling environment for private sector investment. There has been almost no foreign direct investment since 2000. Inflation in most recent years has been modest, reflecting Kiribati’s use of the Australian dollar as its domestic currency. Inflation was 7.3 percent in 2001, due mostly to the pass-through effects of a depreciation of the Australian dollar against other currencies but fell to about 1 percent in 2002. Budget revenues and grants have been strong in recent years, but Kiribati is vulnerable to reductions in fishing license fees or external grants. Tax revenue has fallen slightly over the last two years (by about 2 ‘/2 percent of GDP, to 25 percent of GDP). Total revenue including grants increased by about 20 percent of GDP in 2001, to 122 percent of GDP, due to record revenues from fishing license fees which amounted to over 50 percent of GDP, and increased further in 2002 to 135 percent of GDP, due to an increase in grants equivalent to about 25 percent of GDP that more than offset a small decline in fishing license fees. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the June 16, 2003 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4l- ANNEX VIII Government expenditure increased significantly in 2001 and remained at a high level in 2002. Current spending increased by over 35 percent in 2001, due to increased personnel costs following an increase in both public sector wages and the workforce, higher subsidies to public enterprises, and higher expenditure on government services. Development expenditure increased by over 85 percent, and total government spending in 2001 amounted to 139 percent of GDP. Spending was cut to 136 percent of GDP in 2002, with further increases in development spending being offset by cuts in current spending on services. About one-third of the fiscal deficit of 17 percent of GDP in 2001 was financed by external loans, with the remainder being financed by use of income from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), Kiribati’s main external reserve fund. In 2002, the deficit was cut by to less than 1 percent of GDP, financed by external loans, as more of development expenditure was covered by external grants. The current account worsened in 2001 to near balance for the first time in several years, in line with the higher fiscal deficit, but improved in 2002 to a surplus of 8 percent of GDP. The current account deterioration in 2001 occurred despite higher income from fishing licenses and was largely a result of increased imports related to development expenditure. In 2002, the trade deficit increased further to 88 percent of GDP, but the current account improved due to continued high income from fishing licenses and to higher transfers to the government (33 percent of GDP). The stock of external debt was 17 percent of GDP at the end of 2002. External borrowing is entirely on concessional terms, mostly from the AsDB. Debt service remained low, at around 2 percent of exports of goods and services in 2002. Progress on structural reform has been limited in recent years. New legislation on procurement and the environment was enacted in 2002, and the government’s investments in education began to bear fruit, with completion of the junior secondary schools. However, the new Environment Act has not been enforced yet, and little progress has been made in translating into action the government’s intention to promote private sector development, as expressed in the National Development Strategies for 2000-2003. Majority ownership of the Bank of Kiribati (BOK) was transferred to the private sector, but TSKL, the telecommunications company, reverted to a wholly owned government corporation, and government activity increased in the agriculture sector (construction of a publicly operated copra mill) and in transport (leasing of a new jet by Air Kiribati). Inadequate and poorly maintained infrastructure remains a significant constraint on development and growth.
