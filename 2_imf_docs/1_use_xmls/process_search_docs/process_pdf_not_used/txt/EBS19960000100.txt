The balance of payments, however, remained weak. 0 A unified market-determined exchange rate regime was put in place during the third quarter. However, fiscal and monetary policies were relaxed and the rate of inflation rose again. 0 During the consultation discussions, the authorities committed to take corrective policy measures in November-December, and to make payments to the Fund of SDR 5.5 million in November and SDR 2.75 million in December. As of January 5, 1996, the Fund had received one payment of SDR 2.75 million on December 27, 1995. 0 The authorities presented their economic and financial program for 1996 which they hoped the staff could monitor informally. They committed to make monthly payments during 1996 that would stabilize arrears to the Fund. 0 In the staff's view, the authorities' proposals for 1996 could form a basis for a program the staff might be able to monitor. However, fiscal policy would need to be tightened to bring down inflation and protect the exchange reform. Also, performance and commitments with regard to payments to the Fund would need to be strengthened. 0 The authorities emphasized the absence of foreign assistance, which they view as impeding the consistent pursuit of adjustment policies and of payments that would reduce Sudan's arrears to the Fund. The staff indicated that lack of immediate foreign aid prospects does not make a weakening of the adjustment strategy or of cooperation with the Fund on payments a viable course of action; instead, it made strong performance all the more necessary. l A companion paper for the further consideration of the complaint regarding compulsory withdrawal of Sudan will provide updated information and will review the next possible steps.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Sudan were held in Khartoum during November 3-14, 1995. The staff team met with Finance Minister H.E. Abdallah Hassan Ahmed, the Governor of the Bank of Sudan, the Hon. Dr. Sabir Mohamed Hassan, and the Minister of State for Economic Planning and Investment, H. E. Mohamed Kheir El Zebeir, and other senior officials as well as representatives of the international community. u The staff also discussed relations between the Fund and Sudan with H.E. President Omar Hassan El Bashir. The last Article IV Consultation with Sudan was completed on January 13, 1995 (EBM/95/4). u On that occasion, Executive Directors welcomed the authorities' intention to implement a program of economic and financial adjustment for the fiscal year ending June 1995 of a quality that the staff could monitor, and noted Sudan's commitment to monthly payments that would reduce outstanding arrears to the Fund. Directors stressed that settlement of the overdue financial obligations to the Fund should be given the highest priority and urged the authorities to take additional measures as might be required to achieve the goals of their program. To this end, and in order to facilitate the formulation of a comprehensive follow-up r=w-~, a resumption of limited Fund technical assistance to Sudan was considered appropriate. w At present, the timeliness, quality, and coverage of Sudan's economic data, particularly with respect to national accounts and government finance statistics, needs to be improved (Appendix III). Sudan has been continuously in arrears to the Fund since July 1984. As of December 31, 1995, outstanding arrears to the Fund amounted to SDR 1,186.5 million. Following the issuance of the complaint by the Managing Director regarding Sudan's compulsory withdrawal (EBS/94/77; 4/8/94), the Executive Board has reviewed the matter on five occasions. On August 4, 1995 (EBS/95/77), the Executive Board determined that almost all the measures it had stipulated in its Decision of May 31, 1995, regarding economic policies and payments to the Fund had not been taken; any consideration of a Rights Accumulation Program (RAP) was therefore postponed. Directors urged the authorities to further strengthen and implement the program for the second half of 1995 that they had discussed with the staff, and to develop and implement a detailed and comprehensive u The staff representatives were Messrs. Ghesquiere (Head), Martelino, Iradian (all MED), and Mr. Gruenwald (PDR). Mr. Chabrier (Director, MED) joined the mission for the final round of discussions. u Sudan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. u Following Executive Board approval of a resumption of technical assistance, staff members from FAD and STA joined an MED team in Khartoum in March 1995. This was followed by an FAD mission in August, and an STA multisector mission in September-October.

During consideration of a status report on September 29, 1995 (EBS/95/158, g/22/95), Executive Directors noted that the exchange reform measures included in the May 1995 Executive Board decision had been implemented, but restated the importance of a strengthened track record in co-operating with the Fund. In these circumstances, the Article IV consultation discussions addressed the need to ensure that the objectives of the program for the second half of 1995 would be attained as closely as possible. Following a significant tightening in the first half of 1995, fiscal and monetary policies weakened considerably in the third quarter. The substantial reduction in inflation during the first semester gave way to renewed price pressures, and most of the performance targets for end-September were missed. In order to underpin the exchange reform measures that were adopted in September, the authorities agreed to take corrective fiscal and monetary measures that would bring policies back on track and help observe the credit limits for end-December 1995; they also renewed their commitment to make payments of SDR 8.25 million during October-December 1995 to stabilize the arrears to the Fund. Discussions on a program for 1996, within a medium-term framework, aimed at consolidating the gains achieved in 1994/95 toward macroeconomic stability and strengthening the balance of payments. u The authorities reiterated their commitment to co-operate with the Fund on payments and economic policies. They were concerned, however, that the social and political support for strong economic policies and for payments to the Fund had been eroded by the virtual disappearance of foreign financial assistance and stressed that adjustment fatigue was setting in. As a result, the authorities could accept only in part the staff proposals for 1996 on the stance of fiscal policy and the amount of payments to the Fund. The further consideration of the complaint with regard to Sudan's compulsory withdrawal is scheduled to take place on January 29, 1996, at the time of the 1995 Article IV Consultation. To this end, the Executive Board on December 18, 1995, amended the decision it adopted on August 4, which had called for further consideration before end-1995 (EBS/95/222, 12/14/95). A companion paper for the further consideration of the complaint regarding compulsory withdrawal of Sudan will be issued by mid-January. u u The fiscal year was shifted to coincide with the calendar year beginning in 1996. u The staff report for the Article IV consultation covers information available to the staff through end-1995. Updated information will be provided in a supplement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - II. Recent Developments 1. Background The three-year period that preceded the 1994/95 program was marked by economic policies and payments that failed to constitute adequate cooperation with the Fund. Although economic growth resumed in response to deregulation policies and successive seasons of favorable rainfall, large macroeconomic imbalances persisted (Chart 1). First, the rate of inflation remained over 100 percent owing to inadequate fiscal and credit policies. Improvements in fiscal policy, although significant, were slower than envisaged, while monetary policy was weak, involving rates of return that were negative in real terms. Rapid dollarization and depreciation of the currency in the parallel market further fueled inflationary pressures. Second, the balance of payments remained very fragile. This outcome is attributed to: the pursuit of expansionary demand management policies; the maintenance of multiple currency arrangements that continued to tax exports; and the virtual disappearance of foreign aid disbursements. Debt service payments were minimal, arrears became the principal source of financing, imports were further compressed, and international reserves remained depressed. The poor performance on economic policy and the cessation of payments to the Fund led to further remedial steps under the Fund's arrears strategy. Following the issuance of the complaint in regard to compulsory withdrawal in April 1994, the authorities indicated their intention to renew efforts to cooperate with the Fund by adopting a stabilization program covering 1994/95. In May 1994, the staff advocated a bold program involving no government recourse to bank borrowing and the establishment up front of a unified market-determined exchange rate. In the event, the authorities adopted a more gradual program for 1994/95 which the staff agreed to monitor informally. Since then, the Fund has maintained a close dialogue with the authorities, including frequent reviews by the Executive Board of Sudan's cooperation on economic policies and payments. 2. Performance under the 1994/95 orozram Fiscal policy in 1994/95, although somewhat less ambitious than had been advocated by the staff, constituted a significant improvement from the early 1990s (Table 1). Owing to a rebound in revenue and sustained expenditure containment, net domestic bank borrowing was reduced further from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1993/94 to 0.7 percent in 1994/95, with no government borrowing from the banks occurring during January-June 1995. Revenue rose significantly on account of higher prices of petroleum products and upward adjustments to the exchange rate used for custom duty valuation-- two measures undertaken by the authorities in September 1994. Revenue from direct taxes also improved as a result of measures introduced in March 1995, consistent with Fund technical assistance advice, while additional Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public, -4- Table 1.

Monetary policy during July-December 1994 was weaker than programmed but was brought back on track in the first semester of 1995. Demand for credit from the agricultural and other priority sectors was accommodated to a larger extent than foreseen in the program, and the benchmarks for end- December 1994 were missed. In March 1995, the Bank of Sudan tightened credit policy by raising mandatory reserve requirements and modifying its directives on commercial bank lending (under Islamic principles) in a way that raised the cost of borrowing and reduced its availability. u With inflation declining, the cost of borrowing from the banking system became positive in real terms. The tighter credit policy and improved government finances contained total credit expansion to 19 percent of beginning-period money stock in the twelve months ending June 1995 (down from 49 percent in the previous year) and the end-June credit benchmarks were observed. The rate of growth of broad money (M2) decelerated from 89 percent in 1993/94 to 54 percent in 1994/95, about as programmed (Table 2). Reflecting the tighter stance of fiscal and monetary policies, the twelve-month rate of increase in consumer prices fell from over 100 percent in December 1994 to 57 percent in June 1995, in line with the program objective. At the same time, real GDP grew by about 4.5 percent in 1994/95 mainly on the strength of continued advances in agriculture (notably rainfed crops). This favorable outcome has been attributed largely to the abundant and evenly distributed rainfall, better control of pest infestation, and L/ The March 1995 measures included: requirement to pay profit tax at the time of declaration; shortening of the period of tax appeal and prepayment of non-disputed elements; stiffer sanctioning of tax delinquencies; removal of certain exemptions; and restoration of the tax on passenger cars from 200 percent to 125 percent (see EBS/95/61, 3/31/95). In June 1995, additional tax measures were taken in line with the technical assistance recommendations of the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department, that should yield significant revenue in 1996. These measures comprised: the introduction of a flat tax rate of 40 percent applicable to all corporate profits, except in the case of financial institutions where the rate is 45 percent; a streamlining of tax schedules of profits of unincorporated businesses and personal income; and the introduction of a minimum tax of one percent of turnover (see EBS/95/125, 7/27/95). u The share of the customer's own financing in "Musharaka" lending operations was raised from 55 percent to 75 percent for local trade, and from 10 percent to 30 percent for priority sectors. In addition, the up front repayment of principal under "Murabaha" operations was raised from 35 percent to 50 percent. Also, banks were instructed to call overdue loans (see EBS/95/61, p.4).

In addition, the recent privatization of state controlled agricultural marketing enterprises, including for cotton, sorghum, and groundnuts, has resulted in higher producer prices and better incentives for the farmers. The balance of payments outcome in 1994/95 was below expectations. Despite favorable harvests, recorded exports amounted to only US$424 million, as against a program target of US$616 million, mostly because of shortfalls in shipments of gum arabic, livestock, and sorghum (Table 3). Delays in implementing the needed exchange reform measures led to stockpiling of certain products in anticipation of a more depreciated exchange rate, and illegal exports reportedly rose. Imports fell by 16 percent to US$l billion owing to the tight demand management policies, the depreciation of the exchange rate in the parallel market, shortages of foreign exchange in the official market, and a further decline in official inflows. As a result, the external current account deficit narrowed to USS1.4 billion (20 percent of GDP). Official transfers and loan disbursements, mainly from the United Nation Development Program (UNDP), the World Food Program (WFP), and the African Development Bank/Fund (AfDB/F), dropped to US$132 million (compared with US$844 million in 1990/91). 1/ In the event, the programmed accumulation of net official reserves (US$30 million) did not take place as reserves registered a small decline. The liberalization of the exchange system remained limited during 1994/95. The Bank of Sudan eased the special surrender requirement whereby it influenced the exchange rate in the interbank market (see EBS/95/125). However, the spread between this exchange rate and the rate in the parallel market, although significantly more narrow than in 1993/94, remained at about 19 percent by June 1995. Measures were taken in May 1995 to encourage exports: exporters of selected products (covering one third of total exports) were allowed to retain fifty percent of export proceeds; and the five percent export tax was abolished for selected commodities. a However, the multiple exchange rate system remained in place. III. Policy Discussions The 1995 Article IV discussions were conducted against the backdrop of a relaxation of fiscal and credit policies and a resurgence of inflationary pressures at the time of a major liberalization of the exchange rate regime. Foreign assistance had dropped to historically low levels. Fighting in the south had resumed following the end of the rainy season. Under those conditions, the staff stressed the urgency of bringing the program for July- December 1995 back on track. In addition, the authorities were encouraged u After the portfolio restructuring operation of.the AfDB/F in May 1995 and subsequent disbursements, over US$lOO million (all AfDF) remains in the pipeline. u See Appendix V for a description of Sudan's exchange and trade system.

Finally, discussions brought to the fore the importance of renewed official inflows in any viable medium- term scenario and the need to create the conditions that will make this possible. 1. Performance during July-September 1995 During discussions in May 1995 on a program for the second half of 1995, the staff strongly recommended a continuation of tight monetary and fiscal policies and the adoption of a unified market-determined exchange rate by end-June 1995 at the latest. The aim was to maintain the momentum of inflation reduction, thereby creating a supportive climate for exchange rate unification, and to strengthen the balance of payments and the authorities' capacity to make payments to the Fund. Achievement of these objectives would enable the authorities to build a track record of improved cooperation with the Fund. The Executive Board endorsed these staff proposals in its Decision on May 31, 1995. u While the authorities agreed on the direction of the staff proposals, they were of the view that the four measures related to exchange rate unification could not be implemented by the proposed target date of end-June 1995. They also had reservations about the staff proposals on fiscal policy and payments to the Fund. As a result, only the measure related to tax reform as part of the interim budget for the second semester of 1995 was adopted by June 30, 1995. In the event, the program the authorities adopted for the second half of 1995 was less ambitious than the staff had recommended. The authorities committed to limit net government borrowing from the banking system to LSd 25 billion (8 percent of Ml) and credit extension to the private sector and public enterprises to LSd 30 billion during July-December 1995, with a view to lowering the twelve-month rate of inflation to 45 percent by December 1995. The staff proposal had called for a more rapid reduction in inflation (to 35 percent) in order to support the exchange rate unification, bring about a decisive break in inflationary expectations, and take advantage of the favorable outlook for agricultural production. There also u The Decision of May 31, 1995 stipulated eight measures which the Executive Board expected to be taken by June 30, 1995. They were: (i) establish nonbank foreign exchange dealers; (ii) allow commercial banks to surrender 50 percent of export proceeds to the Bank of Sudan at their regular selling rate; (iii) permit exporters to retain half of their export proceeds in foreign currency deposits for subsequent sale to bank or non- bank dealers; (iv) allow banks to bid for bank deposits in foreign currency for their own account; (v) include structural tax reforms in the budget for July-December 1995; (vi) limit government borrowing to zero in the budget for the second half of 1995; (vii) reach understandings with the staff on a financial program for the remainder of 1995; and (viii) agree on a schedule of payments that would reduce outstanding arrears to the Fund by SDR 8 million during July-December 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - were differences on payments to the Fund, with the authorities committing to make monthly payments of SDR 2.75 million during the second semester, which was expected to stabilize arrears at their end-June 1995 level; the staff by contrast had proposed payments that would have reduced arrears by SDR 8 million during July-December. The adoption of a unified market-determined exchange rate--a benchmark originally agreed for December 1992-- took place in late September 1995. u This step was preceded by the licensing of non-bank foreign exchange dealers from July 1995 onward; by mid-November 1995, twenty-one such dealers were licensed and operating. The three remaining exchange rate measures stipulated by the Executive Board on May 31 were implemented on September 27, 1995. u Information available to the staff through end- November indicated that the system has operated smoothly, although the newly unified rate quickly depreciated to a level beyond that of the previous parallel market rate. The official exchange rate (defined as the weighted average selling rate) under the new system depreciated from LSd 620 per U.S. dollar as of mid-September 1995 to about LSd 800 per U.S. dollar in early November 1995 (Chart 2). However, the staff team considered that the instruction to sell export proceeds exclusively to commercial bank dealers constitutes a potential element of renewed market segmentation that warrants close monitoring, given the past experience of official and quasi-official intervention in determining the level of the exchange rate at government- owned banks, and should be rescinded. In the staff's view, the continued nominal depreciation of the exchange rate following unification points to inadequate support of fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal revenue during July-September 1995 was below target due to low collection of the one-percent minimum turnover tax (owing to difficulties in implementing a withholding mechanism), shortfalls in import duty collection (due to enforcement problems), and delays in price adjustments of petroleum products. In addition, the Government made extra- budgetary advances totalling LSd 13.5 billion in September 1995 to the Cotton Company and the National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, net bank borrowing by the Government during the third quarter amounted to LSd 43 u The exchange rates in the official interbank market and in the parallel market were unified in a single market-determined rate. However, a multiple currency practice related to the payment modalities of export taxes remains. 2/ The following measures became effective on September 27, 1995: (i) the requirement that commercial banks surrender 20 percent of export proceeds at the reference rate established by the Bank of Sudan was abolished; (ii) commercial banks were to surrender 50 percent of export proceeds at their regular buying rate plus a spread of LSd 3 per U.S. dollar; (iii) exporters were allowed to sell the remaining 50 percent of export proceeds to any commercial bank dealer; and (iv) commercial banks were authorized to transact freely foreign exchange for their own account with holders of foreign currency denominated deposits.

Moreover, credit policy was eased in the third quarter to accommodate loan demand for crop preparation and exports. Effective July 1, 1995 the credit tightening measures adopted in March 1995 (increase in reserve requirements and instruction of more onerous conditions for borrowing from banks) were reversed. Consequently, the limit for bank credit to the private sector and state enterprises for July-September (LSd 18 billion) was exceeded by LSd 6 billion. Reflecting the easing of fiscal and credit policies, the 12-month rate of inflation reversed its decline and reached 60 percent in September 1995 and 71 percent in October. The measures adopted in late September 1995 eliminated several exchange restrictions, including the remaining exchange restriction Under'Article XIV (the US$5,000 limit on the purchase of foreign exchange for travel abroad). Two multiple currency practices under Article VIII (relating to the compulsory sale by commercial banks of foreign exchange to the Bank of Sudan at its reference rate, and the official sanctioning of the parallel market) were also eliminated. However, there continue to be restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions that are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a); these arise from the external payment arrears on international obligations and a bilateral payment agreement with a Fund member. In addition, one remaining multiple currency practice subject to approval under Article VIII, section 3, results from the modalities of payment of export taxes. 2. Proeram for October-December 1995 The new exchange arrangement introduced in September 1995 should enhance the supply of foreign exchange. In fact, indications are that export growth is already picking up. However, the staff representatives cautioned that the new system remains vulnerable, particularly in light of earlier failed attempts at maintaining a market-determined exchange rate and Sudan's legacy of exchange rate intervention and multiple exchange rate practices. Supporting fiscal and monetary policies were therefore in need of considerable strengthening. The authorities concurred with this view and committed to take measures that would bring the program back on track and ensure that the quantitative benchmarks for end-December 1995 would be observed. As regards credit to the Government, the extra-budgetary advances to the Cotton Company and the Petroleum Corporation would be repaid in full in the coming weeks, a process that was already underway. They also would lower expenditure as required, in particular development outlays, with a view to bringing net bank borrowing by the Government within the ceiling of LSd 25 billion by end- December 1995. Similarly, if the data for end-October indicated that private credit was not reverting to the program path, the Bank of Sudan Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - would tighten credit immediately by raising the mandatory reserve requirements and the cost of borrowing from commercial banks. u However, the authorities' inflation goal for end-1995 appeared no longer attainable. 3. Prozram for 1996 a. Authorities' proposed economic policies The authorities reaffirmed their intention to continue on the path of economic stabilization and reform. Their objectives for 1996 include: (i) achieving real GDP growth of 7 percent; (ii) lowering the 12-month rate of inflation from 57 percent in June 1995 to about 30 percent by December 1996 and further to 20 percent by end-1997 and 10 percent by end-1998; and (iii) raising official international reserves, possibly by US$25 million. These objectives were to be attained by the continuation of tight fiscal and monetary policies and sustained adherence to a unified market-determined exchange rate policy. Taken together, the authorities hoped that the policies they had designed for 1996, combined with payments to the Fund, would constitute a program that if fully implemented would help build an improved track record of cooperation with the Fund. At the time of the Article IV discussions, the authorities were still preparing the 1996 budget for ministerial approval and subsequent presentation to the Parliament. Accordingly, full details could not be provided but would be made available to the staff after the approval of the budget in late December. Nevertheless, the authorities provided broad indications of the main revenue and expenditure categories and of the principal policy measures they envisaged as part of the budget. For the 1996 program, they were committed to hold net bank borrowing by the Government to LSd 60 billion (1 percent of GDP); this compares with actual net domestic borrowing of LSd 20 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) during 1994/95 (Table 1). As reconstructed by the staff, total revenue in the authorities' program would increase by 0.2 percent of GDP to 9.6 percent of GDP, while cash expenditure would increase somewhat more. The authorities clarified that fiscal revenue would benefit from the structural reform measures in direct taxation that were adopted in March and June 1995. In addition, the 1996 budget would incorporate import tariff reforms, comprising: (i) the application of a 5 percent minimum rate to most import categories (including those previously exempt); (ii) a reduction in the number of tariff categories from 13 to 7, combined with a compression in tariff dispersion from O-250 percent to 5-100 percent--measures that were expected to strengthen tax administration and improve efficiency; and (iii) the introduction of the first phase of the general sales tax at the level of imports in 1996. Also, the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to prepare during 1996 the introduction of a general sales tax covering u As of January 5, 1996, the staff had not received the monetary survey for end-October or information on policy measures taken. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - imports and domestic production on a non-discriminatory basis to become effective on January 1, 1997. Further in the structural area, divestiture of unproductive state enterprises would continue under the privatization program. Prices of energy products and the custom duty exchange rate would be adjusted periodically as needed to achieve the targets in the budget for these revenue categories. On the expenditure side, strict limits would apply to various categories, including wages. The authorities also reaffirmed their commitment to a restrained monetary policy. The growth of bank credit to the private sector and public enterprises will be limited in 1996 to LSd 50 billion, equivalent to 15 percent of narrow money (Ml) projected at end-1995; (this compares with credit expansion in 1994/95 equivalent to 22 percent of beginning period Ml). To achieve this goal, the Bank of Sudan would continue to rely on the monetary policy instruments currently in use (reserve requirements, instructions regarding lending conditions, and close monitoring of overdrafts against the commercial banks' free reserves). Based on the credit program, the fiscal policy stance described above, and the envisaged increase in net foreign assets, narrow money (Ml) was expected to grow by 40 percent during 1996, and broad money (M2) at about the same rate. b. Assessment of authorities' program and staff policy proposals Placing the authorities' program for 1996 in a medium-term context, the staff indicated that the envisaged reduction in the rate of inflation from over 60 percent at present to 10 percent by end-1998 required a more rapid reduction in inflation up front. Other key medium-term objectives and elements of the authorities' strategy (such as the balance of payments and external flows) would also need to be specified. Only a bold and coherent approach could provide credibility to the authorities' commitment and the probability of approaching price stability eventually. Clearly, without an early break in inflationary expectations, the final goal was likely to remain elusive. The staff team elaborated further that, in its view, the authorities' fiscal program for 1996 was insufficient to achieve the targeted inflation outcome of 30 percent by end-1996. A rapid fall in inflation was important to safeguard the recent exchange rate reform. To this end, a more ambitious fiscal program should be considered with a view inter alia to avoiding recourse to net bank borrowing by the Government during 1996. The announcement of the adoption of a budget for 1996 that had zero net bank borrowing would also send a powerful signal of support to the foreign exchange market. In order to achieve further fiscal consolidation, the staff recommended the following revenue measures: (i) quarterly adjustments to energy prices consistent with the formula adopted in September 1994 as part of the 1994/95 staff-monitored program (that aimed to maintain the price of gasoline at the equivalent of USS2.6 per gallon of 4.5 liter); (ii) full implementation of the FAD recommendations on the customs tariff reform; (iii) the immediate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - adoption of the actual exchange rate, with a one-month lag, for custom duty valuation; and (iv) improvement of the administrative machinery for collection of the minimum one-percent turnover tax and strict application of sanctions for non-payment or evasion. On the expenditure side, the staff recommended reductions in non-productive spending and contingency outlays, strict limitations on public sector wage increases, and reductions in non- priority development expenditure. Taken together and implemented early in 1996, these measures could eliminate the need for government borrowing from the banking system. Furthermore, the staff emphasized the need to rely on issuing bonds to the non-bank'public at a market-determined rate of return. The authorities responded that they are preparing such an issue linked to the rehabilitation of a petroleum refinery. In the event, however, they maintained their position of net bank borrowing of LSd 60 billion for 1996, with borrowing in the first half limited to LSd 15 billion. C. Foreign assistance and medium-term prospects In the authorities' view, the intended fiscal policy stance could not be tightened further because of the virtual disappearance of foreign assistance. They underlined that grant and loan disbursements of cash and commodity aid have plummeted from US$844 million in 1990/91 to US$132 million in 1994/95. At the same time, external interest obligations falling due approached US$l billion a year (12 percent of GDP). The staff acknowledged the role of foreign assistance in helping ensure medium-term economic viability, but stressed the primacy of policy improvement. Sustained implementation of appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies is crucial in order for Sudan to improve its economic performance, gain access to private capital, and facilitate a resumption of foreign assistance to finance profitable investments. Staff projections based on a working hypothesis of a continuation of external assistance at the current depressed level of about US$130-150 million per year, an extension of current policies, and average weather conditions, suggest that a rate of economic growth of about two percent could be envisaged over the medium term. Such a scenario would involve an unchanged investment ratio of about 14 percent of GDP, hardly any improvement in the external current account deficit currently at about 19 percent of GDP, and a continued decline in real per capita consumption (Table 4). An alternative scenario, by contrast, involved a broad policy framework which might be consistent with a limited resumption of aid. This framework would include the sustained implementation of strengthened policies, a coherent set of structural measures to lay the foundations for rapid growth and to raise domestic savings, and enhanced diplomatic efforts to break the stalemate over foreign assistance. Such conditions could create room for an increase in the investment ratio to about 17 percent and permit economic growth of up to 5 percent per year; real per capita consumption would stabilize and the external current account deficit would narrow by about 3 percentage points of GDP.

At present, Sudan's outstanding external debt amounts to about 250 percent of GDP and annual interest obligations to about 12 percent of GDP. Both indicators are expected to remain broadly at these levels over the medium term. Sudan's external debt situation is discussed more fully in a debt sustainability analysis to be issued as a supplement to this report. The staff noted that, while every effort should be made to normalize relations with external creditors and donors, a resumption of foreign assistance on a substantial scale is not imminent. At the same time, however, even if foreign assistance was unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future, the pursuit of sound policies, notably with a view to lowering inflation, was still the best course available to the authorities. Renewed inflation will only harm those segments of the population that are least equipped to protect themselves, hinder prospects for economic growth, and undermine the recent unification of the exchange rate system. In fact, the lack of foreign assistance ought to be viewed as one more reason to ensure the proper functioning of the new exchange rate system through adequate support from fiscal and monetary policies. d. Payments to the Fund and balance of pavments prospects Sudan made payments to the Fund of SDR 31 million during January- September 1995. Outstanding arrears to the Fund fell from SDR 1,189 million at end-1994 to SDR 1,183 million by end-June 1995 and further to SDR 1,182 million as of end-September 1995. As mentioned, the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to make payments of SDR 8.25 million during October- December 1995. They explained that payments after June 1995 had been delayed because of the lack of local currency deposits in the Government's account with the Bank of Sudan, but indicated that this issue would be resolved by mid-November. In the event, Sudan paid the Fund only SDR 2.75 million on December 27, 1995. For 1995 as a whole, Sudan's payments to the Fund amounted to 10 percent of estimated commodity exports, about 8 percent of budgetary revenue, and 74 percent of total external debt service payments. For 1996, the authorities committed to a monthly payment schedule that would stabilize arrears to the Fund; on this basis, payments of SDR 15.0 million would be required during the first semester. To help strengthen Sudan's track record of cooperation with the Fund, the staff proposed that payments be made of SDR 23 million during the first half of 1996--the same amount that was paid during the first semester of 1995. In the staff's view, payments of this magnitude would still allow an increase in imports of over one-fifth above the level reached in the first semester of 1995, owing in large part to the favorable impact of exchange rate reform on export performance expected for 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - Mainly as a result of the full year impact of the recently implemented exchange measures, the balance-of payments should strengthen in 1996, particularly the external current account. Assuming that the exchange system is maintained, exports are projected to increase from US$424 million in 1994/95 to US$637 million reflecting sizeable increases in cotton, gum arabic, and livestock. Also, the staff expects an increase in private transfers following the legalization of the former parallel market for foreign currency. Official flows of both grants and loan disbursements, however, are projected to remain largely unchanged in light of minimal progress made by Sudan in improving relations with donors and creditors. Overall, the balance of payments is expected to remain extremely weak, with over US$l.l billion in further accumulation of external arrears. The authorities expressed the view that payments to the Fund that would reduce the outstanding arrears in 1996 would preempt foreign exchange and budgetary resource that were needed for other purposes. They noted that payments to the Fund as proposed by the staff came close in magnitude to the local component of development expenditure in the budget and would be politically difficult to sustain. Accordingly, they stated that payments to the Fund beyond the minimum required to stabilize arrears would be made only if more foreign assistance was forthcoming. The staff expressed concern at the notion of a direct link between payments to the Fund and the level of foreign assistance that the international community makes available to Sudan. In the staff's view, the Fund's heavy involvement in encouraging economic policy reform in Sudan aimed at generating additional budgetary and foreign exchange resources that were designed to more than cover amounts paid to the Fund. Moreover, a direct link would not be well received by foreign donors and creditors. The staff also pointed out that the absence of foreign assistance did not lessen Sudan's obligation vis-a-vis other Fund members to seek a solution to the problem of arrears. Nevertheless, the staff indicated that there would be scope for bringing improvements in Sudan's cooperation with the Fund to the attention of potential donors, noting that for such a message to the international community to be credible, it would be important for Sudan first to establish a stronger track record in cooperating with the Fund in the areas of economic policies and payments on a sustained and timely basis. In addition, for improved cooperation to elicit support from the international community, it would be necessary for Sudan to overcome more effectively than in the past the political differences that separate it from potential donors.

Structural reform The authorities emphasized their resolve to continue the structural reform strategy on which they embarked in the early 1990s. In the public sector this includes, in addition to the direct and indirect tax measures discussed above, a further reduction in the role of the Central Government in production, as well as devolution of public finance functions from the central to state governments. The authorities indicated that during the first phase of the privatization program (1993-95), the Government had sold 17 public corporations; an additional 40 public entities had been restructured, merged with other state enterprises, or entered into joint ventures with private companies. The proceeds from sales of public enterprises amounted to about LSd 23 billion (about 5 percent of government revenue) in the 3-year period ending June 1995. The Government intends to sell an additional 51 public companies during 1996-98 as part of the second phase of its privatization program, with the aim of eventually selling up to 80 percent of all state corporations. In August 1995, a decree was passed that transferred a significant percentage of public services from the central to the state governments. As regards the financial sector, the Bank of Sudan intends to continue to strengthen prudential supervision of banks (in accordance with the "Banking Adaptation Scheme" issued by the Bank of Sudan in 1994). Its aim is to ensure compliance with the Base1 guidelines (adapted to conform with Sudanese legislation) by the target date of June 1997. In this connection, the Bank of Sudan is encouraging mergers of banks in an effort to strengthen their financial position. The staff urged the authorities to streamline the foreign exchange system further by: (i) generalizing the retention of 50 percent of export proceeds which is currently allowed for selected export commodities, to all export items and; (ii) reducing the mandatory surrender of export proceeds to the Bank of Sudan from the current 50 percent, pari passu with shifting imports of selected petroleum products from the Bank of Sudan to the foreign exchange market. The authorities responded that they preferred to first gain more experience with the current system. They noted that petroleum products are of strategic importance and that the generalized retention of export proceeds was equivalent to allowing a degree of freedom of capital outflows for which they were not ready. 2. Technical assistance The authorities expressed appreciation for the resumption of Fund technical assistance. An assessment of technical assistance needs was made during a joint mission comprising staff from the Fiscal Affairs, Statistics, and Middle Eastern Departments in March 1995, when FAD also advised on direct tax reform. In August, a follow-up FAD technical assistance mission made recommendations on tariff reform and the preparation of a general sales Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - tax for implementation by January 1, 1997. In September/October 1995, a STA multisector mission made a detailed assessment of Sudan's methodology and compilation systems for the national accounts, price indices, foreign trade, government finance, money and banking, and balance of payments statistics. Follow-up programs have been developed for this area, including the publication of national accounts estimates and the design of questionnaires for the balance of payments (see Appendix III). 3. Staff monitoring above The authorities proposed that their program for 1996--comprising the described financial policies and payments to the Fund to which they could commit--be monitored by the staff, and that periodic assessments be provided to the Executive Board. To this end, they renewed the mandate of the technical committee of government officials that is responsible for reporting information to the staff (Appendix VI). They also committed to a detailed work plan for improving the statistical data base (Appendix III). They further requested that a Rights Accumulation Program (RAP) be considered, once external financing assurances are in place, and that their performance record of cooperation with the Fund under the programs for 1995 and 1996 be fully taken into consideration. As indicated above, of the authorities' the staff expressed reservations about the quality proposals regarding economic policies and payments to the Fund for 1996, which in the staff's view did not make them suitable in their current form for informal monitoring. Full adherence by the authorities to their commitments for November-December 1995 would also be an important factor in deciding the scope for monitoring of the authorities' 1996 program by the staff. V. Staff ADpraisal 1. Cooneration with the Fund Consistent with their intention to improve cooperation with the Fund, the Sudanese authorities entered a program for the period June 1994-December 1995 which the staff was prepared to monitor informally. During the first half of 1995 the pursuit of tight fiscal and monetary policies led to a significant reduction in inflation. A unified, market-determined exchange rate regime was adopted in the second half of 1995, consistent with long- standing Fund policy advice. The authorities made payments that reduced arrears to the Fund during January-September 1995 by SDR 4 million. These are significant and commendable achievements, particularly against the backdrop of decades of misguided economic policies, one of the highest debt burdens in the world, and the virtual absence of foreign assistance. However, while recent efforts have been significant, the results obtained continue to be insufficient. The sheer scale of Sudan's problems requires policy efforts commensurate with the difficulties confronted. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - Policy performance in 1994-95 was marked by: (i) excessive gradualism in bringing down inflation; (ii) policy reversals in areas such as energy pricing and credit policy; and (iii) lack of coherence and mutual reinforcement of different policies, exemplified by the inadequate support of fiscal and monetary policies for the exchange reform. Sustained implementation of a bold and coherent set of policies in 1996 is all the more important in view of the need to overcome expectations conditioned by a long history of failed attempts at economic policy reform. The authorities' program did not benefit from a resumption of external assistance. Sudan's very high external debt implies that a fully adequate medium-term solution will require sustained implementation of appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies in order for Sudan to: (i) improve economic performance and raise domestic savings; (ii) gain access to private capital; and (iii) facilitate a resumption of foreign assistance at highly concessional terms. In a global environment of shrinking aid budgets, it will be imperative for Sudan to create the conditions that allow a resumption of foreign assistance. While Sudan has applied efforts in the diplomatic field, no results of significance have been reported. The staff is of the view that a combination of strengthened cooperation by Sudan with the Fund and courageous decisions at the highest levels to remove long- standing political obstacles to a resumption of foreign assistance should yield significant improvements. However, lack of prospects for an immediate resumption of foreign assistance does not make a weakening of the adjustment strategy a viable course of action. On the contrary, stronger and more effective adjustment policies become all the more necessary to achieve economic objectives and in order to persuade the international community to increase its support for Sudan. Sudan should articulate a credible medium-term policy framework that could form the basis for mobilizing financing on appropriate terms from multilateral and bilateral sources. Equally, the absence of foreign assistance does not justify a setback in cooperation with the Fund on payments. A prime objective of the Fund's dialogue is to help Sudan implement strengthened policies that will generate the fiscal revenue and export proceeds that should enable Sudan to make payments to the Fund and meet additional essential import needs and key development outlays. Pressures to divert toward other purposes financial resources destined for payments to the Fund, while understandable, should be resisted steadfastly. Improvement in Sudan's cooperation with the Fund will be essential to any comprehensive solution of its external debt problem. Discontinuity in cooperating with the Fund has led to costly setbacks, as recently as 1993 when the previous staff-monitored program foundered. In this connection, an accurate presentation by the authorities in public fora .of the constructive role the Fund plays in assisting Sudan can only be beneficial. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - The fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies for 1996 presented by the authorities provide a useful starting point for developing a program of a quality that the staff could monitor informally. However, recent developments demonstrate that in order to achieve the authorities' objectives for 1996, fiscal policy needs further strengthening along the lines recommended by the staff. Without such strengthening, the foreign exchange reforms will be increasingly at risk, as foreign exchange intervention will be advocated in a misguided attempt to stem domestic price increases, leading to renewed rationing and the reemergence of a parallel market on a significant scale. Payments to the Fund that reduce the amount of outstanding arrears are another essential element of establishing a strong and sustained track record of cooperation with the Fund. In the staff's view, the establishment of such a record by Sudan should be feasible and could help pave the way--provided adequate progress is made in obtaining financing assurances--for a PAP, if this approach remains available beyond April 1996. There remains a need to improve the quality, coverage, and timeliness of Sudan's economic and financial data. The authorities are strongly urged to adhere to the work plan for the improvement of the statistical data that has been developed in conjunction with recent Fund technical assistance missions. The technical committee should provide the necessary information to the Fund in a timely manner. 2. Exchange restrictions and consultation cycle Sudan recently eliminated the remaining restriction it maintained under Article XIV on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Although two restrictions subject to Article VIII were removed in September 1995, there continue to be other restrictions subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a), evidenced by external payment arrears and a bilateral payments agreement with a Fund member. In addition, Sudan maintains a multiple currency practice subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 3, which arises from the payment modalities of export taxes. The staff commends Sudan on the recent reforms leading to a market- determined exchange rate system. However, in view of the absence of a clear timetable for the removal of the remaining exchange restrictions, the staff does not recommend approval for the retention of these restrictions and the multiple currency practice. The staff urges Sudan to further liberalize the exchange system, and to design a comprehensive plan for resolving the problem of its external payment arrears. The staff also urges Sudan to remove as soon as possible the restrictive features of the existing bilateral payment agreement with a Fund member, so as to pave the way for the eventual acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Sudan will be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Fund takes this decision relating to Sudan's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Sudan conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63) adopted April 29, 1977 as amended (Surveillance Over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Sudan maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and a multiple currency practice that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, evidenced by the external payment arrears, a bilateral payment agreement, and the operation of export taxes. The Fund urges the authorities to eliminate the above stated restrictions and multiple currency practice, as well as the restrictive features of the bilateral payments agreement, as soon as possible.

Exchange and Trade Arranpement Since mid-1995, several measures have been implemented in the exchange area with the aim of unifying the official and the parallel market rates. In May, the Bank of Sudan issued regulations for non-bank foreign exchange dealers and began to accept applications. As of mid-November, 21 licensed nonbank dealers were operating with authorization to conduct foreign exchange transactions in the spot market, and six further applications were pending approval by the Bank of Sudan. The following measures were adopted on September 27, 1995: (i) all foreign exchange dealers (commercial banks and nonbanks) are authorized to freely set their buying and selling rates; (ii) the Bank of Sudan "reference rate" was eliminated, with commercial banks required to surrender 50 percent of export proceeds to the Bank of Sudan at their regular buying rate plus a spread of LSd 3 per U.S. dollar; (iii) exporters are allowed to sell the remaining 50 percent of export proceeds to any commercial bank dealer; (iv) commercial banks are allowed to freely transact foreign exchange for their own account with holders of foreign currency denominated deposits; and (v) sellers of foreign exchange to the non-bank dealers are not required to identify the source(s) of their foreign exchange. Under the new system, the official exchange rate (defined as the weighted average selling rate) depreciated from LSd 620 per U.S. U.S. dollar in November 1995. dollar in mid-September to about LSd 800 per VIII. Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation discussions were held during October 28- November 10, 1994. The Staff Report (EBS/94/245) was discussed by the Executive Board on January 13, 1995. In the.opinion of most Executive Directors, the 1994/95 program presented a first step and further measures were necessary in a number of areas, most notably to address the structural weaknesses in the fiscal, monetary, and exchange systems. IX. Technical Assistance Since the Executive Board approval in January 1995 of the resumption of limited Fund technical assistance to Sudan, two missions of technical assistance have taken place: (i) on tariff reform and sales tax (August 1995); and (ii) multisector assistance in statistics (September/October 1995). X. Resident ReDresentative The Fund's resident representative in Khartoum was withdrawn in June 1990.

The mission found that serious deficiencies affect the data systems and that the statistical agencies function under severe resource constraints. The mission concluded that considerable time and further external support would be needed to move the systems to international standards, including the implementation of major new surveys. Nevertheless, some progress can be achieved in the short term. A short- and long-term action plan was drawn and accepted by the authorities. u 1. Real Sector While the conceptual approach to real sector data is reasonably sound, some updating will be needed to bring the national accounts to the standards of the System of National Accounts (1993). Available source data are often poor, and crude estimation techniques rather than surveys form the basis for some of the national accounts components. There is an urgent need for the proposed census of agriculture, a household income and expenditure survey, and new surveys for other sectors. The consumer price indices also need to be rebased, as the underlying weighting scheme is obsolete. While trade statistics are reasonably sound, they need to be processed more quickly so as to be of use to compilers. 2. Money and Banking; The existing framework for money and banking generally conforms with Fund methodological standards, and considerable progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of the 1992 Fund technical assistance mission. Remaining issues in this area relate to ensuring comprehensive coverage of the banking sector in these data, improving the classification of accounts, and enhancing the timeliness of data compilation and reporting. Some progress was made in addressing these remaining issues during the recent multisector mission. 3. Government Finance Government finance data present a serious problem. At present, there is no comprehensive statistical presentation of general government operations, broadly defined to include budgetary accounts, extra-budgetary accounts, and the operations of local governments. This situation poses a serious impediment to the authorities' ability to measure the impact of government operations on the rest of the economy. The 1995 multisector jJ See "Sudan--Report of the Multisector Statistics Mission" (September 4-October 6, 1995). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - APPENDIX III . statistics mission gave high priority to the initiation of a program of compilation of government finance statistics that would follow the Fund's Manual of Government Finance Statistics, which entails the development of a permanent information collection system in the Ministry of Finance and is clearly a long-term project. As an interim step, the recent mission recommended an approach whereby available data sources would be synthesized to provide a more integrated statement of government operations than presently available. Sudan does not report GFS data to the Fund's Statistics Department (STA). The latest data published in the GFS Yearbook and the yearly International Financial Statistics (IFS) are for 1982, and cover only budgetary central government operations. 4. Balance of oavments Balance of payments data suffer from problems of methodology, coverage, and classification. The exchange record, the main source of data for the balance of payments, is not geared to balance of payments needs, and the reporting of information is not always consistent with balance of payments principles. Except for merchandise trade data, which are compiled on the basis of customs records of shipment, no additional data sources have been developed to supplement or improve the exchange record data. The recent STA mission has thus made a number of recommendations to improve the collection of balance of payments data. These include the introduction of revised report forms for the commercial banks, changes in the data collection procedure for the international transactions of the Bank of Sudan, and ensuring the classification of all international transactions of the commercial banks according to balance of payments principles, particularly the adoption of the residency criterion. Alternative procedures for the estimation of workers' remittances and the initiation of questionnaires to collect supplementary data from nonbank sources have also been proposed. 5.

Such loans were generally focused mainly on agriculture, but also on the development of the country's infrastructure in support of productive activities. Attention was increasingly directed toward the rehabilitation of existing capital and the removal of production bottlenecks. Except for a US$16 million drought relief loan in 1991, there have been no new commitments since 1989. An agricultural sector review mission visited Sudan in November-December 1992 and identified a number of actions needed to remove the constraints to growth. The World Bank decided in February 1993 not to appoint a new resident representative and closed its resident mission in Khartoum in June 1993. In its dialogue with the Sudanese authorities, the World Bank has advocated policies that would increase efficiency in the public sector, encourage private sector participation in the economy, raise domestic resource mobilization, and alleviate poverty. To this end, the World Bank, in conjunction with the IMF, has emphasized to the Sudanese authorities that only through a strong and comprehensive reform program implemented seriously over a number of years could Sudan hope to resolve its current economic problems. Disbursements from the World Bank were suspended on September 16, 1993 after arrears had emerged, which placed Sudan's arrears on non-accrual status on January 17, 1994. The arrears to the World Bank Group rose to US$50 million by November 1995. In the 198Os, the World Bank provided Sudan with technical assistance in several areas, including health, family planning, and the petroleum sector. In 1987-88, in the context of a planned Economic Reform Credit, the World Bank studied the social costs of adjustment with a view to framing social safety net policies. It also sponsored a Public Sector and Economic Management Project in 1987 to improve public sector performance and accounting. When heavy rains and floods in August and September 1988 caused extensive damage to Sudan's social and physical infrastructure, the World Bank led a multi-donor effort to help raise funds for an emergency reconstruction program which included a credit for US$75 million in May 1989 to support the program. A loan of US$82 million was approved in December 1989 for the rehabilitation of the Khartoum-Port Sudan Highway which is the country's transport lifeline. In 1992, the World Bank acted as an agent for the UNDP on a public finance project designed to improve macroeconomic management.

A chronology of the major changes to the system from November 1994 through October 1995 is presented in the final section. Information on developments prior to November 1994 is available from the documentation for previous Article IV consultation discussions. l-J 1. Exchanrre arrangements After several years of tentative reforms, the Sudanese authorities introduced over the period May-September 1995 a series of measures that resulted in the creation of a genuine, market-determined exchange system. Comprehensive regulations for non-bank foreign exchange dealers were issued in May. In late September, further regulations were issued by the Bank of Sudan that: (a) eliminated the surrender requirement of foreign exchange by commercial banks at the Bank of Sudan's reference rate (the Bank of Sudan now makes purchases at the commercial bank's selling rate plus LSd 3 per U.S. dollar); (b) authorized commercial banks to transact freely foreign exchange with holders of foreign currency denominated accounts; and (c) permitted exporters to sell to any commercial bank the foreign exchange proceeds not subject to the surrender requirement. Also, from that time foreign exchange dealers were allowed to set buying and selling rates independently, without regard to any pre-specified spread. As of mid-November 1995, there were twenty-one non-bank foreign exchange dealers operating in Sudan, 2J with total daily transactions averaging US$800,000. A similar volume flowed through the commercial banks, with three-quarters of these flows related to export proceeds. Thus, non- export foreign exchange transactions flowing through the system average about US$l million on a daily basis. Anecdotal evidence points to a substantial reduction in parallel market volumes. The official LSd/US$ exchange rate-- calculated by the Bank of Sudan as the weighted average rate (by transactions volume) of all foreign exchange dealers-- depreciated from LSd 620 in mid-September to about LSd 800 in early November after rising to LSd 850 immediately after the switch to the new system. Since the commencement of the new system, the stated Bank of Sudan policy of not intervening has been strictly followed. In real effective terms, the current exchange rate of Sudan's currency is on par with that of February 1992, the last time the rate was genuinely unified. I/ For the most recent information, see "Sudan - Recent Economic Deve lopments," SM/94/311, (12/30/94), pp. 41-48, 68-72. 2/ At present, non-bank dealers are restricted to operate in Khartoum.

About two-thirds of foreign exchange purchased by the Bank of Sudan is used for petroleum imports. The commercial banks are free to use proceeds not sold to the Bank of Sudan for their own purposes. There is no surrender requirement applicable to non- bank foreign exchange dealers. Non-bank foreign exchange dealers are required to register as joint stock companies, and their activities are limited to conducting foreign exchange transactions in the spot market. All foreign exchange dealers are required to post their buying and selling rates. As mentioned above, at mid-November there were twenty-one non-bank dealers, and an additional twenty or so were in prospect (over forty applications had been or were being processed). Market imperfections continue to result in differences in quoted exchange rates. While non-banks compete directly with commercial banks for non-export foreign exchange inflows, there remains a spread of about 2-3 percent between the two groups, down from about 15 percent under the old system during most of the third quarter of the year. This remaining spread could reflect, inter alia, the fact that the banks have a monopoly on services (e.g., export documentation and credit facilities), and some hedging on the part of market participants in light of perceived uncertainties regarding the durability of the authorities' commitment to maintain the new system (foreign exchange was de facto rationed by banks under the previous system). Differences of about 3 percent also persist among the exchange rates quoted by various entities within each dealer group (banks and non-banks) with some banks quoting more attractive rates than some non-bank dealers. An element of the 1995 exchange system reform was the authorization by the Bank of Sudan to allow commercial banks to transact freely with holders of foreign currency denominated accounts ("account to account" transfers). Under the previous system, these transfers, which were officially tolerated, were the main venue for parallel market transactions. Under the new system, the authorities are using the transaction volumes and exchange rates from account to account activity to monitor the evolution of the system. A few individuals have attempted to operate non-bank dealerships using account to account transfers instead of registering through official channels. The Bank of Sudan has closed these accounts and encouraged the individuals concerned to apply for non-bank dealerships. A bilateral payments agreement between Sudan and Egypt covers various bilateral payments including trade mission and embassy expenditures, student costs , and medical expenses. No payments are made to settle liabilities under the agreement; instead, a broad financial balance is maintained through administrative control of the granting of authorizations. Bank of Sudan officials informed the recent mission that this agreement is dormant. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX V ' 2. Trade and Payments system Following the recent exchange system reforms, Sudan now has a trade and payments system that, with the exception of the arrears situation, is largely free of restrictions. a. Imoorts and imports oavments The pervasive shortage of foreign exchange and the attendant rationing characterizing the official exchange market under the previous system has largely disappeared with the introduction of the new system and its market determined rate. Imports of all goods are permitted except those restricted for public health, national security, and religious reasons. b. Pavments for invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles, as the former limit of US$5,000 per year on purchases of foreign exchange to finance travel abroad has been eliminated. There remains a US$5,000 limit on the amount of foreign banknotes that can be taken out of the country; there is no limit on the amount that can be transferred or withdrawn for an invisible payment. As with financing for imports, the informal rationing of foreign exchange for invisibles, pervasive under the previous system, has disappeared. C. Exports and export proceeds Exports to Israel are prohibited, as are exports of raw hides and skins, and charcoal and firewood. Licenses are not required for any category of exports; however, export contracts are subject to approval by the Ministry of Commerce, which also enforces--via "export councils"-- minimum export prices for certain commodities to deter under-invoicing. These prices are updated periodically. All export proceeds must be repatriated into Sudan. However, the requirement that commercial banks surrender a portion of their export proceeds to the Bank of Sudan at the latter's "reference rate," which constituted a multiple currency practice under the old system, has been eliminated. Under the current system, most exporters must sell all of their proceeds to a commercial bank within 45 days of the transaction, and the Bank of Sudan can purchase up to 50 percent of any commercial bank's export proceeds at the commercial bank's selling rate plus LSd 3 per U.S. dollar. A small group of exporters--those of winter cotton, cattle and meat, sunflower seeds, fruits and vegetables, and manufactured good (representing about one-quarter of total exports) --are allowed to retain 50 percent of their export proceeds in foreign currency. The Bank of Sudan contacts the commercial bank identified by the exporter to confirm the receipt of foreign exchange proceeds.

With the exception of cotton and gum arabic, export duties are applied at a rate of 5 percent. Export duties on cotton and gum arabic are charged at the rate of 10 percent. d. Proceeds of invisibles Sudanese nationals working abroad are required to remit annually to domestic residents a minimum amount of foreign exchange, and these must be channelled through the foreign exchange system. Exemptions are provided for Sudanese nationals working in a number of countries, other than employees of international organizations. Travelers entering Sudan must declare all holdings of foreign currency. Within a 90 day period, this amount must be either deposited in a foreign currency account, sold to an authorized foreign exchange dealer, or retransferred abroad. 3. Changes in the Exchange and Trade System, November 1994-October 1995 The following are the substantive changes to the exchange and trade system over the period November 1994 - October 1995. u January 3. 1995. Passenger cars and sugar were eliminated from the negative import list. March 20. 1995. The mandatory spread between a commercial bank's buying and selling price of foreign exchange was changed from a flat LSd 7 per U.S. dollar to 1.5 percent of each bank's buying price. March 21. 1995. The Bank of Sudan reduced the commercial banks' surrender requirement of foreign exchange proceeds from 65 percent to 50 percent. The Bank of Sudan continued to purchase 20 percent of the banks' foreign exchange proceeds at its "reference" rate. The commercial banks were required to report the use of the 50 percent allocated to them, pointing out: the name of importer, type of commodity, etc. May 17. 1995. The Bank of Sudan issued comprehensive regulations for non-bank foreign exchange dealers. Major components included that dealers must be registered as a joint stock companies, and that the scope of operations for non-bank foreign exchange dealers will be limited to the spot market. LJ This summary does not include periodic changes to the minimum export prices of certain commodities as undertaken by the Ministry of Commerce and described above.

Exporters of live cattle, meat, winter cotton, sunflower seeds, vegetables and fruits, and industrial goods were allowed to retain 50 percent of foreign exchange earnings in foreign currency. The remaining 50 percent must be sold to a commercial bank of subsequent surrender to the Bank of Sudan. August 5. 1995. The Bank of Sudan declared that receipts for the purchase and sale of foreign currency from authorized dealers are to be considered legal instruments establishing the ownership of the foreign currency. Authorized banks are permitted to use these receipts to: purchase foreign currency to the receipt holder; open an unrestricted account in the name of the receipt holder; and deposit additional funds in an unrestricted account in the name of the receipt holder. September 27. 1995. The Bank of Sudan eliminated the surrender requirement of commercial banks at its "reference" rate; the total surrender requirement remained unchanged at 50 percent. Henceforth, all foreign exchange proceeds of the commercial banks subject to the surrender requirement must be sold to the Bank of Sudan at the concerned commercial bank's selling rate plus LSd 3 per U.S. dollar. September 27. 1995. With some exceptions, exporters must sell to any commercial bank that portion of export proceeds not subject to the surrender requirement. The portion subject to the surrender requirement continues to be sold to the bank that effected the export transaction and documentation. Sentember 27. 1995. Commercial banks are authorized to transact foreign exchange for their own account with holders of foreign currency denominated deposits. This measure effectively legalize the former (tolerated) parallel market. Seotember 27. 1995. All authorized foreign exchange dealers are allowed to set buying and selling rates free of any pre-specified spread.
