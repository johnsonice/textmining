Following the recommendations of a number of MCM TA missions, the government commenced weekly auctions of treasury bills in September 2006—a move that would allow the government scope to finance its deficits without resort to the MMA.  29.      Staff commended the authorities on recent moves toward establishing central bank independence. Amendments to the MMA Act were passed in April 2007, enshrining the separation of the positions of finance minister and central bank governor and reorganizing the board of the MMA. A new governor is expected to be appointed soon. A recent inter-agency agreement between the MMA and the Ministry of Finance empowers the central bank to set interest rates, and puts a ceiling on the amount that the government can borrow through its Ways and Means Account at the MMA.  30.      Staff noted that going forward, it will be important to entrench the MMA’s independence and ease the burden on monetary policy through a more prudent fiscal path. Although the government is now limited in the amount it can borrow from the MMA’s Ways and Means Account, the option to monetize the deficit still exists through the sale of T-bills to the MMA. The authorities agreed that entrenching central bank independence is an important goal, and that preventing fiscal slippages would help in this regard.  31.      The mission recommended further incremental steps to develop the new market for T-bills. Creating a secondary market would allow participants to manage more actively their risks. Furthermore, moving to a variable rate auction would allow market participants to determine interest rates in a competitive manner. However, a variable rate auction would require a good liquidity forecasting framework, and while progress had been made in creating such a framework, the unpredictability of government finances still impeded the effort. The authorities agreed with these goals, aiming to implement them in gradual steps as they build up experience with market operations. E.   Progress on Structural Reforms 32.      Staff recommended that the SOEs be encouraged to operate on commercial terms with a view towards privatization. No firm has been privatized since 2001, and even though the majority of SOEs have been corporatized (out of 23 SOEs, 9 are still 100 percent government-owned); the public sector continues to be a dominant force in many areas of economic activity. The authorities noted that shares in two SOEs––the Allied Insurance Company and the Housing Development Finance Corporation––will be sold in the near future, and Nasandhura Palace Hotel will be privatized. 33.      The authorities agreed with staff on the need to expedite several key pieces of legislation, and pointed to the passage of some recent significant bills by parliament.

The Banking Bill––to codify prudential regulations in the banking sector––is being finalized. 34.      Staff proposed that the authorities consider acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, since Maldives maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. MMA staff will prepare a note on this issue and present it to its board for discussion once the new board members are appointed. AML/CFT legislation has been drafted with Fund assistance and a bill is expected to be submitted to parliament by end-2007.  IV.   STAFF APPRAISAL 35.      The economy has rebounded strongly from the devastating impact of the tsunami. A strong recovery in tourist arrivals in 2006—which continued in the first quarter of 2007—underpinned growth of 19 percent. Construction is also booming, partly due to investment in several new resorts. Inflation remains low but is on a rising trend. Post-tsunami reconstruction activities continue, with the assistance of external bilateral and multilateral donors. 36.      The main policy challenge for the Maldives will be to contain domestic expenditures in line with revenues, and ensure macroeconomic stability. The fiscal position has deteriorated recently, with large increases in domestic expenditures and the fiscal deficit. Most of the incremental spending is unrelated to alleviating social needs in the wake of the tsunami.  37.      The 2007 government budget envisages a substantial increase in expenditures, which would require significant domestic financing if an unprecedented level of increased revenues were not realized.  New revenue measures are forecast to yield about 11 percent of GDP, but much of this may fail to materialize. Staff estimates that with unchanged expenditure policies, there may be need for large domestic financing of the budget, which would present serious threats to macroeconomic stability. Therefore, prioritizing expenditures and curtailing budgeted expenditure in line with actual revenues would be crucial.  38.      To enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability, revenue-enhancing reforms should be expedited. These reforms include the introduction of corporate taxation, a broad-based sales tax, and replacing the current “per head” tourism tax with an ad valorem tax. Moreover, a medium-term expenditure framework should be developed. 39.      External vulnerabilities should be carefully monitored. The current account deficit has widened further, with construction imports and high oil prices outweighing booming Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  17    25354555657519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006253545556575Total expenditure and net lendingTotal revenue and grantsCentral Government Operations(in percent of GDP)-30-25-20-15-10-50519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006-30-25-20-15-10-505Central Government Balance (in percent of GDP)-4-2024681019961997199819992000200120022003200420052006-4-20246810Domestic financingForeign financingCentral Government Financing, Net (In percent of GDP)-20-10010203040506019961997199819992000200120022003200420052006-20-100102030405060Money and Credit(Annual percentage change)Domestic credit303540455055601996199719981999200020012002200320042005200630354045505560Dollarization Ratio 1/ (In percent)01234561996199719981999200020012002200320042005200604080120160200240In months of imports of goodsIn months of  imports of goods andnon-factor servicesIn millions of U.S. dollars (right scale)Gross Official ReservesFigure 2.
