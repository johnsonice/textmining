The staff team comprised Messrs. Leon (head), Dridi, Gvenetadze, and Singh, and Ms. Farahbaksh (all MCD). Mr. Di Tata participated in the opening discussions. The mission met with the Executive President and the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), as well as with the ministers of national economy, oil and gas, commerce and industry, and manpower. The mission also met with the Undersecretary of Finance, other senior officials, representatives from the Capital Market Authority, the Chamber of Commerce, private and state banks, pension funds, major hydrocarbon sector enterprises, and other private businessmen.   Oman’s economic data are generally adequate for surveillance. Oman has participated in the General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS) since June 2002. The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was conducted in February 2004, and the report was published in 2005. An assessment under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was undertaken in 2003. Oman has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). The rial Omani (RO) has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since January 1986.

Background • Macroeconomic conditions were strong in 2005 and 2006, supported by high oil prices and rapid growth of the non-hydrocarbon sector. Real GDP grew by about 6 percent over the period, while inflation remained subdued at about 3 percent. High oil prices supported overall fiscal and external current account surpluses. The banking system remained sound, with profits rising sharply. • The medium-term outlook is favorable, assuming that oil prices do not decline significantly. Real GDP is projected to grow by 5–6 percent per year, supported by strong growth of the non-hydrocarbon sectors. Surpluses are projected to decrease for both the fiscal and external current accounts; overall economic prospects will depend on the success of Oman’s diversification efforts.  Authorities’ views • The authorities are developing the oil and gas sector and expanding gas-based and non-hydrocarbon industries, in particular manufacturing and tourism. They are aware of the need to maintain financial and macroeconomic stability, promote a favorable environment for the private sector to grow, and create jobs for the fast-growing labor force. The authorities intend to monitor the impact of the diversification strategy on the economy’s absorptive capacity and stand ready to adjust the pace of public spending, if necessary. • The authorities note the rising expenditures from contingent pension liabilities, and plan to address the deficit of the Civil Service Employees Pension Fund (CSEPF) through recapitalization and consolidation of the management of the existing public pension funds. They also intend to tackle the increasing implicit subsidies on petroleum products, but have not yet decided on a timetable. • The authorities remain committed to the exchange rate peg. They have announced that they will delay entry to the GCC monetary union (scheduled for 2010). Staff recommendations • Staff supported the authorities’ fiscal stance, but encouraged them to develop a comprehensive strategy to address implicit quasi-fiscal activities, including subsidies on domestic prices of hydrocarbon products, and finalize promptly arrangements for setting public pensions on a sound basis.  • To better manage the banking system’s liquidity, staff recommended that the authorities closely align the rate on the CBO’s 28-day certificates of deposit (CDs) with the Fed Funds rate.  • Staff also encouraged the authorities to pursue an integrated approach to financial sector development, including efforts to develop secondary and corporate bond market and to continue strengthening the legal framework pertaining to the capital market.

Faced with a rapidly growing labor force and relatively limited oil reserves, Oman has embarked on a growth strategy based on economic diversification, private sector expansion, and human resource development. Investment projects, including public-private partnerships (PPP) totaling about $40 billion (over 100 percent of GDP) are planned during 2006–10, which aim at increasing exports and providing employment opportunities for Omanis.1  2.      The main challenge facing Oman is to maintain macroeconomic stability and create sufficient jobs while pursuing economic diversification. Against the backdrop of high oil prices and a strong economic performance, the consultation discussions with the authorities concentrated on (a) the economic diversification effort; (b) the appropriateness of the fiscal stance; (c) the financial sector development; and (d) the challenges associated with the proposed monetary union with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). 3.      Fund surveillance in recent years has emphasized improving fiscal management, strengthening the financial sector, and implementing structural reforms. Overall policy implementation has been consistent with Fund policy advice. In addition, the authorities have implemented a number of recommendations made in the data ROSC and FSAP missions. B.   Recent Economic Developments 4.      The Omani economy registered solid performance in 2005, supported by high oil prices and rapid growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector. Real GDP grew by 5.7 percent, reflecting significant infrastructure investments and the wealth effects of the oil price increase (Tables 1–4, Figure 1), while inflation remained modest at about 2 percent. High oil and gas exports boosted the current account surplus to 9 percent of GDP. With foreign direct investments (FDI) high, the CBO’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased to $4.5 billion (3½ months of imports of goods and services) (Figure 2). At the same time, with expenditures growing more slowly than revenues, the overall fiscal surplus more than tripled to 12.4 percent of GDP (Figure 3).2 The surplus was used to build up the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF) and reduce Oman’s debt to 9 percent of GDP.3                                                   1 The official unemployment rate for 2005 was below 5 percent. The number of Omanis entering the labor force is likely to increase in the coming years, since about 45 percent of the population is less than 20 years old. 2 Based on an oil price of $23 per barrel (pb), the 2005 budget projected a deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP. The average budgeted price of oil in GCC countries was about $30 per barrel in 2005. 3 The SGRF was created in 1980 for saving oil revenues and privatization receipts.

As in other GCC countries, monetary conditions in 2005 were characterized by ample liquidity (Figure 4), with broad money growing by 21 percent. Credit to the government declined, but private sector credit increased significantly.4 Deposit dollarization rose sharply, with interest rates on foreign currency deposits remaining higher than those on rial Omani deposits.  6.      Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 6 percent in 2006, supported by high oil prices and strong growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector. Inflation is likely to have reached 3.5 percent owing to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and growth in the money supply. Based on an oil price of $32 per barrel, the budget surplus is estimated at 15 percent of GDP, despite an increase in expenditure of about 12 percent. The authorities are expected to use this surplus to further reduce the public debt and contribute to the SGRF and other special funds. The external current account surplus is estimated at 12 percent of GDP, with gross reserves of the CBO covering more than four months of prospective imports.  7.      Monetary conditions in 2006 mirrored those of 2005, with claims on the private sector growing strongly. The CBO introduced changes in its instruments of liquidity management: (i) altered the modalities of reserve requirements; (ii) changed the basis for setting the repo rate from the yield on local securities to LIBOR; and (iii) began assessing excess liquidity by using clearing balances. These changes resulted in the mopping up of some excess liquidity, discouraged banks from using the CBO as the lender of first resort, and improved somewhat the CBO’s liquidity management. 8.      Both the banking sector’s balance sheet and profits increased substantially in the first nine months of 2006 (Table 6 and Figure 4). Banks continued to have capital asset ratios in excess of 10 percent, and nonperforming loans were less than 4 percent of total assets. However, liquidity risks have been rising because of mismatches in the maturity profile of banks’ assets and liabilities (lending for infrastructure and construction projects are of a long-term nature, but the average maturity of deposits is less than one year). Foreign liabilities rose sharply in the first nine months of 2006 as banks sought to redress this maturity mismatch by borrowing long term abroad. Direct loan exposure to real estate and equity markets remained low (Table 7). Banks made preparations for establishing risk management frameworks to implement Basle II by 2007. The Muscat Securities Market (MSM) index experienced a significant correction in the first half of 2006, but, unlike the other GCC countries, had recovered by year’s end (Box 1).                                                  4 In 2005, the CBO raised the ceiling on the share of total personal lending in total lending to 45 percent by imposing separate limits of 40 percent on personal lending and 5 percent on residential mortgage lending.

Stock Market Developments  Over the last few years, the behavior of the MSM has diverged from that of the regional markets. During 2002–05, gains in the Omani stock index (136 percent) were relatively moderate compared with those in other GCC countries, such as Saudi Arabia (819 percent), Dubai (1,000 percent), and Qatar (553 percent). Also, in 2006, the MSM index had increased by about 15 percent, while the regional markets had declined 40–60 percent.   The recent volatility in asset prices is not likely to have a significant impact on financial stability owing to the soundness of the financial system and prudential measures that limit banks’ exposure to equity market risk. In 2006, the direct exposure of the banking system to the equity market remained below 2 percent.  The MSM’s performance reflects the country’s modest oil reserves, the limited impact of initial public offerings (IPOs), and a strong legal framework. Oman has put in place clear disclosure and transparency rules and is the only country in the region that has issued a corporate governance code. The law and the implementing regulations issued by the Capital Market Authority (CMA), and strict enforcement of these regulations, have created a transparent environment that has succeeded in boosting investor confidence. Finally, the resolve shown by the CMA in addressing quoted companies’ noncompliance with the new regulations has improved the stock market’s resilience to shocks. The CMA has also increased efforts to improve investors’ access to information and training, including through conferences and workshops.     II.   OUTLOOK AND RISKS 9.      Oman’s economic prospects for 2007 are positive. Real GDP is projected to increase by 6 percent (Table 5) owing to high oil prices, ongoing infrastructure projects, and buoyant consumption.5 Inflation is likely to reach about 4 percent, driven by significant increases in both government and private expenditure. Supported by high oil prices, the budget surplus is projected at 9 percent of GDP, despite the expansionary fiscal stance. The external current account surplus would be about $2.7 billion (7 percent of GDP), with imports increasing by about 7 percent, reflecting increased consumption and developments in                                                  5 The outlook is based on the mid-December 2006 oil price forecasts.  0100200300400500600700800900Jan-03Mar-03Jun-03Sep-03Dec-03Feb-04May-04Aug-04Nov-04Jan-05Apr-05Jul-05Oct-05Dec-05Mar-06Jun-06Sep-06Dec-060100200300400500600700800900BahrainKuwait Saudi ArabiaOmanStock Market Developments in Selected GCC Countries, 2003 - 2006(January 1, 2003=100, week ending December 8, 2006)Source: Bloomberg.PERPBRMarket Capitalization (in percent of GDP)Dividend Yield (percent)Bahrain Stock Exchange12.782.131343.06Kuwait Stock Exchange16.384.141902.52Muscat Stock Market18.122.59412.63Doha Stock Market30.206.502541.30Tadawul All Shares Index (Saudi Arabia)39.809.002101.40Dubai Financial Market43.605.431.30Abu Dhabi Stock Market33.706.151.01Emerging 2/19.723.442.40Nasdaq Composite35.382.560.67S&P 50018.232.821.80   2/ Simple average.Key Stock Market Indicators 1/   Sources: Bloomberg; stockselector.com; Bakheet Financial Advisor; KAMCO; and Fund staff estimates.   1/ Data as of end-2005.183Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 11the non-oil economy. The foreign exchange reserves of the CBO are expected to increase to $6.8 billion or 4.7 months of prospective imports of goods and services. 10.      Based on current policies and assuming that oil prices will not decline significantly, the medium-term outlook looks favorable. The hydrocarbon sector will increase its contribution to economic growth in the next few years, before slowing down starting in 2009. Medium-term prospects are characterized by growth of 5–6 percent a year, a rising private investment-to-GDP ratio, and low inflation. Fiscal indicators are expected to improve, with non-hydrocarbon revenues rising and the public expenditure-to-GDP ratio falling. On the external side, debt would decline, and reserve assets would increase. Growth and employment prospects, however, will depend on maintaining financial and macroeconomic stability, and on the success of Oman’s ambitious diversification program. Downside risks include a slowdown in global growth, a sharp fall in oil prices,6 increased security concerns for the region, and a reduction in FDI. III.   KEY POLICY CHALLENGES 11.      The discussions focused primarily on four areas: (i) Oman’s economic diversification and employment generation policies; (ii) the appropriateness of the fiscal stance; (iii) developments in the financial sector; and (iv) Oman’s participation in the planned GCC monetary union. A.   Diversification and Employment Generation Policies 12.      The authorities recognize that barring new oil discoveries, the geological location and the age of oil reserves suggest an inevitable decline in oil production. To shore up production, the authorities plan to invest about $13 billion in oil and gas over the next five years. They aim to achieve a 50 percent ultimate recovery of oil in place, and are exploring alternatives for boosting production that can use crude oil, gas, or coal as inputs. 13.      The authorities are pursuing economic diversification beyond oil. Initiatives include the development of gas-based industries; the expansion of manufacturing, tourism, mining, and fisheries; water and power projects, steel and iron plants, and industrial and container ports; and the creation of free-trade zones. Efforts to diversify have emphasized the role of the private sector, and most new major projects initiated in the past five years are being implemented as PPP initiatives (Box 2). The authorities realize that the absorptive capacity of the economy may be stretched. Bottlenecks are likely to develop both in the supply of skilled and semi-skilled labor, and in the provision of ancillary goods and services. The authorities indicated that they intend to monitor the pace of public spending and reduce it, if necessary.                                                  6 A $10 reduction in average oil prices over the medium term could reduce the medium-term current account balance by about 4 percentage points of GDP.

Investment Plans in Oman  During 2006–10, Oman has plans to invest about $40 billion in various projects, of which public spending constitutes about 45 percent. These projects are aimed at improving physical infrastructure, enhancing oil and gas output capacity, and promoting private sector growth to create employment opportunities for the rapidly growing labor force.  More than half of the planned investment aims at strengthening the oil and gas sector and developing the petrochemicals industry. In tourism, which is expected to have a significant payoff in the creation of jobs, the government has been encouraging the establishment of new hotels and resorts, and plans to build airports and expand transportation links. It also supports the development of sport tourism, eco-tourism, caving, and airstrip services.  As the planned investments are implemented, the economy’s limited absorptive capacity may pose a risk to macroeconomic stability. With the boom in investment in the Gulf region, shortages of specific skills are emerging and contractors are having difficulty coping with the large number of projects. Deployment of expatriate labor, which seems unavoidable in Oman, most probably require salary and rental premia, adding to already emerging inflationary pressures. This factor becomes even more important because of the authorities’ intention to frontload the investments.    14.      The authorities have also embarked on a comprehensive training program geared to providing vocational and technical skills, which are identified in partnership with the private sector. These efforts are aimed at providing appropriate employment opportunities for nationals. The authorities recognize the importance of applying the Omanization program flexibly and have established lower quotas at professional levels in critical sectors. B.   Fiscal Policy 15.      The main challenge facing the authorities is finding the right balance between increasing expenditure and keeping inflation low. Although significant fiscal surpluses are projected, the near-term fiscal stance is expansionary. The authorities are fully aware of the inflationary pressures caused by increased spending and limitations on the absorptive capacity of the economy, and noted that they will carefully monitor inflation and respond, if necessary, through appropriate fiscal adjustment. 16.      The authorities view the enlargement of the non-hydrocarbon revenue base as an important objective. They indicated that the introduction of value-added-tax (VAT) would be best if harmonized across the GCC countries.

The differential between world market and domestic petroleum product prices has been widening, leading to growing implicit energy subsidies. With the exception of diesel and jet fuel, Oman’s domestic petroleum product prices have been fixed for a long time, despite the rising prices in international markets. Staff’s preliminary estimates indicate that by end-2006, implicit petroleum product subsidies will increase to about 3 percent of GDP ($1 billion), from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2003. The authorities indicated that they plan to raise petroleum prices to levels similar to those in the U.A.E.,7 noting the scope for unrecorded cross-border trade, but have not yet decided on a timetable. The authorities also indicated that they expect to reduce subsidies to the electricity and water sectors over time in the context of privatization of utility companies. 18.      Contributions to the Civil Servant Employees Pension Fund (CSEPF) will not be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations. In the absence of other initiatives, the government will have to cover the growing deficits. The authorities indicated that their preference is to determine the fund’s exact actuarial deficit and then implement a sustainable financing plan. Such a plan would include a recapitalization, the consolidation of the management of the existing public pension funds, and higher contributions.  19.      Estimates of fiscal sustainability suggest that although long-run sustainability is not a major concern, the authorities need to be careful about the pace of real expenditures (Box 3). Based on oil price futures, staff estimates that the authorities could maintain current expenditures, in real terms, through 2025.                                                    7 Regular (high octane) gasoline costs $0.30 ($0.31) per liter in Oman, compared to $0.45 ($0.50) in U.A.E.

Fiscal Scenarios  Strong oil prices have enabled the financing of investment programs aimed at diversifying the economy. This box calculates the level of expenditures that can be financed from hydrocarbon wealth, until the hydrocarbon resources are depleted. It takes into account data on total proven and potential oil and gas reserves, a given production profile, the long-term projections for world market oil prices, the rate of return on financial assets, and the authorities’ investment expenditures plans.  With reserves at 5.4 billion barrels of oil and 23.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and production kept constant at the 2011 projected level, expenditures can be maintained constant in real terms through 2025, with an average permissible expenditure level of RO 5.7 billion over 2006–11. On the downside, if oil prices fell by $10 per barrel, the average expenditure level would be RO 4.9 billion. For upside potential, if oil reserves were increased to 10.7 or 16.1 billion barrels, similar levels of expenditure would be feasible over longer periods or higher expenditures (real growth) could be maintained through 2025.   C.   Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector  20.      A key challenge for the CBO is the management of the liquidity in the banking system, which has risen significantly owing to the increase in government expenditures on diversification projects and the injection of funds to recapitalize the pension funds (about RO 400 million in 2006). The CBO has been mopping up part of the excess liquidity by issuing CDs at interest rates that have been kept below the Fed Funds rate, in order to keep the cost of these operations low. The low CD rates, however, have, at times, discouraged banks from purchasing enough CDs, limiting the CBO’s ability to mop up the intended volume of excess liquidity (Figure 5). The CBO’s liquidity management has also been hampered by the lack of frequent and regular information on the cash requirements of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).

The low CD rates appear to have contributed to some distortions in the domestic interest rate structure and to increased dollarization. They have reduced banks’ incentive to raise resources in rial Omani, given that the return on these funds is low compared with the LIBOR rate. Instead, banks have opted to increase the rate on dollar-denominated deposits (Figure 6) in order to place funds abroad in search of better returns, leading to a sharp increase in dollarization of deposits. The authorities noted that the rates on rial Omani deposits reflect the banks’ desire for large profit margins (Figure 7). They expressed an interest in receiving technical assistance on liquidity management and money market development. Figure 6.

The CBO manages the intermediation process through various monetary and prudential measures, including a limit on the banks’ net open position (NOP) of 40 percent of tier 1 capital, lending limitations, and diversification requirements for the placement of foreign assets with foreign banks. The limit on banks’ NOPs is intended to minimize exchange risk and encourage banks to finance local projects, but may create an additional incentive on banks to raise U.S. dollar liabilities. The authorities noted that the ceiling on the banks’ NOP is not currently binding: they view it as a necessary prudential measure in case the balance of payments comes under pressure. The staff noted that it may be worthwhile reviewing the effects and consistency of the various existing prudential measures.  23.      The authorities recognize the need to develop the interbank market and deepen the corporate bond market. The CBO changed the basis for setting its repo rate, linking it to LIBOR. The increase in the repo rate was intended to discourage first-resort use of CBO facilities and to raise the volume of borrowing in the overnight interbank market. They would also like to deepen the corporate bond market. Corporate bonds would add depth to the financial market, allow banks to better manage their liquidity and diversify their asset portfolio away from CDs, and provide insurance companies and pension funds with an additional instrument to manage their maturity matching. 24.      The authorities were concerned about the low volume of float in the MSM, which arises partly because institutional investors mainly buy shares to hold. Also, many large family companies are not listed on the market for the fear of losing control. The authorities are considering lowering the floor on the percentage of shares that is allowed to be put up for IPOs in order to deepen the capital market.8 25.      Consistent with the recommendations of the 2003 FSAP, the authorities are strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for financial markets, including by                                                  8 Currently, at least 40 percent of a company must be placed on the MSM in order for the company to be publicly traded.

The authorities noted their intention to implement the remaining FSAP recommendations to further strengthen and deepen the financial system, and to request an FSAP update in 2008.  D.   External Sector 26.      Oman has a pressing need to build a competitive and job-creating non-hydrocarbon sector, in view of its relatively modest oil and gas reserves. Given the institutional commitment of the GCC countries to a U.S. dollar peg until the proposed monetary union in 2010, competitiveness cannot be secured through exchange rate adjustment. The rial Omani has depreciated by 16 percent (in real effective terms) since 2002, notwithstanding some recent real appreciation reflecting improvements in the terms of trade (Figure 8). Looking ahead, further real depreciation would be consistent with the gradual depletion of oil reserves and economic diversification. Enhancing Oman’s external competitiveness would require continued fiscal discipline, flexible labor markets, and accelerated structural reforms to further improve productivity.  70758085909510010511011512019901991199219931994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006Real effective exchange rateNominal effective exchange rateFigure 8.

Although Oman’s economic trends are similar to those of the GCC countries (Figure 9), Oman’s oil resources are relatively modest and therefore the country has benefited less than the larger GCC countries from the recent increase in the price of oil (Figure 10). As oil resources decline, this divergence will continue. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 18 Figure 9.

During the discussions, the authorities indicated that the target date for the establishment of a GCC monetary union was ambitious, and that they favored extending the deadline. Although supportive of monetary union, they thought more time should be taken to fully implement the customs union and to explore alternative convergence criteria capable of accommodating the varying levels of resources, stages of development, and specific needs (including demographic) of individual countries (Box 4). They also wanted to explore the implications of full labor mobility and large wage differentials among neighboring states and between the private and public sectors; as well as of the general shortage of professional labor to meet the growing needs in the GCC region. More recently, Oman announced that it would delay entry to and would not be part of the GCC monetary union to take effect in 2010.   Box 4. GCC Monetary Union: Progress and Challenges  At the Muscat summit in December 2001, the GCC members agreed to further economic integration by launching a common currency by 2010. A number of factors support economic integration, including similar economic structures (oil and gas dominate the national economies), growing regional trade and factor mobility, similar business cycles, exposure to similar exogenous shocks, and socio-cultural factors.  Convergence criteria proposed in 2005: (1) budget deficit lower than 3 percent of the GDP, or 5 percent when oil prices are weak; (2) public debt-to-GDP ratio lower than 60 percent; (3) foreign exchange reserves in excess of four months’ imports; (4) interest rates not higher than two percentage points above the average of the lowest three countries’ rate; and (5) inflation not higher than 1.5 percent above the average rate of the six states. A final decision has not yet been made, and a discussion about the appropriateness of these criteria for the GCC countries is underway. For instance, some argue that a convergence criterion on budget deficit may disguise the true stance of fiscal policy as fiscal balance may remain the same, despite an increase in expenditure due to higher oil revenue. The criteria are expected to serve as an anchor for policies and expectations, and as a device to enforce discipline. All six countries are in compliance with the first four criteria as of the end of 2005, but inflation may be problematic for Qatar and the U.A.E. where inflation rates are higher than the GCC weighted average.  Over the medium to long term, three key factors will affect the members’ ability to adjust to shocks and can pose challenges for implementing common policies under the monetary union. First, while hydrocarbon resources will remain central to GCC economic performance, varying levels of hydrocarbon endowments and rates of depletion imply that some members will be replacing oil revenues over different time horizons. Second, economic diversification away from hydrocarbon activity is advancing at different speeds among GCC members. Third, labor market conditions vary, as reflected in the under 15 population ratio, relative wage rates, expatriate hiring policies, and flexibility to adjust to shocks through nominal wage changes.     F.   Other Structural Reforms 29.      The authorities continue to implement structural reforms geared toward creating a market-friendly economic environment. These include removing impediments to the flow of foreign direct investment through a revised FDI law, streamlining business regulations, and adopting a one-stop investment center policy. The authorities remain committed to privatization and intend to reduce the role of government in the provision of 050100150200250BahrainKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUAEOil (billions of barrels)Gas (billions of barrels of oil equivalent)Non-Oil GDP (percent of total GDP)Population under 15 (percent of total population)GCC: Variable Hydrocarbon Reserves and GDP Composition; and a Labor Force Set for Growth, 2005Sources: Authorities; British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 2006; World Development Indicators; CIA World Fact Book; and Fund staff estimates.

A new Labor Law was passed in 2005, which provides for freedom of association, the right to unionize, and protection against child labor. The authorities are drafting revisions to the Company and Bankruptcy Law. G.   Data Availability, Transparency, and Technical Assistance 30.      The authorities have made substantial efforts to improve the quality of economic data provided to the Fund and the general public. Consistent with the recommendations made by the 2004 Data ROSC, the CBO has conducted for the first time a comprehensive survey of the assets and liabilities of the financial and nonfinancial corporations. The CBO is in the process of supplementing the outcome of these surveys with information on the government sector to compile the international investment position (IIP) in the coming weeks.  31.      The authorities agreed to publish the Public Information Notice this year and indicated that they would consider publication of staff reports in the future. The staff informed the authorities of the proposal to include Oman in the list of countries for streamlined Article IV consultations, starting in 2007.  IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 32.      The authorities’ export-oriented development strategy has provided a firm foundation for Oman’s medium- and long-term prospects. Ongoing and planned investments to diversify the economy and expand gas-based and non-hydrocarbon industries should help sustain economic growth over the medium term. The success of the diversification program, however, depends heavily on maintaining financial and macroeconomic stability. The staff supports the authorities’ fiscal stance, given their diversification strategy, and welcomes their intention to adjust the pace of public spending to keep it consistent with the economy’s absorptive capacity, particularly in light of the front-loaded profile of the government’s investment plan. 33.      There is a need to develop a strategy for addressing implicit quasi-fiscal activities. The authorities’ intention to deal with the deficit of the CSEPF through both further recapitalization and consolidation of the management of the existing public pension funds is welcome. The staff encourages the authorities to finalize these plans and implement them promptly. Also, a timetable should be developed for gradually adjusting domestic petroleum prices to international levels.  34.      To more effectively manage liquidity, the CBO should more closely align the rate on its 28-day CDs with the Fed Funds rate. Low CD rates can limit the CBO’s ability to mop up excess liquidity and reduce the banks’ incentives to raise deposits in rials Omani, given that the return on these deposits is low compared with international rates. Furthermore, since the information on the domestic financing of the budget is particularly important for the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 22CBO’s liquidity management, the staff recommends that information on cash requirements of the MOF be provided to the CBO on a regular basis, which would allow the CBO to begin pre-announcing the amount of liquidity it plans to mop up prior to each auction.  35.      The staff encourages the authorities to pursue an integrated approach to financial sector development. The MOF, in consultation with the CBO, should issue treasury bills and development bonds through regular auctions, with an advance release calendar, and efforts to develop secondary and corporate bond market should be intensified. The availability of government securities of varying maturities will help establish a benchmark yield curve for the pricing of financial risks. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to continue strengthening the legal framework pertaining to the capital market, and also recommends lowering of the floor on the volume of shares permitted to be placed on the MSM. In order to increase float and deepen the capital market, the government could use the MSM as the preferred vehicle for privatization. 36.      The peg to the U.S. dollar has provided a credible nominal anchor. Looking ahead, Oman has a pressing need to diversify its economy and create jobs for its growing labor force. Enhancing Oman’s external competitiveness and promoting growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector calls for continued fiscal discipline, flexible labor markets, and accelerated structural reforms to further improve productivity. 37.      A key challenge posed by economic diversification is the need to endow the labor force with appropriate skills. The implementation of a number of large infrastructure projects may put pressure on the labor market. The staff supports the authorities’ strategy of raising the skills of nationals through education and training programs for private sector development, and to implement its Omanization policy flexibly. 38.      Oman’s statistics are generally adequate for surveillance purposes. The authorities should be commended for the substantial efforts that have been undertaken to improve the quality of economic statistics, including unemployment data. Looking forward, the staff recommends that the authorities develop consolidated central government fiscal accounts, including transactions on the publicly administered social security funds and the oil funds, and encourages them to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). 39.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Oman take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Macroeconomic performance remained favorable in 2006, spurred by high oil prices and rapid growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector. Ongoing infrastructure projects, buoyant consumption, and an increase in gas production are expected to have led to overall real GDP growth of about 6 percent, with inflation running at 3.5 percent. The external current account surplus is estimated at 14 percent of GDP in 2006, on account of high oil revenues, higher liquefied natural gas exports, and a surge in non-oil exports. As a result, the foreign exchange reserves of the CBO are projected to have reached $5.8 billion by year’s end (4.3 months of prospective imports of goods and services).  The fiscal position remains comfortable. Strong oil prices are estimated to have resulted in an increase in fiscal revenues of about 20 percent in 2006, while expenditures, including social and infrastructure spending to support the authorities’ diversification                                                  1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [January, XX, 2007] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

As a result, the central government fiscal surplus is estimated to have increased to 15 percent of GDP in 2006, from 12 percent in 2005. Preliminary information indicates that this surplus has been used to reduce the public debt, which was already low, and to contribute to the State General Reserve Fund and other government funds and accounts.   Monetary conditions in Oman are characterized by ample liquidity, with broad money growing by 18 percent during the first nine months of 2006, notwithstanding a significant increase in the stock of certificates of deposit (CDs) placed by the CBO to mop up liquidity. Both the banking sector’s balance sheet and banks’ profits have increased substantially, with prudential indicators remaining strong. As in other GCC markets, the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) index experienced a significant correction in the first half of 2006, partially reversing the 44 percent increase recorded in 2005, but by year’s end the index had risen 14.5 percent above the end-2005 value. Foreign participation in the market increased substantially in 2006 to about one-third of total investors.   Ongoing infrastructure projects and buoyant consumption should help maintain real GDP growth at about 6 percent in 2007. Inflation is likely to reach 4 percent. Although the fiscal position is projected to remain in surplus, expenditure would increase by about 20 percent. At the same time, broad money is projected to grow by 10 percent, with credit to finance private and public investments rising strongly. The external current account surplus is expected to decline in 2007, but with foreign direct investment rising, the foreign exchange reserves of the CBO are projected to increase to over 4½ months of prospective imports of goods and services by year’s end.
