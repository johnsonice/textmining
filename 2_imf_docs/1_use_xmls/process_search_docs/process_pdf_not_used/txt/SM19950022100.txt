I The analysis of developments in 1993/94 and 1994/95 is complicated by data deficiencies, particularly with regard to the national income accounts and external trade. 2. ReDort on the discussions I 1993/94-1994/95: While there was a consensus on the progress made in fiscal adjustment and in certain structural reform areas, the staff considered that the envisaged "critical mass" of structural reforms was not implemented. Further, the macroeconomic policy mix, involving an overvalued currency and relatively high interest rates, had diverged substantially from that envisaged under the program. The authorities were of the view that a devaluation would run the risk of destabilizing the foreign exchange market, and that the limited overvaluation could be compensated through cost-cutting measures. I The medium term: There was a consensus on the need to achieve a high growth rate to raise living standards and start reducing unemployment. 0 The authorities did not share the staff's view that the maintenance of the current macroeconomic policy stance was inconsistent with the growth target, and involved risks of a shift in market sentiment as the pound became increasingly overvalued. l While welcoming the authorities' intention to accelerate the pace of structural reform, the staff observed that the proposals did not provide for a meaningful deepening of reforms, lacked specificity, and did not Include a clear implementation timetable. Moreover, the staff did not share the authorities' view that structural reforms alone in Egypt could substitute for an appropriate exchange rate adjustment. 3. Staff aDDraisa1 I To achieve a high growth rate, strengthen the budget and balance of payments positions, and confront an increasingly competitive international and regional environment, Egypt needs to elaborate and implement a clear and well-defined adjustment and reform program. Measures need to aim at increasing savings and investment levels, liberalizing the regulatory framework, significantly reducing the size of the public sector, improving financial intermediation, restoring competitiveness and liberalizing trade, enhancing the structure of government revenue and expenditure, and strengthening the social safety net. Improvements in the data base are also important.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Egypt were initiated in Cairo during December l-18. 1994, and continued through a subsequent exchange of documents, with the last document provided by the Egyptian authorities on July 17, 1995. 1/ The staff had also started in December 1993 discussions on the first review under the current extended arrangement, which had been scheduled to be completed by end-February 1994. However, despite frequent discussions between the authorities and Fund management and staff, no understandings could be reached on a corrective policy package to safeguard the medium-term objectives envisaged under the extended arrangement. Since the staff and the authorities had intended to combine the report on the first review with that on the Article IV consultation, the conclusion of the 1994 consultation discussions was delayed (EBD/95/32). In the circumstances, the third and final tranche of the Paris Club debt reduction and reorganization, conditional on the conclusion of the last review or the approval of an appropriate arrangement before end-June 1994, has not been made effective (SM/91/129). The Fund and the World Bank staffs have continued to cooperate closely on Egypt, particularly in the context of the Bank's Structural Adjustment Monitoring Program (SAMP). The World Bank staff participated actively in the discussions between the Fund staff and the authorities, including those on the Article IV consultation. The first review under the SAMP, relating to the end-December 1993 targets for structural reforms, was completed in July 1994. The World Bank considered progress with respect to these targets to have been largely satisfactory, although a number of the end-December 1993 reforms were delayed. At the request of the authorities, subsequent reviews of the structural reforms have not taken place. The World Bank considers the SAMP to be inoperative, and, in agreement with the authorities, has no intention of undertaking these reviews in the future. 1/ The Egyptian representatives included the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Planning; the Ministers of Finance; Public Sector, Environment Affairs, and Administration Development: Economy and External Trade: and International Cooperation; the Governor of the Central Bank; and other senior officials. The Managing Director met with the President, the Prime Minister, and the Egyptian representatives. The First Deputy Managing Director also held discussions with the Prime Minister and the Egyptian representatives. The staff teams over the last two years included Messrs. Nsouli (Head), Zavadjil (Resident Representative), Lazare, I. H. Lee, MacArthur, Decressin, and Ms. Daseking (all MED); Messrs. K. Lee and Subramanian (PDR); and Messrs. Daniel and Garcia (FAD), Mr. Chabrier (MED) participated in the discussions. Messrs. Voyadzis, Musalem, Burmester, Petersen, and Giugale, of the World Bank, took part in the discussions. Mr. Shaalan, the Fund's Executive Director for Egypt, and Mrs. Farid, Advisor to Executive Director, also participated.

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 20, 1993, at which time the Board also approved Egypt's request for a precautionary extended arrangement in an amount of SDR 400 million (EBS/93/139. and Supplements 1 and 2). On that occasion, Executive Directors welcomed the progress that Egypt had made in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform, and expressed strong support for the comprehensive program envisaged under the extended arrangement. While Directors were concerned that the continuing reform effort could create social pressures, most believed that determined implementation of the program would be critical to expanding private investment and restoring economic growth. A number of Directors, noting the large appreciation of the real effective exchange rate and the high rate of inflation, believed that exchange rate flexibility would be required to restore competitiveness and foster outward-oriented growth. While progress has been made in improving the data base, important deficiencies, relating particularly to the national income accounts and trade data, remain and complicate the economic analysis (Appendix II). The Egyptian authorities regularly provide data to the Fund on prices, exchange rates, and monetary and fiscal accounts. Much of this information is also published, although with varying lags. II. Backpround Building on the progress made under the 1991/92-1992/93 (July/June) program, 1/ the Government's three-year program, covering 1993/94-1995/96 and supported by the extended arrangement, aimed at stimulating economic activity and employment generation through an outward-oriented private sector-led growth strategy, while consolidating financial stability. On the macroeconomic front, the program envisaged a further improvement in the budgetary position to release additional resources to the private sector, combined with a monetary policy designed to ease interest rates to foster private investment while containing inflationary pressures. These policies were expected to ease the upward pressure on the exchange rate and gradually reverse the real effective appreciation of the Egyptian pound. The authorities undertook to adapt their intervention policy on the foreign exchange market, as necessary, to achieve the programmed reversal. On the structural front, a broad range of reforms was envisaged, including the restructuring and privatization of public enterprises, the further reform of the financial sector and investment regulations. the adoption of a global income tax, the evolution of the General Sales Tax (GST) into a full-fledged value-added tax (VAT), the reduction in customs tariff rates, the virtual elimination of the remaining nontariff barriers to trade, and the adoption of a foreign exchange law. l-/ EBS/93/139, Supplement 1 provides an overview of the progress made under the stand-by arrangement that expired in May 1993. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - In line with program targets, the overall budget deficit was reduced to 2.5 percent of GDP in 1993/94 and 1.5 percent of GDP in 1994/95. The impact of this improvement "as reflected in a decline in interest rates and in the average annual inflation rate, even though inflation picked up and exceeded the program objective in 1994/95. HO"W.S?L, while interest rates declined, they remained above market-clearing levels, as reflected in an accumulation of excess reserves in the banking system (Chart l), and were substantially higher than those on foreign currency-denominated assets (Chart Z), attracting larger short-term capital inflows than envisaged. This, combined with the Central Bank's decision not to adapt its intervention policy on the foreign exchange market to achieve the envisaged depreciation, sustained the virtual stability of the Egyptian pound vis-B-vis the U.S. dollar. Although the real effective exchange rate fluctuated during 1994/95, the cumulative real effective appreciation at end-May 1995 remained at 29 percent relative to February-March 1991 (Chart 3 and Appendix V) u. As a result of the fiscal adjustment and the interest rate policy pursued, all the performance criteria and indicative ceilings, except for those on external payments .arre.srs, were met in 1993/94. Regarding structural reforms, the global income tax and foreign exchange laws were adopted, and the GST structure "as improved. While progress "as also made in other areas, it fell short of that envisaged under the extended arrangement (Table l), as detailed in Section III. The analysis of developments in 1993/94-1994/95 is complicated by the aforementioned data deficiencies, particularly on national income accounts and external trade (Appendix II). The authorities estimated the growth in real GDP at 3.9 percent in 1993/94 and 4.5 percent in 1994/95 (Table 2). However, the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank estimated that economic activity had risen by about 2 percent in 1993/94 and, particularly in view of a poor harvest, stagnated in 1994/95 (Appendix III). Unemployment, estimated at about 20 percent, continued to be high. While national savings and investment as a ratio of GDP fluctuated, they exhibited a downward trend, and were lower in 1994/95 than in 1989/90 (Chart 4); owing to data deficiencies, the breakdown between the public and the private sector cannot be established. Inflation was kept to below the programmed average annual rate of 9 percent in 1993/94, but rose above the target of 6.3 percent in 1994/95 to reach 9.4 percent. In the external sector, the current account deficit, excluding official transfers, at 1.4 percent of GDP in 1993/94, "as held below the targeted level, as a shortfall in merchandise exports "as more than compensated by lower imports and higher tourism receipts and remittances. Given that the lower-than-projected official transfers and medium- and long-term drawings were only partly offset by higher-than-envisaged net short-term capital inflows, the balance of payments surplus is estimated at USS1.7 billion, somewhat lower than programmed. u As indicated in Appendix V, the real effective exchange rate had risen by 18 percent by May 1995, relative to the average of the period February- October 1991.

III. Reuort on the Discussions 1. overview The staff welcomed the progress that had been made during 1993/94- 1994/95 in a number of areas, such as the improvement in the fiscal position, the containment of government expenditures to budgeted levels, the introduction of the global income tax, and the adoption of the foreign exchange law. The staff, however, noted that the macroeconomic policy mix in 1993/94 and 1994/95 had diverged from that envisaged under the program. At the same time, although some progress had been made in such areas as public enterprise reform, tariff reduction, and financial sector reform, there had been slippages in the implementation of structural reforms. These slippages had compounded the difficulties created by the significant loss in external competitiveness. As a result, even when the macroeconomic targets had been met in 1993/94, the underlying developments had not been consistent with the outward-oriented growth strategy envisaged under the extended arrangement and with sustainable domestic and external balance over the medium term. Instead, the policies pursued and the developments in the exchange and money markets, as well as in the external sector, suggested that the overriding objectives of the authorities had been to maintain a fixed parity vis-A-vis the U.S. dollar and to continue to attract short-term capital inflows to boost the international reserves position of the Central Bank (Chart 5). These objectives had required keeping interest rates above market-clearing levels to maintain a significant, albeit narrowing, differential between Egyptian pound- and U.S. dollar-denominated assets. The policies pursued had failed to reduce inflation to trading partner levels and had not achieved a "critical mass" of structural reforms to foster the envisaged supply response. The authorities underscored the progress that Egypt had made since 1991. They were of the view that the financial policy mix during 1993/94-1994/95 had been appropriate, and that further considerable progress had been made on the structural front. They pointed out that the policies implemented since 1991 had brought down inflation significantly, moderated wage increases, restored balance of payments viability, and reduced the size of government borrowing, thereby providing more room for the private sector. In addition, budget sustainability had been enhanced by the structural and administrative reforms. Moreover, they noted that production and export growth had resumed. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAs such, while recognizing that there had been some appreciation of the currency, they did not consider it necessary to take steps to devalue the Egyptian pound; rather, they were of the view that a number of cost-reducing meesures they had taken end would take, together with their financial stance and other structural reforms, would improve export competitiveness. Tki stressed that, apart from being unnecessary, intervention in the market to effect a depreciation would undermine the hard-won confidence generated by the nominal stability of the rate against the U.S. dollar and run the risk of destabilizing the foreign exchange market. Looking ahead, there was a consensus between the staff and the authorities on the importance of pufsuing policies designed to achieve over the medium term en average annual growth rate of about 6 percent, to help Egypt raise living standards and reduce unemployment; reduce the vulnerability of the budget and balance of payments and limit inflation to maintain competitiveness; reap the dividends and meet the competitive pressures arising from the evolving international economic environment, including the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and a possible association agreement with the European Union (EU); and benefit from the positive atmosphere generated by the Middle East peace process. lJ There was also an agreement on the areas where structural reform was needed, even though the staff was of the view that a more precise definition of the scope, content, and timetable for implementation to deepen the structural reforms was important. However, while there was a common view on the need to consolidate financial balances and enhance competitiveness, there was a divergence of views on the appropriate budgetary/monetary/exchange rate policy mix to be pursued over the medium term. 2. Develooments end policies in 1993/94-1994/95 a. Macroeconomic oolicies The authorities pointed out that the budeet deficit had fallen to the programmed levels in 1993/94 and 1994/95. The reduction in the budget deficit in 1993/94 had been achieved through both revenue mobilization and expenditure restraint. The GST base had been extended, its rate structure simplified, and an import surcharge at the rates of 2 percent and 5 percent levied. In addition, the global income tax law had been approved by Parliament. The ratio of expenditure to GDP had been reduced through lower, and better-targeted, capital expenditure, and through economies on noninterest current expenditure. The budgetary improvement in 1994/95 had reflected further efforts to mobilise revenue, including a strengthening in tax and customs administration, a containment of noninterest expenditure, and a decline in interest payments. I/ A staff study on the impact of the Uruguay Round on Egypt in the accompanying recent economic developments report shows that, in the medium to long term, Egypt will need to undertake productivity-raising efforts to cope with the challenges and exploit the opportunities presented by the Round, especially in key sectors such as textiles and clothing.

Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicThe authorities noted that the size of the civil service had been substantially reduced since 1987, and that the growth of the wage bill of 13.1 percent in 1993/94 and 10.2 percent in 1994/95 had followed five years of economy-wide real wage declines, However, revenue. as a ratio to GDP, was estimated to have fallen. The main reasons were declines in receipts from the state oil corporation (EGPC) and the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). Progress had been made in the preparation and implementation of a civil service reform program, the implementation of actions to strengthen budgetary control procedures, and the preparatory work for the full implementation of the VAT. The staff welcomed the continued improvement in the budgetary position. At'the same time, the staff considered that the increase in the government wage bill in both 1993/94 and 1994/95 had been excessive. Apart from its adverse signaling effect to the private sector, it had further increased the resources for the combined wage bill, defense outlays, and interest payments, which accounted for 22.8 percent of GDP in 1993/94, compared to 18.9 percent of GDP in 1991/92. In addition, the data received from the Ministry of Finance indicated that civil service employment had grown by nearly 500,000 during 1989/90-1993/94 (Chart 6), and that Government employment, excluding public enterprises, had risen from 23.7 percent of the Egyptian labor force in 1991/92 to 24.2 percent in 1993/94. Accordingly, the staff expressed concern about the delay in elaborating and implementing a fully-specified and comprehensive civil service reform program. The staff noted that the observance of the budgetary target in 1993/94 had depended partly on limiting the sales of treasury bills for sterilization purposes, which had resulted in savings on interest.payments estimated at about LE 300 million (0.2 percent of GDP). While the limited sales of treasury bills had helped reduce the outstanding stock of domestic debt, the stock remained high, at 79.7 percent of GDP at end-June 1994 compared with 75.6 percent of GDP at end-June 1991 (Chart 7). Consequently, interest payments on domestic debt alone were estimated at 7.2 percent of GDP in 1994/95, broadly equivalent to the wage bill. The result was that, although Egypt had benefitted from debt reduction and reorganization both from Paris Club participants and other official bilateral creditors, the overall interest cost of the debt had risen and its maturity shortened. As regards tax reform, while the global income tax law had been approved, the law had not included the 1 percent minimum turnover tax and the 5 percent interest income withholding tax designed to widen the tax base and improve the distribution of the tax burden, Turning to monetarv uolic\r, the authorities noted that, broadly consistent with the objectives under the extended arrangement. monetary growth had been held at 12.4 percent in 1993/94 and was targeted at 9.4 percent in 1994/95. In the face of capital inflows, the careful use of sterilization policy had allowed for the liquidity growth targets to be met, while nominal and real interest rates had been reduced gradually. As a result of such an approach, the capital inflow problem in 1993/94 and 1994/95 had largely subsided. During the same period, growth of credit to the public sector had declined, while there had been a gradual increase in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - growth of credit to the private sector. Progress had been made in strengthening bank supervision and meeting prudential regulations. While there was an accumulation of excess reserves in the banking system, this had reflected inefficiencies in bank operations. In early 1995, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank had been given the authority to issue medium- term bonds, with a view to diversifying the range of financial instruments, developing the financial market, and lengthening the maturities of public debt. The staff considered that the decline in interest rates was a positive development. Nevertheless, it was of the view that interest rates had been held through the use of moral suasion by the Central Bank at above market- clearing levels, as evidenced by the accumulation of excess reserves in the banking system. The continued dominance of the banking sector by the four large public banks, which still seemed to be operating in ways that were inconsLstent with full commercial behavior. facilitated the use of moral suasion to achieve monetary objectives through nonmarket means. The cost to the commercial banks of holding excess reserves had been partly assumed by the Central Bank through the opening of interest-bearing accounts for commercial banks starting in 1994. While the interest rate policy had succeeded in attracting further, albeit reduced, short-term capital inflows and supporting the exchange rate peg vis-8-vis the U.S. dollar, it had involved an implicit cost to the economy of about 2 percent of GDP, stemming mainly from the difference in interest rates between that paid on the stock of capital inflows and that earned on the counterpart foreign assets. It had also contributed to the development of inefficiencies in the financial system; the imposition of an implicit tax on the banking sector arising from the fact that a certain proportion of excess reserves was unremunerated, whereas interest was paid on the counterpart deposits; and the reduction of the Central Bank's flexibility in using its key indirect monetary policy instrument--the issuance and repurchase of treasury bills. Further, the reliance on interest rates to induce short-term capital inflows had been key to observing the floors on the Central Bank's net international reserves, as well as meeting the ceilings on its net domestic assets. As regards exchanee rate uolicy, the authorities indicated that they had allowed market forces to determine the exchange rate, with the Central Bank pursuing a policy of "passive" one-sided intervention aimed at preventing the nominal appreciation of the pound. The Central Bank's buying and selling rates were based on the previous day's rate in the interbank market, but were not binding on market participants. In the event, the Egyptian pound-U.S. dollar rate had remained virtually stable. The authorities noted that this stability had contributed to increased confidence in the Egyptian economy, and had dampened inflationary pressures, whereas an exchange rate adjustment would have carried the risk of destabilizing the foreign exchange market. Net capital inflows had declined and the dollarization rate had increased since July 1994, reflecting the narrowing in the interest differential between Egyptian pound and U.S. dollar-denominated assets. Some short-lived attacks on the pound had taken place, but those had been associated with the publicity surrounding the negotiations with the Fund.

They underscored that by moving the base period of the real effective exchange rate calculation from February-March 1991 to October 1991, to take into account the effect of the introduction of the GST on consumer prices, the real exchange rate appreciation through end-March 1995 would be reduced from 35 percent to 17 percent. In addition, the structural shifts in the E?CO"OtSy ( such as the lower budget deficit, positive real interest rates, and the improvement in the balance of payments position had moved the equilibrium real effective exchange rate to a more appreciated level. Furthermore, private sector exports had performed strongly during 1991-94, rising by a" estimated 20 percent per annum, while public sector exports had fallen sharply owing to exogenous factors, such as the discontinuation of barter agreements and a loss of markets in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In July-December 1994, total non-oil exports had risen by 70 percent over the same period of the preceding year. Accordingly, the authorities did not consider exchange rate indicators as reliable measures for evaluating the loss of export competitiveness. Nonetheless, they had taken a number of administrative, tax, and customs measures that they estimated would reduce costs to exporters by 6-9 percent, including improvements in the temporary admission scheme u and the introduction of customs rebates. The staff recognized that the measured appreciation depended on the choice of the base period, but concluded that February-March 1991 was a reasonably appropriate choice, since it coincided with the liberalization of the exchange market and the unification of the exchange system. In its view, the impact of the reform of the GST in 1991 on the price level was minimal, amounting, at most, to only 2 percentage points (Appendix V). In addition, the terms of trade had deteriorated by about 22 percent between early 1991 and end-1994, which, in conjunction with other exogenous developments, such as the loss of export markets, suggested a downward rather than a" upward shift in the equilibrium exchange rate. Furthermore, the tax measures aimed at improving export competitiveness were estimated by the staff not to reduce export costs, insofar as the previous system had already provided for a duty and sales tax drawback scheme. While some improvements in administrative procedures could lower costs, these were difficult to quantify and would have, in any event, no effect on the competitiveness of import-competing industries or services. The staff also noted that other indicators of competitiveness suggested a" overvaluation ranging from 22 percent to 56 percent (Appendix V). Further, non-oil export performance through 1993/94 had suffered distinctly, and, as explained below, it remained to be see" whether performance in the first half of 1994/95 signaled a durable reversal. The staff considered that the stability of the pound had been operationally maintained by the Central Bank's system of setting daily preannounced exchange rates, as the Central u Appendix V. Table 10, item 8. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - Bank’s high reserve level gave credibility to the preannounced rates. It also noted that, even then, the small-scale speculative attacks and the reversal of the three-year trend of dedollarization suggested some market concerns about the sustainability of the exchange rate. b. Structural reforms The authorities underscored that most end-December 1993 and end-June 1994 structural measures under the extended arrangement had been met, albeit with some delays, but noted that a number of measures that had been scheduled for 1994/95 had been postponed. In February 1994, the maximum tariff rate had been reduced from 80 percent to 70 percent. In addition, tariff rates on some capital goods had been reduced to 5 or 10 percent, both in 1993/94 and 1994/95. Further tariff reform had been postponed because the authorities considered that it would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the lower-income groups. As regards the exchange system, the new foreign exchange law enacted had eliminated the repatriation requirements for export proceeds. The authorities noted that all the privatization targets had been met on time. The private sector had assumed majority ownership in 1993-95 in 17 of the identified 60 profitable companies. Eleven of the 17 companies had been privatized through Employee Shareholder’s Associations (ESAS), and a minimum of 20 percent of equity of 12 other profitable companies had been privatized. The strategy followed was to offer successful companies for sale either through bids or through the placement of their stock in the capital market. The difficulties in selling companies that needed restructuring had persuaded the Government to resort to other forms of divestiture, such as leasing and sales of assets. Significant progress had been achieved as regards the restructuring of the public sector. Profit and return on equity targets had been observed; 15 nonviable enterprises had been liquidated; plans had been made to restructure companies in need of restructuring; and 27 companies had returned a profit and had been prepared for privacization. Efforts had been undertaken to privatize the joint- venture banks, but problems with the valuation of the banks were still being worked out. Regarding the reeulatorv enviionment, energy-intensive industries had been removed from the negative investment list in December 1993. The Government. had submitted the draft of a unified investment law ta the Parliament in December 1994. It had also prepared a revised labor code, and presented a rent decontrol law for consideration by the Parliament. All remaining price controls on industrial goods had been eliminated at end- 1993, and the agricultural sector had been further liberalized. Numerous administrative actions had been taken to simplify investment approval procedures and encourage private sector investment. In particular, governorates’ decrees establishing investment approval procedures and other government agencies’ Licensing activities had been abolished in 1995 for all projects with authorized capital of less than LE 50 million. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - While commending the authorities on the progress made in a number of areas, the staff expressed concern that the further reduction in tariffs scheduled for end-December 1994, as well as some other trade liberalization measures for end-June 1994, had not been implemented; those scheduled for end-June and end-December 1995 had been postponed. The staff considered that the impact of the reduction in the maximum tariff in February 1994 had been partially offset by the imposition and maintenance of an import surcharge levied at rates of 2 and 5 percent. As regards privatization, the staff noted that the December 1993 targets had not been met on time, and that, therefore, the first review under the World Bank's SAMP was completed only in July 1994. Further, a full assessment of the status of the privatization program at end-December 1994 and end-June 1995, as well as that of the structural reforms in general, had not been possible, as a World Bank review mission had been postponed at the request of the authorities. If the authorities had eventually met the privatization targets, it had been mostly by selling minority rather than majority shares, and even those to newly formed ESAs rather than to private investors. The staff also noted that the investment and employment commitments required from investors may have contributed to the lack of interest in some companies offered for sale. In addition, there had been delays in privatizing joint-venture banks and identifying a public bank for privatization. In all, it did not appear that the scope of the public enterprise sector, which had accounted for about 68 percent of industrial production in 1989/90, had declined significantly. There had also been delays in the adoption and implementation of the revised unified investment law and the rent decontrol law. While the elimination of the governorates' approval procedures and other authorizations on investment of less than LE 50 million had been a move in the right direction, the staff noted that the action had fallen short of the liberalization of investment envisaged under the program. As regards exchange restrictions, the staff urged the authorities to remove the remaining three restrictions to enable Egypt to accept the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The authorities noted that they had undertaken serious efforts to eliminate two of these restrictions. Thus, arrears to non-Paris Club creditors had declined from US$423 million at end-June 1993 to US$207 million at end-November 1994. They expected the remaining arrears to be cleared through debt: conversion operations. Progress had also been made in relation to the multiple currency practice arising from the special exchange rate for liquidation accounts from expired bilateral payments agreements; outstanding balances in those accounts had been settled with all but thirteen countries. The authorities added that, while they would have liked to eliminate the third restriction arising from the bilateral payments agreement with Sudan, they were seeking to minimize the financial costs of doing so. 1/ 1,' Egypt's bilateral payments agreement with Russia was formally terminated in November 1994, and the outstanding balance was transferred to a liquidation account. In January 1994, Egypt signed its last bilateral agreement under the 1991 Paris Club rescheduling, and was undertaking negotiations to clear its outstandinp, arrears to non-P.?yis Club r:redi!-nry Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - c. Outcome The authorities expressed satisfaction with the performance of the Egyptian economy in 1993/94-1994/95. They underscored that inflation had been reduced to below the targeted rate in 1993/94 and, after a temporary surge in prices of fruits and vegetables, had returned to 8.7 percent in May 1995, close to its underlying annual rate; economic growth had exceeded significantly the program objectives of 2.0 percent in 1993/94 and 3.3 percent in 1994/95, reaching 3.9 percent in 1993/94 and an estimated 4.5 percent in 1994/95; and the external sector position had continued to strengthen, with the Central Bank's net international reserves reaching USS17.9 billion (about 20 months of imports of goods) at end-June 1995. The staff considered that, notwithstanding the progress made in improving the data base, the evaluation of economic performance was hampered by the lack of reliable data (Appendix II), and expressed concern that the authorities had not taken advantage of a World Bank technical assistance mission or of the Fund's Statistics Department's offer of a technical assistance mission. The staff explained that its estimates for 1993/94 and 1994/95 for economic growth diverged considerably from those of the authorities, partly as the envisaged improvement in competitiveness, which had been expected to contribute to an expansion in the tradables sector and a reinvigoration of the private sector, had not taken place, and also on account of the poor harvest in 1994/95 (Appendix III). Inflation had been fueled in 1993/94 and 1994/95 by wage increases and by monetary growth, despite the stability of administered prices and the dampening impact of the exchange rate policy. While inflation had indeed been held to below the targeted level in 1993/94, it had picked up in 1994/95. The staff recognized that the poor harvest in 1994/95 had played a role, but the underlying inflation, based on the authorities' estimate, remained high compared with key trading partner countries. Turning to external sector developments, the staff noted that export proceeds had fallen further by about 10 percent in 1993/94, reflecting both the drop in oil prices and a reduction in industrial exports consistent with the growing loss of competitiveness, bringing the cumulative decline in non- oil export volume to 19 percent during 1991/92-1993/94. Import payments had been broadly stagnant--despite the reduction in tariffs and the scope of quantitative restrictions as well as the real appreciation of the pound-- reflecting in part the manner in which quality control regulations were being applied. Import volume in 1993/94 was 13.6 percent below the level in 1985/86. Reflecting these developments, Egypt's openness index had declined significantly, and its shares of world exports and imports had fallen (Chart 8). Turning to 1994/95, the staff observed that, while preliminary data for the first half of 1994/95 showed a strong non-oil export performance, almost half of the increase in non-oil exports appeared to be accounted for by a one-off reduction in cotton stocks. Furthermore, the data provided were at variance with those reported by partner countries.

Thus, it remained to be seen whether the recent non-oil export performance constituted a durable reversal. In all, the balance of payments position remained vulnerable, insofar as it was highly sensitive to the volatility in petroleum and food prices, end continued to rely heavily on remittances, tourism receipts, official transfers, and short-term capital inflows. 3. The medium term: Dolicies and DrosDects There was a common view on the need to pursue policies designed to achieve over the medium term a rate of real economic growth of about 6-7 percent annually, against an estimated annual growth in population of 2.0 percent and in the labor force of 2.7 percent, to both reduce gradually the high level of unemployment (estimated at about 20 percent) and bring about a decisive improvement in per capita income. There was also agreement that such an ambitious growth objective could only be sustained if the financial balances were consolidated and structural reforms deepened through an acceleration in the pace of reforms and a widening of their scope. The staff shared the authorities' views that the strategy should focus on increasing the role of the private sector in generating economic growth and economic activity; maintaining strict fiscal and monetary policies; better integrating the Egyptian economy into the world economy through trade liberalization; and promoting human resource development. To these ends, the staff was of the view that the strategy had to aim at fostering savings and investment; putting in place an enabling regulatory framework; narrowing the share of public enterprises in economic activity; improving financial intermediation; enhancing competitiveness and reducing tariff and nontariff barriers; strengthening the structure of the budget; and establishing a comprehensive social safety net. However, there was divergence of views on the appropriate macroeconomic policy mix and on the specificity, content, and time frame for structural reforms. a. 'Jhe authorities' views On the macroeconomic front, the authorities were of the view that the policies being pursued had already yielded demonstrably positive results. Therefore, they saw no need for a shift in the macroeconomic policy mix. The budget deficit would be maintained within a range of l-l.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, with a deficit target of 1.5 percent of GDP already approved for 1995/96. The authorities would continue with the phased introduction of the value added tax as technical preparations progressed; implement further expenditure control measures based on the Fund's technical assistance recommendations; pursue the civil service reform; reduce customs tariffs; and maintain a constant real wage bill. A restrained monetarv uolicy would also be pursued. Interest rates would be maintained at about 2-3 percentage points above the inflation rate, while the market mechanism for the determination of interest rates would be strengthened. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 Exchanee rate policy would be geared toward maintaining the confidence of the private sector in the stability of the exchange and capital markets. The rate of appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the pound would continue to be reduced through a decline in the rate of inflation to 5-6 percent by end-1995, and to partner country levels in the first half of 1996, at which time the Government would adopt a policy of maintaining a constant real effective exchange rate. This would be achieved through market forces, and there would be no administrative intervention in the exchange market. In the authorities' view, the focus had to be on furthering the structural reforms to improve competitiveness. They, therefore, intended to take a number of actions over the medium term. . Tariff reform would continue, but would be postponed to coincide with a later phase in the reform of the GST. However, the authorities had indicated that they had planned to bring forward the target date for reducing tariffs on all the remaining capital goods in the agreed list to 5 percent and 10 percent from end-December 1995 to end-June 1995. In addition, investment goods for factories would be exempt from the GST pending the application of the VAT. The stamp tax on the authorized capital of new joint stock corporations would be eliminated. The business turnover tax and interest income withholding tax would be resubmitted to Parliament when propitious. . The Government planned to accelerate the urivatization ~roeram. In that regard. the authorities had indicated in December 1994 that they intended to exceed the privatization targets envisaged under the program by 20 percent or more in 1995, depending on the absorptive capacity of the market. The Government would deepen the privatization program through the sale of shares in the stock market. The privatization of profitable companies would continue. In 1995/96, the remaining most successful companies would be offered for sale (31 out of a total of 60 companies), and shares of 27 restructured companies would be placed on the stock market. The shares would be placed on the market in tranches, starting with 20 percent. Sales of the stocks of these public companies would continue until majority ownership was transferred to the private sector, except for certain key industries. During 1996-98, the Government would offer for sale stocks of all companies whose profitability was expected to improve, in addition to restructured companies that had become profitable. Companies which needed restructuring would be offered to the private sector to buy, lease, or manage, with first priority given to the buying option. In the absence of interested parties and cases where consultants determined that the price offered was too low, the holding companies would take the responsibility of carrying out the needed restructuring to speed up privatization. In addition, all companies that had accumulated losses and could not be restructured would be liquidated. The remaining privatization proceeds (after restructuring) would eventually be transferred to the budget. The authorities had indicated in December 1994 that they would also Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 seek to sell 60 percent of the Government's total share in joint-venture banks and select one major public sector bank and one insurance company for privatization. . The liberalization of the repulatorv environment would continue. The draft Unified Investment Law had been submitted to Parliament. A committee had been established to examine all the laws, decrees, and texts that had a bearing on investment and business activities. The objective,was to redraft the texts of 18 laws to streamline the procedures and =x-ante involvement of governments departments and to create a friendly environment to private investments. In addition, the commercial code was being reviewed and an equipment leasing law was being elaborated. A unified labor code, which would consolidate the various existing labor laws, was currently being examined by the Egyptian business community and the Trade Union Federation. The Government would exert efforts to mobilize Parliamentary support to secure approval of the rent decontrol law, and would remove the current barriers to private sector entry into the sectors of electricity, water, post, port management, development of investment zones, education, and health. . The reform of the civil service, initiated in January 1995, would be pursued to achieve three objectives: (i) to reduce employment in the civil service; (ii) to reduce the number of government agencies; and (iii) to improve the performance and quality of services provided. A study would be conducted in 1995/96 for selected government services to decide which would be operated on a cost recovery basis. Government employment would be reduced through the continued freeze on the hiring of nontechnical staff; the lifting of all restrictions on leaves of absence; the encouragement of early retirement; and the retraining of clerical staff to help them find self-employment. A number of government departments would be transformed into independent economic organizations. Ten test projects to improve the quality of government services would be implemented during 1995/96. . The Social Fund for Development (SFD) would continue to focus on job creation beyond 1996, when the SFD was originally envisaged to expire. In its post-1996 phase, the SFD would require US$300-US$400 million per year to generate an estimated 216,000 jobs per year. The Government agreed to the need for a strengthened social safety net. To this end, it had identified the "ultra-poor" that would benefit from a cash transfer program, once funds became available. The self-targeting subsidy for baladi bread, which amounted to about 1.5 percent of GDP in 1994/95, would continue. b. The staff's views The staff welcomed the prospective reforms enunciated by the authorities and considered that they went in the right direction. However, the proposals on structural measures would not significantly deepen reforms, lacked specificity, and involved, in certain cases, delays vis-8.vis the time frame originally envisaged under the extended arrangement. The staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicnoted that achieving a high growth rate would require a major increase in productivity and a substantial improvement in investment incentives. In particular, the introduction at an early stage of key structural reforms would be essential to ensure the credibility of the reform effort and the needed private sector supply response. Furthermore, the macroeconomic package was not internally consistent and was likely to erode investment incentives further and jeopardize balance of payments viability over the medium term (section c, below). The staff did not share the view that structural reforms alone in the case of Egypt could substitute for an appropriate exchange rate action. On the contrary, it considered that a realistic exchange rate was required to provide the needed complement to such key structural reforms as trade liberalization. The staff explained that the continuation of the stabilization of the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound against the U.S. dollar would require that competitiveness be restored by lowering Egypt's inflation rate well below the average for its competitors. Such an approach, which was unlikely to succeed, would require the implementation of highly restrictive financial policies coupled with very strong and wide-ranging structural reforms to lower costs and achieve major improvements in overall productivity. The policies involved would initially be highly deflationary, and imply considerably higher social costs than a more balanced and comprehensive approach. Against this background, the staff suggested that there was a need to strengthen various policy areas, without excluding any of the available policy instruments: specify more concretely the actions to be taken; and define the time frame for their implementation. To maximize the benefits to the economy, it would be important to ensure that the macroeconomic policies--fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate--complemented and were reinforced by the structural reforms. With regard to macroeconomic uolicy!, the staff indicated that, in view of the large overvaluation, a credible upfront exchange rate adjustment, supported by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies as well as forceful structural reforms, would be critical to boost performance of the export and import-competing sectors, reduce distortions, and reinforce market confidence. To safeguard competitiveness over the medium term, there was a need to bring about a durable improvement in the budgetary position, through a well-designed and clearly defined civil service reform program to reduce the wage bill; a wage policy for public sector employees involving initially only partial adjustments for the cost-of-living increases, which would also provide a signal to the private sector and reduce cost-push inflationary pressures; a reduction in nonessential and less productive expenditures; and a rationalization of public investment to support private sector activity. Concurrently, structural tax measures were needed to widen the revenue base, enhance the elasticity of the tax system, and reduce the vulnerability of receipts, particularly in view of the high share of receipts from the petroleum sector and the Suez Canal. A strong improvement in the budgetary position would help in widening the scope for private sector credit while limiting the growth in domestic liquidity.

To alleviate the current distortions in the financial markets, the existing impediments to market-determined interest rates, in terms of the dominance of the public banks and the use of moral suasion by the Central Bank, would have to be addressed. As regards structural reforms, there was a need to accelerate the pace of tariff reform, discontinue the current import surcharge and eliminate the implicit restrictions embodied in quality control regulations. The gains in efficiency from trade reform would be reinforced by the implementation of a credible privatization effort to widen the scope for private sector activity and signal the authorities' commitment to private sector-led growth. While the intention to liquidate nonviable companies and accelerate sales of profitable companies was welcome, the staff expressed concern about the ambiguity of the timetable, the lack of quantified sales objectives, the reluctance to sell majority ownership outright, the exclusion of the sale of majority ownership in some unspecified "certain key industries," the move toward granting in certain cases private management contracts instead of full-fledged privatization, and the intention to restructure certain enterprises prior to offering them for privatization. The staff noted that a speeding up in the adoption and effective implementation of an appropriate unified investment law, a meaningfully revised labor code, and a rent decontrol law, as well as the liberalization of the remaining price controls, including those on rents, utilities, and petroleum products, would help improve investment incentives. Further, the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank had reviewed the draft of the unified investment law, and considered that it did not provide a sufficiently clear, comprehensive, neutral, and predictable environment for business activity. The staff shared the view that an adequate social safety net would be essential to underpin a reinforced reform program, which would include improved targeting of social transfers end less reliance on generalized subsidies. The authorities' proposals did not provide for such a net. The staff agreed that the SFD could be an element of the social safety net; however, it considered that the SFD should be used less as a means of generating employment, but rather, as originally planned, to mitigate potential short-run adverse effects of the reform process. c. Illustrative medium-term scenarios To illustrate the points raised during the discussions, the staff provided the authorities with a medium-term macroeconomic scenario assuming that (i) there would be a deepening of structural reforms: (ii) aggregate demand management and wage policy would be geared to containing inflationary pressures; (iii) the intervention policy of the Central Bank would be adapted to bring about an upfront downward adjustment in the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound in July 1995--assumed for illustrative purposes to amount to 25 percent in foreign currency terms--supported with restrained financial policies; and (iv) interest rate policy would be geared to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - supporting the exchange rate policy initially by stabilizing market expectations and subsequently by allowing an orderly reversal of short-term capital flows (Appendix IV). The projections showed that, under such an adjustment and reform scenario, the achievement of a gradual increase in real GDP growth to 6.3 percent by 1998/99 would require a substantial increase in gross investment from 16.8 percent of GDP in 1993/94 to 22.5 percent in 1998/99 (Table 3, Chart 9). To maintain a viable external sector position, gross national savings would need to rise to 21.1 percent of GDP in 1998/99 from 15.4 percent in 1993/94. An important part of the increase in savings would need to come both from improved performance of the public enterprise sector and a stronger budgetary position. Apart from the structural tax and expenditure reforms discussed above. the budget would benefit from the exchange rate adjustment and from the unwinding of the treasury bills issued to sterilize the short-term capital inflows. The inflationary impact of the devaluation would be limited through a moderate growth in domestic liquidity. As the positive impact of increased competitiveness on exports would offset only partly the impact of the pick-up in investment activity and the trade liberalization on imports, the trade deficit would widen. With an expected improvement in the services account and private transfers, the external current account position, excluding official transfers, would remain in near balance over the period considered. Assuming official transfers remained relatively constant in nominal terms; that a return to market-determined interest rates would help reverse capital inflows, particularly in 1995/96 and 1996/97; and that the improved domestic economic environment would attract increasing levels of foreign direct investment, the balance of payments would incur a small deficit in 1995/96. With a tapering off in capital outflows in subsequent years and assuming the implementation of the third tranche of the Paris Club debt reduction and reorganization, the balance of payments would revert to a surplus over the medium term. An alternative scenario, by contrast, assumed that the authorities maintained their current policy stance, involving high interest rates to attract capital inflows to support the peg to the U.S. dollar and safeguard the substantial level of foreign reserves. Under this scenario, inflation would pick up. reflecting in particular the continued full adjustment of the government wage bill for inflation and a deteriorating fiscal position, owing partly to sluggish growth and an increasing interest burden on domestic debt, which would frustrate the authorities' intention to hold the budget deficit to its current level in terms of GDP. As a result, the real effective exchange rate would appreciate at an annual average rate of more than 8 percent over the medium term. The combination of high interest rates and an increasingly overvalued exchange rate would undermine investment incentives, contributing to a drop in gross investment and a concomitant weakening in economic growth, resulting in growing unemployment and declining per capita income. Concurrently, the sluggish economic activity would adversely affect private savings, which, together with the deteriorating budgetary position, would lead to a widening in the external current account deficit.

Egypt would thus be caught in a vicious circle involving weak economic activity and a deteriorating structure of its external sector position. The increasing macroeconomic imbalances could in due course lead to a major and sudden shift in market sentiment, resulting in a speculative attack on the pound and bringing about forced adjustment in a disorderly manner. Under both scenarios, Egypt would maintain its capacity to repay the Fund. Egypt's outstanding principal obligations to the Fund stood at SDR 100.9 million at end-July 1995. Debt service to the Fund would decline from SDR 73.3 million in 1995, amounting to less than 1 percent of gross reserves or of exports of goods and services, to about SDR 2.9 million from 1998 onwards. IV. Staff Aouraisal The Egyptian authorities are to be commended for the important adjustment and reform measures taken in 1993/94-1994/95 in a number of areas, particularly the reduction of the budget deficit and the adoption of the global income tax and foreign exchange laws. While some progress was made on privatization, trade liberalization, and deregulation, the overall pace of structural reform was slower than envisaged. Concurrently, the overvaluation of the currency supported by interest rate policy compounded the adverse effects on the economy of the delays in structural reforms. In a nutshell, the differences between the authorities and the staff have related to the pace and scope of structural reforms as well as the appropriateness of the exchange rate-interest rate mix. The staff appreciates the concerns of the authorities that altering the interest-exchange rate configuration could destabilize the foreign exchange market, and that fully implementing the envisaged structural reforms, such as tariff reductions, may have substantial transitional costs. However, it considers that the policies pursued involved higher costs and risks. First, the reduced incentives in the tradables sector and the uncertainties regarding the prospects for reform have had a" adverse impact on growth. Second, the total cost to the economy, resulting from the interest-exchange rate configuration to support the stock of short-term capital inflows and the corresponding high level of international reserves, amounted to nearly US$l billion per year (about 2 percent of GDP). Third, the increasing over-valuation of the exchange rate had carried the risk of a sudden shift in market sentiment. Looking ahead, the staff and the authorities have a common view on the three main medium-term challenges facing the Egyptian economy: a. Achieving a sufficiently high rate of economic growth not only to absorb the growing labor force but also to start reducing the high level of unemployment and improving living standards; Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - b. Strengthening the budget and balance of payments positions, which are subject to downside risks, such as potentially stagnating revenues from the Suez Canal, decreasing workers' remittances, and declining levels of foreign aid, as well as the volatility of oil and food prices; and c. Confronting the increased competition resulting from, and seizing the opportunities offered by, a rapidly changing regional and international environment , in particular with the implementation of the WTO agreement, the prospects for an association agreement with the EU, and changes in the regional economy associated with the Middle East peace process. From the discussions, at least seven major obstacles emerge, which will need to be overcome for Egypt to successfully meet the above-mentioned medium-term challenges. 1. Insufficient levels of savings and investment are constraining growth. The current levels of gross investment and national savings in Egypt have allowed for only a modest growth performance in recent years. A continued sluggish growth of about 2 percent annually would lead to an increase in the unemployment rate by about one percentage point per year. By contrast, the achievement of a sustainable average annual growth rate of 6 percent would help reduce unemployment by about one percentage point per year. However, the attainment of such a growth rate would require a marked pick-up in investment and in national savings, as well as a substantial increase in productivity, through a comprehensive macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform package. 2. Investment is hindered by the current regulatory framework. To streamline and liberalize the framework, a unified investment code should aim at rationalizing investment incentives; a revised labor code would need to provide for increased flexibility in the labor market; licensing and approval procedures for investment decisions, both at the national and local levels, would have to be abolished; private sector entry into sectors that are currently restricted, such as utilities, should be allowed; and the retiaining price controls, which generate considerable distortions, would need to be phased out. 3. The share of public enterprises in the economy remains large. Besides crowding out the private sector and limiting productivity gains, the slow progress on privatization, establishment of ESAs, and the hesitancy to sell outright majority shares have been viewed by the private sector as signaling the Government's lack of commitment to reform, thereby discouraging domestic as well as foreign direct investment. Accordingly, the Government needs to accelerate decisively the pace and widen substantially the scope of privatization. Privatization could be extended to public banks and utilities and would need to be effected through the sale of majority ownership to the private sector proper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - 4. Financial intermediation is hampered by interest rate rigidities and a weak financial system. While interest rates have declined, they have nevertheless remained above market-clearing levels, as evidenced by the accumulation of excess reserves in the banking system. This has reflected the use of moral suasion by the Central Bank, facilitated by the dominance of the four large public sector banks. The Central Bank has borne in part the cost of the excess reserves by opening interest-bearing accounts for commercial banks for a portion of these reserves. Furthermore, the outstanding treasury bills used for the sterilization of the stock of sho&- term capital inflows, attracted by the relatively high interest rates combined with the peg to the U.S. dollar, have involved a substantial fiscal burden. To improve financial intermediation and reduce distortions, interest rates should be allowed to be market-determined. This will require the avoidance of the use of moral suasion, the closure of the aforementioned accounts, and, over the medium term, the privatization of the public banks. 5. The rapidly eroding competitiveness of the Egyptian economy and relatively high tariff rates are imperiling the strategy of fostering outward-oriented growth and presage an unsustainable current account in the medium term. This is particularly evidenced by the substantive real effective appreciation of the Egyptian pound over the last four years in the face of a marked fall in the terms of trade. To restore competitiveness, the authorities need to adjust the exchange rate. The macroeconomic policy mix will have to be devised to ensure that it is viewed by the business community as credible not only in restoring competitiveness but also in maintaining competitiveness over time, thereby reinforcing market confidence in the currency. At the same time, given the disappointing progress thus far, Egypt needs to promptly implement all trade reforms envisaged under the program, and to further liberalize trade according to a preannounced path that would guide medium-term investment decisions. This would be facilitated by a competitive exchange rate. 6. The current fiscal position absorbs considerable resources and involves structural flaws. Despite the progress made, current expenditure as a ratio of GDP remains high. Interest payments and the wage bill are excessive, and absorb the bulk of current expenditure. The high wage bill reflects the fact that the Government employs nearly one quarter of the labor force, and has granted substantive wage adjustments for the civil service over the last two years. On the revenue side, the vulnerability of the base is evidenced by the high share of revenue in GDP from rents and the low share from taxes on goods and services. To address these problems, current expenditure needs to be reduced and restructured, and the tax system reformed. In this regard, the implementation of a comprehensive civil service reform program, a restrained government wage policy that would also avoid cost-push pressures through its signaling effect, a cutback in lower priority expenditure, the provision of additional resources for the social sectors, the reduction in tariff rates, and the full implementation of the VAT will be particularly important. The improved fiscal position, coupled with increased privatization receipts, would help not only in fostering Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - savings but also in the reduction of the Government's excessively high outstanding domestic debt. 7. The lack of a meaningful social safety net is limiting the speed at which reforms can be implemented. The authorities need to develop such a comprehensive net, in which the original role of the SFD to help displaced workers would be restored, to mitigate the transitional impact of a reinforced reform strategy and protect the most vulnerable groups. While Egypt has made progress in improving the data base and has been providing adequate monetary and fiscal data on a timely basis, considerable deficiencies, particularly as regards the national income accounts and external trade statistics, remain. Further work is, therefore, essential to provide a meaningful basis for analyzing developments. for policy formulation, and for more effective surveillance. The staff commends the authorities for their efforts to eliminate the remaining exchange restrictions under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and encourages them to complete their elimination as soon as possible. To recapitulate, the authorities have moved courageously over the last few years to stabilize the economy, particularly by reducing sharply the budget deficit. They have also taken important structural measures by initiating the privatization process and liberalizing several areas of economic activity. Yet the challenges to fully harness the potential of the Egyptian economy, in a rapidly changing world environment, remain large. They will require intensive and sustained adjustment and reform efforts to generate the critical mass of actions needed to elicit a favorable supply response. The Egyptian authorities recognize the challenges ahead, and need to ensure that the policies they pursue are commensurate with those challenges. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - V. ProDosed Decision The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the exchange measures of Egypt subject to Article VIII, Sections 2 (a) and 3, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Egypt conducted under Decision No. 5392- (77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in M/95/--, Egypt retains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions evidenced by external payments *rre*rs, a bilateral payments arrangement, and a multiple currency practice arising from a special exchange rate for liquidation accounts under terminated bilateral payments arrangements. These measures are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3. The Fund urges Egypt to eliminate these exchange restrictions as soon as possible.

National accounts, production, employment, and wages data are particularly weak. The latest actual national accounts data published by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) are for 1989/90. Beyond that date, only Ministry of Planning estimates are available. The coverage and compilation methodology of these estimates has not been made available to the staff and the estimates are often inconsistent with other indicators of economic activity, such as electricity and cement consumption, output of particular sectors, and foreign trade indicators. Based on such indicators, the staff has estimated lower growth rates for 1993/94 and 1994/95 compared with the estimates of the Ministry of Planning. The authorities have been reluctant to accept the Fund or the World Bank technical assistance to improve the national accounts and real sector data. Data on employment, wages. and industrial production are provided sporadically, and are usually available with a lag of a few years. Price statistics are provided regularly and with minimal delays, but the index is based on an outdated consumption basket that may not reflect price trends fully, and data on some items are only collected on a semi-annual basis. Balance of payments methodology is being revised, with Fund technical assistance, in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. This has resulted in significant improvements in methodology in recording services, workers' remittances, and private capital movements. Problems remain with trade statistics, particularly as there appear to be inconsistencies with those reported by partner countries. In addition, the recording of private capital transactions may not be comprehensive and current. Fiscal data are generally of good quality, but they exclude foreign- financed military outlays and their financing and do not provide comprehensive information on government arrears. Monetary statistics are comprehensive and generally accurate. To enhance their capacity to monitor and assess current economic developments and formulate appropriate policies, the authorities need to take a number of steps to improve the statistical data base. First, the authorities should make use of the available technical assistance to improve national accounts reporting and the CPI methodology. The authorities also need to introduce new indicators of economic activity, especially for industrial activity, to provide a more timely and accurate assessment of current economic activity. Second, data on wages and employment should be compiled on a more regular basis. Finally, the current work to improve balance of payments statistics and the reporting of data should be accelerated.

These estimates indicated a real growth rate of 3.9 percent and 4.5 percent in 1993/94 end 1994/95, respectively. After a thorough assessment of the authorities' data, the staff came to the conclusion that these estimates likely overestimated growth both in 1993/94 and 1994/95. 1. The authorities' estimates The estimates provided by the authorities suffer from the following problems: a. The January 1995 data differ significantly from those used both by the staff and the authorities for purposes of previous Article IV consultations and the Fund-supported programs. In the past, the staff had agreed with the authorities on estimates of national income accounts derived from the historical data computed by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), which is the Government's statistical agency in charge of preparing the official national income accounts. In recent discussions, the authorities considered the CAPMAS data an "experiment" based on the UN national income accounts recommendations. The January 1995 data are, therefore, not consistent with the authorities' previous national income accounts data. They have been prepared by the Ministry of Planning, and the estimates are close to the data prepared for the five-year planning projections. b. The January 1995 estimates imply, in particular, a significant, and largely unexplained, u upward revision in the level of national income; in particular, the new GDP data at current prices for 1989/90 are some 22 percent above the former data prepared by CAPMAS, which were previously reported as "final" data. c. The methodology used for elaborating the revised set of national income accounts raises some questions. In particular, the Ministry of Planning stated that it does not use deflators to determine sectoral growth rates but direct estimates of sectoral growth valued at their base year prices. While this methodology can be used for some sectors like agriculture and industry, it is not possible to directly observe growth rates in some other sectors, like the services sector. 1/ The authorities have provided the staff with a list of some methodological differences between data series on investment as estimated by the Ministry of Planning and by CAPMAS. However, these methodological considerations can only explain a fraction of the difference between the two sets of national accounts. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - APPENDIX III d. The sectoral deflators used by the Ministry of Planning seem somewhat low in 1993/94. Using the Egyptian data at current prices in 1992/93 and 1993/94, and a set of deflators elaborated by the World Bank staff, the staff concluded that the Egyptian authorities' data were consistent with a real growth of about 2-2.5 percent in 1993/94. e. The 1993/94 indices of activity in the industrial and services sectors, when available, do not, in general, support the Ministry of Planning estimates. f. The authorities' data are inconsistent with their own estimates of the balance of payments developments in 1994/95. Exports of goods and nonfactor services are estimated to have increased by 12.5 percent in the national income accounts against 16.5 percent in the authorities' balance of payments data for 1994/95. While the balance of payments data as.sumes that most of the 16.5 percent increase stemmed from an increase in volumes (non- oil and tourism exports), the national income accounts include an increase of only 1.5 percent in real terms (with a 10.8 percent rise in the deflator of exports). Restoring consistency on this point would involve either an upward revision in the growth rate or a downward revision in the growth of investment or consumption in real terms. g. The Ministry of Planning data estimate the 1994/95 growth rate in the agricultural sector at 2.8 percent, even though there has been a sharp decline in cotton production in 1994/95 of 40 percent according to the data provided by the Egyptian Cotton Authority. Some other important crops, like vegetables and fruits, have also been affected by adverse weather conditions. 2. The staff's estimates Against this background, the staff re-estimated the national income accounts. This work was based, in particular, on: (i) the 1989/90 national income accounts available from CAPMAS; (ii) the national income accounts that had been agreed upon with the authorities for purposes of the extended arrangement in 1993; (iii) the revised data for the balance of payments and the fiscal sectors for 1992/93 and 1993/94; and (iv) the available indices of real activity in different sectors in 1993/94 and 1994/95. The staff estimates point to a real growth rate of 2.3 percent in 1993/94 and to near stagnation in overall economic activity in 1994/95. For the period 1989/90 to 1992/93, the data are comparable to those included in the staff report on the 1993 Article IV consultation (EBS/93/139, Supplement 1). The main assumptions used to estimate the sectoral growth rates in 1993/94 and 1994/95 are as follows: Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - APPENDIX III a. Agricultural sector growth was estimated at 3.4 percent in 1993/94 based on detailed data provided by the Central Bank of Egypt in December 1994. Value added in the agricultural sector in 1994/95 was projected to fall by 9 percent, reflecting the aforementioned crop failures. b. Petroleum sector growth was estimated at 2.9 percent in 1993/94, in line with the increase in oil production. Value added in the sector was conservatively projected to increase slightly in 1994/95, despite a fall in oil production in the first half of 1994/95. c. The manufacturing sector was projected to grow by 2 percent in 1993/94 and 1994/95, based in part on the volume of electricity used by the industrial sector and a relatively good performance of the food processing industries. The same growth rate was estimated for 1994/95, despite a weaker performance in the food processing sector and in cement production during the first half of 1994/95. d. Construction activity was estimated to have risen by 4.1 percent in 1993/94 (i.e. the same percentage as the government estimates), but was estimated to have stagnated in 1994/95, despite the significant fall in the production of construction materials in the first six months of the year. e. Reflecting various indicators, and, in particular, an expected rebound in tourism activity in 1994/95, value added in the services sector was estimated to have grown by 1.7 percent in 1993/94 and by 2.3 percent in 1994/95. These estimates, which are used in the present staff report and the recent economic development report, are compatible with the balance of payments, fiscal, and monetary data for 1993/94 and 1994/95.

The analysis suggests that the Egyptian pound is overvalued by about 22 percent to 56 percent, depending on the indicator used. 1. The equilibrium exchange rate and the base ueriod A determination of whether the exchange rate is over- or under-valued requires the computation of the equilibrium exchange rate. In practice, it is very difficult to compute such a rate. Instead, competitiveness is assessed vis-&-vi* a base period. In the case of Egypt, the period February-March 1991 is used as the base for the following reasons. A new exchange system was introduced in February 1991 for a transitional period. Prior to that date, the exchange system consisted of three segmented exchange markets: the central bank pool, the commercial bank pool (or the new bank market), and the outside banks (or free) market. The exchange rate in the new bank market involved a form of managed floating, with the rate being set by a committee using various indicators. The exchange system introduced in February 1991 consisted of a dual exchange system under which the exchange rate in the primary market was maintained on a daily basis within 5 percent of the average rate in the secondary free market during the previous seven working days. Thus, the free market was effectively the rate-determining mechanism for the entire exchange system. 1/ In this light, the average level of the exchange rate that prevailed with the introduction of the new exchange system in the two-month period February-March 1991 can be considered as representing a market-clearing and market-determined rate. In fact, the sharp and temporary increase in loans and grants in 1990/91, deriving from the Gulf conflict may have biased the market-determined exchange rate in early 1991 (the base period), showing a temporary overvaluation. The authorities have suggested that the implementation of the General Sales tax (GST) in May 1991 would have led to an increase in the consumer price level, which in their view would not have affected competitiveness. Hence, the choice of February-March 1991 as the base period would overestimate the degree of over-valuation. However, estimates of revenues from consumption taxes before (broadly 1990/91 ) end after (broadly 1991/92) I,/ The rate in the free market depreciated gradually from LE 3.23 per U.S. dollar on February 27, 1991 to LE 3.32 per U.S. dollar by March 20. 1991, before stabilizing at around the then market-clearing rate. The exchange system was formally unified on November 28, 1991. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V the imposition of the GST indicate that the GST increased the tax burden-- measured as consumption tax revenues as a proportion of consumption expenditures--by about 2.1 percentage points. The maximum impact of this tax increase would have been an increase in the consumer price of about 2.1 percentage points. u This represents the maximum extent of "bias" in the measurement of competitiveness on account of the choice of February-March 1991 as the base period. On the other hand, some of the tax increase, which affected capital goods and inputs, affected producer costs and competitiveness, suggesting that the tax increase should not be excluded from the estimation of competitiveness. 2. Indicators of comuetitiveness In view of the lack of clear superiority--theoretically and empirically--of any one indicator, the following measures of competitiveness of the Egyptian economy are examined to assess whether any broad and consistent trend can be discerned from them: (i) the real effective exchange rate (REER) index provided by the Fund's Information Notice System (INS), which adjusts the nominal effective exchange rates by the consumer prices in Egypt relative to those of its trading partner countries and other competitors; (ii) the wage-based REER, which takes into account the cost structure of Egyptian exports relative to those of Egypt's key industrial trading partners; and (iii) the relative price of tradables to nontradables, which gives an indication of the relative profitability between, and hence resources attracted by, the two sectors. a. The Fund's INS REER The Fund's REER index shows that the Egyptian pound appreciated by 26.6 percent through May 1995 over the base period (Table 9). This index uses relative consumer prices as a proxy for the evolution of the factor CcJStS. Of the 28.6 percent real effective appreciation that occurred during this period, 13.8 percentage points resulted from the appreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate. Given the nominal stability of the Egyptian pound-U.S. dollar rate, this reflects the depreciation of Egypt's trading partners' currencies, on a weighted basis, against the U.S. dollar. The balance (13.0 percentage points) originated from the evolution of prices in Egypt, which increased relative to those of trading partners during this period. The reel effective appreciation of the pound peaked in December 1994 at 38.8 percent, and has since been partially reversed, in large part 1/ This maximum impact would occur if either demand conditions were completely inelastic or supply infinitely elastic with respect to price. With normal demand and supply conditions, the price impact would be less than the increase in the effective tax. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V because of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of Egypt's trading partners. If, instead, the average of the period February- October 1991 is chosen as the base, the real effective appreciation through May 1995 reached 17.9 percent, which remains sizeable. b. The wage-based REER Rather than using relative prices to assess developments in relative costs, relative wages can be used. Thus, the exchange rates adjusted by relative unit labor costs--defined as nominal wages adjusted for labor productivity--can serve as another indicator of relative profitability. HOV.TYPZ?Z) no reliable manufacturing unit labor cost indices, nor other broad measures of economy-wide labor costs, are currently available in Egypt. It is possible nevertheless, to use the Government's wage bill per worker in Egypt as a proxy for this purpose. Government wage increases in Egypt are closely related to those awarded in the public sector companies, which dominate the industrial sector and set the pace for wage increases in the formal private sector. Assuming a 2 percent annual productivity gain in Em= s the unit labor cost between 1991/92 and 1994/95 rose by 40.5 percent in Egypt as against a decrease of 2.4 percent in industrial partner countries, based on WE0 data for June 1995. Thus, the real effective exchange rate based on relative wage movements increased by 56.4 percent in the period 1991/92 to 1994/95 (Table 9), with about 44 percentage points accounted for by the movement in relative unit labor costs between Egypt and its trading partners. c. The relative price of tradables and nontradables Based on an approximate division of goods in the CPI between tradables and nontradables, the increase in the price of nontradable goods in relation to tradable goods prices in Egypt is another indicator of eroding competitiveness. By this measure, the loss of competitiveness had reached 22.2 percent by April 1995 relative to February/March 1991, reflecting inflation rates of nontraded and traded goods of 83.7 percent and 50.3 percent, respectively (Table 9). 3. Possible adiustments to the price indicators The REER based on relative prices may need to be adjusted to take account of the impact of a number of factors that may have biased the results. The factors considered below, however, do not affect the other indices. The authorities have implemented several tax measures to improve the competitiveness of the export sector and compensate for the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (Table 10). However, in principle, these meas.ures would not affect the costs and competitiveness of the domestic export sector because even prior to the institution of the new tax regime, the tax burden on exports stemming from taxes on domestic and imported inputs was negligible. This was due to the zero rating of exports under which the consumption tax (which was subsequently replaced by the GST) and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIX V tariffs on inputs used in export production were rebated. Furthermore, while such steps may help the export sector, these measures do not fully address the problem of overvaluation since the competitiveness of the service and import-competing industries are not affected by them. On the assumption, however, that the previous system of zero rating of exports had been ineffective, the measures taken in January 1994 could represent a reduced tax burden on, and hence an improvement in the competitiveness of, exports. Two important measures were reportedly put in place since January 1994. The first set of measures includes rebates for exporters related to the customs duties and sales tax (GST) on intermediate inputs. u The authorities have estimated that the combined effect of these tax rebates would reduce average export costs by 6-9 percent. Assuming an effective customs duty rate--customs receipts as a proportion of imports--of 16.9 percent that was observed in 1993/94, an average imported input content for non-oil exports of 10 percent and a 30 percent content of domestic taxable inputs u, the average export cost would be reduced by at most 4.9 percent (Table 11) as a result of the steps already introduced. However, this estimate is based on a full impact of the customs duties and GST rebates on export costs and represents an overestimation of the effect of the reforms for et least two additional reasons. First, the customs duties rebate does not benefit all companies, but only those which are fully integrated. Second, the rebates do not improve export costs in the "export processing zones", where customs duties and taxes are not applicable. Based on current information, it is not possible, however, to quantify the precise amount of such an overestimation. Therefore, it has been assumed (Table 11) that the overestimation could reach half of the tax rebate effect, namely, 2.4 percentage points. The conclusions, however, would not be materially affected even if the full 4.9 percent was taken into account. The second set of administrative measures to promote exports deals mainly with the elimination of procedures required for exporters (and their associated fees and stamp duties), as well as with reductions in transport and port service fees. The authorities are of the view that these measures can eventually reduce export costs by et least 7 percent. While there is not enough evidence to confirm this figure, only the elimination of the u The sectoral impact of these measures depends on the specific production processes assumed. Exporters using import-intensive technologies will benefit most from the customs duties rebate, while those with a large component of domestic taxable inputs will be favored by the sales tax rebate. 2-/ The other 60 percent of the cost would comprise labor costs, interest payments other than for bank guarantees for customs duty due, domestic inputs exempt from the GST and profits. The average value of imported intermediate goods to GDP amounted to about 10 percent in 1993/94. The effective customs rate of 16.9 percent would overstate greatly the effective rate on intermediate goods, which face much lower duties than final goods. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V requirement to provide a letter of credit to the Customs Department (with an estimated savings of 0.1 percent) has been put in place. Therefore, the effect of the other measures cannot yet be taken into account in estimating the underlying appreciation since early 1991. The above adjustments to the REER or price indicators are biased by being only one-sided. In principle, similar adjustments need to be made to the corresponding price indicators to take account of similar reforms that may have improved producers' competitiveness in partner countries. These could limit the adjustment to the competitiveness indicators, stemming from measures taken by Egypt. 4. Effects on the eauilibrium exchange rate Although the Egyptian pound has appreciated in real effective terms since February/March 1991, this development could reflect exogenous factors that have affected the balance of payments and therefore the equilibrium exchange rate. If the net effect of these factors has been favorable for the balance of payments, the appreciation could be viewed as an equilibrium phenomenon. Two factors--debt forgiveness and the rapid increase in workers' remittances--have positively affected the balance of payments since 1990/91, suggesting an appreciation in the equilibrium exchange rate. 1/ However, a number of international developments suggest that the equilibrium real exchange rate is likely to have deureciated. First, the terms of trade deteriorated by about 22 percent between early 1991 and end-December 1994, reflecting largely a decline in oil prices. Second, current trade liberalization and prospective initiatives, including in the context of a free trade agreement with the European Union, would argue for a downward shift in the real equilibrium exchange rate. Third, there has also been a collapse of Egypt's traditional export markets in the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Finally, a competitive real exchange rate is needed to underpin the strategy of promoting export-oriented growth. The medium-term scenarios also illustrate the consequences of maintaining the current policies--which would lead to a fuzther appreciation of the Egyptian pound--on the sustainabilitv of the current account. The current policy would lead to stagnating exports (at about USS3.3 billion- USS3.4 billion) and rising imports (averaging about USS12.8 billion) over 1995/96-1998/99. This would contribute to a current account deficit (excluding official transfers) estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP in 1998/99. 1/ The capital inflows in the recent past have been of a short-term and reversible nature and, hence, do not affect the equilibrium exchange rate. The authorities have stated that exports have been affected by the reduction in the most-favored-nation tariffs by OECD countries of about 40 percent. HOWeVer, this cannot explain past export performance as these tariff cuts went into affect only on January 1, 1995, and will be gradually phased in over a five to six year period. - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V This deficit would have to be financed by large capital inflows (about USS3.8 billion cumulatively between 1995/96 and 1998/99), necessitating high interest rates, which would be seriously detrimental to investment and GDP growth. On the other hand, an adjustment of the exchange rate to reverse the recent loss in competitiveness, supported by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, would keep the current account in surplus at an average of about 0.1 percent of GDP between 1995/96 and 1998/99, eliminating the dependence on capital inflows while facilitating the achievement of higher investment and GDP growth. 5. Conclusions This note has examined a number of indicators of competitiveness. The following are the main conclusions. . First, the period February-March 1991 provides a reasonably appropriate base for calculating the appreciation of the currency, insofar as it was the only period where the exchange rate most closely approximated a market-determined one following the reform of the exchange system. The implementation of the GST, after the base period of February-March 1991, had a relatively small impact on the consumer price level of less than 2 percent, and does not in itself invalidate the choice of the base period. . Second, the over-valuation of the Egyptian pound, as reflected in the Fund's INS REER index based on the relative price movements in Egypt vis-B-vis its trading partners, amounted to 28.6 percent between February- March 1991 and May 1995. If, instead, the average for the period February- October 1991 is chosen as the base, the overvaluation amounts to 17.9 percent through May 1995. . Third, the ova-valuation, based on the available indicators of relative unit labor costs, amounted to 56.4 percent between 1991/92 and 1994/95. . Fourth, the movement in relative prices of traded to nontraded goods suggests an ova-valuation of 22.2 percent between February-March 1991 and April 1995. . Fifth, the sharp drop in the terms of trade of 22 percent between 1991/92 and end-December 1994 and other developments would indicate the need for a downward adjustment in the exchange rate, other things being equal. . Finally, the REER, based on relative consumer prices between Egypt and its main trading partners should not, in principle, be adjusted to take into account the rebates for the GST and customs duties put in place in January 1994 because they replaced a system that had similar features aimed at eliminating the tax burden on exports. Even if account is taken of the new measures, the overvaluation would still amount to 25-27 percent by end-May 1995. Such an adjustment, however, is not relevant for the other indicators. Furthermore, these measures affect the export but not import-competing industries. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX V Table 9.

I/ The customs duties rebate does not, de facto, benefit all companies but only those which are fully integrated. Therefore, the total elimination of the customs duties from the cost structure overestimates the effect of the price measures. Moreover, a second overestimation might result from the fact that the average customs duties rate on inputs are likely to be lower than the overall average figure of 14.7 percent because statutory tariffs are lower for inputs than final goods. u The authorities estimate that these costs would be eliminated almost in full; however, only the "financial guarantee" measures seem to be in place, the rest is, therefore, still integrated in the cost structure.

VIII. Article IV Consultation Consultations vith Egypt are on a 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions (and discussions on en adjustment program) were held in Cairo during April 3-13, 1993, May 14-27, 1993, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - APPENDIX VI July 16-23, 1993, and at headquarters during April 26-May 7, 1993 and June 23-July 7. 1993. The staff report (EBS/93/139) was discussed by the Executive Board on September 20. 1993. At that time. the Executive Board took the following decision: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the exchange measures of Egypt subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 1993 Article XIV consultation vith Egypt, in the light of the 1993 Article IV consultation with Egypt conducted under Decision No. 5392- W/63). adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in EBS/93/139, Supplement 1, Egypt retains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions evidenced by external payments arrears, a bilateral payments arrangement, and a multiple currency practice arising from a special exchange rate for liquidation accounts under terminated bilateral payments arrangements. These measures are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3. The Fund welcomes the intention of Egypt to eliminate the external payments arrears by December 31. 1993, and encourages Egypt to eliminate the remaining exchange restrictions as soon as possible. In the meantime, the Fund grants approval for the retention of the restriction evidenced by external payments arrears to non-Paris Club creditors until December 31, 1993. Egypt maintains a bilateral payments agreement with Sudan involving an unduly long settlement period and the use of a special exchange rate. Egnt also maintains a special exchange rate to liquidate accounts related to past bilateral payments agreements. IX.

Eevpt - Relations with the World Bank As of June 30, 1995, the World Bank Group had approved 62 loans and 39 credits to Egypt. Total commitments amounted to lJSS4.3 billion, net of cancellations (see attached table), of which IJSS3.4 billion had been disbursed. Of commitments (net of cancellations) for 14 ongoing operations, about one third went to agriculture end environment, and about a quarter each to the energy sector, and human resources and poverty alleviation, respectively. In FY 1995, the World Bank Group approved one project for irrigation improvement for $80 million, of which 35 percent on IBRD terms and 65 percent on IDA terms. The World Bank's recent economic and sector work has concentrated on private sector development, human resources development, energy, and structural issues in a number of sectors. A World Bank Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) for $300 million approved in FY 1991 supported the Government's reform and adjustment program and complemented the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement. The first tranche of $150 million was fully disbursed, and Egypt met all conditions for release of the second tranche for the balance of the loan. In view of the improved resource position, the Government of Egypt requested that the $150 million balance be canceled. As a follow-up to SAL I, the Government of Egypt and the World Bank agreed in FY 1994 on a Structural Adjustment Monitoring Program (SAMP), which complemented the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF). It focused on trade and financial sector liberalization and privatization, with a view to eliciting a quick and sustainable supply-side response. The World Bank's last formal review of progress, relative to SAMP targets for December 31, 1993, indicated that in the areas of purview of the World Bank, performance was largely satisfactory. The World Bank has not yet reviewed progress with respect to targets for June 30, 1994 end beyond; under the agreement with Government of Egypt, a formal review was scheduled for February 1995, but this has been delayed at Government of Egypt's request; and the SAMP is now inoperative. In January 1994, the World Bank convened a Consultative Group for Egypt to mobilize donor support for the Government's program. In March 1994, the World Bank presented a Country Assistance Strategy to its Board of Executive Directors. This strategy focused on: (i) maintenance of macroeconomic stability and deepening of structural reforms (including public enterprise reforms, private sector development, and privatization); (ii) development of human resources, poverty alleviation, and improvement of social safety net; and (iii) improvements in natural resource management and environment. This strategy was to be implemented through an assistance program that would comprise lending, economic and sector work, technical assistance, and aid coordination. The World Bank and the Government of Egypt are currently reviewing this strategy. As regards lending, Egypt continues to be eligible for both IDA and IBRD support. However, lending on IBRD terms is currently expected to be limited for the next few years, primarily because of the availability of more concessional Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX VII funding from official sources. Over the next few years the World Bank's lending program would focus primarily on the second end third elements of the above-mentioned strategy. IFC investments end lending, D&$ of cancellations, termination, repayments, exchange adjustments, write-offs and sales totalled $134 million es of June 30, 1995, of which $58 million wes undisbursed. About two-thirds of IFC's activities have been lending operations. There were no IFC investments during FY 1995. So far there have been no MICA guarantees for Egnt.
