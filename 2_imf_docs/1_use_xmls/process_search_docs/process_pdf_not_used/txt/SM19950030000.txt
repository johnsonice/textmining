Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation were held in Sofia during March 13-24, 1995 and September 11-22, 1995, and in Washington during April 24-28, 1995 and October 7-12, 1995. The staff team u met with the Prime Minister; the Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister; the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Development; the Finance Minister; the Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB); the Minister of Labor and Social Welfare; representatives of the National Statistical Institute and the Agency for Economic Cooperation and Development; senior officials from these as well as other ministries; selected parliamentarians; and major trade unions. Discussions also took place during this period regarding policies that could be supported by use of Fund resources. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on September 15, 1993 (EBM/93/132), although Directors discussed on September 12, 1994 developments and prospects in the context of approving an augmentation to the stand-by arrangement. As reported to the Executive Board previously (EBD/94/102;EBD/95/120; and EBD/95/147), the Article IV consultation was initially postponed due to the resignation of the Berov government in September 1994 and subsequently, owing to discussions on use of Fund resources with the newly elected government that was formed in January 1995. On the occasion of the last consultation discussion, Executive Directors considered that adjustment and structural reform efforts had flagged, contributing to worsened economic prospects. They stressed the need for quick action to tighten stabilization policies and regain the momentum of early structural reforms. In this context, a reversal of the very sharp real appreciation of the exchange rate- -supported by a tight wage policy-- was called for. A sizable fiscal adjustment was also needed in order to reach a sustainable position over time. Structural reforms--particularly enterprise and bank privatization and enhanced financial discipline--were seen as necessary complements to stabilization policies. Debt reduction with foreign banks was viewed as essential to restore external viability over the medium term. On April 11, 1994, the Executive Board approved requests for a 12-month stand-by arrangement in an amount of SDR 69.7 million (15 percent of quota) and for a first STF purchase of SDR 116.2 million (25 percent of quota). This arrangement was augmented on September 12, 1994 by a further SDR 69.7 million (15 percent of quota) in support of a debt and debt service reduction (DDSR) operation; at that time, the Board also approved a waiver and modification of performance criteria. No further purchases under the stand-by arrangement were made and Bulgaria's eligibility for the second STF purchase expired on October 12, 1995. Fund and Bank relations are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively. 1/ The missions included Messrs. Kincaid, Hewitt, Beaumont, Putscher (all EUl) , Schiller (FAD), Houben (PDR) and Ms. Rodic and Ms. Ricasa (both EUl) as staff assistants. The staff teams were assisted by Mr. Dahl and Mr. Rozwadowski (who were in turn the IMF Resident Representative).

Core surveillance data are provided on a high frequency basis and in a timely manner, except for data on trade flows and national income accounts. II. Background Bulgaria has lagged behind other transition economies in implementing structural reforms. l/ As a result of this slow pace, macroeconomic stabilization was undermined during 1992-93, with disastrous consequences for inflation in 1994; fiscal indebtedness is extremely high; and the banking system is insolvent. In part, this situation derives from difficult initial conditions--such as a high dependence on CMEA trade and an external debt overhang--and from adverse external shocks, most notably the loss of transit routes to western Europe associated with the UN sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) (Serbia/ Montenegro). But it also reflects political conditions in Bulgaria; five governments in as many years have found it difficult to implement far-reaching structural reforms and sustain needed adjustment policies. In the absence of a strong politica:L consensus for structural reform, the financial health of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) deteriorated sharply. Profits were squeezed primarily by overly generous nominal wage hikes and by weak enterprise governance that permitted profit and asset stripping. 2/ This financial deterioration of SOEs spilled onto the budget and the banking system. For example, budgetary revenues collapsed, falling by nearly 18 percentage points of GDP from 52.9 percent of GDP in 1990 to 35.2 percent of GDP in 1993. 3J Fiscal deficits averaged 15 percent of GDP during 1991-93. In addition, SOEs increasingly failed to service their domestic bank loans, resulting in mounting bank losses and decapitalization. &/ IJ Compared with other transition economies in the region, Bulgaria ranked near the bottom of various EBRD indicators of transition--see Annual Economic Review, The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 1994. The private sector was estimated at 28 percent of GDP in 1994 up from 21 percent -in 1992; private sector activity was concentrated in the agricultural and trade sectors, while industrial output was almost totally produced by state-owned firms. 2/ This process of asset and profit stripping of SOEs has been described in "The Ecebirth of Capitalism in Bulgaria", Agency for Economic Coordination and Development, October 1994. J,/ Owing to problems in estimating GDP, which have resulted in substantial revisions, ratios to GDP can chang,e markedly over time, hampering analysis based on such ratios. &/ Tax and interest arrears, including to foreign c,reditors, were the main sources of forced financing by SOEs; inter-enterprise arrears did not reach the magnitude observed in many other transition economies.

Even with this assistance, the banks remained unprofitable and largely insolvent, while the fiscal debt burden escalated. Reflecting worsening domestic imbalances and eroding external competitiveness, the current account deficit widened to nearly 13 percent of GDP in 1993 (Table 1 and Chart 1). The authorities sought to reverse this unsustainable situation in 1994, but their policy changes came too late to avoid a foreign exchange crisis (see Appendix IV for details on targets and outcomes under the Fund-supported program). With the commitment of international reserves to fund the DDSR'S closing costs, when delays were encountered in mobilizing international assistance in support of the authorities' program, a confidence crisis ensued; the lev jumped to 65 per U.S. dollar at end-March 1994 compared to lev 33 at end-1993, and demand for real lev balances plummeted (Chart 2). lJ This crisis prompted a tightening of financial policies beyond that originally envisaged. The fiscal deficit narrowed by 9 percentage points of GDP (or almost double the programmed adjustment) to about 6 l/2 percent, owing entirely to a strengthening of the primary balance (excluding BNB transfers), which moved into surplus--the first since 1990. Real wages fell by 28 percent in 1994, enhancing SOEs' profitability and restoring external competitiveness (based on U.S. dollar wages and relative ULCs 2/) to its level in late 1991. Monetary policy was less successful, encountering two main obstacles. One, the depreciation and accompanying substantial shift into foreign currency deposits undermined control over broad money aggregates (Chart 3); broad money expansion accelerated sharply-- owing to currency substitution and revaluation of foreign currency deposits-- even though lev money growth slowed slightly. Two, the substantial liquidity needs--nearly 6 percent of GDP--of several large ailing banks were accommodated by the BNB so that reserve money expansion was excessive. After making considerable headway during the first half of 1994, the structural reform program stalled again once the Berov Government stepped down in early September 1994. Key measures to enhance financial discipline --limits on bank credits to selected large loss-making SOEs, liquidations of selected non-viable SOEs, and strengthened bank supervision and bank rehabilitation--were not implemented. Despite the DDSR operation, Bulgaria remains saddled with a heavy fiscal debt burden--a debt/GDP ratio of I/ Regression analysis indicates that real lev balances in 1994 experienced a statistically significant downward shift in their trend compared with a virtually constant level previously. 2/ For reasons noted in Appendix III, data on industrial output are unreliable and therefore ULC calculations are also suspect.

With the shrinking of domestic imbalances and a turnaround in external competitiveness, exports rose and imports fell; trade flows continued their redirection toward western markets, which accounted for k0 percent of total trade in 1994. The current account improved by 13 percent of GDP in 1994 and was roughly balanced (Table 2). Gross official reserves increased to USS1.3 billion even though external financing was less than expected .(Table 3). The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and decline in real wage incomes produced a nearly 7 percent decline in real domestic demand in 1994. However, a strong positive trade contribution generated a real GDP increase of 1.4 percent--the first expansion during the transition period. Thus, a strong adjustment effort was combined with a recovery in real growth. The registered unemployment rate declined by 3 l/2 percentage points to 12 3/4 percent, owing mainly to the expiration of benefit periods (Chart 4). The positive real trends observed in 1994 continued in 1995 and were joined by falling inflation. During the first half of 1995, real GDP growth is estimated at nearly 2 l/2 percent. (A break-down by expenditure and sector is not available.) During the first half of 1995 compared with the same period a year earlier, export earnings expanded by 14 l/2 percent (in US dollars), while import payments were 2 percent lower; thus a trade surplus of nearly US$300 million was recorded during the first half of 1995, or about twice the trade surplus achieved in all of 1994. Gross official reserves rose by nearly US$1/2 billion to USS1.8 billion at end-October 1995; their highest level during the transition (Chart 5). Virtually, all of this increase occurred during the second quarter of 1995. J/ i,/ At end-1994, Bulgaria's external debt totaled US$ll billion (109 percent of GDP), of which 50 percent was in the form of bonds; 14 percent was due to former CMEA creditors; 12 percent was owed to Paris Club creditors; and 12 percent was outstanding to multilateral creditors. ZZ/ Although roughly three quarters of debt was denominated in foreign currency at end-1994, about 80 percent of interest payments in 1994 were on domestic debt, owing to high nominal interest rates occasioned by high inflation. Thus, sharply lower inflation and nominal interest rates would reduce dramatically the fiscal deficit assuming an unchanged primary surplus. Indeed, the operational deficit-- a deficit measure that excludes inflation induced distortion--was estimated at only l/2 percent of GDP in 1994. 3J About three quarters of the second quarter increase in BNB foreign reserves was the direct consequence of DMBs selling their foreign exchange assets to the BNB. This took place during a period when the uncovered interest differential-was decidedly in favor of domestic assets, although progressively less so as domestic interest rates were cut.

A stable lev against the U.S. dollar during this period was the major reason for the improved inflation performance. The BNB began to aggressively cut its basic interest rate from 6 percent per month in March 1995 to 2.8 percent in August. This action was in response to favorable inflation developments and was designed to facilitate a lev depreciation. Even with these cuts, interest rates remained above inflation and the uncovered interest rate differential was still high (see Chart 3). III, Policv Discussions Following parliamentary elections in December 1994, a new Government led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) was formed in late January 1995. Although the BSP'has a parliamentary majority, internal party divisions on economic policies, particularly structural reforms, have slowed policy formulation and implementation and raised doubts about the true course of policies. In its dialogue with the new Government, including on a possible Fund-supported program for 1995-96, the staff proposed policies to sustain and deepen the progress realized in 1994, particularly accelerating structural reforms. The staff also suggested that a preannounced exchange rate crawl--in line with projected wage increases--might be the most effective nominal anchor, while safeguarding external competitiveness. &/ The BNB preferred to continue with a flexible exchange rate policy and unannounced monetary targets. u Progress toward a new Fund arrangement stumbled not over the choice of a nominal anchor, but rather over differences of view on the appropriate stance of macroeconomic policies and the priority to be given to structural reforms. In particular, the staff viewed the budget deficit passed by Parliament in May 1995 (5 l/2 percent of GDP) as too high relative to the then projected lev money demand given the inflation target and relative to an adjustment path that would quickly establish a sustainable fiscal position; this deficit target also seemed likely to be exceeded. Moreover, the incomes policy was geared to an insufficiently ambitious inflation path which, coupled with an expected strong currency, risked too rapid an erosion in external competitiveness. Finally, the absence of key structural measures threatened the sustainability of macroeconomic stabilization. 1/ The staff's position was based on the rapid pass-through of exchange rate movements to inflation (see Chart 2), given Bulgaria's very open economy; on the high endogneity of broad money owing to lev revaluations of foreign currency deposits; and on the instability of real lev money demand observed in 1994 (see again Chart 2). 2/ The authorities' view was that while the demand for real lev money had experienced a behavioral break in 1994, the trend decline in real broad money still appeared to be stable (see Chart 2), and thus provided a basis for a money-based stabilization approach.

During the'discussions in September, the staff commended the authori'ties on the dramatfc improvement in inflation performance observed so far in 1995, noting that inflation was projected to drop to somewhat below 35 @ercent by end-.1995--the lowest rate in five jrears. It was also noted however that this performance had been associated with significant real currency appreciation. .' The staff and the.authorities agreed that the stability in the nominal exchange rate over the past.12 months was the major reason for sharply lower inflation. The staff asked the BNB.whether it had in fact st'abilized the nominal exchange rate over the past year as part of its anti-inflation effort. The.BNB authorities explained that a stable currency had not been a policy objective per se, buts rather ‘that, in the face of large inflows, the BNB.had purchased foreign exchange' to prevent nominal currency appreciation that would be damaging to the traded-goods sector. These purchases had been largely sterilized .in an effort to keep to their monetary targets, which had in any case been exceeded. The cuts in official interest rates during the .second quarter tiere'undertaken to reduce interest-sensitive foreign exchange flows ,and moderate"upward pressuresen the exchange rate. The staff noted that, 'other than foreign exchange sales by,DMBs, interest-sensitive inflows appeared'manageable .and that adoption and implementation of foreign exchange cover regulations would have prevented such sales, easing the task of reserve money management. I/ .' . . In reviewing monetary.,conditions for the first nine months of 1995, the ,'staff and' the authorities agreed that :a recovery in real lev demand had been underway but that considerable uncertainty existed about its magnitude and likely duration, which complicated monetary targeting (Table 4). Thus, -the rapid growth-in reallev and broad monies relative to trends could be viewed either somewhat benignly or as 'a nascent monetary overhang. 2/, Both,the 1/ The absence of foreign exchange cover regulations permits banks to take large .unhedged--generally long--foreign exchange positions and to change them rapidly,. Requiring bank's.to. engage in more prudent foreign exchange risk management would limit their scope to sell foreign exchange,. thereby increasing their iong position. 2/ Analysis of factors* contributing to broad money expansicn has been hampered by data problems. In particular,' a new chart of accounts that was introduced in June 1995 has produced a major break in the time series, (An MAE technical assistance mission visited Sofia in November 1995 to help rectify problems encountered with the new chart of accounts.) In addition, the .improvement in DMBs' net foreign assets has largely stemmed from the removal of debts to the .I,ondun Club-, CMEA, and other creditors from DMBs' balance sheets. and not from balance of payments flows. The amounts and timing of these stock changes are"not known precisely. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - staff and the BNB leaned toward the latter interpretation partly as it presented less downside risk, but also because of the seasonally weak increase in net foreign assets during July-October, the resurgence in foreign currency deposits, and the magnitude of the deviation in real broad money balances from past trend. The staff recommended that growth in monetary aggregates be reined in immediately. The BNB did not disagree but observed that its room for maneuver was narrow, owing to the substantial liquidity needs of ailing banks and of the Government. The authorities and the staff were both worried that the lev may have been too stable for too long (Chart 6). Based on June data, wages in U.S. dollar terms had risen by 33 percent from a year earlier--nearly returning to their 1993 peak, while the index of relative ULCs had increased by half as much (16 percent), remaining well below its peak, although this indicator is subject to serious measurement problems. Even though the levels for these indices did not give a consistent signal, their pace of increase was clearly a source of concern. Bulgaria's export growth during 1994-95 has been only about half as rapid as the export growth recorded in other transition economies in Central Europe. Moreover, the lagged effect of the recent real appreciation would likely only exacerbate this relatively.weaker export performance in the future. The staff recommended therefore a modest nominal currency depreciation in line with targeted wage increases, allowing time for more data to become available on which to assess the appropriate level and path for the exchange rate; this time could also be used to reevaluate the advisable exchange rate/monetary arrangements. The BNB was reluctant to consider depreciation during the winter months--in which the external accounts are seasonally weak- -fearing that this might ;Lgnite a portfolio shift that would be difficult to manage. The staff noted that the situation in the spring could then be more difficult if, as expected, competitiveness as well as the BNB's foreign reserve position were eroded further. b. Incomes nolicv The authorities considered incomes policy an important supplementary anchor in their efforts to achieve lower inflation, to secure export-led growth, and to strengthen the financial condition of SOEs. Under the wage guidelines adopted by the Tripartite Committee, nominal wage increases by SOEs were 85 percent of projected quarterly inflation with an equivalent catch-up provision for the difference between actual and projected inflation during the previous quarter. This formulation was not viewed as problematic. The crucial problem from the staff's perspective was a projected inflation rate that was too high (48 percent). The authorities agreed to revise downward the path for projected inflation if actual inflation tracked below the authorities' initially projected path. In September, available data for the first half year indicated that nominal wages had exceeded the revised wage target (Table 5). The authorities stated that this overshooting would be corrected during the second half and the revised end-year target would be observed. The staff remarked that this could prove difficult given the wage momentum and that only one quarter Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - remained in the year. Nonetheless the staff underscored the importance of slowing wage increases as much as was feasible. Turning to 1996, the authorities indicated that they intended to continue with a forward-looking incomes policy. The adjustment coefficient was still under discussion but pressures were to increase it to 100 percent of projected inflation. The staff cautioned against moving to full forward CPI indexation and full catch-up for any deviation between actual and projected inflation. This would increase inflationary inertia and would lead to an inappropriate response to real shocks. In particular with full indexation, the large increases planned in administered prices and in some indirect taxes would then be quickly passed through in the form of higher nominal wages, which could lead to further pressures for price increases. The authorities acknowledged these points but stated that social and political considerations might prevail. Wage adjustments based on core inflation (e.g., 'excluding the impact of administered price increases) were also thought by the authorities to be unacceptable to the unions. C. Fiscal policv Based on preliminary data through September, the overall fiscal deficit for 1995 is projected to be 1 l/4 percent of GDP higher than budgeted or 6 3/4 percent of GDP--virtually unchanged from 1994 (Table 6). Higher-than- budgeted interest payments on domestic debt and lower-than-expected BNB transfers would more than account for this deficit overrun. The former is explained by overly optimistic budget projections for the decline in domestic interest rates', while the latter stems from the unbudgeted costs incurred by the BNB to assist in the rehabilitation of two large ailing banks. Overall revenue collections (excluding BNB transfers) as a percentage of GDP are envisaged to perform as budgeted, I-J improving by close to 2 percentage points of GDP, while on present trends non-interest spending would be compressed by about 1 percent of GDP from its 1994 level and would be 3 3/4 percent of GDP below budget allocations. Thus the primary surplus (excluding BNB transfers) is projected to rise by 2 3/4 percent of GDP to 6 l/2 percent of GDP or equivalent to about half of the interest bill. 2/ The Finance Minister cautioned that continued political support for expenditure control was crucial to realize these projections. Toward this I/ However the structure of revenues is expected to be quite different. Revenues related to VAT and custom duties are envisaged to be less than budgeted, while collections from income taxes and non-tax revenues are projected to perform better than budgeted. L?/ The primary balance, excluding BNB transfers which are largely inflation tax collections, is one measure of fiscal effort in cases of high inflation and high nominal interest rates. Another measure is the operational deficit. Using this concept, the fiscal position is projected to improve by 1 3/4 percentage points of GDP in 1995.

While supporting the Minister's efforts, the staff added that even keeping within the established ceiling would imply recourse to bank credit of 6 3/4 percent of GDP, or 1 l/2 percent of GDP higher than in 1994; the authorities were fortunate that a revival in lev money demand had coincided with this larger use of bank credit. Such good fortune should not be counted on in the future. Looking to 1996, the authorities had not yet prepared a fully articulated macroeconomic framework on which to base budget projections; an inflation target of 20-25 percent was tentatively under consideration and real GDP growth was preliminarily projected at 3 percent. The staff considered further fiscal consolidation to be essential to support monetary tightening because the exchange rate should not be employed to slow inflation as in 1995. With lower nominal interest rates already largely in place, interest dosts could decline by 2 3/4 percent of GDP in 1996. In addition, a somewhat higher primary surplus was recommended in order to cover about three quarters of projected interest costs, thus moving closer to fiscal sustainability. To achieve this primary surplus, the tax base should be broadened to capture the new emerging private sector, including reform of personal and corporate income tax laws, a move to market valuation for property taxes, and increases to EU levels for fuel excises and the VAT; FAD technical assistance in tax administration is planned for early 1996. Given past expenditure restraint, the staff recommended that the authorities focus on expenditure rationalization, rather than spending cuts. In this context, and as has been discussed with Bank staff, the extensive social benefit system should be revamped (e.g. higher retirement age, increased penalty for early retirement) and become better targeted at the most vulnerable groups. These efforts would improve the quality and durability of fiscal adjustment. While not disagreeing with these points, the authorities were not yet prepared to discuss a fiscal target for 1996. Subsequently, they put forward preliminary estimates for new expenditures related to structural reforms (see Section 2.a, below) of 4-5 percent of GDP. The staff agreed to work with the authorities and Bank staff to refine these cost estimates and to develop a macroeconomic framework for 1996, incorporating justifiable structural costs and assessing possible implications of offsetting improvements in the quasi-fiscal position. d. Medium-term outlook The staff discussed the policy challenges and constraints posed by the medium-term outlook (for details see Appendix V). Although the projections for the balance of payments- -most notably the current account position and international reserves--have improved compared to the projections provided in EBS/94/160 (8/26/94), the lessons drawn were cautionary. In particular, the external position has fluctuated substantially, responding rapidly to changing macroeconomic. policies. Given the large external debt, it was recognized that external viability would require a substantial non-interest Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - current account surplus over the foreseeable future. This external surplus would need to be underpinned by a sizable, although declining, fiscal primary surplus and by further improvement in the SOEs' financial condition. Achievement of a sustainable fiscal position is a goal of the Finance Minister. This will require a substantial reduction in the debt/GDP ratio from its current level--estimated at 112 percent at end-1995 (down from 157 percent at end-1994 owing mainly to a real currency appreciation). At current market prices for external debt and accounting for collateral, the debt/GDP ratio would be 35 percentage points lower at end-1995. Thus, in the view of the Finance Minister, debt swaps and purchases of debt in the secondary market at a discount can make significant contributions to easing the debt burden and to reducing Bulgaria's vulnerability to higher foreign interest rates or real depreciation. The Finance Minister also believes that curtailment of debt creation from fiscal deficits and quasi-fiscal losses of SOEs and state-owned banks would be a crucial element of this effort particularly in the near term; indeed debts incurred by quasi-fiscal losses and subsequently transferred to the Government have been a more important source of public debt creation than fiscal deficits themselves. This underscored the importance of long delayed structural reforms. The Fund is by far Bulgaria's largest single creditor, accounting for 8 l/4 percent of estimated total external debt at end-1995. Current and forthcoming payments to the Fund are significant; payments average about 40 percent of quota during 1995-96 before quickly tapering off. Although payments to the Fund amount to less than 5 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services from 1996 onwards, the high share of multilateral institutions in debt service payments--over 25 percent in 1996--makes the debt structure rigid. Developments will need to be kept under close review. 2. Structural Policies a. Transition reforms The new Government has expressed its commitment to continuing Bulgaria's transformation toward a market-oriented economy based on private ownership. Nonetheless, a comprehensive structural strategy has been slow to take shape. Although privatization plans were quickly formulated, implementation has been delayed. Until the fall, the authorities seemingly attached low priority to hardening budget constraints on SOEs and strengthening the banking system. The staff warned that a go-slow approach in these critical areas risked undermining--as it had in the past--prospects for growth and financial stabilization, recalling that SOEs' financial indiscipline had been the primary cause for the high government indebtedness and fo-r the insolvency of the banking system. Moreover, monetary policy during the past two years had been held hostage to the liquidity problems of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - state-owned and new private banks. lJ The staff cautioned that macroeconomic stabilization could be threatened by a looming financial crisis in the banking system as has happened recently in other transition economies and urged the immediate implementation of remedial measures. Actions during 1995 have also sent mixed signals. For example, amendments to the agricultural land restitution law that, inter alia, would restrict private land sales and reestablish cooperatives, and a new price control law have back-tracked on earlier reforms. On the other hand, long delayed increases in administered prices were finally implemented; actions were taken to reform two major ailing banks; and the number of enterprises transfered via cash privatization during the first nine months of 1995 nearly equaled the total for 1994 (see Table 1). Formulation of a more comprehensive structural strategy started only in October 1995. Privatization combines market/cash sales with a mass privatization approach. A list of more than 1,200 SOEs--or about one third of all SOEs-- has now been approved by the Government for inclusion in the first round of voucher privatization, which presuming confirmation by Parliament, is scheduled to begin in March 1996. Most of these enterprises would not be fully privatized via vouchers, leaving the remainder for cash privatization or possibly a second round of mass privatization--tentatively set for 1997. In addition, the authorities expected to privatize more than 200 medium and large SOEs through cash transactions during 1996. The staff was encouraged by these plans but expressed concern that effective control of most large firms would be retained in state hands. The staff also encouraged the authorities to accelerate market privatizations and use the proceeds to retire public debt. Turning to financial discipline of SOEs, the authorities have prepared a list for closings of non-viable SOEs and have proposed the financial isolation of selected large loss-making SOEs. The latter SOEs would be placed into receivership and all banks would be prohibited from lending to these SOEs. While welcoming these intentions, the staff proposed that the authorities avail themselves of technical assistance by Bank and Fund staffs to help flesh out the details (e.g., establishment of the legal framework, determination of the selection criteria, development of downsizing plans, and cost estimation). Finally, under the impetus of an MAE technical assistance mission in September 1995, the authorities have begun to draw up a bank reform strategy consisting of new legal structures (e.g., bank bankruptcy law, improved collateral enforcement, partial and conditional deposit insurance), supervisory changes (e.g., regulations on foreign exchange open positions, lJ‘ These problems stem mainly from nonperforming loans, which amounted to almost three quarters of loans to the nongovernment sector, and from a substantial foreign currency mismatch.

The staff was encouraged by the broad thrust of this strategy, but noted that many thorny issues remained to be tackled through ongoing technical assistance including from the World Bank. b. External oolicies Integration of Bulgaria's economy into the global trade and financial systems remains a goal of the authorities. Toward this end, discussions are continuing on accessions to the WTO and to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). The authorities would hope to conclude these talks in 1996. They also thought that the Uruguay Round would have only minor economic consequences for Bulgaria, given the high share of trade with EU, CEFTA, and countries of the former USSR. Bulgaria has a relatively open trade regime. An.import surcharge--set at 3 percent when introduced in 1993 and now reduced to 1 percent--will be phased out at end-1995. Removal of the only import quota (on ice cream) and a few export bans were being considered in the context of WTO accession and domestic supply conditions. Under the transitional arrangements of Article IV, Section 2, Bulgaria maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions that arise from: (i) the operation of an official payments arrangement with Bangladesh and the lack of settlement of balances outstanding under inoperative official payments arrangements with 23 Fund members; and (ii) a limitation of US$2,000 per person per year on certain current invisible payments, including tourism. lJ The Minister of Trade did not envisage extending the one operational payments arrangement when it expires at end-November 1995; outstanding balances under the inactive arrangements were in the process of elimination. Turning to the limit on certain current payments, the authorities acknowledged that this limit was largely not observed in practice, but they felt it complemented their outward capital controls. The staff recommended that, rather than a rigid limit, the authorities could grant all bona fide requests for current invisible transactions and thus retain some protection against unauthorized capital outflows. The staff urged the authorities to consider a timetable for moving to Article VIII status, but the authorities felt it was premature at this time. As regards external debt management, the authorities desired to complete regularization of creditor relations and to reduce further their external debt. In particular, Russian banks (with claims equivalent to almost US$750 million) did not participate in the DDSR operation. 2/ In I./ The staff is continuing its examination of Bulgaria's exchange system in light of possible future acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. 2/ A Polish bank (with claims equivalent to US$79 million) also did not participate in the DDSR operation. Settlement discussions have taken place.

In June 1995, agreement was reached with the International Investment Bank of Moscow (IIBM) to permit Bulgaria to settle its debts to the IIBM (about US$525 million) at a substantial discount. The authorities hoped to conclude a deal on similar terms with the International Bank for Economic Cooperation to settle Bulgaria's debts with that institution (US$165 million). In response to an enquiry, the authorities stated that domestic legal and technical problems currently prevented purchases of Bulgarian Brady bonds, but that these problems would be resolved in due course. In any case, gross reserves were not deemed sufficient to buy such illiquid instruments. Turning to official creditors, all bilaterals under the first and second Paris Club rescheduling have been ratified, except for the Netherlands owing to a disputed claim. Two bilaterals--Italy and Germany-- under the third Paris Club rescheduling have not been signed, owing respectively to disputes about institutional coverage and valuation of transferable ruble debts. Except in these disputed cases, the authorities indicated that they had made all payments under their reschedulings since the end of the third consolidation period in April 1995. The authorities stated that they would seek to avoid future Paris Club reschedulings partly in an effort to reduce Bulgaria's external debt. In this latter context, a debt-environment swap--equivalent to about US$17 million--was entered into with Switzerland in October 1995. IV. Staff Anpraisal In 1995, Bulgaria will have its best year since its transition to a market-oriented economy began five years ago: real growth will be the highest; inflation will be the lowest; and the current account and official reserves will be at their strongest levels. Bulgaria is to be commended for these outcomes, which are partly a legacy of the substantial adjustment measures undertaken in 1994. If these positive achievements are to be sustained, however, current stabilization efforts should be intensified and structural reforms should be deepened substantially and pursued more energetically. In particular, actions are urgently required to redress weaknesses in the banking system and enterprise sector, which have been a major source of macroeconomic instability and of Bulgaria's indebtedness problems. The doubling of inflation in 1994 followed by its dramatic fall in 1995 is vivid testimony to the impact of the exchange rate on prices. However, the recent stability of the exchange rate has not been adequately supported--so as to make possible sustained stability--by fiscal and incomes policies during 1995. The gains in external competitiveness achieved in 1994 have been largely eaten away during the course of 1995, casting a shadow over an otherwise favorable external outlook. A major policy challenge for the period ahead will be to assure a level of external Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 " competitiveness consistent with export-led growth, while at the same time achieving further reductions of inflation. Under these circumstances, financial and incomes policies must be expected to shoulder a greater share of the burden for reducing inflation in 1996 than in 1995. Significant fiscal consolidation should thus be resumed. Such consolidation is not only required for macroeconomic stabilization, but also to progress toward a sustainable medium-term fiscal position. This will be far from easy. A further increase in the primary surplus is necessary even as additional reform-oriented expenditures--related to downsizing and liquidations of SOEs, and to restructuring state-owned banks- -must also be made. Neither can be put off. Delay would only exacerbate indebtedness problems and needlessly prolong the transition to a well- functioning market economy. Monetary conditions should also be tightened to avoid a nascent monetary overhang from emerging; with shifting lev demand, developments in the exchange rate could serve as an important indicator of monetary conditions. Success in achieving lower inflation and preserving external competitiveness will also hinge crucially on the performance of incomes policy as a supplementary anchor. In view of developments in 1995, the authorities are urged to implement a forward-looking incomes policy that compensates only for projected core inflation (i.e, excludes the direct impact of real changes in administered prices and direct taxes), avoids complete catch-up for deviations between actual and projected inflation, and differentiates wage increases according to SOEs' financial health. Past failures to tackle structural weaknesses in the enterprise and banking sectors have laden the budget with a heavy debt burden and have undermined monetary control. This situation will get worse unless the Government acts aggressively to impose greater financial discipline, promote privatization, and create a sound banking system. Financial discipline of SOEs is crucial for the performance of the economy, the budget, and banks. Higher administered prices, particularly for electricity, will be an important step toward restoring financial health to key infrastructural enterprises. The authorities are urged to develop concrete measures--in conjunction with Bank staff--to harden the budget constraints on large loss-making SOEs, to liquidate non-viable enterprises, to operate remaining enterprises on a commercial basis, and to improve the financial condition and lending behavior of banks. Progress in these areas would also permit the long delayed Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL) to go forward. Privatization is vital to the economic transformation of Bulgaria but a lack of political consensus has delayed progress, robbing enterprises of the needed private capital for modernization and inhibiting job creation. The new majority Government has sought to end this impasse by placing nearly one third of SOEs, including medium- and large-scale enterprises, into the first wave of mass privatization. This goal is welcome, but should be supplemented by a similar effort to relinquish control over a significant Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - number of large enterprises to assure meaningful privatization. The Government should also press forward tiith,.and even accelerate, its cash privatization plans. The banking system is extremely fragile and threatens to undermine macroeconomic stability. The Government should develop and implement as quickly as possible the action plan that has been discussed with Fund and Bank staffs. Banks' problem loans to weak enterprises need to be resolved in the context of a comprehensive strategy involving both sectors; the Bank's FESAL operation can also be a highly useful vehicle for international assistance in these areas. Major strides have been made during 1994-95 toward regularizing creditor relations and enhancing 'Bulgaria's medium-term external viability. These are most welcome. The authorities are urged to complete and to ratify the remaining bilaterals under Bulgaria's Paris Club reschedulings and to make all payments on official debt. The authorities are encouraged to lighten Bulgaria's external debt burden (and thus also'move closer to fiscal sustainability) through debt reduction deals arranged with former CMEA creditors, debt swaps, and purchases of its Brady bonds at a discount. The authorities are urged to eliminate the restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions maintained by Bulgaria under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, as soon as circumstances permit, and to develop a timetable to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The authorities are encouraged to further strengthen theirystatistical database --particularly the national and external accounts--in terms of quality, periodicity, and timeliness. Ongoing technical assistance should help remedy these problems. In .other respects, surveillance data is provided by the authorities on a timely and high frequency basis.

Exchange Rate Arranpement In February 1991, a new unified exchange rate system was introduced based on an interbank foreign exchange market. The Bulgarian National Bank now quotes on a daily basis the market- determined exchange rates for the lev based on developments in the interbank foreign exchange market for the lev against the U.S. dollar and in accordance with the values of other foreign currencies in terms of U.S. dollars prevailing on international currency markets. On October 31, 1995, the interbank exchange rate of the lev was leva 68.641 per US$l. The value of the lev in terms of the transferable ruble was set at leva 3.5 per TRl for the limited amount of transactions with countries that were members of the former CMEA in settlement of claims and liabilities with reference to pre-1991 contracts. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation was concluded at EBM/93/132, g/15/93. Bulgaria is on a 12-month cycle.

Five economic reports have been completed since 1993: (i) an Economic Update, the principal background document for the Consultative Group Meeting, held in June 1994, which provided an overview of recent economic developments during 1993, and a medium-term macroeconomic framework; (ii) an Agricultural Strategy Paper for Bulgaria, which was prepared jointly with the EC-Phare program; (iii) an Energy Power Options Study, prepared by the Bank at the request of G-7, in collaboration with a number of other international organizations; (iv) a study of higher education; and (v) a report entitled "Bulgaria: Public Finance Reforms in the Transition", focusing on medium-term issues of resource mobilization, fiscal decentralization, public investment, and social insurance and health finance reform. The IMF and Bank staff continue to collaborate closely on supporting the Government's structural reforms. The Bank is also preparing a poverty assessment and a private sector assessment. Lending operations. Nine lending operations have been approved to date: a Technical Assistance loan for US$17 million (approved in June 1991); a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) for US$250 million (approved in August 1991); an Energy loan for US$93 million (approved in March 1993); a Telecommunications loan for US$30 million (approved in April 1993); a Private Investment and Export Finance loan for US$55 million (approved in June 1993); a Water Companies Restructuring loan for US$98 million (approved in May 1994); an Agricultural Development loan for $50 million (approved in June 1994); a DDSR for US$125 million (approved in September 1994); and a Railways Rehabilitation Project (approved in July 1995). The SAL and DDSR are fully disbursed. In addition, US$35 million have been disbursed from the other projects as of end-August 1995. The most urgent priorities in Bulgaria's development strategy are structural reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors. If the new Government is willing to move on implementing the necessary reforms, the Bank would be willing to support them by processing a proposed Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL). The FESAL would build upon the SAL program and would include measures to strengthen the financial system and to support and advance the liquidation, restructuring and privatization of state enterprises. The Bank would also support the efforts of the Government to enforce financial discipline on enterprises and discourage the growth of bad debts in the banking system. Since an effective social safety net is considered vital during the transition, adjustment lending is also being explored to support social sector reforms. The objectives of the Bank's future investment lending seek to ensure adequate maintenance of the country's physical infrastructure through Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - APPENDIXa further investments in the transport sector, in addition to increasing the country's power generation capability so that Bulgaria could comply with the provisions of the Nuclear Safety Agreement. In addition, Bank investment lending would help establish an effective social safety net by providing financing for the automation of the social insurance system and restructuring of the health sector; stimulate a supply response in agriculture through an irrigation restructuring credit operation; and help in protecting the environment. A Country Assistance Strategy is being drafted, which will soon be discussed with the Government.

Coverage and quality are not yet adequate in compiling statistics for the balance of payments, monetary accounts, and national income accounts--particularly in constant price terms. Sectorization is a problem for all major macroeconomic statistical systems including residency criteria and distinction between nonfinancial public enterprises and the private sector. Incomplete institutional coverage and sectorization have hampered efforts to establish consistency across the statistical systems. Statistical legislation with regard to collection, compilation, and dissemination of macroeconomic data could be enhanced in several aspects. In particular, ,areas of improvement include enforcement of confidentiality and compliance, and authorization of data dissemination both within and outside of the Government according to a regular timetable. Nonetheless, the authorities have been cooperative in providing data to the Fund, primarily via the Resident Representative office. Core surveillance data are made available in a timely manner; statistics on monetary, fiscal, and international reserves are provided to the Fund staff with high frequency, but trade and national accounts data have long release delays. Recommendations to the authorities regarding statistical problems, including an analysis of further technical assistance needs, are provided in the report of the March 1995 STA mission. 1/ Bulgaria provides press releases on new data to the media. Monthly statistical publications are prepared by the National Statistical Institute (NSI), Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB), and the Agency for Economic Cooperation and Development (AECD). Economic analysis is contained in separate quarterly and monthly publications released by the BNB and AECD. Bulgaria as yet has no IFS page. 1. Real Sector The national accounts have advanced considerably, but serious problems still remain related to price deflators, coverage of private sector activities, and measurement of imports, household consumption and capital formation. SNA consistent data are available beginning in 1991. Production, expenditure, and income accounts are published annually by the NSI, though release delays are up to six months, and subsequent revisions have been large. Input-output tables at current prices are constructed annually, whereas annual and quarterly national accounts are compiled at current and constant prices. Although quarterly data from 1993 have been constructed, quarterly data were published for the first time in July 1995 for 1995 Ql. Measurement of private sector activities is a problem as in other transition economies. I/ "Bulgaria: Report on the Multisector Statistics Mission, March 6-21, 1995", Statistics Department, IMF.

This index does not adequately distinguish pure price changes from composition changes and thus the volume changes--in, for example, real industrial output--implied by using the PPI series for deflation are questionable. A price statistics mission in January 1995 has recommended a complete redesign of the PPI compilation procedures. Alternative constant price GDP series, which do not rely on the PPI for deflation, are under development. Construction of expenditure GDP also has encountered difficulties related to the possible underestimation of imports and household consumption and the measurement of capital formation. There are reasons to believe that offsetting underestimation of imports and household consumption takes place. Imports are likely to be higher than recorded because of smuggling and under-invoicing, while estimates of household consumption are underestimated as they rely on retail turnover in formal outlets, which are increasingly less important, and upper-income households are under-represented in budget surveys. Capital expenditures have an upward bias, owing to improper valuation procedures, while the methodology used for inventory valuation adjustments creates uncertain biases. Ongoing technical assistance is provided by the OECD. For now, national accounts data should be used with due caution. 2. Fiscal Data The overall quality and currentness of fiscal data have not posed major impediments to policy analysis. Bulgaria has a country page in the GFS Yearbook. Fund staff are provided with detailed revenue, expenditure and financing data for the general government, covering the republican/state budget, the budgets of regional governments and extrabudgetary funds, including the social security system. In addition, the MOF provides--with a lag of about two weeks --semi-monthly reports with data covering the main components of the consolidated general government and with detailed data on tax and non-tax revenue and on expenditures for the republican budget. More disaggregated data for the general government sector would be useful, and the treatment of some of the extrabudgetary funds, particularly the State Fund for Reconstruction and Development (SFRD), could be made more transparent. On the financing side, greater consistency is needed among data for financing in the fiscal accounts and lending to the Government recorded in the monetary and BOP statistics. The MOF and BNB together publish a monthly bulletin on government debt, with details on new issues, and analysis of outstanding domestic government debt. 3. Monetarv Data Monetary data are provided on a timely basis, but coverage and quality could be improved further. The monetary survey is compiled weekly and monthly, with reporting lags of one week and three weeks, respectively. Differences between the monthly and weekly data are modest, while revisions are usually small. Coverage of commercial banks is comprehensive, but data are not presently compiled for financial houses. Prior to May 1995, six Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 33 - APPENDIX III different charts of accounts were utilized by commercial banks. Commercial banks' reporting to the BNB was interrupted after the introduction of a unified chart of accounts in June 1995. The BNB imposed penalties on a few banks with unreasonable delays in reporting, which were quickly effective. However, the delays meant that the June monetary survey was not compiled until September, leaving policy-makers with inadequate information for three months. Areas for further improvement include compilation of foreign assets and liabilities, the analytical treatment of fiscal functions performed by the monetary authorities, and the valuation of government and other securities held by banks. Central bank data are provided on a high frequency basis. The Fund staff receive on a weekly basis an analytical presentation of reserve money, with an auxiliary table for net foreign assets; reporting of daily foreign exchange intervention is made monthly. Classification problems exist however in the BNB balance sheet, particularly in the area of foreign assets and liabilities, stemming from the SFRD accounts, the treatment of gold holdings, and Fund transactions. Recommendations from technical assistance missions have been made in all these areas and are under consideration by the BNB Managing Board. BNB publications are frequent and have comprehensive data coverage; they include the monthly bulletin, quarterly journal, and semi-annual BNB reports. 4. Balance of Payments Statistics Balance of payments reporting has evolved from a highly aggregated statement in 1990 to a more detailed presentation. However, this presentation remains aggregated by international standards, the underlying data are questionable in major components of the BOP, and many data gaps exist. Data are reported quarterly with a lag of about two months by the BNB, but have been subject to major revisions. Trade data are based mainly on customs declarations as reported quarterly by the Ministry of Trade, and are likely to understate both exports and imports due to under-invoicing. Large discrepancies exist between the customs data and banking system statistics on trade flows, which may partly reflect the inclusion of transactions between domestic banks, leading to double-counting. Implementation of expanded reporting requirements on banks, as recommended by STA, may address this latter problem. Trade data are available only on a cumulative basis during the year. Thus it is not possible to separate revisions to previous quarters from data on the most recent quarter. Transportation, tourism and foreign direct investment flows are estimated by the BNB on the basis of partial indicators from ministries and the Committee for Tourism. Information on official debt and debt service has been relatively good. These data are compiled by an inter-institutional Debt Information Group (DIG) composed of the Bulbank, the BNB and the MOF; recently the BNB has taken responsibility for the functions of the DIG. Owing to a low response rate on questionnaires, reliable data are not available on portfolio investment or foreign direct investment, particularly related to the emerging private sector. Data on banking system related capital flows are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX III obtained from the monetary survey.

The macroeconomic framework for 1994 is first summarized, then developments under the program are presented. Overall, substantial correction of domestic and external imbalances was achieved, but progress on structural reforms lagged program targets. An unexpected loss of confidence in the currency as reflected in a sharp depreciation and collapse of lev money demand resulted in the inflation target being exceeded by a wide margin, as the authorities did not tighten policies, particularly monetary policy, sufficiently. 1. Macroeconomic Framework The authorities' program for 1994 was designed to quickly reverse a sharply deteriorating situation with unsustainable fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, an increasingly overvalued exchange rate, and a heavy external debt burden. The fiscal package targeted revenue enhancements equivalent to about 3 l/2 percent of GDP lJ and expenditure cuts of about 1 percent of GDP. With a strong near-term effort to raise the primary surplus, the overall fiscal deficit would decline to a level that could be financed in a less inflationary manner. The overall fiscal deficit was targeted to shrink to 6 l/4 percent of GDP in 1994 from 11 percent in 1993, while the primary balance would move to a surplus of 2 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 from a deficit of almost 3 percent in 1993. This fiscal consolidation, by reducing domestic absorption, would help narrow the non-interest current account deficit by about 2 percent of GDP. Incomes policies and monetary policy were assigned the task of cutting the inflation rate by almost half in 1994. Although performance criteria were set on net domestic assets of the banking system, there were also indicative targets for the money supply, with substantial tightening envisaged as necessary to achieve the targeted inflation. Given the significant targeted increase in net international reserves and the projected stable behavior of lev money demand, domestic lev credit growth was envisaged to fall to about one third of its growth rate in the previous year. Ceilings consistent with projected inflation were set on the public sector's nominal wage bill--serving as a secondary nominal anchor. With substantial foreign assistance planned to help finance the upfront cost of the DDSR operation and maintain an adequate reserve cushion, the flexible exchange rate policy was continued. Despite restrictive macroeconomic policies that were expected to restrain real domestic demand, the four-year contraction in real GDP was projected to end in 1994; real GDP was expected to be constant. The u Tax revenue was projected to rise by about 2 l/2 percent of GDP-- mainly owing to the introduction of a value added tax, while higher non-tax revenues would contribute another 1 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - APPENDIX IV contractionary domestic demand influences were envisaged to be outweighed by strengthening demand in partner countries and by positive supply-side effects. Under the program, the authorities would also enact complementary structural reforms--including privatization, financial isolation of the major loss-making SOEs, and financial sector restructuring--which were to be supported by a Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL) from the World Bank. 2. Targets and Outcomes for 1994 A review of targets and outcomes for 1994 (Table 9) reveals a mix of success and slippage. Actual adjustment was much larger than had been programmed in the areas of the fiscal primary surplus, profitability of SOEs, current account position, and net international reserves. Real GDP growth was also faster than had been projected originally. Money and inflation targets were however missed by wide margins. The authorities' program encountered an unexpected exchange rate crisis in March, 1994 in the early stages of its implementation and before the Executive Board approved the use of Fund resources. L/ With the currency depreciation significantly surpassing expectations, the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the nominal policy targets for fiscal, wages, and money while recognizing that additional adjustment effort could be in store. Thus an attempt was made to anchor domestic prices with financial policies in the expectation that with a restoration of confidence some reversal of the currency depreciation would take place. Quantification of the impact on inflation and the external accounts was considered premature. The Board was informed of developments and policy adaptations in a supplement (EBS/94/52; 4/5/94) issued prior to the Board discussion. The overall fiscal deficit improved more than had been targeted; the actual narrowing was 9 percentage points of GDP compared to nearly 5 percentage points of GDP targeted under the program. (Downward revision to 1993 GDP and subsequent upward revision to the fiscal deficit for 1993 was responsible for this greater improvement even though the overall deficit outturn for 1994 was l/2 percent of GDP above the program target.) The primary surplus exceeded its program targets, both in terms of the improvement and the level. The primary surplus was targeted at nearly 2 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994 but the outturn was 7 l/2 percent of GDP. This stronger adjustment resulted both from real expenditure compression, I/ Lax financial policies during 1992-93 created a precarious macroeconomic situation including an overvalued exchange rate, which along with waning policy credibility of the government were the fundamental forces at work. The trigger for the foreign exchange crisis was delay in mobilizing EU/G-24 financial assistance that also called into question Fund support owing to possible lack of adequate financing assurances. Net foreign exchange intervention by the BNB was constrained by the need to preserve gross reserves for the upfront costs of the DDSR operation, which was to be completed by end-June. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - APPENDIX2 particularly wages, and better than envisaged collections from the new VAT. The higher primary surplus nonetheless could not fully cover the much higher than projected interest expenditures resulting from increased nominal interest rates and the currency depreciation. Incomes policy retained the original nominal ceilings for the first three quarters of 1994, resulting in a substantial decline in real wages. These ceilings were increased during the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, real wages dropped by 28 percent during 1994 which exceeded the assumed real decline of around 5 percent. Incomes policy, thus, served largely successfully as a supporting nominal anchor under extremely difficult circumstances and contributed to the greater correction in the underlying macroeconomic imbalances. Monetary policy, unlike fiscal and incomes policies, did not adhere to its nominal targets. Broad money rose by '79 percent in 1994 (from 53 percent at end-1993) compared to a program target of 28 percent. Both the lev and the foreign-exchange components of broad money exceeded their program targets (Table 9). Foreign currency deposits in U.S. dollar terms expanded by 42 percent as opposed to no growth under the program. While the BNB's control over broad money growth was made difficult by currency substitution and the sharp lev depreciation, ineffective monetary instruments, and a fragile banking system. In mid-year, the BNB switched the conduct of monetary policy from reliance on bank credit ceilings to reserve money management. However, during the second half of 1994, the substantial liquidity needs--nearly 6 percent of GDP--of several large ailing banks and unsterilized foreign exchange purchases produced an excessive expansion in reserve money. Inflation doubled to 122 percent by end-1994, far exceeding the program target (30 percent). Higher inflation was a natural outcome of the increase in traded-goods prices of 100 percent associated with the depreciation, along with the collapse in lev demand that, ceteris paribus, provided a substantial inflationary impulse for non-traded goods prices. After the turbulence of March 1994, the lev appreciated by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar, but then retreated ahead of the Government's resignation on September 7, 1994, and closed out 1994 at the end-March level. This later depreciation fueled another bout of inflation during September and October 1994, which was accommodated by excessive monetary growth. Owing to expenditure switching and compression, the external current account improved significantly more than had been envisaged. The current account strengthened by 13 percent of GDP in 1994, compared to a program target of 3 percent of GDP, leaving the current account virtually in balance in contrast to a program target of 6 percent of GDP. With the greater external adjustment, gross foreign reserves increased to USS1.3 billion, exceeding the program target by about US$200 million, despite a large shortfall of US$400 million in expected external assistance. Notwithstanding the increased adjustment effort, real GDP growth (1.4 percent) surpassed the program target of zero growth. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - APPENDIX IV Bulgaria's ambitious structural reform program made considerable headway in some areas during 1994 but fell short in others. Major accomplishments included implementation of the VAT, parliamentary passage-of a bankruptcy law and of enabling legislation for mass privatization, completion of the DDSR operation, partial recapitalization of the banking system, and significant agricultural land restitution. However, key structural reforms needed to underpin macroeconomic stabilization efforts were not-undertaken--in particular introduction of limits on bank credits to selected loss-making SOEs, enterprise liquidations, and strengthened bank supervision and rehabilitation. Although market privatizations accelerated, they did not get close to their targets (10 percent of SOEs and at least one state-owned bank) and implementation of the mass privatization approach stalle'd. These delays also meant that the FESAL was not finalized in 1994 as had been envisaged. 3. Performance Criteria and Program Review All the performance criteria for end-March 1994 were observed after allowing for adjustors, while all the performance criteria for end-June 1994 were met except for net domestic assets (Table 10). In August 1994, the authorities requested an SDR 69.74 million augmentation of the stand-by arrangement, primarily to compensate for the upfront costs of DDSR operation. At the same time, the authorities requested a waiver of the end- June 1994 performance criterion on net domestic assets u and modifications of the end-September and end-December 1994 performance criteria on net domestic assets and net international reserves to accommodate the use of official reserves to finance the upfront DDSR costs and to rebase the monetary aggregates. Progress on structural reforms was considered adequate in view of the implementation of a VAT on April 1, 1994; further progress in the transfer of agricultural land to private hands; I/ Due to difficulties in predicting the net foreign assets (NFA) of deposit money banks (DMBs), net domestic assets (NDA) was defined in this program--as in the previous two stand-by arrangements--as the difference between broad money and the net foreign assets of the BNB. (The foreign currency elements of broad money and the NFA of the BNB were valued at constant exchange rates.) Under this definition, improvement in the NFA of DMBs would be treated like an expansion of their NDA. Through June 1994, foreign currency deposits at the DMBs increased by 20 percent at constant exchange rate compared to the projected unchanged level; when valued at the end-June exchange rates, foreign currency deposits increased by 97 percent over December 1993. DMBs increased their gross and net foreign assets in response to higher foreign currency deposits. Under the program definition, this better-than-expected performance in DMBs' NFA was registered as an increase in NDA; the actual expansion in NDA of the banking system was much smaller than measured for monitoring compliance under the Fund arrangement. The staff discussed with the BNB staff the possibility of revising the NDA definition, but uncertainties about the accounting treatment of the DDSR operation and greater familiarity with the existing definition caused the BNB staff to defer action until a new Fund arrangement.

All the performance criteria for end-September were met but trends suggested that the ceilings on NDA and credit to the Government for end,- December would not be observed. In September 1994, the Berov Government resigned, a caretaker Government was established and elections were called for December. In view of the need for decisive measures, particularly on structural reforms, and the short tenure and limited policy mandate of the caretaker Government, the program review could not be completed and the second STF purchase was not made. In the event, while the end-December 1994 performance criteria for accumulation of net international reserves and external debt were all met comfortably, the revised ceiling on net domestic assets of the banking system and the original ceiling on credit to the Government were both missed.

Even with the completion of the DDSR operation, Bulgaria remains a heavily-indebted country according to a variety of indicators. The government debt/GDP ratio is estimated at 112 percent for end-1995, of which nearly 70 percent is foreign currency denominated. Budgetary interest payments are projected to amount to 16 percent of GDP in 1995 or just over one third of government expenditures. From an external perspective, the debt burden is somewhat less onerous; foreign debt service payments in 1995 are estimated at about 17 l/2 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services, Interest payments on foreign debt are equivalent to about 5 l/2 percent of GDP, reflecting the high share of exports in GDP. The baseline scenario begins with the estimated outturns for 1995 and extends through 2003. Assumptions concerning the foreign economic environment are taken from the most recent WE0 exercise. Domestic economic objectives include a modest acceleration in real GDP growth from 2 l/2 percent in 1995 to 3 l/2 percent over the medium term, while inflation falls gradually to the level in OECD partner countries (about 3 percent per annum by 2000). As to policy assumptions, the nominal exchange rate depreciates in line with differential CPI inflation; real wages rise with productivity growth; and quasi-fiscal deficits narrow by some 9 percentage points of GDP over the period. If the latter were not to hold, then fiscal adjustment would need to be commensurately greater. 1. External Accounts Under the baseline assumptions, the current account is projected to move into a small surplus of l-2 percent of GDP during 1996 through 2003, corresponding initially to a non-interest current account surplus of 3 l/2-4 percent (Table 11). While this improvement is small compared to the strengthening observed during 1994, it would require sustained financial discipline. Export volume growth (5-5 l/2 percent per annum) would be moderate compared to other transition economies in central and eastern Europe and would be in line with current estimates for Bulgaria's export volume growth in 1995 (5 l/4 percent). Import volume growth is projected in the neighborhood of 5 to 5 l/2 percent over the medium term--compared to a decline of 15 percent in 1994 and a projected increase of 3 percent in 1995. These projections for volume growth in exports and imports presume that the recent real currency appreciation does not continue beyond 1995. Developments in the capital account are based on conservative assumptions concerning spontaneous private inflows and foreign direct investment, while new disbursements from official bilateral and regional sources are assumed to be on average about US$200 million per year less than amortization payments. No Fund arrangement, adjustment lending by the World Bank, or exceptional macroeconomic financing from the EU/G-24 is projected. Debt reductions stemming from debt swaps or purchases of Bulgarian Brady Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX V bonds were also not incorporated into this baseline scenario. Owing to lumpy debt-service payments to the EU, the capital account would register deficits in 1998-99 and 2001, thereby straining the overall balance of payments position. Moreover, repurchase obligations to the Fund are particularly high in 1996 and remain significant through 1999 (Table 12). Gross official reserves (including gold), would increase only slightly (by US$80 million) to 1999, declining in terms of months of imports of goods and nonfactor services (GNFS) from almost 3 l/2 to just under 3 months. IJ By 2003, gross official reserves would once again achieve 3 l/2 months of imports of GNFS. Sustained current account surpluses would permit the various debt indicators to be more than halved by 2003 (Table 13), which should set the stage for restoration of access to private capital markets. A weaker current account position could be envisaged, particularly if it were associated with an investment boom financed by foreign direct investment. These projections are, of course, susceptible to wide swings in response to even small parameter changes, or to policy deviations. For example, a decline in export volume growth of 1 percent per annum during 1996-2003 implies that gross official reserves (including gold) would dip below 2 months of imports of GNFS by 1999 and below 1 month by 2001. The negative effects of the ongoing UN sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) (FRY) are assumed to continue in the baseline projections. However, if these sanctions were relaxed or lifted in conjunction with reduced hostilities, this would improve access to western European markets by restoring trade routes through the FRY improving prospects for export growth. On the adequacy of international reserves, several observations are germane. One, the DMBs have foreign exchange liabilities (including foreign exchange deposits) in 1995 considerably in excess of the market value of their foreign exchange assets. This foreign exchange open position should be closed over the medium term, adding to pressures on the balance of payments. Two, given the substantial debt service burden and with reserves projected to dip below 3 months of import.5 of GNFS in 1998 and 1999, a higher gross reserve cushion would seem appropriate. Three, with Bulgarian Brady bonds selling at heavy discounts in the secondary market, some additional resources could be earmarked b:y the authorities to retire Bulgarian external debt at a discount. 2. Fiscal Policv In this subsection, interest payments on the external debt are imputed based on the aforementioned scenario. Macroeconomic policies are assumed to be successful in lowering inflation and become sufficiently credible such that nominal interest rates are also reduced commensurately. However, domestic nominal and real interest rates would continue to exceed, 1/ Excluding gold, official reserves decline to 2.9 months of imports of GNFS at end-1995.

(Nominal and real interest rates have been greater than nominal and real GDP growth throughout the transition period, 1990-95.) Thus, the debt dynamics are inherently unstable without a compensating larger primary surplus. Before proceeding with the scenario results, the characteristics of Bulgaria's government debt structure should be noted. A relatively large share of government debt is denominated in foreign currency. At end-1995, about 20 percent of projected domestic debt would be denominated in foreign currency and external debt would account for 61 percent of total government debt. Thus, only about 30 percent of the debt stock pays domestic interest rates; domestic currency denominated debt is all on variable interest rate terms. In this situation, foreign interest rates and the real exchange rate are more crucial variables for fiscal sustainability than are domestic nominal and real interest rates. The medium-term fiscal policy rule for the baseline scenario postulates a primary surplus sufficient to cover interest payments. Thus ) over the medium term, government debt does not increase as a result of deficit financing. Given Bulgaria's initial heavy indebtedness, a balanced budget would quickly restore a viable fiscal position; modest deficits would also reduce the debt/GDP ratio but more slowly. Under the baseline, the adjusted primary surplus (excluding BNB profit transfers) would rise to 8.3 percent in 1996 before it declines to 4.3 percent during 2001-2003 (Table 14). The government debt stock falls from 112 percent of GDP in 1995 to 62 percent of GDP in 2003 and is on a modest declining trend. As a result, with revenues held at 39.5 percent of GDP, primary expenditures would increase by 5 percentage points of GDP to 34.7 percent of GDP in 2003. The second panel of Table 14, illustrates the impact of relaxing the fiscal policy rule. Under a revised rule that keeps the primary surplus at about one half of interest payments over the medium term, the primary surplus would decline to about 3 percent of GDP. The debt ratio would decline as in the baseline scenario, but more slowly and would be nearly 20 percentage points of GDP higher than in the baseline by 2003. With the larger overall balance assumed to be financed domestically, lev denominated debt would account for over half of total government debt by the end of the projection period. While this scenario suggests there is some scope to relax the fiscal rule and still achieve a more sustainable fiscal position, it abstracts from the pressure on real domestic interest rates that increased dcmestic borrowing could cause. Compared to the baseline scenario, if real interest rates were 2 percentage points higher on domestic currency denominated debt, the primary surplus required to balance the budget would increase by about l/2 of one percentage point of GDP, and over the medium term the primary surplus would stabilize at around 5 l/4 percent of GDP. Similarly, if interest rates on foreign currency denominated debt were 2 percentage points higher, the primary surplus would have to be about one percentage point of GDP higher than in the baseline. This highlights the additional fiscal effort required to offset higher real interest rates.

This might be expected for a transitional economy which could experience productivity increases, particularly in the export sector, that exceed those of its partner countries. Under the assumption that the real exchange rate appreciates at 2 percent annually, annual interest payments would decline by about 0.4 percent of GDP below the baseline scenario, permitting the primary surplus to be commensurately lower and primary expenditures therefore greater (third panel of Table 14). Owing to the high foreign currency denomination of the debt at the start of the scenario, the ratio of government debt to GDP would fall nearly 6 percent of GDP below the baseline scenario. Alternatively, in the event of real currency depreciation, the outcome would be reversed. The final scenario incorporates budgetary costs of further banking sector and public enterprise restructuring. It assumes that government debt will increase by about 10 percent of GDP to recapitalize the banking sector and that the Government will spend an amount equivalent to 4 percent of GDP in additional expenditures related to restructuring and downsizing of SOE:; during 1996-97. As a result, the primary surplus needed to cover interest payments over the medium term would increase by 0.6 percent of GDP, reducing the scope for increasing other primary expenditures (fourth panel of Table 14). Although debt stocks initially rise sharply, the debt/GDP ratio would then taper off and would be about 7 l/2 percentage points of GDP above the baseline. The costs associated with structural reforms may be greater than assumed but, perhaps balancing this, is the fact that no provision has been made for the possible reduction in government debt through debt/equity swaps or purchases of Bulgarian Brady bonds. Both actions could substantially improve the debt dynamics and move Bulgaria closer to fisca:L sustainability.
