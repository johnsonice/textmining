EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background l Following years of economic mismanagement and consequent economic decline, change began in June 1998. Fundamental political reforms were launched, culminating in the inauguration of democratically elected President Obasanjo at the end of May 1999. Some economic reform was achieved, and a staff monitored program (SMP) was adopted in January 1999. Performance under the SMP was unsatisfactory, however. l The new administration took immediate action to stop financial excesses, combat corruption, and build public confidence. The earlier threat to macroeconomic stability has been thwarted. Inflation has decelerated sharply, and the precipitous fall of international reserves has been halted. However, signs of economic recovery are yet to emerge, and social tensions remain high. Medium-Term Economic Prospects l Although the outlook for the international oil price is good, Nigeria’s external position will remain weak. While imports will need to grow as the economy expands, non-oil exports are negligible and the growth in oil export volume will be constrained by world demand. The prospects for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction therefore depend on economic policy reform, rather than on oil. Report on the Discussions l Discussions focused on policies for the period immediately ahead, in line with the authorities’ priority to restore social and economic stability. The authorities’ have indicated their intention to request a one year Stand-By Arrangement. This would follow a period of informal monitoring. The prior actions include: (i) the satisfactory implementation of the revised budget and the monetary program; (ii) a shift to a market- based exchange system; (iii) minimum payments on external debt; (iv) the announcement of a privatization program; (v) the adoption of an appropriate anticorruption bill; (vi) the completion of investigations into financial malfeasance; (vii) an external audit of the foreign exchange transactions of the central bank and the financial accounts of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC); (viii) and initiation of timely publication of the key financial statistics of the NNPC and the central Bank (CBN). A successful SBA could be followed by a medium-term arrangement. l To achieve a meaningful reduction in poverty, Nigeria needs to achieve economic growth of at least 7-8 percent. The country should adopt a double headed strategy of swift, decisive and tindamental reforms to support broad-based economic growth and an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicenhanced delivery of basic social services essential for improving living standards, The reforms should be properly sequenced, focusing on: fiscal prudence; a credible regulatory framework to promote competition and privatization; a market-based exchange rate; and institution building which entails judicial reform, enhanced governance, and sharply enhanced capacity in state and local governments to support fiscal federalism. l On fiscal policy, the authorities indicated that the revised budget for June-December 1999 ’ will be implemented judiciously, and the petroleum subsidy will be eliminated over a 12- month period beginning in January 2000, The staffrecommended that an overall balance may be warranted in 2000; large domestic debt needs to be settled in an orderly and equitable manner; further improvements to fiscal transparency and strengthening of treasury and budget management are urgently called for. l Over the medium term, an appropriate fiscal target may be to aim for an overall balance based on an oil price of US%16 per barrel. With the share of federation revenue allocated to federal government being reduced and that of state and local governments raised, the former should shift its focus to activities that are truly national in scope while the latter strengthen the provisions of basic social services. The establishment of fiscal federalism should be caremlly managed to match the increased resources of state and local governments with their capacity to utilize them well. l The authorities indicated that cautious, market-based monetary policy will be pursued; the present system of weekly central bank allocation of foreign exchange at a pre-determined price is being replaced by an expanded interbank foreign exchange market; the remaining restrictions on international current account transactions are being lifted; and Nigeria intends to accept the obligations under the Article VIII shortly. The staffunderscored the critical importance of allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate, and substantially improving the quality and timeliness of monetary data. A number of measures are being taken to mrther strengthen the soundness of the banking system. l Stressing the urgency of restoring efficiency and international competitiveness of Nigeria’s non-oil sector, the staff argued for avoiding persistent over-valuation of the exchange rate; a reduction of high tariff rates and more uniform tariff structure; the establishment of a more effective regulatory framework, particularly for power, telecommunications, and petroleum product markets; and early completion of privatization in these sectors. The staff also called for the vigorous pursuit of the anti-corruption campaign, judicial reforms to enhance the security of property rights and the rule of law, and re-establishment of professional, result-oriented civil service at all tiers of the government, The authorities reaffirmed their firm commitment to market-based economic management, privatization, and good governance. A comprehensive technical assistance program has been prepared for capacity building at the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Nigeria, and the Federal Office of Statistics.

The World Bank and other donors plan to actively engage in community-based poverty reduction projects. The institutions and mechanisms to deliver social services efficiently- with full accountability-need to be established, as financial resources are increased. Nigeria’s external debt is heavy. The staffs projections indicate that if debt owed to the Paris Club is rescheduled on non-concessional terms only-as the Club has indicated-a large financing gap would persist over the medium-term, and the debt would remain heavy. The staff has consistently stressed the need for Nigeria to improve its relation with the Paris Club by establishing a track record of payments and policy performance. The desired track record is yet to be established. The authorities strongly believe that debt forgiveness is crucial to free up resources for basic social programs. Staff Appraisal l The statTcommended the authorities on establishing renewed hope in Nigeria. The staff emphasized the importance of decisive reform to reverse long-term economic decline in Nigeria. In particular: fiscal prudence; cautious monetary policy and a market-determined exchange rate; good governance; the re-building of public institutions; de-regulation and privatization; trade liberalization; and well-targeted, efficiently run social programs. l The staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to request a one-year Stand-By Arrangement. If (a) the prior actions are met, (b) strong economic program for 2000 is adopted, and (c) adequate financing to support the program is assured, the staff would present Nigeria’s request for the SBA in January 2000. The staff also welcomed the authorities’ intention to accept the obligations under the Article VIII in the near future. l The new democratic government in Nigeria offers the hope of a new beginning, and should be swiftly supported. The staff trusts that the authorities will quickly establish a credible track record that will provide a secure basis for more substantial support from the international community, bilateral donors, the financial markets, and the Paris Club. Far- reaching reform will gather support on its own merits. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- IL INTRODUCTION 1. During the last Article IV consultation discussions (June 12, 1998), Executive Directors expressed serious concerns about inadequate economic growth in Nigeria, poorly coordinated economic policies, the maintenance of multiple exchange rates, and the continued accumulation of external arrears. They called for an improvement of the investment climate through continued prudence in financial management, determined progress in structural reforms, improved relations with creditors, a strengthened approach to policy coordination, and the resolution of governance problems. 2. Since then, there have been four missions to prepare, negotiate, and monitor the stti monitored program approved by management in January 1999. Technical assistance missions have been fielded in the areas of budget management, central banking and statistics. A comprehensive IMP and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) technical assistance program has also been prepared which aims, inter alia, at strengthening Nigeria’s economic data, which are weak and impede timely and accurate monitoring of economic developments. In addition, the Fund has recently established a resident mission in Abuja. Finally, to help improve public understanding of the Fund and the effectiveness of Fund assistance in Nigeria, the statfco-sponsored a conference on Nigeria’s economic policy, and invited a group of Nigerian journalists to visit headquarters. The stafFalso held a seminar for members of the National Assembly and civil society. 3. The World Bank Group is currently gearing up to actively support Nigeria. The planned activities include technical assistance in privatization and broad based capacity building; a petroleum sector review; a community-based poverty reduction credit; and urban transport projects. The Bank Board recently reviewed and supported the Informal Country Assistance Strategy Paper which envisages IDA credits of SDR 300-700 million over the next three years, including balance of payments support in the context of a Fund-supported program. 4. Summaries of Nigeria’s relations with the Fund and with the World Bank Croup are presented in Appendices I and II, respectively; data issues are discussed in Appendix III; selected social and demographic indicators are provided in Appendix IV; the assumptions underlying the medium-term balance of payments projections are presented in Appendix V; Appendix VI reviews the financial sector in Nigeria, and a tentative work program is presented in Appendix VII. III. BACKGROUND 5. Nigeria is no better off now than in 1970. Per capita income was US!§3 10 in 1998 and two-thirds of Nigerians (about 80 million people) live in poverty (Box 1). The top 20 percent of Nigerians account for half of total income, while the bottom 20 percent account Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- for only 4 percent; forty percent of children under 5 are malnourished (Appendix IV). Over the last five years, real GDP growth averaged 2.7 percent a year, while population growth averaged 2.4 percent. Annual inflation averaged 36 percent; the balance on the external current account and the overall fiscal balance have lluctuated with the price of oil, averaging - 0.5 and -1.2 percent of GDP, respectively’ (Figure 1, Table 1). 6. Weak economic performance has been mainly the result of economic mismanagement, including fiscal indiscipline, unproductive public spending, and the haphazard implementation of monetary policy. Persistent exchange rate over-valuation and overregulation, have weakened the non-oil economy. Importantly, endemic corruption, poor governance, a weak judiciary, and high levels of insecurity have undermined the rule of law, the sanctity of property rights, and the enforcement of contracts. In turn, this deterioration has contributed to the “high cost of doing business”, further reducing savings and investment, and fbeling capital flight. Inadequate pay, perverse incentives, and the pernicious influence of military rule have severely weakened public services. The capacity of state and local govemments-which are largely responsible for delivery of social services-has been particularly degraded. 7. Change began in June 1998, following the sudden death of General Abacha. His successor, General Abubakar, implemented fbndamental political reforms, releasing detainees and holding local, state,’ and national elections, which international observers considered to have been largely fair. A new constitution was adopted, and a democratically-elected president, Oluseg,un Obasanjo, was sworn into office on May 29, 1999. 8. The first half of the Abubakar administration also achieved some economic reform: (a) the heavily subsidiied official exchange rate was abolished; (b) an ambitious privatization program was launched; (c) the petroleum subsidy was replaced with a consumption tax, resulting in a doubling of the gasoline price; (d) about one-third of the US%2.3 billion “withdrawn” from the central bank under the Abacha regime was recovered; and (e) the 1999 budget incorporated fiscal adjustment equivalent to 9.4 percent of GDP, sufficient to offset a drop in petroleum revenue then estimated at 6.8 percent of GDP. 9. These actions allowed Nigeria to come to an agreement on a staff-monitored program (SMP) in January 1999. The SMP envisaged the pursuit of tight fiscal and monetary policies, a market-based exchange rate, rapid progress in privatization and deregulation, and an important beginning in improving governance. It was understood at that time that satisfactory performance under the SMP through May could lead to a medium-term Fund arrangement around the middle of 1999. ’ Oil accounts for over 90 percent of export earnings and over 70 percent of consolidated government revenue. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- 10. However, performance under the SMP was unsatisfactory as reform disintegrated. Large extrabudgetary expenditures (equivalent to 3 percent of annual GDP) increased the budget deficit to 8.3 percent of GDP over the first five months of 1999, compared with the SMP target of 5.8 percent for the whole year (Tables 2 and 3.) The deficit was financed by an expansion of credit from the central bank, equivalent to 72 percent of the stock of reserve money at the beginning of the period, and international reserves fell from US$7 billion to US$5 billion despite a tripling of short-term interest rates to 30 percent (15 percent in real terms) and a 10.5 percent devaluation of the naira (Tables 4 and 5). All but one of the quantitative SMP targets were missed by large margins, and structural reforms were either not implemented or delayed. 11. Upon taking office, President Obasanjo took immediate action to reverse the excesses of the previous administration, combat corruption, and build public confidence. The actions included: the retirement of military officers that have held high political office, the establishment of human rights and contract review panels, the launching of investigations into financial malfeasance, the dismissal of 3000 civil servants (including at top levels), and the presentation to the National Assembly of a draft anticorruption bill. Combined with measures to restore fiscal discipline, including a freeze on payments on extrabudgetary commitments, a suspension of capital spending, and the cancellation of oil concessions, the new administration has given hope that things may turn for the better. 12. Thus, the risk of serious macroeconomic instability, apparent towards the end of the previous administration, has been contained. Following the sharp cut in public spending and the implementation of temporary monetary measures, demand for foreign exchange in the weekly foreign exchange allocation (the autonomous foreign exchange market, or “AFEM”) dropped substantially, and the parallel market exchange rate strengthened appreciably, to close to the AFEM rate of +f95=US$l (Figure 2). With tighter monetary conditions and a good harvest, the 12-month rate of inflation fell from 15 percent in April 1999 to 1 percent in August 1999 (Figures 3 and 4). Gross international reserves are expected to reach US$4.9 billion by end-December (Table 5). 13. Democratic checks and balances are now at work. The National Assembly closely scrutinized the administration’s budget proposals for June-December 1999, and continues to debate the Anti-Corruption Bill and the Niger Delta Development Commission Bill. The press enjoys new freedom, as illustrated by the resignation of the Speaker of the House following newspaper revelations of his falsification of credentials during the election campaign. 14. However, signs of sustained economic revival and a resurgence of private investment are yet to emerge. Real GDP is expected to increase by less than 1 percent in 1999, despite good agricultural performance, because of a 4 percent decline in oil production (reflecting a reduction in the OPEC quota) and continued stagnation in the industrial sector. Reports from the manufacturers point to a substantial fall in employment, a reduction in capacity utilization, and an increase in inventories during the first half of 1999, compared to the previous year.

Ethnic clashes have been reported in the South-West and the North, and a number of workers died in a recent protest at Lagos port. Local discontent is particularly strong in the Niger Delta, where oil spills have also caused major environmental damage. Dozens of local residents have been killed in recent clashes in protest against the oil companies, and the lifting of oil in the region has been disrupted. A new liquefied natural gas plant was also temporarily shut down by local community protests. Unless addressed urgently, the situation in the Niger Delta could threaten economic and social stability (Box 2). IV. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS 16. The prospects for the world oil price are favorable: it is currently projected to rise from an average of US$15 per barrel in 199g2 to US$20 per barrel in 2000, and then to remain at about US$l8 per barrel through 2005. If oil production grows somewhat faster than world demand (2 percent a year), Nigeria’s oil exports should increase from US$9.2 billion in 1998 to US$13.4 billion in 2005 (Table 6). Together with the coming onstrearn of exports of natural gas, as well as projected growth of 15 percent a year in non-oil exports, total exports are projected to increase from US%9.6 billion to US$15.8 billion in the same period. 17. However, even with such a favorable outlook for oil prices, Nigeria’s external payments position wig remain difficult, for four reasons, First, there is a significant gap between Nigeria’s non-oil exports (2 percent of non-oil GDP) and non-oil imports (over 30 percent of non-oil GDP). Second, oil exports (25 percent of non-oil GDP) are insufficient to finance this gap, largely because the large import requirements of the oil sector (for drilling, production and services), and the generous terms with oil companies particularly regarding retained profits, are equivalent to about half the oil export receipts. Natural gas exports will not provide significant revenue to the country for several years, partly because of generous tax concessions. Third, Nigeria’s oil production, subject to the OPEC quota, cannot be expected to increase in line with the growth of non-oil imports, which should grow at a similar rate as projected for non-oil GDP. Fourth, if Nigeria’s debt to Paris Club creditors is rescheduled on non-concessional terms, external debt service would remain heavy over the medium term (see below). 18. Moreover, even with strict financial discipline, if the shift to market-based reforms and the privatization of key utilities are slow to materialize, improvements in Nigeria’s competitiveness and efficiency would only be gradual. National saving should 2 The average price of % 15 per barrel in 1999 is based on the actual price realized through July, and an estimate for the rest of the year based on WE0 data with a lag of three months. The actual price realized in Nigeria lags the world market price because payment is made one month after delivery, and the NNPC sells forward.

Similarly, private investment could even double, but, given its low base, this would not be enough to raise real GDP growth to above 5 percent within the next 5-6 years. Moreover, although the external current account deficit would decline from 12.6 percent of GDP in 1999, it would still persist at 8-9 percent of GDP. 19. Furthermore, any rises in the world oil price beyond the current level are likely to be temporary, and a fall is probable. If the price of crude oil is lower by US$2 per barrel throughout the projection period, then total export receipts would be lower by some US$1.4 billion annually, and the current account deficit higher by about 2 percent of GDP. Real GDP growth would then be somewhat lower than in the above scenario. In any case, given the current difficult conditions and the enormity of the needed reforms, there is a significant risks that the projected economic growth will not materialize. 20. The medium-term prospects for economic growth and poverty reduction in Nigeria depend much more on the government’s economic strategy and management, than on oil. The acute importance of sound economic policy is evident from Nigeria’s own experience, but can also be illustrated by comparison with Indonesia. Despite recent difficulties, Indonesia’s macroeconomic management has sustained strong growth, and reduced poverty by two-thirds over the last three decades (Box 3). V. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 21. The discussions focused on the policies needed to restore financial discipline and macroeconomic stability, as the authorities’ first priority upon taking office was to preserve social stability during the early days of the new democracy. Because the government had been in office for less than two months at the time of the stafI’s mission, the discussions on structural and medium-term policies centered on broad strategies and principles, with an understanding that the details would be developed over the coming months in consultation with the staffs of the Fund and World Bank. 22. The authorities indicated that they intended to request a one-year Stand-By Arrangement as an interim step toward the adoption of a medium-term arrangement. In light of the poor performance under the SMP, the staff indicated that the authorities needed to establish a track record of a strong policy performance for the period June-November 1999 before the stafF could recommend the presentation of Nigeria’s request for a Stand-By Arrangement to the Executive Board. To this end, the staff came to understandings on the performance targets, which would serve as prior actions for the Stand-By Arrangement (Table 8 and Box 4). The occasion of the Annual Meetings provided an opportunity to clarify the remaining understandings. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- A. Reform and Poverty Reduction Strategies 23. The overriding objective of economic policy should be to maximize economic growth and reduce poverty. Economic growth of 5 percent is clearly insufficient to make a significant dent in poverty and unemployment. The Nigerian population is young, and the labor force could grow at double the rate of population growth. To achieve a meaningful reduction in poverty, Nigeria needs to achieve economic growth of at least 7-g percent, with a rapid expansion of small-scale enterprises in both agriculture and manufacturing (which together account for about 70 percent of employment). 24. To this end, Nigeria needs swift, decisive and fundamental reforms. The immediate reform agenda must be selective and well-sequenced, in view particularly of the country’s limited institutional capacity. The staff’s view is that such reform should encompass: l A strong fiscal position to support a monetary policy aimed at achieving low inflation, and at lowering real interest rates and making room for higher private investment; transparency in fiscal operations; and sharply improved capacity for budget management. l Removal of the structural bottlenecks that impede growth through a credible regulatory framework to promote competition, that would serve as a foundation for a decisive privatization program, particularly in power, downstream petroleum, and telecommunications. l A flexible market-based exchange rate, in a liberalized foreign exchange market. l Institution-building-both for a competitive market economy, and for the delivery of essential social services-which entails judicial reform, improved governance, and sharply enhanced capacity in state and local governments to support fiscal federalism. 25. Improved provision of education, health and essential social services complements growth, and is essential for enhancing living standards. This requires institution-building and establishment of mechanisms-both public and privat-for effective service delivery. In particular, social programs need to have the close involvement of local communities, rather than being handed down Corn the top. With fiscal federalism leading to increased allocations of federation account revenues to state and local governments (see below) the immediate binding constraint on effective initiatives to reduce poverty directly is likely to be institutional. B. Fiscal Policy 26. The National Assembly approved in September a revised budget for the period June- December 1999, which in the statIFs assessment, was not My consistent with the objective of maintaining macroeconomic stability. Total revenue for the second half of the year was estimated at 22.5 percent of annual GDP (or an annual&d rate of 38.4 percent), based on an oil price assumption of US$18 per barrel. Total expenditure was set at 24 percent of annual GDP (an annualized rate of 40.8 percent), with capital spending increasing to 2.5 percent of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - annual GDP (an annualized rate of 5 percent). The overall deficit for June-December 1999 was estimated at 1.5 percent of GDP. Given that a deficit of 8.3 percent of GDP had been recorded in January-May 1999, the overall deficit for the year as a whole would be 9.8 percent of GDP. 27. In the discussions during the Annual Meetings, the authorities stated that the approved budget was substantially more expansionary than had been proposed. The staff indicated that if expenditure commitments are to be made prudently and only after due process-as the authorities intend-actual capital spending in the final three months of the year could not be more than H20 billion. On this basis, and taking into account an expected shortfall in petroleum product tax receipts (owing to oil companies taking offsets against previous overpayments and compensating for government arrears on cash calls), it was agreed to set the performance target for central bank financing for the period June-December 1999 at H-9 billion (-0.2 per cent of GDP). 28. While supporting the authorities’ overall fiscal stance for June-December, the staff noted with concern that the revised budget implied a subsidy on petroleum consumption. Since January 1999, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been selling the gasoline it refines at #20 per liter (equivalent to US$O.80 per gallon) in the domestic market. As the international oil price rose, the domestic price became substantially below import parity (currently about H27 per liter). Private sector imports ceased and the NNPC monopoly was effectively reinstated. Without imports, and with two of the country’s four refineries closing for maintenance, the risk of reemergence of severe petroleum shortages cannot be discounted. Moreover, with the gasoline prices in the neighboring countries ranging from ?+45 to 9c)60 per liter, a significant volume is smuggled, which means that the government is not only subsidizing the better-off in Nigeria, but also those in neighboring countries. The staff suggested that social concerns could be better addressed by eliminating the subsidy and using the revenue that would accrue to help the poor through well-targeted interventions, including investment in public transport and an increase in the minimum wage. 29. While recognizing the economic rationale for removing the petroleum subsidy (estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP in 2000 at current prices), the authorities stressed the social sensitivity of petroleum product prices, as demonstrated by the widespread public protest that followed the previous increase in December 1998. In the absence of a public transport system, there is no effective way of targeting subsidies to those groups most affected by a price increase. The authorities thus indicated that the subsidy will be eliminated over a 12- month period beginning in January 2000. The petroleum market will be fully deregulated when the elimination of the subsidy is complete. 30. The maintenance of the petroleum subsidy has major implications for the 2000 budget. Assuming that the subsidy is removed gradually during the year, that the petroleum product consumption tax is suspended, and that the petroleum profit tax shortfall recovers slowly and that the world oil price averages US%18 per barrel, total revenue is likely to be limited to less than 22 percent of annual GDP-i.e., the level envisaged in the revised budget Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- for June-December, 1999. If the budget is to be balanced-as the authorities intend-total expenditure will have to be reduced significantly fi-om the levels for that period. At the same time, government wages will need to be increased substantially to begin to bring them closer to a “living wage,” and to provide necessary incentives for a well-motivated civil service, as well as to reduce the susceptibility for rent-seeking. Federal government capital expenditure would then have to be reduced substantially from the already low level recorded in 1999-all at a time when resources need to be channelled into health, education, and essential infrastructure. Thus, all that could be realistically attained for the 2000 Budget may be an overall balance, even though with high world oil prices, the authorities should ideally target an overall surplus to reduce domestic debt. This proposition is based on the general principle that budget surpluses (deficits) should be targeted when oil prices are above (below) their long-term trend. 31. Domestic debt is large, at more than Hl trillion (40 percent of GDP), including arrears to local contractors, estimated at #150 trillion for the National Priority Projects alone. The authorities intend to settle such claims on a bilateral basis with individual creditors, both to maximize the discount on the claims and to leave flexibility to deal with special circumstances. In line with this policy, a request for a supplementary appropriation of NC)30 billion has been submitted to the National Assembly to pay arrears on National Priority Projects (for example, the Ajaokuta steel complex). The staff recommended the establishment of priorities in payments based on clear principles-to ensure comparable treatment for all creditors (domestic and foreign), transparency, and consistency with available budgetary resources-and the publication of payment schedules. The staff and authorities agreed first to complete an inventory of domestic arrears by end-December, and then to discuss the strategy towards a prompt settlement of these arrears in the context of the program for the year 2000. 32. Moreover, the staff urged the authorities to make further improvements to fiscal transparency, acknowledging that progress has already been made. The National Assembly now closely scrutinizes budget proposals. An extrabudgetary fund, the Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund (PSTF) is being wound up, with its program transferred to line ministries. The public accounts must be audited by the Auditor-General (who reports to the National Assembly) and published within seven months of the end of the fiscal year. The staff recommended that additional measures, to be taken in the year 2000, include: (a) the inclusion of remaining extra-budgetary expenditure and special tinds in the budget; (b) the compilation and publication of data on commitments and payments by line ministries on a monthly basis; and (c) the provision of the necessary budgetary and human resources to the Office of the Auditor-General and the Accountant General of the Federation. The latter is a significant component of the World Bank’s Economic Management Capacity Building Project, which is expected to be launched with the support of other donors in the year 2000. 33. The authorities also stressed that defense spending is now subject to the same accountability standards as the other ministries, including scrutiny by the Auditor General. They provided the information on defense spending readily available to them, although it appears to be incomplete (Table 9). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- 34. The sttiemphasized that early action should also be taken to strengthen treasury and budget management. At present, the treasury neither monitors payments by line ministries nor’manages cash to minimize costs to the government. Similarly, the budget is prepared without adequate information on, and assessment of, line ministries’ execution of the existing budget. Technical assistance under the lMlVUNDP program could begin in these areas in 2000. C. The Medium-Term Fiscal Stance and Fiscal Federalism 35. Over the medium term, it is crucial that fiscal policy continues to contribute to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, to the reduction of poverty, and begins a reduction in domestic debt. Also, as noted above, the guiding principle should be to target a surplus when oil prices are above their long-term trend and to allow a deficit only when prices are below that trend, so as to insulate expenditures fkom potentially large fluctuations in oil revenue. The oil price is currently projected to remain stable at around US$18 per barrel. The target of fiscal balance on average over the medium term at an oil price of US%16 per barrel is therefore prudent, as it allows some debt repayments in the event that the projected oil price materialixed. 36. A new formula to share federation revenue among the three tiers of the government (Federal, state and local) is expected to take effect in 2000. The new constitution mandates that at least 13 percent of the natural resource-based revenues should go to the producing states, up fkom the current provision of 4 percent. Under the new formula, payments to service external debt contracted prior to end-May 1999, and the finding for the operations of the oil joint venture companies (“cash calls”) will be deducted from federation revenue as “first charges,” and the remainder to be distributed to the federal, state, and local government. The share of federal government in total federation revenues could be reduced from 48.5 percent to 39.5 percent. 37. If the international oil price is assumed to average US$18 per barrel in 2000, and US!!16 per barrel thereafter (US!!2 below the WE0 projections), total consolidated government revenue would rise fkom 32.8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 38.4 percent of GDP in 2000, and then decline to 34 percent by 2005. If the authorities are to follow a fiscal policy broadly consistent with the principles discussed above and achieve approximate budget balance in 2004-2005, federal government expenditure (excluding the first charges) would have to fall from 17.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to 8.8 percent in 2005. Text Table 1 illustrates this fiscal adjustment scenario, and it can be compared with the bottom panel of Table 7, where the assumed fiscal effort is weaker. State and local governments’ revenue could increase from 11.7 percent of GDP in 1999 to 15.8 percent in 2000 and then decline to 13.1 percent of GDP by 2005.

The stafFnoted that as its revenue is reduced, the federal government should shift its focus to activities that are truly national in scope, while state and local government should strengthen the provisions of basic public services, such as education, health and safe water. A stronger local tax base should be developed by the lower tiers of the government to give them the stability of revenue needed to improve the delivery of public services. 39. The staff noted that, while state and local governments, in principle, could provide certain public services, such as health and education, more efficiently than the federal government, their capacity to do so is seriously inadequate. The states are also not well placed to manage the volatility in their resources arising from the close link between their funding and oil revenues. The establishment of fiscal federalism therefore should be carefully designed and sequenced so that the allocation of increased resources to state and local governments provides some stability in resources and is matched by improvements in their capacity to manage them. An interim arrangement may be sought to ensure prudent management of increased resources over the next few years. This could take the form of a program for savings to be accumulated initially, and then drawn down as the capacity to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- manage additional resources efficiently is estabIished. State and local governments shouId continue to refrain from borrowing. 40. Fiscal federalism should also facilitate the resolution of the problems of the Niger Delta. Centralized initiatives to develop the Niger Delta, such as the Oil and Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC), have failed (Box 2). It is necessary for the new administration to work closely with the state and local governments, and with the indigenous populations of these areas, to accelerate economic development in the Niger Delta. D. Poverty Reduction 41. The authorities emphasized that reducing poverty is a top priority. President Obasanjo has recently announced various initiatives directly aimed at alleviating poverty, including the provision of nine years of compulsory free education for all children, and a comprehensive social welfare scheme for senior citizens. Oyo State has announced a program of free primary health care and subsidiied secondary health care services. The staff noted that a decisively implemented reform program was particularly important since the single most effective way to reduce poverty is through strong growth in the non-oil economy. 42. Effective social programs are also essential for raising standards of living. In improving the impact of public health, schooling, and the provision of infrastructure, the staff noted that the three key actions were generally to increase the allocation of resources to these activities (Table lo), to administer them better-most importantly in the context of fiscal federalism-and to encourage private sector participation. In gearing up their efforts in support of initiative to reduce poverty, the World Bank aims to deal directly with the states, local governments, communities, and with NGOs, initially in the areas of primary education, water supply and sanitation systems, and pilot community development projects. The staff recommended working closely with the World Bank, other development partners, and Fund staff to develop an effective poverty reduction strategy, building on the recommendations of Vision 2010, a public-private sector partnership involving traditional rulers, civil society, and all other stakeholders. E. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 43. The authorities stressed that fiscal discipline will be accompanied by a market- based monetary policy, including market determined exchange and interest rates. The staff noted that the measures taken earlier to contain the excess liquidity in the banking system (the mandatory purchase of “special treasury bills” (STBs) in April; the requirement that banks purchase treasury bills equivalent to 200 percent of their customers’ bids for foreign exchange in the AFEM, and the increase in the liquid assets requirement from 30 percent of deposit liabilities to 40 percent, both in June) were inconsistent with these principles. The CBN explained that these were temporary measures taken under exceptional circumstances. As the pressure in foreign exchange market subsided, the CBN eliminated the requirement of treasury Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- bill backing for foreign exchange bids in three steps, and the remaining STBs will be redeemed by end-November 1999. 44. The authorities further indicated that the AFEM will be abolished in favor of an expanded interbank foreign exchange market, where the exchange rate will be market determined, and the CBN will be one of the principal participants. As a first step, effective October 25, (a) the CBN abrogated the requirement that the oil companies sell foreign exchange to the central bank to meet their local currency needs; (b) commercial banks were permitted to buy foreign exchange from the CBN on their own account, subject to a prudential limit on their net open position; and (c) the CBN began buying and selling foreign exchange at rates posted by the authorized dealing banks. As a next step, the authorities envisage allowing the oil companies to pay taxes and royalties in naira, and sell foreign exchange to banks for those payments. The necessary amendment to the tax law is expected to be submitted to the National Assembly by the end of 1999. Once this is completed, non- CBN supply of foreign exchange should be broadly sufficient to meet end-users’ needs, and the AFEM will be phased out completely. 45. Moreover, as a necessary complement of a market-based exchange rate system, the remaining restrictions on international current account transactions will be lifted. Effective October 22, 1999, tOhe limitations on profit remittances in respect of the investment made under the debt equity conversion scheme were abolished. In addition, shortly the CBN will formally lift the embargo of access to foreign exchange in the AFEM for exporters who have failed to repatriate proceeds of prior exports. Further, the CBN has abolished the requirement for banks to purchase treasury bills to back their customer’s bids for foreign exchange from the CBN. 46. With these measures, and once the AFEM has be phased out, Nigeria will no longer maintain: (a) a multiple currency practice, subject to the Fund’s approval under Article VIII, Section 3, (that had arisen from the coexistence of the AFEM and interbank rates); or (b) restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). The authorities indicated that they intend to accept the obligations under Article VIII shortly. 47. The staff welcomed these intentions, noting that the experience of the first five months of the year illustrated the futility of attempting to maintaining a fixed exchange rate in face of excessive government spending and monetary expansion. The staff underscored the critical importance of allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate. Under the new system, the CBNs intervention in the foreign exchange market should be limited and conducted so as to ensure that the targets for international reserves are met. 48. On this basis, the staff endorsed the authorities’ monetary program for the remainder of the year. The program calls for keeping reserve money unchanged at the end- July level through end-December 1999 (Tables 5 and 8). Net international reserves are programmed to be US$4.9 billion by end- 1999. The net domestic assets of the CBN are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- projected to remain flat over the period owing to a small reduction in net claims on government, consistent with the fiscal target, and open market sales of treasury bills by the CBN, as required (Table 5). 49. Provisional data indicate that the monetary program targets were met through end-September, except for the following. First, monthly external debt payments were below target since July for cumulative shortfall of US$293 million. Second, the end-September target on net international reserves was missed by US% 133 million (after adjusting for the shortfall in debt service and the higher-than-expected oil price), owing mainly to continued difficulties in collecting petroleum taxes from the joint venture companies. The authorities undertook to make up the shortfalls by the end ofNovember. 50. The staffunderscored, however, that in order to manage monetary policy proficiently using indirect instruments, and to ensure the satisfactory implementation of a monetary program under the possible Stand-By Arrangement, the quality and timeliness of monetary data will have to be improved substantially. At present, a full CBN balance sheet is reported with a lag of two to three months, and contains large unidentified items (the monetary program is monitored using “flash statistics”); CBN’s foreign exchange cash flows cannot readily be reconciled with changes in the stock of reserves; and the balance of payments for the last three years are constructed without customs data, direct information on private capital flows, or full accounting of oil-related flows. The CBN has informed the staff that these weaknesses, as well as others, are being addressed by a comprehensive reorganization and restructuring project led by an international consulting firm. 51. A sound banking system is also a pre-requisite for the maintenance of financial stability. A preliminary assessment indicated that prudential norms were largely compliant with the Basle Core Principles, and efforts are underway to achieve full compliance. The staff noted, however, that in practice many requirements were circumvented and supervisory gaps existed. The staff thus encouraged the authorities to complete the liquidation of the 16 remaining distressed banks by year’s end, to finther strengthen bank supervision, and to move forward in reducing the stress in the nonbank sector (Appendix VI). The authorities indicated that the CBN plans to close, or sell to investors, the 16 remaining distressed banks; increase the frequency of onsite inspections of banks; and require banks to submit their monthly returns with a lag of only two weeks. In addition, the CBN is developing a system to provide an early warning of bank distress; will establish a new department to supervise nonbank financial institutions; and will consider the use of private institutions to carry out on- and off-site inspections on its behalf 52. The authorities emphasized that, over the medium term, substantial strengthening of the financial system was also needed to mobilize domestic savings and improve the allocation of domestic resources. Financial transactions are predominantly in cash. The large spread between lending and deposit rates (about 10 percentage points) is another area of concern. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - F. Competitiveness and Trade Liberaiixation 53. The staff stressed that a key medium-term policy challenge was to avoid a persistent over-valuation of the exchange rate, which could leave the non-oil economy uncompetitive. For a brief period following the major devaluation of 1993, the naira was at a level competitive for manufacturing (for example, a 1996 World Bank study suggested that the competitiveness of Nigeria’s textile manufacturing was comparable to China’s, as Nigeria’s lower productivity was offset by its lower wages and a competitive exchange rate). Since then, however, Nigeria’s competitiveness has been eroded substantially by disproportionate increases in local costs and by the strong real appreciation of the naira (Figure 5). A market-determined exchange rate-together with the structural and fiscal policies discussed above-are essential to improve the competitive position of Nigerian producers. 54. Furthermore, the staff argued for a reduction of the high tariff rates and a more uniform tariff structure, as well as an early removal of the remaining import bans. Duties are often not paid (the ratio of collections to recorded imports is about 13 percent, compared with an average tariff estimated to be 24 percent), and a large volume of imports are smuggled. High tariffs and import bans therefore do not effectively protect the Nigerian industries, but rather fuel corruption and hurt honest business. The recent fall in the prices of a number of imported products largely reflects a depreciation of the currencies of the origin of imports vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, to which the naira has effectively been pegged. The rapid pace of trade liberalization in neighboring countries has also contributed to lower import prices. In the staffs view, a call for higher tariffs to protect jobs, widely heard in Nigeria, is difficult to support. 55. The authorities set out the main objectives of trade policy: economic development through export promotion, more trade through formal channels, and the facilitation of trade through the removal of trade barriers and liberalixation @30x 5). In line with this policy the staffurged the authorities to resist the pressure for higher tariffs in the 2000 budget and review the tariff structure during 2000 with a view to reducing tariffs, and harmonizing them with trading partners in the Economic Community of West &can States (ECOWAS) region. G. Deregulation and Privatixation 56. The authorities stressed that they are firmly committed to deregulation and privatixation. Thus, in October, the National Privatixation Council @PC), headed by the Vice-president, announced a three-stage privatixation program. In the first stage, government shares in eleven banks, cement companies, and oil marketing firms already listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange will be offered for sale by the end of 1999, with most of the sales to be completed by end-January 2000. The second stage will see the sale of all government holdings in hotels during the year 2000. The final stage, to be completed by end- 2001, will involve the privatization of the national power company (NEPA), the telecommunications companies (NITEL/MTEL), a fertilizer company (NAFCON), Nigerian Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-21- Airways, and the oil refineries. The World Bank has agreed to provide assistance for the privatization of the power and telecommunications companies, and the IFC has been retained to advise on the privatization ofNigerian Airways. According to the authorities, the three- stage program also takes account of the need to proceed prudently to ensure proper valuation and transparency in all asset sales, and to inject capital and rehabilitate some enterprises before offering them for sale in order to maximize the net sale price. 57. The staff stressed, however, that privatization of the public utilities alone would not reduce the high costs of doing business in Nigeria. It is first necessary to establish a regulatory framework, and a regulatory body, for each of the key sectors-power, telecommunications, petroleum products-and then to liberalize each of these activities. In this regard, the staff urged the authorities to complete the drawl electricity law, complete the regulatory framework for petroleum products, establish a new policy and legal framework for telecommunications, and strengthen the Nigerian Communications Commission. 58. The staff also stressed that, in order for Nigerian industries to become internationally competitive, it was absolutely essential to eliminate frequent interruptions in the supply of power, telecommunications, and petroleum products. The staff thus encouraged the authorities to complete privatization in these areas-as a first priority and without any delay-while ensuring full transparency and accountability in the process. During the course of 2000, the authorities should prepare for the restructuring of NEPA and bring NITEL/MTEL and the refineries to the point of sale. With some enterprises, including the oil refineries, it was unproductive to inject new resources prior to sale, as such investment would not result in a higher net return and would only cause further delay. The staff also recommended that the authorities carefully consider the possibility of selling a small part of government equity in the oil joint venture companies and directing these proceeds into other assets that could facilitate the economic development of the country, as well as a resolution of the problems of the Niger Delta. H. Governance and Institution Building 59. A consensus has now emerged in Nigeria that corruption is the single most important factor responsible for economic decline, and the authorities have vigorously pursued policies to combat corruption and ensure good governance. The staff wholeheartedly welcomed the authorities’ determination. It noted that, given the enormity of the task, even with such strong conviction, it would take time before the objectives were realized. The authorities must sustain their efforts, and persevere in pursuing each initiative to its conclusion. 60. Accordingly, the investigations into financial malfeasance of previous administrations should be completed by end-December, as scheduled, and the main findings published. The statutory external audit of the financial accounts of the NNPC must be brought up to date by end-November, and its management audit conducted swiftly with assistance of the World Bank. The external audit of the central bank’s foreign exchange operations in 1998 and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - January - May 1999 must also be completed by end-November, and its management audit thereafter. In addition, monthly publication of key financial data of the CBN and the NNPC is expected to commence by December. 61. The authorities informed the mission that the government is actively pursuing stolen funds which have been deposited abroad. In response, the Swiss authorities recently froze the accounts of the family and associates of General Abacha. The authorities requested Fund assistance in repatriating misappropriated public funds from foreign financial institutions. The stti indicated that although the Fund did not have the mandate to be directly involved, it would encourage member countries to provide maximum cooperation. 62. The staff noted that the anticorruption campaign should be the responsibility of all branches of the government. Judicial reform will be essential for building confidence in the security of property rights and in the enforcement of contracts and the rule of law. The number of judges and other judicial personnel is grossly insufficient,3 and they are underpaid. The number of courts should be expanded and their facilities upgraded. The National Assembly is expected to enact the Anti-Corruption Bill by end-November, after amending the p’resent draft to assure the independence of the Anti-Corruption Commission and to f%lly protect privacy and human rights. 63. The authorities stressed that a professional, results-oriented civil service was an essential prerequisite of good governance. They indicated that a service-wide civil service reform will be launched, that would include (a) “right-sizing” the federal civil service (162,000 employees at present); (b) substantially raising civil service salaries; (c) strengthening the provision of statistics and other information; and (d) installing a computerized information system that will provide government officials with key economic data on a timely basis. The staff concurred that such a service-wide reform-with a strong capacity-building component-is essential, and that it should be expanded to include the state and local government civil service. Substantial technical assistance is being offered by the Fund staff, the World Bank, UNDP, and other bilateral and multilateral agencies. 64. Nigeria’s macroeconomic statistics suffer from many serious deficiencies that impede timely and accurate monitoring both of economic developments and program implementation. A multisector statistics mission conducted an in-depth assessment of the macroeconomic database, including the legal framework, inter-agency coordination, adequacy of resources, and data dissemination. An action plan to address the data weaknesses was agreed with the authorities. The mission stressed that the authorities would need to take some basic institutional actions, provide more resources and improve the working environment of the Federal Offrice of Statistics so as to maximize the effectiveness of technical assistance. 3 For example, in Lagos state in 1996 there were only 3 1 judges to deal with the 4,000 civil suits filed each year. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - I. External Financing and Debt 65. Nigeria’s outstanding external public debt is provisionally estimated at US$28.3 billion at end-1998, equivalent to 94 percent of GDP or 283 percent of exports of goods and non- factor services (Table 1 1).4 More than 70 percent of the outstanding debt ($20.4 billion) is owed to the official creditors of the Paris Club. Debt owed to the multilateral institutions and commercial banks is relatively smaI1, estimated at $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Most of the outstanding debt is in arrears (US$l8.5 billion), which consist of U$18.4 billion to the Paris Club creditors and US$74 million to a multilateral creditor. Scheduled debt service payments in 1998 amounted to US$4.2 billion or 40.4 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services; actual payments were limited to US$1.3 billion or 12.9 percent of exports (Table 13). 66. Since beginning an intensive dialogue with the authorities last November, the staff has consistently stressed the need for Nigeria to improve its relations with the Paris Club, by establishing a track record of payments and policy performance. The sttithus proposed, and the previous administration agreed, to include minimum debt payments as a monthly performance benchmark under the SMP, and subsequently this benchmark has been agreed as a prior action for the possible Stand-By Arrangement with the present administration. For 1999, the minimum payments were programmed to be US$l.8 billion (15.5 per cent of exports), sufficient to settle arrears with one multilateral creditor; remain current with all multilateral creditors; to service post-cutoff-date maturities to Paris Club creditors, to reduce post-cutoff-date debt arrears, make small payments on pre-cutoff-date arrears to those creditors who do not have post-cutoff-date claims; and to remain current with commercial creditors (Tablel2). Under the SMP, during January-May, the targets on debt payments were met. Since June, however, debt service payments have fallen substantially short of the program targets. 67. The Paris Club has indicated its willingness to consider rescheduling Nigeria’s debt on nonconcessional terms in the context of a possible one-year Stand-By Arrangement, provided that the Paris Club creditors receive-before the rescheduling-payments that they consider satisfactory. The creditors have yet to decide the size of the payment that they would require. 68. Even with such a Paris Club rescheduling, the staffs projections indicate that a large financing gap would persist over the medium-term, and the debt would remain heavy. For example, if the rescheduling terms were similar to those recently extended to middle income countries (3-year grace, plus 15 years repayment, with a graduated repayment schedule), the external current account balance (excluding interest due) is projected to turn 4 This estimate may not fully reflect late interest payments due to Paris Club creditors, as well as some loans guaranteed by the government. A more accurate estimate is expected to be available shortly as a result of technical assistance, extended by a bilateral aid agency. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - from a deficit of US$Z. 1 billion in 1999 to a surplus of US$O.6 billion in 2000 (due to the sharp increase in the oil price), and then return to a deficit (with the fall of oil price), forecast to increase to’US$Z. 1 billion in 2005 (Table 6). Actual debt service payments would increase from US$l.8 billion in 1999 to US$3.4 billion in 2000 to US$4.2 billion in 2005. Taken with capital inflows (mostly private) projected to increase substantially, as well as the financing needed to raise gross international reserves from an estimated US$4.9 billion (4,l months of imports) to US$8.4 billion (5 months of imports) by 2005, the external financing gap is projected to rise from US$1.3 billion in 2000 to US$2.7 billion by 2005. The public debt outstanding would remain in the range of 150-200 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services over the repayment period, and public debt service ratio would rise from 21 percent in 2000 to around 35 percent towards the end of the repayment period. These projections do not take account of private debt, which is assumed to accumulate substantially. 69. If the authorities adopt a more aggressive reform strategy, the balance of payments would be stronger. On the other hand, if the oil price was lower than currently projected much of the gains from the faster adjustment would be offset. 70. The authorities believe strongly that debt forgiveness is crucial to free up resources for basic social programs. In their view, creditors must understand the urgency of addressing the deplorable social conditions in Nigeria and allow the government to intensify its efforts to expand primary education, preventive health care, and rural infrastructure, all of which are essential for alleviating poverty. VL STAFFAPPRAISAL 71. Nigeria is making a new beginning. Since assuming office at the end of May 1999, President Obasanjo has taken a number of bold initiatives to combat corruption, restore human rights, re-introduce discipline in public service, and avoid macroeconomic instability. The new administration has given hope that things may finally turn for the better in Nigeria. 72. Yet it will not be easy to translate this hope into tangible gains in the form of reduced poverty, higher employment, and a safer living environment. Public institutions, essential for the smooth functioning of a market economy and the effective delivery of social services, have been shattered during the period of military rule. Nigeria’s economy, although blessed with vibrant entrepreneurship, is severely handicapped by high costs of doing business arising from dysfunctional infrastructure, overregulation, corruption, the absence of the rule of law, and the legacy of the economic strategy of the last 30 years. 73. Moreover, Nigeria’s external payments position is weak. Because of the structure of the oil sector, about half of oil export receipts are accounted for in imported inputs or profit remittances. Similarly, natural gas exports will not provide significant revenue for many years. Non-oil exports are only a fraction of production, while Nigeria depends heavily on imports. Over the medium term, imports will have to grow if the economy is to modernize and expand Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - rapidly. But oil exports, limited by the OPEC quota, are unlikely to keep pace. In addition, the burden of external debt is heavy. 74. Analysis in the World Bank’s poverty assessment indicates that Nigeria must grow at 7-8 percent a year to reduce deep and pervasive poverty. A comprehensive and bold economic reconstruction program must therefore be adopted. The reform agenda should be selective and properly sequenced. In the staffs view, the key elements are the following: 75. First, fiscal prudence. The authorities’ policy to achieve a small fiscal surplus for the period June-December 1999 is appropriate, and this overall fiscal stance should be broadly maintained in 2000, so as to keep the overall deficit at about 1 percent of GDP. Sizable increases in civil service wages appear warranted to establish a “living wage,” and to reduce susceptibility to corruption, but must be accompanied by close scrutiny of the payroll and a major move toward “right-sizing” the civil service. The federal government’s spending on basic social services may have to be increased (until the capacities of the state and local governments are sufficiently enhanced for them to shoulder this responsibility), while other capital outlays will have to be further cut. The petroleum subsidy should be phased out during 2000, with a substantial up-front adjustment. The financial arrangements in the oil and gas sectors should be reviewed to increase the gains accruing to the country, more domestic revenue mobilized, and customs duties lowered. 76. Second, cautious monetary policy and a market-determined exchange rate. The monetary program for June-December 1999 is appropriately tight. Following its full implementation, the authorities could consider a judicious easing of monetary conditions as interest rates are currently high in real terms. The shiR to a market-based exchange rate system must be completed swiftly by allowing the oil companies to sell foreign exchange for their tax payments to commercial and merchant banks, and by the official acceptance of fluctuations in the exchange rate. 77. Third, good governance. President Obasanjo has said “we have taken concrete measures to safeguard life and property. We will defeat crime and enhance security...we shall promote and enhance the rule of law and give all residents in Nigeria a sense of dignity and self-respect.” The staff welcomes the authorities’ strong commitment. It urges them to persist, for it will take some time before the desired changes in the way of life take root. For the immediate period ahead, a truly independent Anti-Corruption Commission should be established with a person of the highest repute as its Director. The ongoing investigation of past financial malfeasance should be completed by December, and its major findings published. Finally, the staff calls on the international community and the Fund’s members to assist Nigeria in its quest, including the recovery of misappropriated public funds. 78. Fourth, rebuilding of public institutions in all three branches of the government, as well as at all tiers of the executive branch. This involves: (a) training; (b) increasing pay for those that qualify, and removing those who do not; (c) carefully sequencing the establishment of fiscal federalism, with the federal government confined to truly national activities, and state Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26- and local governments assuming the primary responsibility for the provision of basic social services; (d) “right-sizing” the public service, which entails a substantial reduction of the federal civil service and an increase in the police force and the judiciary; and (e) providing necessary facilities and equipment, including for the National Assembly. 79. Fifth, well-targeted, efficiently run social programs must be implemented. This requires, first and foremost, institutional-building, particularly at state and local levels to ensure that well-designed poverty programs can be effectively delivered. The establishment of effective fiscal federalism, coupled with community-driven anti-poverty programs, will help ease social tensions, especially in the Niger Delta. 80. Sixth, de-regulation, and privatization. A clear regulatory framework needs to be established urgently to ensure fair competition, particularly for the telecommunications and power sectors. The administration of the regulatory framework needs to be transparent and fair. Simplicity in the regulations and the tax codes, with the elimination of discretion and exemptions, will significantly improve the quality of governance. The establishment of the “rules of the game” is a prerequisite for any market economy, and will also lay the foundation for successful privatization. The staff broadly supports the authorities’ three stage privatization program, but underscores the critical importance of the speedy privatization of power, telecommunications, and oil refineries. In general, privatization should not wait for the completion of rehabilitation, because there is not a priori reason to believe that the government can accomplish the task more efficiently than private investors. 81. Finally, trade liberalization. Import bans on the few remaining items should be removed, and the structure of import duty rationalized to provide an essentially uniform and low tariff structure with no exemptions. High tariff rates are ineffective because they are evaded; attempts to sustain high effective protection merely nurtures inefficiency; and exemptions fuel corruption. A comprehensive review of the tar-8 situation should be conducted, with a view to introducing its main findings in the 2001 budget. 82. The staff is heartened that the authorities share this vision of fundamental reforms. Over the next several months, the authorities should develop a medium-term reconstruction program, with full participation of the National Assembly, private business, the labor movement, local governments, and, importantly, others who represent interests of the poor and the disadvantaged. Without strong public support, fundamental reforms are unlikely to succeed. 83. The staffwelcomes the authorities’ intention to request a one year Stand-By Arrangement as an interim step to a medium-term Fund arrangement, which they hope will immediately follow the Stand-By Arrangement. The performance benchmarks established by the authorities and the staff, if implemented fully, are sufficient as prior actions for the Stand- By Arrangement. If (a) these prior actions are met, including the payment of minimum debt service; (b) a strong economic program for 2000 is adopted; and (c) adequate financing Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-27- assurances are obtained, the staff would present Nigeria’s request for the Stand-By Arrangement in late January 2000. 84. The stti welcomes the authorities’ intention to remove shortly the remaining exchange restrictions on current international transactions, as well as the multiple currency practice, and to accept the obligations under the Article VIII at the time of their request for the Stand-By Arrangement. 85. The authorities firmly believe that health-care, education, safe water and other basic social services cannot be adequately provided for unless external debt is reduced. They believe that this is in the interest of the international community, for stability and prosperity in Nigeria will contribute substantially towards Ming all Africa out of poverty. The Paris Club has indicated that it will consider a nonconcessional rescheduling ofNigeria’s debt in the context of a possible Stand-By Arrangement. This position is in light of the experience of an uneven track-record on policy performance and payments over the last 12 months. The staffs medium-term projections indicate, however, that if the outstanding debt to Paris Club creditors continues to be rescheduled on nonconcessional terms over the medium term, the stock of debt will remain high, and the debt service ratio will rise to a level even higher than at present. 86. The staff is of the view that the new democratic government in Nigeria offers the hope of a new beginning, and that this hope justifies swift support. The staRis aware that many observers are of the view that “the jury is still out.” Substantial risks remain, not least of which come from the inadequate institutional capacity and deficient economic data that impede timely and accurate monitoring both of economic developments and program implementation. Nevertheless, the actions taken by the new administration and its request for comprehensive technical assistance, offers assurances that, in the context of the Stand-By Arrangement, and then a medium-term arrangement, the authorities could quickly establish a credible track record that would provide a secure basis for more substantial support from the international community, donors, the financial markets, and the Paris Club. Far-reaching reform will gather support on its own merits. 87. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions with Nigeria be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

A recent “poverty profile for Nigeria”, prepared by the Federal Oflice of Statistics and based on survey data, calculates that the proportion of the population below a given poverty line increased from 43 percent in 1992 to 66 percent (about 67 million people) in 19%. The study also identified a group of the “core poor” who had accounted for only 14 percent of the population in 1992, but 29 percent (about 30 million people) in 1996. While poverty increased across rural and urban areas between 1992 and 1996, poverty remains worse in rural areas. Though all regions share in poverty in Nigeria, the highest incidence is in the northwest (the states of Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi and Sokoto). The World Bank’s 1999 World Developmek Indicators confirm that Nigeria is poorer than the average sub&&ran African country, but other indicators are in line with the continental average (see Appendix Iv). Nigeria sub-Saharan Africa GNP capital (US%, 1998) per 310 510 Life expectancy at birth (years) 54 51 Infant mortality (per 1000) 77 91 Access to safe water (percent of population) 50 47 Illiteracy Pate (adult total, percent over 15 years old) 40 43 Source: Worldfkveiopment Indicators, The World Bank, 1999. Poverty has worsened in ruml areas-where most Nigerians live-because economic policy has severely damaged livelihoods in agriculture. In addition, those living in rural areas, especially the poor, do not receive reliable publicly provided social services, Poverty has worsened in urban areas as the stagnant and inefficient modem sector has failed to supply jobs. But part of the explanation also lies in the failure of initiatives intended to reduce poverty directly (Box 6).

Nigeria: The Niger Delta The bulk of Nigeria’s crude oil is produced and exported from the nine states that make up the Niger Delta (Abia, Akwa Ibon, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Jmo, Ondo and Rivers State). The geographical terrain of the Niger Delta is very complex, with numerous creeks, waterways and rivers separating several small communities. Fishing remains the main occupation of the inhabitants of the delta, and settlements are small and scattered. Since independence, the Constitution has mandated that .a certain portion of oil revenues be allocated to the Niger Delta, but it remains severely underdeveloped. With the exception of a few congested urban areas, most communities lack basic amenities, such as potable water, electricity, and transportation infmstmcture. Past federal administrations deprived the Niger Delta states their constitutionally mandated share of oil revenue through various devices. Moreover, their interventions to develop the Nigeria Delta (such as the Oil and Mineral Producing Area Development Commission, OMPADEC) was largely ineffective, because of mismanagement of finds. Numerous agencies, such as the Niger Delta Environmental Survey @DES), OMPADEC, the Petroleum Special Trust Fund, State governments, and federal ministries operated simukaneously but inefliciently as there were parallel authorities with duplicated roles and functions. The result has been that although substantial amounts have been allocated for investment in the Niger Delta (e.g, for road constmction, canals, land reclamation, electrification, water supply, health care delivery, and education), there has been very little to show for it in terms of tangible results. The environment, particularly the soils and rivers of the delta, have been seriously polluted because the safeguards against oil spills in drilling and transportation of oil have been inadequate. The inhabitants have therefore been deprived of income from traditional fishing and farming. Moreover, the contrast between the afnuence enjoyed by oil company employees with local deprivation has contributed to the escalation of communal disputes, and the disruption and sabotage of oil installations and production. During the final days of the Abubakar administration, a Presidential Committee on Development Options for the Niger Delta was commissioned to carry out an inventory of all the ongoing developmental efforts in the Niger Delta and make recommendations on how best to proceed. The committee recommended to . establish a consultative council consisting of indigenes and non-indigenes of the Niger Delta to commission a draft plan for the resolution of the problems; articulate a Niger Delta Development Plan; prioritize the provision of electricity and potable water in the communities of the Niger Delta; connect areas to the national grid that are not presently supplied with adequate electricity; embark on the construction of canals and waterways; construct trunk roads to link the principal urban centers within the Niger Delta; establish and equip vocational training centers to enable the gainful employment of youths in the area; study the viability of developing new towns with all basic amenities; and reconstitute the board of OMPADEC with Nigerians of transparent honesty and integrity who are committed to the development of the Niger Delta. The Obasanjo administration has placed the Niger Delta at the top of its agenda for action. Jn July, it submitted legislation to the National Assembly addressing the development concerns of the Niger Delta. The bill calls for the establislunent of a new commission in place of OMPADEC to use part of the allocation of funds from the federation account to address ecological problems arising from oil exploration in the Niger Delta by developing the region and assisting the states in the formulation and implementation of their development programs for development. Opposition to the bill calls for a more community-based solution. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - Box 3. Nigeria and Indonesia: Relative Economic Performance, 1970-97. In the l%Os, both Nigeria and Indonesia were large, agrarian economies with oil. Following the oil price boom of the 197Os, the policies chosen by each country differed with, over the long-run, sharply contrasting results. A summary of economic and social indicators for the two countries shows that Nigeria’s GNP per capita is essentially unchanged, while in Indonesia GNP per capita in 1997 was over four times higher than in 1970. The same pattern is evident in private consumption per capita A comparison of agriculture and manufactufing shows that value added per capita in agkukore in Nigeria has declined, while that in Indonesia has grown. While value added per capita in manirfkkng in Nigeria has grown by about one-third, in Indonesia it has grown to thhteen times the level of 1970. The contrast in economic progress is also m&ted in social indicators. Infhnt mortality in Nigeria in 1997 was 55 percent of the level in 1970; in Indonesia, the equivalent statistic is 40 percent. Between 1970 and 1997, illiteracy was halved in Nigeria, but in 1997 it was just one-third of the level in 1970 in Indonesia Gross primary school enrollment rates have increased in both countries, but in Indonesia female enrollment is much closer to male enrollment 1970 1997 Nigeria Indonesia Nigeria Indonesia Population (millions) GNP per capita (1995 U.S. dollars) Private consumption per capita (1995 US dollars) Agriculture value-added per capita (index of 1995 U.S. dollars, 1970=100) Manufacturing, value-added per capita (index of 1995 U.S. dollars, 1970=100) Infant mortality mte (per 1000 live births) Illiteracy rate, adult total (percent of people aged 15 and above) Gross primary enrollmem (percent age-group) Ofwhich: female Source: WorMDewlopmenrlndicators, ‘lb World JhkJ999. 53 118 236 298 239 194 100 100 139 118 80 44 37 80 27 73 100 100 118 200 239 1096 214 788 69 154 135 1359 77 47 40 15 98 115 86 112 In Indonesia, economic policy focussed on promoting international competitiveness, including a liberal trade regime and an open capital account, and growth in the non-oil economy; the oil windfall was a problem that required careful management.

Nigeria: A Summary of the Trade Regime A seven-year customs and excise tariff was introduced in 1995 for the period 1995-2001. It comprises 5,147 tariff lines; and only uses ad valorem tariffs, with no variable or seasonal duties. The duty consists of l the customs duty; l a surcharge of 7 percent on the duty payable; l the Sugar Levy of 5 percent applied to the c.i.f. value of sugar imports; and l the National Automotive Council tax of 2 percent levied on the c.i.f. value of imported vehicles and parts. The customs tariffs range from 0 percent to 150 percent. The average tarEis 24 percent, reduced fkom 33 percent under the previous customs and excise tariff. The most frequently applied rates are 10 percent (applied to 26 percent of lines), 5 percent (applied to 13 percent of lines), 45 percent (12 percent of lines) and 15 percent and 30 percent (both applied to 8 percent of lines). About 375 items, or 10 percent of lines, are subject to import duties exceeding 50 percent. Less than 30 lines are free of duty. Several tmde restrictions, such as licensing, compulsory advance deposits for imports, and import bans were introduced in 1982,1986, and 1994, but have now been almost entirely eliminated. The introduction of the 1995-2001 customs and excise tarifF represented a modest trade liberalization, as it reduced the average tariff, the dispersion and number of rates, and lowered some tarit% on consumer goods while increasing those on raw materials. Nigeria currently has a ranking of 7 out of 10 on the trade restrictiveness index (10 indicates maximum restrictions).

Nigeria: Poverty Alleviation Programs The World Bank is conducting an ongoing review of poverty-reduction progmms. The prehminary findings include the following: l Targeting. The few projects that achieved objectives such as raising income or achieving agricultural or social development generahy did not succeed in reaching the poorest or most vulnerable in rural society. l Organizational structure. Projects directly managed by public agencies are slow, with a bureaucratic decision-making process and minimal participation of the potential beneficiaries in the design and implementation of projects. Nongovernmental Grganizations (NGGs), in general have a simple and relatively well-managed organiMionaI structure that tends to involve potential beneficiaries and local communities. But, in general, their capacity to design implement, and monitor projects is limited. l Cost effectiveness and sustainability of the programs. There is insu&ient information on the cost- effectiveness of projects. However, a survey of beneficiaries indicates that NGG-or private sector-run projects tend to be more costeffective. Sustainability remain a major problem as the nature and the level of funding from external donor agencies and the government are far from certain. This is partly the result of a lack of a poverty-reduction strategy at the national and state levels that could enable funding agencies to commit resources over the medium term. Family Economic Advancement Program (FEAP) The FEAP is the largest program aimed at poverty reduction that is administered at the Federal level. It was established in 1997 to provide subsidized, supenised credit. During the period 1997-98, the FEAP bad an anmiaI budget of #9 billion, though disbursements amounted only to H 1.7 billion. Under the program, credits are provided to cooperatives-and only cooperatives-through six participating banks, which also share part of the default risk (25 percent). Once a loan is approved, the beneficiary cooperative buys the equipment needed to start the business from designated suppliers, who receive the payment directly from the banks. It takes au average of four months to review an application for a loan, which average t#145,000. In its recent reviewed of the FE?@, the World Bank found that it did not achieve its objectives and suITered from a number of problems: l The FEAP lacks a clearly defined primary objective: it is not clear whether it’s top priority is targeted poverty reduction, support the small enterprise sector, or to provide credit for community needs . It exercises control from above in designing and implementing projects, as it tried to identify the raw materials endowment and, hence, what it considered to be the viable projects in each ward. l This centralization, and concomitant bureaucracy, has led to high administrative costs (about 30-40 percent of total approved credit). l As a result of the “top-down” approach, the FEL4P has been unable to secure the participation of local communities in the administration of the program. l The process used to vet loan applications and decide loan amounts is arbitrary, is not transparent, and not discussed with the potential beneficiary. l The evidence is that there has been little success with cooperatives located in the poorest communities, as these have formed simply to access the available credit, and lack the capacity to initiate, implement, and monitor projects. l There is little information on the performance of projects, the repayment profile, and the impact on the intended beneficiaries-either the poor or the suppliers of equipment Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - Figure 1.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: Nigeria’s current exchange rate arrangement can be classified as a managed float with no preannounced target for the exchange rate of the naira. In January 1995, the authorities introduced a multiple exchange rate system, with an official exchange rate of W22 per US%1 that applied to official government transactions and a market-related autonomous foreign exchange market (AFEM) rate that applied to most other transactions. By early 1998, all Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-51- private sector transactions drawing on official foreign exchange and a large part of official government transactions took place at the AFEM rate. The official exchange rate was abolished effective January 1, 1999. Currently, in addition to the AFEM rate, there are three other foreign exchange rates: the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) rate, the bureau de change rate, and the parallel market rate, The central bank sets the AFEM rate, which applies to its weekly provision of foreign exchange to end-users through banks and to some other transactions, with reference to the interbank rate and the parallel market rate. Therefore, even though prevailing regulations give rise to an artificial segmentation of the exchange markets, the rates on these markets are highly correlated. Average exchange rates during the first three weeks of September 1999 were as follows: AFEM rate W 94.88 per U.S. dollar Local currency&DR equivalent N 131.9 per SDR IFEM rate W 96.11 per U.S. dollar Bureau de change rate W 101.08 per U.S. dollar Parallel market rate W 100.94 per U.S. dollar VIII. Article IV Consultation and SMP Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Lagos and Abuja during the period March 3- 19, and May 6-8 1998. The stti report (W/98/1 12, 5/22/98) was discussed by the Executive Board and the consultation concluded on June 12, 1998. Negotiations on the staff- monitored program (SMP), which covers the period January 1 - December 1999, were completed in January 1999 and discussed in an informal meeting of the Executive Board on February 25,1999.

Since the World Bank’s first lending operation in Nigeria in 1958, a total amount of US$6,079 million of IBRD and IDA resources (net of cancellations) has been committed to 98 operations in the country. Fourteen of these were IDA credits (totaling US%797 million), of which five were fully disbursed (one, however, was canceled, with substantial disbursements remaining; the other four totaled US!! 159 million). Total disbursements of IBRD loans and IDA credits as of March 30, 1998 amounted to US$5,757 million, leaving an undisbursed balance of US$323 million. Bank operations in Nigeria have included projects in agriculture and the environment (accounting for 30.1 percent of total IBRD/IDA commitments), industry and telecommunications (14.8 percent), power (6.5 percent), transport (10.3 percent), urban infrastructure/water supply (15.1 percent), education, health, and population (9.1 percent), and technical assistance (0.2 percent).Two structural adjustment loans were responsible for 13.2 percent of total IBID/IDA resources committed to Nigeria. IFC loans and equity investments since 1964 have amounted to US$192 million (including project approvals as of end-1997). 89. Between 1985 and 1991, the Bank’s annual average lending program was US$600 million. For the fiscal years 1992-96, it averaged US$90 million. No new operations have been approved since 1993. Since Nigeria was declared IDA eligible in 1988, support from IDA rose from less than 10 percent of total commitments in fiscal year 1989 to 50 percent in FY 1992, and to 100 percent in 1993. 90. Nonlending services have continued to play a role in the World Bank’s policy dialogue with the Nigerian authorities. Recent examples include the federal public expenditure review, the poverty assessment, and several workshops on issues such as capacity building, urban growth, national household surveys, and water supply. The World Bank has also provided technical assistance in support of the government’s medium-term economic framework, its privatization program, and its “Vision 2010” program. 91. The IFC, in a period of reengagement, is providing advisory services on infrastructure privatization, including on Nigeria Airways. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is currently undertaking a technical needs assessment of Nigeria’s Investment Promotion Commission, to serve as a basis for subsequent advisory services and activities.

Nigeria’s statistical base continues to suffer from serious weaknesses, particularly with respect to the national accounts, government finance, and the external accounts, including debt. Numerous problems prevent the compilation of timely, accurate, and internally consistent data, in particular inadequate budgetary resources and insufficient used of computerization in the compilation of statistics. These problems are well known to Fund staBand to the authorities, and have been the focus of recent technical assistance exercises carried out by FAD, STA, and AFR. National accounts 93. Annual national accounts data are published by the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) with about a year’s lag. The national accounts statistics are of poor quality, largely due to a deterioration in business and household surveys. Estimates of value added for agriculture, mining (oil), industry, transportation, and financial and other services are based on old surveys with extrapolations that used out-of-date ratios and other indicators. Many sectoral deflators are not soundly based and have a number of inconsistencies. In the past, the use of the official exchange rate has resulted in a gross understatement of value added in the oil and export sectors. The expenditure accounts suffer from unreliable external trade and government budgetary data. Imports and government expenditure are significantly understated, which biases estimates of private consumption. Prices 94. The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is a composite of urban and rural price data, and the consumption weights are based on the 1985/86 National Consumer Survey. The delays in reporting the CPI data now amount to about two months. Some data on producer prices are collected, but these statistics are not comprehensive and no producer price index is compiled. As a consequence, some sectoral GDP deflator indices are based not on producer prices, but on consumer price subindices and ad hoc assumptions. The expenditure deflators also suffer from methodological shortcomings. Government finance 95. Nigeria has not reported government finance statistics (GFS) data to STA for many years. A GFS technical assistance mission visited Abuja in June 1997 and noted that, while revenue was recorded on a cash basis, spending was compiled on the basis of warrants released (not actual cash payments). The mission was unable to compile data for financing from the government accounts, and, hence, government finance statistics are not reconciled with the available data on government financing from the central bank. 96. Fiscal data in Nigeria have historically been opaque and complicated not only by the federal structure, but also by a multiplicity of off-budget fi.mds and accounting practices that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - APPENDIX III underestimate the actual size of public expenditure. The multisector statistics mission that visited Nigeria during September 6-2 1, 1999 noted that most pressing shortcomings relate to inadequate data coverage, the lack of monthly and quarterly compilation, and timeliness. The mission recommended that fiscal data include operations financed with earmarked oil revenue (“First Charges”) and several off-budget special funds. The mission also recommended procedures for the compilation of the economic classification of expenditure on a cash basis for the federal, state, and local governments (on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis). These developments will allow the compilation of improved monthly, quarterly and annual GFS, the reconciliation of the fiscal balance and its financing with the CBN, and better reporting to AFR and STA. Monetary accounts 97. The authorities have taken steps toward implementing the key recommendations of past STA money and banking technical assistance missions. Problems remain however, regarding the consolidation of central bank branch data with those of the main office, the reconciliation of the central bank’s data on its net foreign asset position with that of the correspondent banks, and the identification and classification of certain government accounts held in the commercial and merchant banks. As a result, monetary data are provided to the Fund with a lag of about three- four months. The recent STA exploratory mission identified further measures and actions to be taken for improving the timeliness and quality of monetary data. Balance of payments 98. The balance of payments statistics are compiled from the foreign exchange records in the banking system and from data derived from surveys. However, all oil sector data are weakened by the low response rate to survey requests from oil businesses. For example, the statistics reported on imports of goods and services relating to oil sector operations are based on some historical ratios relating imports to production. In the non-oil sectors, only enterprises with foreign capital participation are surveyed. The estimates of non-oil imports of goods and services are based on banking data. Private capital movements are under-recorded, and data on external debt service are inaccurate. Moreover, the trade data reported by the FOS (based on customs data) sharply differ from those reported by the Central Bank of Nigeria (based on banking data). External debt 99. Despite the authorities’ recent effort to reconcile their external debt data with Paris Club creditors, significant differences remain, essentially because the fundamental loan-by-loan data remain incomplete. Data on stocks are not consistent with the data on disbursements, debt service due, debt service paid, arrears, and late or penalty interest. The inadequate data on exchange rates prevent the conversion of data into U.S. dollars from the original currency. To address these problems, a technical assistance effort was launched with the support of the U.K. Department for International Development in October 1998.

The balance of payments projections are based on the following assumptions: l the exchange rate remains constant in real terms; l the international market price for Nigerian grade crude oil averages about US$18 per barrel; l Nigeria’s share in OPEC production would be maintained at about the current level; l the absence of a comprehensive policy program, resulting in a gradual shift to market-based reforms over the medium-term; l export operations of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas project would begin in autumn 1999; l international reserves would increase to the equivalent of five months of imports in 2001 and remain constant thereafter; l the stock of outstanding arrears on pre-cutoff-date debt at end-1999 and current maturities to the Paris Club are assumed to be rescheduled on nonconcessional terms, with graduated repayment scheme (similar to those in recent reschedulings for middle income countries by the Paris Club) and amortization to begin in 2003. 101. With the price of oil projected at US$20 per barrel (WE0 projections) for the year 2000, the current account deficit is expected to fall to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2000 from over 12 percent in 1999 (the latter reflects high public sector imports resulting from extrabudgetary spending in the first half of the year). With the medium term price of oil declining to US%18 per barrel, the current account deficit is expected to remain around 9 percent of GDP. While imports are expected to grow in line with GDP, oil export growth (which constitutes about 90 percent of exports) is constrained both by world demand for oil and increasing domestic consumption of oil as the economy grows. The projected current account deficits also reflect large interest payments of about US%2 billion a year. 102. Maintaining a conservative assumption on official disbursements, while assuming a doubling of non-oil-related direct investment and private sector borrowing averaging US$700- US$SOO per year, the capital account is expected to be in surplus despite substantial amortization payments. However, combined with the large current account deficit and assuming that reserves will be maintained at five months of imports, the external financing gap is expected to remain around US%2 billion from 2001-2004, widening to US$2.8 billion in 2005. 103. The projected evolution of the current account and the financing gap reflect the structure of the oil and gas sectors in Nigeria. As a result of the provisions of the memorandum of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59- APPENDIX V understanding, a considerable proportion of oil export earnings are accounted for by offsetting imported inputs for production and investment and profit repatriation. With respect to the gas sector, the agreement between the government and the foreign companies allows all the export proceeds to be reinvested (reflected as imports of mainly capital-intensive equipment for this sector) and the companies have negotiated a ten year tax holiday. In the past, Nigeria has often met any imbalance between foreign exchange receipts and payments through the accumulation of arrears, which has led to a rapidly growing stock of debt even though no new borrowing has been initiated since 1995. 104. As noted, the projections assume only a gradual shift to market-based reforms over the medium term., In particular, the pace of the privatization program with regard to power, telecommunications, and other critical infrastructure is assumed to be slow, despite the urgent need to remove structural bottlenecks which impede investment and economic growth. Similarly, rationalization of the country’s tariff structure is assumed to proceed slowly, despite the need to improve Nigeria’s competitiveness. However, it is assumed that the authorities maintain a market- based exchange rate policy throughout the medium term. 105. It is also assumed that, beginning in 2000, the oil-producing regions will receive 13 percent of federation account revenues (i.e., an additional 9 percent) in line with the provisions of the new constitution, and that the federal government’s share will decline from 48.5 percent to 39.5 percent. The consolidated government primary balance would average the equivalent of 6 percent of GDP during 2000-05. Given the fiscal stance, monetary policy is assumed to be sufficiently conservative to lower inflation gradually from 12 percent in 1999 to about 5 percent over the medium-term. It is also assumed that the nominal exchange rate would depreciate in line with the differential between domestic and world inflation rates and, hence, that the real exchange rate would remain constant throughout the medium-term.

The financial system in Nigeria consists of 89 commercial and merchant banks, and numerous community banks, finance companies, primary mortgage institutions, development finance institutions, and discount houses. Although the financial system has been largely insulated from the recent adverse developments in world capital markets on account of existing restrictions on capital account transactions, it has nonetheless experienced substantial stress owing to poor management practices and inadequate banking supervision. While there has recently been substantial progress in addressing financial distress in commercial and merchant banks, the subsector remains fragile because of weak institutional capacity in bank supervision. In addition, the nonbank financial sector remains highly problematic on account of poor banking practices and inadequate supervision. Efforts are under way, however, to strengthen the supervision and oversight of the financial sector. Banking sector 107. The banking sector consists of 5 1 commercial banks and 38 merchant banks. This sector has been under substantial financial stress throughout the 1990s because of poor management practices, insufficient banking supervision, and an ineffective regulatory oversight that has been subject to political constraints. In 1995, there were 5 1 banks classified as in distress. Since then, substantial progress has been made in cleaning up the banking system. A total of 3 1 banks have been liquidated, and only 16 banks were classified as in distress as at end-June 1999. These 16 banks were to have been liquidated in 1998, but political considerations, combined with the lack of central bank autonomy, prevented this from occurring. 108. With the passage of a new amendment to the Central Bank Decree in May 1999, the central bank regained full autonomy to revoke banking licenses without the approval of the presidency and it has launched an effort to conclude the sanitization of the banking sector. In response to investor interest, 10 of the 16 distressed banks are to be sold, with the remaining 6 to be placed in liquidation by end-1999. The deposit insurance scheme managed by the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has fUnctioned reasonably well; it has been adequately fbnded to cover the insured deposits of the 1.7 million depositors of the liquidated banks, as well as those of the 6 remaining banks to be liquidated. Moreover, the enforcement of the 1994 Failed Banks Decree has resulted in the recovery of some H3.4 billion (about 10 percent) of loans from the liquidated banks, which, along with the sale of some fbl billion in liquidated assets, has allowed the NDIC to declare a liquidation dividend to these banks’ investors of some H3.8 billion to date. 109. As regards the supervision of the remaining banks, although the current set of regulatory rules and procedures seems largely in compliance with the 25 Core Principles of the Basle Committee on banking Supervision, many requirements are circumvented, and supervisory gaps exist on account of capacity constraints-in particular, too few bank supervisors with adequate training. As a result, the banking system remains fragile. Recent efforts have been undertaken to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61- APPENDIX VI strengthen the banks’ financial position, as well as the regulatory authorities’ capacity to supervise the banking system effectively: With effect from April 1999, banks are required to submit their monthly returns for the purposes of computing the cash reserve requirements and the liquidity and capital adequacy ratios by no later than the fourteenth day after the end of each reporting month. The cash reserve ratio was also adjusted from 8.0 percent to 10.0 percent in April 1999 and subsequently to 12 percent with effect from May 1999, and the minimum liquidity ratio was revised upward from 30 percent to 40 percent with effect from June 1999. In addition, all uncollateralized inter-bank placements, including money at call by banks have been reclassified as loans and no longer qualify as part of eligible assets for the purposes of meeting the statutory liquidity ratio requirement, meanwhile pledged treasury bills are henceforth to be deducted from the pledger to avoid double counting. The CBN and the NDIC have also jointly developed an automated Bank Analysis System (BAS), with a view to establishing an effective framework for assessing the financial condition of banks. Once operational, the BAS will allow more informed judgement by the CBN and NDIC on the financial condition of banks, as well as provide early warning signals such that weak financial institutions will receive closer supervisory attention, A Credit Risk Management System (Credit Bureau) has been established; it serves as an important resource for banks to assess the creditworthiness and indebtedness of potential borrowers. The benchmark for credits to be captured under this system was recently increased from #lOO,OOO to ?#l million, with a view to focusing on large credits. As at end-June 1999,24,875 borrowers’ codes had been issued while a total of 11,060 customers’ credit returns, with a total value of #157 billion were received from 86 banks and loaded into the database. A total of lo,43 1 credit requests had also been received. Nonban k financial sector 110. The nonbank financial sector consists of some 250 functioning community banks, over 279 finance companies, more than 161 primary mortgage institutions, 6 development banks, and 6 discount houses. The distress that has ravaged the community banking subsector has continued unabated. Trapped placements totaling some H500 million, as well as incompetent management, poor record keeping, insufficient assets to meet obligations, negative shareholders funding, and inadequate earnings persisted in most of the community banks. Of the 279 licensed finance companies as at end-June 1999, only 66 were considered to be healthy, while the remaining 213 were in distress or inoperative. While the supervisory authority of the 161 primary mortgage institutions was transferred from the Federal Mortgage Bank Board to the CBN in January 1998, the supervisory overlap between these two bodies has persisted, as the decrees regulating the activities of this subsector have yet to be amended. Moreover, the rendering of returns by these Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - APPFZNDIXVI institutions has been irregular and erratic. The supervisory authority over the development financial institutions has only recently been transferred to the CBN. As regards the discount houses, all 5 have made their statutory returns on a regular basis and have submitted their annual accounts for approval before publication. Moreover, the CBN management approved in 1999 an increase in the minimum paid-in capital of Discount Houses from WOO million to #200 million, as well as revised its guidelines. 111. At present, the CBN’s capacity to supervising this subsector is inadequate. In response, approval was given on March 24, 1999 for the establishment of an Other Financial Institutions Department which will henceforth be responsible for off-site and on-site supervision of the nonbank financial sector. The new department’s core staff is to come from existing divisions of the CBN Banking Supervision Department, redeployment of CBN staff from other departments, and absorption of some staff from the Federal Mortgage Bank Board. The CBN also intends to strengthen its in-house capacity to supervise the nonbank financial sector. It is also considering the possible use of external bodies (i.e., accounting firms) under specific guidelines to carry out on-site and off-site inspections of these institutions.
