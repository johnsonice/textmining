In particular, the performance criterion on the primary surplus of the consolidated public sector was exceeded by a substantial margin, despite a slowdown in output growth that began in the second quarter. Inflation has been higher than expected, and will exceed by end-200 1 both the official inflation target and the upper limit for consultations with the staff under the stand-by arrangement. Financial markets were hit hard in the weeks following September 11, but have since more than fully recovered and key variables are now at their strongest levels since early summer. The improvement in investor confidence is due in part to a strong recovery in the trade balance in recent months. FDI flows remain significant, and Brazilian firms continue to have access to international capital markets, although in some cases at higher interest rates than earlier in the year. However, the public sector debt stock has increased notably over the course of the year, as a result of a large increase in the stock of foreign exchange-indexed debt (reflecting both the depreciation of the real over the course of the year and large sales of these instruments in the weeks following September 11). Progress on the structural reform agenda has been slower than expected. Macroeconomic framework: Output growth is projected at 2 percent in 2001 (although there are indications that growth could be slower) and 2-2X percent in 2002. Inflation is projected at 4 percent at end-2002, slightly above the official central target of 3% percent. The current account balance should improve significantly, based on continued strong performance in the trade account, and-even with conservative assumptions regarding the capital account-international reserves are projected to exceed the program’s NIR floor by about US$7% billion at end-2002. Report on the discussions: The authorities expected that some of the fiscal policy overperformance that occurred in the first 10 months of the year would be reversed during November and December, but nevertheless believed that the end-year primary surplus target of 3.35 percent of GDP would be exceeded. The authorities and the mission agreed the 2002 deficit target of 3% of GDP remained feasible, despite the deterioration in the economic environment since the budget was submitted to congress. Recent reforms in the management of fiscal policy give confidence that the surplus target will be achieved next year even if growth turns out lower than expected or presidential election- related spending pressures arise. Primary surplus figures for end-June and end-September 2002 previously established as indicative targets will be converted to performance criteria unchanged. Monetary policy will continue to be conducted under the inflation targeting framework. Given the shocks this year, the authorities felt that missing the 2001 inflation target was perhaps inevitable, but stressed that policies remained on track for achieving the 2002 target. They agreed with the staff that the policy of responding to exchange rate pressure almost exclusively through the sale of foreign exchange-indexed debt was unsustainable, and stated that any future net sales of such debt instruments (or of foreign exchange) would be accompanied by a tightening of liquidity. Should market conditions permit, they would seek to reduce the stock of foreign exchange-indexed debt next year. The authorities were pessimistic about progress on the structural reform agenda in 2002, due to the limited time congress will be in session. However, some important legislation could still be approved by April 2002, and the authorities and the mission did agree on a number of structural benchmarks for the remainder of 2001 and 2002, mostly in the fiscal and financial sectors.

A staff team visited Brazil from October 18 to November 1 to conduct the 200 1 Article IV consultation and First Review discussions under the 15-month Stand-By Arrangement that was approved by the Executive Board on September 14,200l for the equivalent of SDR 12.1 billion.’ Performance criteria (PCs) and indicative benchmarks for end-September to have been met. The PCs on net international reserves for October and November were also met. The statistical benchmarks, and the structural benchmark on the privatization of federalized state banks were met, but the structural benchmark regarding the revision and upgrade of plans of accounts for financial institutions has been delayed (although it is expected to be completed before end-December) (Table 1). 2. Prior to approval of the program, the authorities indicated that they did not intend to draw under the program unless deemed necessary because of developments in market conditions and the external environment. In view of the deterioration in market conditions, and of the external environment, on September 28 the authorities did make the first purchase of SDR 3.676 billion under the new stand-by arrangement, of which SDR 3.3 17 billion was under the SRF (Table 2). Brazil’s outstanding Fund credit after the purchases equals 218.5 percent of quota. Upon completion of the first review additional credit tranche resources of SDR 358.6 million will become available for purchase and the authorities have indicated that their policy regarding purchases remains unchanged: only if market conditions require would they contemplate making additional drawings from the Fund. They have requested that the earliest availability date associated with the second review be advanced by one week to March 22 in order to open a window of several days for a possible purchase without necessitating a waiver of applicability for end-March PCs. 3. Brazil has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2a, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The 2000 Article IV consultation was concluded on November 27,200O. 4. In approving the new stand-by arrangement, Executive Directors praised the authorities for Brazil’s strong performance under the three-year stand-by arrangement that was approved in December 1998 and was cancelled when the new arrangement came into ’ The staff team comprised of Mr. Perez (Head), Ms. Belaisch, Messrs. Gerson and Paiva (all WHD), Bannister (PDR) and De Mello (FAD), and Mrs. Marcoux (Assistant, WHD). The Fund Resident Representative in Brazil, Mr. Zandamela, assisted the mission. The mission met with the Ministers of Finance; Budget and Planning; Social Security; Development, Industry and Trade; the President of the Central Bank (BCB); and officials in these and other institutions, as well as representatives of the private sector. Mr. Portugal, Executive Director for Brazil, and Mr. Tombini, Advisor to the Executive Director for Brazil, attended a number of the meetings in Brasilia.

In particular, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to further fiscal consolidation under the new program, to a tight monetary policy to ensure low inflation, and to structural reforms in the fiscal and financial areas. II. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDSHORT-TERMPROSPECTS' 5. At the time of the last Article IV consultation, short-term prospects for the Brazilian economy were decidedly upbeat. Following two years of stagnant output growth and flat or contracting domestic demand, real GDP expanded by 4% percent in 2000, fueled by very strong growth of private consumption, especially of durables, in response to declining interest rates (Figure 1). At 6 percent, inflation in 2000 was exactly on target (Figure 2). The current account deficit declined in 2000, and the capital account strengthened (Table 3) with foreign direct investment (FDI) exceeding the current account deficit by a healthy margin due, in part, to an ambitious privatization program. 6. Economic growth remained rapid in the first quarter of 2001, but this strong performance was eventually overtaken by a domestic energy crisis, developments in Argentina, and slower growth in the global economy (Paragraph 1).3 Real output grew by 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2001 (year-on-year), led by solid industrial activity. However, increased uncertainties regarding the external environment, the implementation of an energy-saving program, and the tightening of monetary policy (see below) led to a slowdown in economic activity in the second quarter, with the rate of output growth falling to just 1.8 percent. Industrial output suffered a particularly sharp decline, posting growth of just 0.6 percent in the second quarter, after expanding by 5.8 percent in the first quarter. This slowdown continued in the third quarter, even before the events of September 11, when real GDP rose by just 0.3 percent and industrial production fell by 0.4 percent. 7. In the weeks immediately following the events of September 11 the real depreciated sharply, bond spreads rose, and the stock market index fell significantly, but the deterioration in these variables has been more than reversed in recent weeks. Investors’ concern about Brazil following the terrorist attacks presumably related to the country’s large (though declining) external financing requirement, projected at US$50 billion in 2002. However, a spate of relatively positive developments in late October-early November, including evidence of a substantial adjustment in the trade balance (see below) and anticipated capital inflows of about US$2% billion related to the repurchase by the 2 For further details on developments in 2000, see EBS/O0/223 (November 8,200O) and EBS/01/36 (March 15,200l).

Measures introduced by the BCB that discourage banks from maintaining long dollar positions by increasing capital requirements on positions exceeding a minimum level and that raised reserve requirements, combined with fiscal overperformance, also helped investor confidence (Paragraph 16). More recently, Brazilian financial indicators have benefited as well from a rebalancing of the Emerging Markets Bond Index (the EMBI+) that increased the weight of Brazil at the expense of Argentina4, and from improved global liquidity conditions more generally. By December 11, the real had appreciated by about 14 percent (Figure 4), and the stock exchange had risen in local currency terms by about 33 percent, from their post-attack lows of early October. Bond spreads had also narrowed by about 330 basis points over the same period. The exchange rate and stock index now stand at levels not seen since July 2001, while bond spreads are only about 100 basis points above their level at the start of the year. 8. Slowing domestic demand and the depreciation of the exchange rate have led to a significant improvement of the external current account in recent months (Paragraph 9). After increasing to US$13.4 billion in January-June 2001, the current account deficit narrowed to just US$4.1 billion in the third quarter on the strength of better performance in the trade balance, interest payments, and profit remittances; in October the deficit was only 70 percent of its level a year earlier. The trade balance moved from a small deficit in the first quarter into a surplus of US$l.3 billion by the third quarter, the latter a particularly strong seasonal outcome, with another surplus occurring in October. The real effective depreciation that has taken place has improved Brazil’s external competitiveness, but due to weak external demand, this has been reflected more in lower imports than in a solid growth of exports. For 2001 as a whole the current account deficit is projected to decline marginally to less than US$23 billion, but to widen in terms of GDP to 4.5 percent because of the decline in Brazil’s GDP in US$ terrns.5 9. Capital market developments in the first eight months of the year were largely positive, and firms have continued to have access to markets post-September 11 (Paragraphs 10-12). FDI and portfolio investment flows remained solid in the period January-August-although about 8 percent lower than in the same period last year-and Brazil continued to enjoy good access to the sovereign bond market, with bond issuances totaling US$6.7 billion, substantially exceeding central government amortization payments due this year. The private sector has continued to have access to international capital markets 4 The rebalancing of the EMBI+ tends to lead to an increase in demand for Brazilian bonds by fund managers whose performance is assessed relative to the outturn for this index. 5 In U.S. dollar terms, the current account deficit in 2001 is considerably smaller than the deficits in 1997-98 before the two large depreciations of the real when this deficit averaged US$32 billion.

Net FDI is projected to reach US$20 billion by year end, more than 80 percent of the projected current account deficit. Gross reserves are expected to be at 70 percent of short-term debt on a residual maturity basis (compared to 56 percent at end-2000) and NIR are projected to be US$28.5 billion by end-2001, some US$8.5 billion above the program floor. 10. Total external debt at end-August amounted to US$210.0 billion (38 percent of GDP), about US$22 billion below its end-2000 level. Its public sector component (net of debt to the Fund) also declined, falling to US$89.1 billion from US$90.7 billion at end-2000. The short-term component of the external debt, measured on an original maturity basis, decreased to US$24.7 billion at end-August from US$30 billion at end-2000. 11. Inflation has been higher than expected this year, due to adjustments in administered prices and currency weakness (Paragraphs 7-8). The 12-month inflation rate through November equaled 7.6 percent, with food and administered prices accounting for a large share of the rise in the price level. With accumulated inflation over the first 11 months of the year already at 7.0 percent, end-year inflation is virtually certain to exceed the trigger point of 6.8 percent for consultations with the staff. Even though the depreciation has contributed to higher-than-expected inflation this year, the extent of the passthrough from the exchange rate to prices has been low relative to the very large fall in the value of the real, reflecting a variety of factors including tight monetary policy, relatively slack domestic demand conditions, and perhaps the perception among firms that there has been an overshooting of the exchange rate. 12. The relatively successful implementation of the energy saving program, together with weakening aggregate demand and a good start to the rainy season, have helped alleviate concerns about the energy crisis (Paragraphs 3-6). In addition to reductions in consumption among households, significant investment by firms in energy generation and in more energy-efficient equipment, and the trading of energy consumption quotas within the business sector, have also contributed to reducing the impact of the crisis on the economy. The government has taken steps to contract private sector companies to produce additional power using mobile generators, to import electricity from neighboring countries, and to improve the regulatory framework to further stimulate private investment. Effective December 1, the energy saving targets for most businesses and residential users were reduced from 20 percent to 12 percent in the Southeast and Midwest regions, to 5 percent in the North, and to 17 percent in the Northeast. The reductions do not apply to industrial plants or the public sector, for which the targets remain 20 percent and 35 percent, respectively. 6 Average maturity on newly rolled over interbank lines fluctuates significantly from month to month, but there is no evidence that maturities have shortened since September 11. For example, average maturities in October and November exceeded those in February-May. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- 13. The BCB has maintained a cautious monetary policy stance during 2000-01 guided by the requirements of its inflation targeting framework. Following a series of gradual cuts that reduced the benchmark overnight interest rate (Selic) from 19.0 percent to 16.5 percent between April and July 2000, the BCB left interest rates unchanged until December 2000, citing concerns about unsettled conditions in international markets and the potential impact of higher oil prices on inflation. Successive rate cuts in December 2000 and January 2001 reduced the Selic rate to 15.25 percent, but continuing pressure on the exchange rate and signals of rising domestic inflation led the BCB to shift course soon thereafter, entering into a tightening cycle that brought the Selic rate back to 19 percent by July 200 1. 14. The BCB has kept the Selic rate unchanged since July. The aim has been to balance concerns about inflation with worries about the weakening of the real economy, and the BCB has increasingly relied on other policy tools to address the potential inflationary impact of further depreciation of the real (Paragraph 16). In July, the BCB announced that it would sell a total of US$6 billion in the spot foreign exchange market through regular daily sales of US$SO million until the end of the year, in order to bolster confidence in the liquidity of the foreign exchange market. 15. During the last two weeks of September-when demand for foreign exchange hedge jumped sharply in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks-the BCB introduced a 10 percent reserve requirement on time deposits and increased the minimum proportion of required reserves on demand deposits that banks must maintain at the BCB on a daily basis, without raising the overall reserve requirement that banks must meet on a two-week moving average. Both of these measures reduced the scope for banks to enter into short term repurchase transactions that could put additional pressure on the exchange rate. In addition, the BCB substantially increased capital requirements on open foreign exchange positions that exceed a (newly reduced) threshold level, greatly increasing costs for banks wishing to speculate against the real. Following the implementation of this rule, banks’ long dollar positions reportedly declined by some US$2 billion, contributing in part to the real’s recent rally. The BCB also sold about US$7% billion worth of foreign exchange- indexed debt in September and the first two weeks of October. As a result of these bond sales and the substantial depreciation of the real, the share of foreign exchange-indexed debt in the total public securitized debt stock has risen from 22 percent at the start of the year to 32.9 percent at end-October (Figure 5). In addition, during September 11-13 the BCB intervened modestly in the spot foreign exchange market beyond the limited daily interventions already discussed.7 7 In addition to its daily US$50 million interventions, the BCB sold US$lOO million in the spot market on September 11, US$70 million on September 12, and US$50 million on September 13, for a total of US$220 million.

The banking system does not pose systemic risks (Paragraphs 17-18). Banks’ capital adequacy ratios averaged 20 percent as of end-June 2001, well above the 12 percent requirement imposed by the BCB (which exceeds the Base1 requirements). This strong ratio results in part from the restructuring of the federal banks undertaken in June, which included both capital injections and a swap of nonperforming loans for government securities. In addition, Brazilian banks or their subsidiaries hold large portfolios of floating rate and foreign exchange-indexed government bonds, and several large private bank holding companies also have substantial foreign assets. Thus the earlier increases in interest rates and depreciation of the real relative to the start of the year have been profitable for many financial intermediaries. Finally, despite the slowing economy credit quality has not deteriorated, and the share of nonperforming loans has in fact declined from 8 percent at end- 2000 to 5.3 percent in September. Provisioning of these loans exceeds BCB requirements (Table 4). 17. While accounting data indicate that the currency depreciation significantly reduced net profits of nonfinancial Brazilian corporations during the first half of 2001, these data tend to underestimate profitability by not including revenue from yet-to- mature off-balance sheet hedging operations.8 To help Brazilian corporates absorb more gradually the impact of the depreciation on their balance sheets, and to reduce accounting- driven private sector demand for hedge, the stock market regulatory agency and the federal tax authority introduced regulations allowing publicly-traded corporations to spread accounting losses associated with the depreciation of 2001 over the next four years, although to date only a handful of them have elected to do SO.~ 18. Brazil’s fiscal performance in 2000 was strong, with the cumulative primary surplus of the consolidated public sector reaching 3.5 percent of GDP at year-end. The overall deficit of the public sector (PSBR) declined to 4.6 percent of GDP from 10.0 percent in 1999 (Table 5), but the debt/GDP ratio increased marginally, partly reflecting the more depreciated exchange rate at end-year, as well as some shortfall in privatization revenues ’ This information is based on accounting data for the 206 largest Brazilian nonfinancial, publicly-traded companies, collected by the Fundacao Getulio Vargas. The cash flow position of these companies is stronger than the one suggested by these accounting data because of the revenues from the foreign exchange hedging operations that are done off- balance sheet. 9 Corporations taking advantage of this opportunity will be required to disclose this information-and details of losses yet to be amortized-in their financial statements. These reporting requirements may explain why so few firms have thus far chosen to avail themselves of this option.

Fiscal performance has remained solid in 2001 (Paragraphs 13-14). Between January and October 200 1, the consolidated public sector posted a primary surplus equivalent to 4.5 percent of period GDP, and R$4 billion higher than the end-December target. With a primary surplus of 2.8 percent of period GDP between January-October, the central government’s fiscal performance has reflected strong revenue collection and continued expenditure restraint. The revenue impact of the slowdown in economic activity has been muted by increases in certain tax bases such as those of capital gains and income taxes as a result of the depreciation of the exchange rate and the increase in the policy interest rate. 20. The regional governments and the public enterprises have also contributed to the strong fiscal outturn of the consolidated public sector. The states and municipalities posted a cumulative primary surplus between January-October 200 1 of 1 .O percent of period GDP, reflecting strong revenue performance and continued expenditure restraint in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) and compliance with the debt restructuring agreements with the treasury that require the attainment of minimum primary surpluses. The weaker real has contributed to the fiscal performance of those public enterprises that have earnings in, or indexed to, foreign exchange (mostly Petrobras and Itaipu, the hydroelectric plant jointly owned by Brazil and Paraguay). Public enterprises registered a cumulative primary surplus of 0.8 percent of period GDP between January and October, despite the adverse effect of the energy saving program on the revenues of government-owned energy generation firms. 21. On account of the more depreciated exchange rate, the accumulated PSBR reached 7.6 percent of period GDP at end-October, compared with 4.2 percent in the same period of 2000. However, the BCB has implemented a recommendation of the ROSC mission that visited Brasilia in September 2001 and begun publishing alongside its traditional PSBR statistics, a “harmonized” PSBR that excludes exchange rate-induced changes in the valuation of the domestic foreign exchange-indexed debt stock that were incurred during the reference period but will not be paid until the debt instruments mature. l1 Based on the harmonized methodology, the accumulated PSBR of the consolidated public sector actually fell to 2.7 percent of period GDP at end-October, relative to 3.5 percent in the same period of 2000 (see Box 1 for a summary of main findings of the ROSC mission). i” In contrast to many other countries, Brazil’s public debt figures are reported on a net basis. This net debt is essentially equal to gross debt plus the monetary base minus international reserves. ii The term “harmonized” refers to the fact that this definition coincides with that applied in other Mercosur countries and many other countries.

ROSC Fiscal Module: Main Findings An FAD mission visited Brazil in September 2001 to assess the country’s fiscal transparency practices in relation to the requirements of the IMF Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency. The main findings of the mission were as follows: 1. The coverage of Brazil’s fiscal statistics is commendably broad, a fact that needs to be taken into account in cross-country comparisons. The nonfinancial public sector is clearly separated from the financial public sector. In addition, the allocation of responsibilities among different levels of government-a challenging task in a decentralized federation such as Brazil-is defined in the Constitution, which clearly assigns revenue sources among the different levels of government. Although the constitution allows for significant overlap of expenditure functions, the authorities have made progress in clarifying these responsibilities. Government equity holdings, which remain significant in some sectors, are reported clearly on a company-by-company basis, although not comprehensively in the aggregate. 2. Central bank operations (not related to the conduct of monetary policy) are included in the general government accounts. This ensures that any quasi-fiscal activity would be promptly and transparently reflected in the fiscal accounts. The central bank is not formally independent, but, in practice, enjoys substantial operational autonomy. 3. Fiscal information is widely disseminated, including budget statistics, as well as relevant legislation and administrative regulations on tax and budgetary matters, particularly at the federal government level. Detailed data on central government finances are readily available on a timely basis, but data on subnational government finances, although readily available, are less comprehensive and timely than central government data. Below-the-line data on the consolidated operations of the various levels of government and the nonfinancial public sector are produced regularly, together with data on public debt and the government’s financial operations. 4. Brazil is at the forefront of countries at comparable levels of development in the use of electronic means to deliver government services, and to facilitate citizens’ influence over government activities and programs. Dissemination of information has been greatly enhanced by the extensive use of the intemet, both by the government and the population at large. Several e-government programs are available, including federal procurement programs and a wide range of taxpayer services. 5. Brazil has substantially improved the management of its public finances recently. Key reforms in this regard have been the enactment in May 2000 of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) and greater emphasis on medium-term budgeting. In particular, the FRL sets out for all levels of government fiscal rules designed to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, and strict transparency requirements to underpin the effectiveness and credibility of such rules. In addition, the existence of a detailed medium-term expenditure framework (PPA) for the central government, articulated into programs and activities-the implementation of which is closely monitored-provides an effective instrument for better aligning the execution of budgetary appropriations to government priorities, and to the actual performance of the programs, as well as for minimizing disruptions implied by any budgetary cuts that may be needed in the course of each year. 6. Mechanisms of internal and external expenditure control are generally well developed, and are increasingly complemented by efforts to assess not only formal compliance with legal requirements for public expenditure management, but also the quality and cost-effectiveness of public spending. Goods and services are purchased according to comprehensive procurement regulations. However, there is scope for improvement in these areas, especially as regards a clearer definition of the responsibilities of the various agencies involved in these functions; the follow-up on reports of the internal and external control agencies; the development and effective utilization of appropriate indicators of program outputs and outcomes; and the development of cost centers, including personnel costs, for the programs in the annual budget and the multi-year plan.

As already mentioned, the indicative target for the net public debt at end- September was met, but reflecting primarily the larger-than-programmed depreciation of the real net public debt rose to 54.4 percent of GDP at end-October from 49.4 percent of GDP at end-2000 (Paragraph 15). Public debt management remains cautious and continues to build on previous progress in lengthening maturities and increasing duration. For example, the average maturity of competitively-placed outstanding domestic public debt issued by the treasury increased from 32.3 months at end-2000 to 40.6 months in October 2001. The treasury has also aimed at reducing public debt refinancing pressures towards the end of the current administration and the beginning of the next one by reducing amortization obligations in the second half of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003 (Figure 6). 23. On August 31, the government submitted to congress the 2002 budget proposal, which envisages an increase of the public sector primary surplus to 3.5 percent of GDP (Box 2). The budget proposal, as well as revised central government budget projections, are consistent with the program’s primary surplus target for the consolidated public sector in 2002. The government is negotiating with congress to limit proposals for additional spending and possible losses on personal income tax receipts that could occur from an initiative to revise personal income tax brackets upward to reduce the bracket creep that has occurred in recent years. 24. Progress on the structural reform agenda has been made this year (Paragraph 19). Earlier this year congress approved two of the remaining three pieces of legislation for the establishment of complementary pension funds. In October, a new corporate law was signed strengthening the rights of minority shareholders and enhancing the autonomy of the stock market regulatory agency (Box 3). In addition, congress approved a constitutional amendment introducing the explicit taxation of petroleum products, a key step toward the full liberalization of the domestic oil market in 2002. Less progress has been made in congress in advancing proposals that would result in new legislation for the central bank and supervisory agencies of capital markets, including with respect to approval of the constitutional amendment that is a prerequisite for this legislation. Brazil has also made progress in the implementation of OECD antibribery initiatives: the antibribery Convention was signed by the President in August 2000, and implementing legislation is currently under consideration by the congress. 25. The authorities have continued to implement their privatization program, although with some setbacks (Paragraph 19). The authorities have successfully auctioned various oil prospecting licenses and concessions for hydroelectric power plants this year, as well as concessions for two mobile phone bands. However, the privatization of Furnas, the federally-owned electricity company, has been postponed because of the problems in the energy sector. The privatization of the COPEL electricity company, owned by the state of Parana, has also been delayed because of a lack of private sector interest in the company at the announced minimum sale price. The BCB continues to implement its program for privatizing six banks formerly owned by state governments.

The 2002 federal budget proposal-submitted to Congress on August 3 1, 2001-assumes an average real GDP growth of 3.5 percent, end-2002 inflation of 4 percent, and an average exchange rate of R$2.4 per US$l for the year. The minimum wage is projected to increase by nearly 5 percent in 2002, to adjust the losses in purchasing power since the last adjustment in April 2001. Social security benefits are projected to rise on average by 3.8 percent, with those benefits above the minimum benefit having a lower rate of adjustment. The main fiscal aggregates. Total revenues are budgeted to increase to 23.6 percent of GDP in 2002, relative to 22.9 percent of GDP in 2001. Nonfinancial expenditures, including intergovernmental transfers, are budgeted to remain constant in 2002 relative to 2001 at 21.4 percent of GDP, generating a primary surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP at the federal government level. The social security system is projected to have a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP, with total revenues stabilizing at 5.4 percent of GDP and total expenditures rising to 6.4 percent of GDP relative to 200 1. The nominal deficit of the federal government is expected to fall to 2.8 percent of GDP from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2001. Revenues. Tax revenues are projected to track the changes in the exchange rate and in GDP growth.’ Budget projections take into account the extension of the bank debit tax (CPMF), due originally to be phased out at end- June 2002, and the (elimination of the import duty surcharge). Nontax revenue is projected to rise in percent of GDP relative to 2001 by approximately 0.4 percent of GDP to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2002. Pending approval of the legislation allowing for the explicit taxation of domestic petroleum products in 2002, revenues from the taxation of petroleum products are projected at 0.4 percent of GDP, in line with an average price of imported crude oil at US$23.7 per barrel and an average exchange rate of R$2.30 per US$l. The budget proposal does not provide for an upward adjustment of the personal income tax brackets that has been approved by Congress and that could result in revenue losses. The law approving the changes has not been signed yet by the President. Likewise, the budget proposal does not include revenue gains from the collection of income taxes from pension funds, a measure that would offset in part the revenue losses associated with the approved adjustment in the income tax legislation. Expenditures. Payroll expenditures are projected to fall by 0.2 percent of GDP to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2002 relative to 2001. The budget does not provide for a general salary increase for civil servants and total payroll outlays are expected to be determined by the usual wage drift and by selected wage increases in a small number of careers. Total current spending net of payroll and social security benefits is expected to rise to approximately 5.2 percent of GDP. This is due primarily to increased rigidity in the budget following a constitutional amendment in 200 1 determining that budget allocations to health care should be adjusted in line with the nominal rate of growth of GDP, in addition to a 5 percent increase vis-a-vis the 1999 allocations. Federal government capital outlays, other than those in the health care sector and in the legislature and the judiciary, are programmed to fall by 0.2 percent of GDP to 0.8 percent of GDP, with most outlays in the multi-year Avanqa Brad program that encompasses priority projects. Budget allocations for the Poverty Fund, financed through the earmarking of a 0.08 percentage point surcharge in the CPMF, is programmed to account for nearly 0.4 percent of GDP. ’ As noted in the text of the report, revised revenue forecasts for 2002 suggest that revenues are likely to be close to the level in the program despite the deterioration in the macroeconomic scenario because there has been a broadening in the revenue base in 200 1, due primarily to the higher than previously projected exchange rate depreciation.

The New Corporate Law The new Corporate Law (Lei das S.A.s, Law No. 10.303/01)--signed by the Executive on November 1,200l after nearly four years in Congress-is likely to be a landmark in Brazilian corporate governance. The new corporate law replaces Law No. 6.404/76, which provides the legal framework for open-capital corporations, and modifies Law No. 6385/76 (the Capital Markets Regulatory Agency (CVM) Law). It increases transparency, protects minority shareholder rights, and gives the CVM budgetary and operational independence. Open-capital corporations have a year to adapt their by-laws to the new legislation. The main changes brought about in the legal framework for open-capital corporations are: 1. Holders of non-voting shares are guaranteed representation in the Board of Directors, as long as they hold at least 10 percent of its shares. This new provision, to be fully implemented by 2006, is expected to increase the value of nonvoting shares when the controlling shareholders decide to increase their Board representation. 2. Share buybacks can only be carried out competitively, at a fair price and, under certain conditions, minority shareholders can call for a revaluation of the selling price. Share buybacks must also be approved by at least 50 percent of the shareholders of the relevant share type. 3. Up to 80 percent tag-along right is guaranteed for minority holders of voting shares in case of change in control. This is expected to create a control premium in equity pricing in Brazil; currently, voting shares are traded at a discount. Tag-along rights had been abolished in 1997 to facilitate the privatization of some public enterprises. 4. The law creates incentives for minority shareholders not to sell their shares in the case of changes in control. New controlling shareholders are required to offer minority shareholders the possibility of remaining as minority shareholders in the company by paying them the difference between the current share prices and the price paid for the controlling block. Although this measure should increase acquisition costs, it encourages liquidity in equity markets. 5. At least fifty percent of new stock issues has to be with voting rights. This requires higher share ownership for control. Currently, the minimum ratio of voting shares is l/3 of the company’s shares. 6. Dividend payment becomes compulsory. The payment of dividends must be equivalent to at least 25 percent of the corporation’s net profits and at least 3 percent of its net worth in a given reference period. Holders of nonvoting shares are guaranteed to receive dividends worth at least 10 percent more than those paid to holders of voting shares. 7. Disputes can be resolved through arbitration, as long as this possibility is envisaged in companies’ by-laws. 8. The law punishes insider trading as a crime.’ 9. The law also gives the capital markets regulatory agency (CVM) budget and operational independence. CVM now has more autonomy in legal investigations of wrongdoing. The law grants CVM a special status among public entities (autarquia), akin to that of other regulatory agencies.’ ’ These two changes were approved in a decree (Medida Provisoria) separate from the new Corporate Law.

Auctions for the remaining banks should be completed by April 2002 (Box 4). III. MACROFRAMEWORK FOR 2002 26. The macroeconomic framework for 2002 has been revised in line with a more pessimistic external scenario since the program was approved by the Executive Board in September (Paragraph 21). The program is based on a growth forecast of 2 percent in 200 1 (compared to 2.2 percent in the original program) and 2-255 percent in 2002 (compared to 3% percent originally), with growth bottoming out in the first quarter of 2002 and recovering significantly in the second half of the year. I2 Private consumption growth is projected to recover somewhat from its very depressed level in 2001, but private investment is forecasted to be flat in real terms. Notwithstanding the poor international economic environment, the external sector’s contribution to growth is expected to strengthen in 2002 due to the impact of this year’s very large shift in relative prices on exports and imports as well as the effect of lower domestic demand growth on imports. From the supply side, output growth is expected to be led by agriculture-with bumper crops forecast in soya and other products-and to a lesser extent by services. Industrial output is projected to continue its current slide into the first quarter of 2002, but it is expected to recover gradually over the remainder of the year. With the unsettled global economic environment these projections are subject to considerable risk. 27. For 2002, the projected trade surplus is about US$6 billion, contributing to a decline in the current account deficit to less than US$20 billion, some 4.2 percent of GDP (Paragraph 23). Export volume growth is expected to slow further in 2002, to just 3.7 percent, as demand in partner countries is anticipated to recover only very slowly over the course of the year. However, continued weak domestic demand and the lagged impact of the exchange rate depreciation are projected to result in a decline in imports of 3.2 percent in volume terms. A modest improvement in the terms of trade (on the order of about 1.3 percentage points) is also expected to contribute to strengthening the trade surplus. 28. Brazil’s gross external financing requirements are projected to decline from about US$57 billion in 2001 to US$50 billion in 2002 (Table 6), due to the smaller l2 Recent information suggests that economic growth could be less than 2 percent in 2001, about 1.8 percent. Projections for the fiscal sector and the balance of payments were produced using GDP growth of 2.2 percent in 2002.

Plans for Privatizing the Federalized State Banks in 2001-02 Following the successful privatizations in 2000 of the state bank of Paran (BANESTADO) for a total of R$l.6 billion, and of 5 1 percent of the voting shares of the former state bank of Sgo Paul0 (BANESPA) for a total of R$7.05 billion, the federal government’s privatization program in the financial sector for this year and next deals with six federalized state banks. These privatizations are part of the process of the resolution of Brazil’s state banks which, depending on the institution, also includes liquidation/ closure, recapitalization, and transformation into development agencies.’ Tentative Schedule for Privatizing Federalized State Banks in 2001-02 _I ~ Action I”Servi~o B” (due diligence. 1 1 Banco do Estado do Banco do Estado do ‘;;A?

None of these privatizations has the systemic importance of the privatization of BANESPA. At the same time, these privatizations will help bring to an end the lengthy process of cleaning up state financial institutions and their history of being used by state governments for quasi-fiscal purposes, and will thereby contribute to a more efficient banking sector. It is unlikely that there will be a repetition of the extensive legal proceedings between the government and groups opposed to privatization that surrounded the privatization of BANESPA. At the same time, and notwithstanding the government’s strong commitment, some delays may occur, given the ambitious privatization schedule. ’ See EBSlOOl82 for a review.

Net portfolio investment flows are also projected to decline, due in part to lower amortization requirements on public sector bonds. Based on these projections, combined with conservative assumptions of US$4 billion in sovereign bonds issues, 80 percent rollover rates for syndicated loans, and a 100 percent rollover for short-term credit, and the presumption of no further drawing of Fund resources, the overall balance of payments is projected to record a deficit of US$3% billion in 2002, with gross reserves being US$33.2 billion (64 percent of short-term debt on a residual maturity basis) at end-year (Table 7). NIR would decline marginally to about US$27 billion, still well above the program floor. This projection assumes no net intervention by the BCB in the spot foreign exchange market in 2002. Total external debt is projected to continue to decline in U.S. dollar terms, but to rise modestly as a share of GDP due to the effect of the 2001 depreciation on GDP in dollars (Table 8). IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 29. The authorities noted that after a period of substantial turbulence in the international economy that had led to significant pressures on Brazilian financial variables, market sentiment had recently improved, a development they attributed in part to the maintenance of strong macroeconomic policies supported by the Fund arrangement. They stressed their full commitment to the targets in the program, and their readiness to adjust policies as needed to achieve them. At the same time, they recognized that the international environment remained volatile, and that the nature of future shocks-and of the international community’s response to them-would inevitably have a major impact on developments in Brazil. In agreeing with this assessment, the mission emphasized that the proposed maintenance of a strong fiscal policy stance, with less reliance on foreign exchange intervention, particularly through net sales of foreign exchange-indexed bonds that have a large fiscal risk, and more use of traditional monetary policy instruments, as well as redoubled efforts on the structural reform agenda, would provide the best means of helping the economy absorb future external shocks. l3 Of the total amortization of medium and long-term loans of US$28 billion (excluding SRF repurchases) projected for 2002, about US$5.2 billion is owed by the central government, about US$l billion by public sector enterprises and US$ 1 billion by the financial public sector. Amortization of sovereign bonds is estimated at US$l.2 billion (not including the exercise of put options), with US$O.7 billion for the rest of the public sector. Of total private sector amortizations of medium and long-term debt, about US$5.7 billion are amortizations of international bonds, and about 60 percent of these are owed by the banking sector.

The discussions on fiscal policy focused on the extent to which the end-year primary surplus target was likely to be exceeded, given the very strong performance through October, and on the stance for 2002. Overall, the authorities expected that the primary surplus of the central government would ultimately be close to the program level, but they noted that some public sector overperformance was likely at the end of the year, particularly if state and local governments continued to perform strongly. 31. The mission advised the authorities to try to maintain some of the margin built up so far, given the deterioration in the economic environment since the program was negotiated, but the authorities adopted a more nuanced view on the advantages of overperforming. The authorities agreed that, given the current unsettled international environment and the recent growth in the debt stock relative to GDP, some fiscal overperformance could help solidify recent gains in market confidence. However, they noted that some ministries had not yet reached their spending authorization limits, giving them latitude to raise spending in the remainder of the year. More importantly, while persistent fiscal overperformance could be viewed by market participants as a prudent response to a deteriorating economic environment, such an outcome could ultimately weaken efforts to obtain support for next year’s fiscal target from the rest of the government, because spending ministries might feel that the proposed spending limits for 2002 would contain a level of overperformance. They also emphasized that creating a budgetary overperformance this year through the build-up of unspent commitments at year-end would put in peril the attainment of the 2002 target, because the FRL requires that unspent commitments be settled before the end of an administration’s term of office. In their view, the primary surplus target of 3.35 percent of GDP established under the program for 2001 remained an appropriate goal, and although some overperformance was likely, this outcome would not be the result of a deliberate shift in policy. 32. The indicative targets for the June and September 2002 primary surpluses established under the program will be converted to performance criteria at their existing nominal values, which would imply a primary fiscal stance that is marginally tighter than originally programmed (Paragraphs 25-27). Nominal GDP in 2002 is expected to be some S-1 percent lower than projected in the program’s original macroeconomic framework, with more rapid deflator growth only partially offsetting slower real growth. Revised revenue forecasts for 2002 suggest that total revenues are likely to be very close to the levels in the program despite the deterioration in the macroeconomic scenario, with lower revenues from more output-elastic taxes being offset by higher revenues from taxes sensitive to the exchange rate. In addition, the revised revenue forecast for 2002 benefits from a broadening of the revenue base in 2001 from the level envisaged in the program, due primarily to the higher than previously projected exchange rate depreciation in 200 1. Thus, despite the fact that growth is 2002 is expected to be lower than assumed in the budget, staff and the authorities agreed that the primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP remains feasible.

The authorities agreed with the mission that the main risks to the fiscal stance in 2002 would stem from a lower-than-projected level of economic activity. They noted, however, that they will cut expenditures if any revenue shortfalls occur next year, in order to ensure the achievement of the fiscal targets, although the relatively inflexible structure of expenditures would complicate this. l4 Against the background of considerable strengthening in the management of public finances in Brazil, they felt that the fiscal stance was unlikely to be severely affected by the adverse political cycle prior to the presidential election in October, observing that the debt restructuring agreements that state and local governments had signed with the treasury obligated them to run primary surpluses. In addition, the authorities are committed to offset any shortfall in performance at the level of subnational governments with an equivalent overperformance at the central government level in order to achieve the overall primary surplus target. The fiscal performance of the public enterprises in 2002 is likely to be aided by the more depreciated exchange rate and the announced easing of the energy saving program. With a primary balance of 3.5 percent of GDP, the net debt of the consolidated public sector is projected at 55.3 percent of GDP by end-2002 (relative to a projected 56.2 percent of GDP at end-2001).15 Consistent with this primary surplus, the PSBR is programmed at 3.4 percent of GDP in 2002. 34. Budget projections for 2002 call for federal social expenditure of about 14 percent of GDP, similar to the level of 1999-2001. The authorities noted that both the quantity and quality of social expenditure had improved in recent years, even as the government has managed to achieve substantial fiscal consolidation (Table 9). Budget execution of high priority (generally more cost-effective and more highly targeted) federal social programs has also been preserved (Table 10). More importantly, key indicators such as primary and secondary school enrollment have improved, although the authorities recognized that there was scope for further progress in the social sectors. Expenditure priority has been given to programs that have been most successful at reaching the targeted population, such as the federal Balsa Escola (which provides an income supplement to poor families that keep their children in school); the federal equalization transfers to the states and municipalities within FUNDEF to ensure a minimum level of spending per elementary school student; basic health care programs, which also focus on budget appropriations based on minimum per l4 Revenue forecasts for 2002 may be affected by two recent developments. First, the Supreme Court has ruled that private pension funds should be liable for taxes on capital gains, which could yield up to R$600 million in additional receipts on an annual basis. However, this decision is likely to be appealed. Second, congress approved an upward revision of personal income tax brackets to partially offset bracket creep that has occurred in recent years. The law still has to be signed by the President, but the annual cost is estimated at about R$31/ billion. l5 These forecasts are based on program exchange rates of R$2.75 per dollar at end-2001 and R$2.79 at end-2002. Based on an exchange rate of R$2.40 per dollar at end-2001 (the level as of December 6), the debt/GDP ratio would be closer to 53 percent by the end of this year.

Efforts are on-going to strengthen the design and implementation of these selected social programs, aiming to improve their targeting and cost-effectiveness. B. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Policies 35. The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to the inflation targeting regime and their floating exchange rate policy (Paragraphs 29-30). Over the course of 2001 the authorities responded to a series of substantial shocks through a combination of adjustment (via exchange rate depreciation and interest rate increases) and smoothing (through sales of foreign exchange and the issuance of foreign exchange-indexed debt). They agreed with the mission that the nearly exclusive use of foreign exchange-indexed debt to respond to shocks in September and October was unsustainable, but argued that this response had been justified by the extraordinary circumstances confronting Brazil in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. In the view of the central bank, allowing an unchecked depreciation of the real in the very unstable market conditions that prevailed in the weeks immediately following September 11 could have had a serious negative impact on expectations, in particular on inflation. At the same time, the BCB was wary of raising interest rates at a time when domestic demand growth was declining sharply. In these circumstances, and with the exchange rate in their view clearly having overshot its equilibrium value, they saw the sale of dollar-indexed debt as the lowest risk and least costly policy instrument. 36. Looking forward, the authorities and staff both saw the need to adopt a more balanced mix of monetary and intervention policies. The BCB may continue to sell predetermined amounts of foreign exchange in the spot market on a daily basis in the first few months of 2002, but the volume of such daily intervention is likely to be substantially smaller than the current US$SO million, and the authorities hoped to be able to phase out such intervention early if market conditions remained satisfactory. In addition, the BCB did not intend to increase the stock (in U.S. dollar terms) of foreign exchange-indexed debt in 2002. Indeed, as market conditions permit over the course of the year, the BCB will seek to reduce the stock of these instruments. Should exceptional circumstances force the BCB to increase its spot market intervention or to issue new foreign exchange-indexed debt, the authorities indicated that these measures would be accompanied by a tightening of liquidity, possibly through an increase in interest rates. 37. Despite the fact that the official inflation target for 2001 would surely be missed, the authorities believed that inflation was likely to be near the trigger point of 6.8 percent for consultations with staff, and stressed that policies were on track to hit the inflation target for 2002.16 As is customary in countries using an inflation targeting l6 The official inflation target for end-2001 is 4 percent, with an upper band of 6 percent. However, at the time of negotiating the current Stand-By Arrangement it was clear that inflation would exceed this target, and the central inflation projection and the consultation bands were revised up. (See the attached TMU). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - framework, the BCB intends to write an open letter to the minister of finance early next year explaining why the official inflation target was not met at end-200 1, in order to enhance the transparency and credibility of the inflation targeting regime. For end-2002, the November market consensus for inflation is 5.1 percent (compared to an official target of 3.5 percent), but the BCB projects end-2002 inflation of about 4 percent with the difference reflecting in part assumptions about interest and exchange rates: the BCB’s projection was based on unchanged interest and exchange rates, while most private sector economists were forecasting a decline in interest rates and further depreciation. 38. The authorities acknowledged, however, that there were two major sources of uncertainty regarding inflation in 2002. First, adjustments in administered prices-which had contributed significantly to inflation in 2001-could be larger than assumed. Second, it was unclear how the large depreciation in 2001 would feed through to prices in 2002. To date, exchange rate passthrough had been relatively limited, but there was a risk that the passthrough that did not occur this year would materialize in 2002, especially if activity recovered. The BCB’s inflation projections assume that this repressed passthrough will add % percentage point to inflation in 2002, but this was subject to considerable margin for error. Thus, they agreed with the mission that, despite the weakening of domestic demand there was no scope at present for a relaxation of monetary policy. The central inflation projections for March, June, and September 2002 under the program will remain unchanged, as will the inner and outer bounds under the program’s consultation mechanism (see the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)). 39. The authorities confirmed their interest in participating in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (Paragraph 3 1). A joint MAE/World Bank team visited Brazil in October to discuss with the authorities the scope of the assessment and the schedule for its completion. FSAP missions are expected to travel to Brazil in the first half of 2002, with a view to completing the process in time for the 2002 Article IV consultation discussions tentatively scheduled for late 2002. C. Structural Reforms 40. The authorities noted that some progress was being made on the structural front, while acknowledging delays in certain areas (Paragraphs 28-3 1). They cautioned that the electoral calendar was likely to make further progress difficult on measures requiring congressional approval during the remainder of the program period. Congress is likely to approve an extension of the bank debit tax (CPMF) through end-2003, with stock market transactions probably exempted from the tax,17 and the enabling legislation for complementary pension funds for civil servants may also be approved. However, congressional activity is likely to grind to a near halt by spring 2002 as the election season l7 A Fiscal Affairs Department mission visited Brazil in December to assess tax reform options, with a focus on indirect taxes.

As such, they were skeptical about prospects for significant progress in approving new legislation for the central bank law and for capital market regulatory agencies; for permitting collection of social security contributions from retired civil servants (for which there is virtually no support in congress); and for modifying the framework of states’ value- added taxes. However, the mission and authorities did agree on a number of structural benchmarks, mostly related to financial system reforms, for December 200 1 and March, June, and September 2002 (see the attached TMU and Box 5). In addition, the BCB is pursuing reforms of the system for housing finance. 41. Progress continues to be made in financial sector reform. In accordance with the federal banks restructuring program that was initiated in July, the new nonfinancial corporation (EMGEA) that took charge of impaired assets transferred out of the Caixa Econbmica Federal (CEF) has begun operations with a staff of about 50 employees.‘8 Collection activities on these assets, which are valued at about R$26.7 billion, continue to be conducted by CEF, in return for a fee from EMGEA. Reforms to strengthen management capacity at both CEF and Bunco do Brasil (BB) are being implemented, cross-subsidies across different lines of activity are being eliminated, and the law requiring explicit transfers from the federal budget to compensate the federal banks for subsidized lending has been approved. Budgetary transfers to the two significantly smaller federal banks included in the restructuring-Bunco do Nordeste and Bunco da Amazo”nia-are expected to be approved later this year. In addition, the government is undertaking preparatory work to float shares of BB on Bovespa’s Novo Mercado, and the first shares could be placed in 2002. To this end, BB has already increased the transparency of its financial reports. However, proposed improvements in information technology (requested by the BCB) and increases in director salaries to attract more private sector professionals have yet to be implemented. Progress is being made in the development of a strong offsite banking supervision department at the BCB. Its monitoring of individual banks through data received regularly should improve the supervision of the banking system. 42. The authorities expressed general satisfaction with the pace of reform in the energy sector, but agreed that significant challenges remain. In addition to the relaxation of the energy saving program, changes had also been introduced to the regulations governing tariff adjustments for electricity distributors-so that changes in tariffs will more accurately reflect changes in their costs over the course of the previous year-and distributors will be compensated for losses incurred prior to the revision in tariff rules. In addition, the authorities noted that a number of large contracts with energy generation firms are due to expire in the coming months. If these contracts were to be renewed at generation firms’ full marginal costs, the result would be a drastic increase in energy tariffs. The authorities may therefore opt for a more gradual increase toward full marginal cost pricing, especially in the case of public sector firms. While recognizing that such a move would likely require a further l8 For more details on the bank restructuring operation, see EBS/O1/149 (August 29,2001), Annex II.

Coverage of Structural Conditionality in the Current Program The set of structural benchmarks in the proposed program concentrate in the areas of prudential standards and supervision of financial institutions; continuing the process of privatizing the federalized state banks; and approving legislation introducing an explicit taxation of oil products and creating complementary pension funds for federal civil servants. These reforms aim at improving transparency and efficiency in the Brazilian economy, as well as contributing to long-term fiscal sustainability. (Section III-A of Technical Memorandum of Understanding). 2. Status of Structural Conditionality from Earlier Programs One structural benchmark for September 2001 was not met. The revision and upgrade of the plan of accounts for financial institutions, the rules for recording and evaluating assets and liabilities, and the reporting to the BCB and the public of the financial statements of financial institutions were delayed for technical reasons. It is expected that these measures will be completed by December 2001. 3. Structural Areas Covered by World Bank Lending and Conditionality The First Fiscal Reform Programmatic Structural Adjustment Operation (PSAL) of US$758 million was approved in January 2001, and a second loan is envisaged for CY02. Program goals include fiscal planning and transparency measures; multiyear budgeting with improved budget evaluation; new financial management systems; administrative reform regulation; centralized debt management with improved risk management capacity; and the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law and the Fiscal Crimes Law. The First Financial Reform PSAL of US$404 million was approved in April 2001, again with a second loan envisaged for CY02. Program goals include increased efficiency in intermediation relating to improved debtor information, contract enforcement, and bankruptcy laws; broadened access; improved banking regulation and supervision; enabling legislation for new payments systems; and an improved governance and regulatory framework for securities markets. These programmatic loans, supported by technical assistance, form the centerpiece of World Bank support for structural reforms in the current CAS. An Energy Sector Adjustment Loan is also now being discussed with the authorities, with the objectives of improving the regulatory environment in the power sector and setting up a well-functioning wholesale market for electricity.

The definition of a new energy model that would be more attractive to private investment involves other complex pricing reforms, such as reducing the rigidity in upstream gas supply contracts and introducing capacity payments to provide incentives for creating energy supply margins. D. Medium-Term Issues 43. The net debt ratio of the public sector is sensitive to variations in interest, exchange and economic growth rates as depicted in Figure 7. A vulnerability exercise undertaken by the staff indicates that even under fairly extreme assumptions the public debt dynamics do not follow an explosive path in the medium term. The exercise examined the impact of a sharp increase in interest rates (by 1,100 basis points, to 30 percent) in the last quarter of 2001 (with a subsequent decline to 20 percent by end-2002, still 100 basis points above their current level) and separately of a depreciation of the exchange rate to R$3.25 per US$l , which would bring the cumulative depreciation for the year to about 65 percent. The scenarios assume that real GDP growth stays at 2% percent over the medium term (compared to the 4 percent envisaged in the program) and that there is no fiscal policy response to the shocks, with the primary balance target remaining at 3% percent of GDP. Inevitably, the increase in interest rates or the depreciation of the currency provokes a sharp increase in the net public debt stock, from 49.4 percent of GDP at end-2000 to about 62.5 percent in 2002. However, as interest rates decline to levels more consistent with longer term developments in the economy (though remaining high in real terms) and the real exchange rate stabilizes, the debt-to-GDP ratio also stabilizes in the medium term. 44. Under less pessimistic assumptions than those used in the vulnerability exercise above, the goal of reducing the ratio of net public debt to GDP through the attainment of significant primary surpluses in the coming years is achievable. Staff baseline projections show that primary surpluses of 3.5 percent of GDP over the medium term combined with a decline in real interest rates after 2002 (albeit with real interest rates being higher than during 1999-2001) are consistent with a gradual decline of the net debt ratio to 48.1 percent of GDP in 2006 (Table 11). Cognizant of the need to ensure the stability of the debt dynamics, the authorities have increased the primary surplus target from the original 2.3 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.5 percent in the 2002 Budget Guidelines Law, and have maintained the target over the medium term. The authorities remain committed to cautious public debt management, with the aim of lengthening maturities and improving the composition of the public debt stock by reducing the share of foreign exchange-indexed securities. 45. Maintenance of primary surpluses of 3% percent of GDP in the medium term would, in the context of declining interest rates, imply a significant increase in public sector saving, thereby contributing to a substantial improvement in the external current account.

Assuming a private sector saving offset of three-quarters (which accords with the preliminary results of staff analysis of the savings offset in Brazil, and with the results of studies of the offset in Latin America more generally), this net increase of 5 percent of GDP in public saving would, ceterisparibus, contribute to a reduction in the external current account deficit from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to 3% percent of GDP in 2006. 46. Consistent with these assumptions, the mission’s medium-term balance of payments projections forecast a gradual decline in the current account deficit to about 3% percent of GDP by 2006 (Table 12). The stronger current account performance is projected to be driven by a widening trade surplus, with the growth of exports outstripping that of imports and the terms of trade continuing to improve modestly. Direct investment is projected to remain at its 2001 level, thus covering about 90 percent of the current account deficit in the medium term, and reserve coverage is projected to improve steadily. In this scenario, total external debt is projected to remain more or less constant in U.S. dollar terms, while declining from 39.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 36 percent in 2006. 47. Recognizing the importance of increasing trade as a means of promoting economic growth and improving living standards, the authorities remain committed to pursuing trade liberalization at the regional and multilateral levels (Paragraph 32). Discussions within Mercosur have sought to allow some flexibility in the implementation of the common external tariff, and the tariff surcharge of 2% percent will reduced by 1 percentage point between January and December 2002. The authorities are also pursuing further regional trade liberalization by negotiating preferential trade agreements as a block with the EU and other countries of Latin America that would be compatible with a future Free Trade Area of the Americas. However, the authorities expressed concern that industrial country trade restrictions on Brazil’s most competitive exports could frustrate efforts to increase Brazilian exports in the medium term (Box 6). V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 48. The Brazilian authorities have continued to perform well under the previous and current Stand-By Arrangements, notwithstanding a progressive deterioration of the external environment over the course of the year and the emergence of a domestic energy shortage. This strong performance has been maintained to the present, with all end- September performance criteria and indicative targets having been met. Recently, however, progress on the structural reform agenda has been slower than expected, and the political calendar is likely to limit further progress on some important initiatives.

Trade Barriers Faced by Brazilian Exports in Industrial Country Markets At a time of restricted access to international capital markets, the turnaround in Brazil’s trade balance has alleviated some of the pressure for external financing. However, this adjustment has been limited by a slowdown in demand for Brazil’s exports and by protectionism in Brazil’s largest export markets. The barriers faced by Brazil’s exports into the most important industrial markets, the United States, Japan and the European Union, are particularly noteworthy. While these economies are generally very open, they have tariff peaks and nontariff barriers that apply to imports of many products for which Brazil has comparative advantage. Table 1 shows the tariff barriers that apply to the top 25 product categories from Brazil into the U.S. by value, including under the preferential access of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), in 2000. Three broad categories of exports face particularly high tariffs: tobacco and tobacco products (9 1 percent); articles of footwear (14.1 percent); and preparations of fruits and vegetables (11.3 percent). Of these, only preparations of fruits and vegetables receive a significant margin of preference under the GSP (43 percent). Within other broad categories there may be very high tariff peaks also. A recent study by Brazil’s Ministry of Industry and Trade shows that the trade weighted average tariff for 15 major exports of Brazil to the U.S. is 45.6 percent.’ In addition to ad valorem tariffs, many of Brazil’s exports face nontariff barriers and less transparent forms of protection. For example, in the United States orange juice concentrate is subject to a specific charge which, depending on the price, is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff of close to 50 percent. Other exports such as sugar and tobacco are limited by quotas or tariff quotas. In the case of tobacco, the extra-quota tariff is as high as 350 percent. In the area of steel and steel products, Brazil is also one of the potentially countries most affected by U.S. antidumping measures, with duties ranging from 6 percent to 142 percent. These barriers are not limited to the US. Exports of Brazil to the European Union also face substantial barriers. Soybean products and coffee face significant tariff escalation, which discourages exports of higher value added products. Sugar, orange juice, beef and chicken meat are subject to quota restrictions and specific tariffs that range from an ad-valorem tariff equivalent of 33 to 115 percent. In Japan, Brazilian exports face similar barriers in many of these same products, as well as quotas and high tariffs (up to 30 percent) on leather and leather products, such as shoes. With such restrictive barriers in important export markets, it is understandable that Brazil is pursuing trade agreements to open up these markets. However, to enter into these agreements Brazil will also have to reform its own trade regime. Brazil remains, in many respects, a significantly protected economy. The average of the Mercosur common external tariff is 13.2 percent, still nearly three times higher than the average for most industrial markets. Many of the most important imports enter into Brazil under much higher tariffs, that reach a maximum of 35 percent for automobile goods and certain capital goods. In addition, Brazil imposes quotas on products related to the automobile industry, as well as trade-related investment measures, minimum import prices, and an extensive system of import licensing which has been the subject of consultations at the WTO. Brazil is also an active user of contingency protection, principally antidumping measures. Between 1998 and 2000 Brazil applied 56 antidumping measures, with the U.S. and China being the most frequently affected; 37 of the measures were still in place as of end December 2000.” i SECEX, 2001; “Barreiras as exportaqbes brasileiras” ii SECEX, 2001; “Relatorio DECOM, 2000: medidas de defesa comercial antidumping compensatdrias salvaguardas.” Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - 49. As in most emerging market economies, financial markets in Brazil were hit hard in the weeks immediately following the September 11 events. However, by early December losses had been fully reversed. Nevertheless, the international environment remains volatile, and Brazil’s large (though diminishing) external financing requirement leaves it susceptible to shifts in market sentiment. In addition, considerable uncertainties persist in the domestic political environment in the run up to next October’s presidential election. Thus, the authorities will need to maintain the proactive policy stance they have exhibited this year. 50. Growth in 2001 and 2002 is likely to remain slow, in part because of the weak international environment, the domestic energy shortage, and the impact of monetary tightening in the first half of 2001. Domestic demand growth slowed substantially beginning in the second quarter, and is expected to recover only gradually over the course of 2002. However, the external sector’s contribution to growth is projected to strengthen, despite weak activity in partner countries, due to the impact of the large depreciation of the real earlier this year. As a result, the external current account deficit is expected to decline markedly in 2002, covered largely by net foreign direct investment. Brazil’s external public sector amortization requirements in 2002 are low and external financing needs are expected to be relatively easily covered, even under conservative assumptions about rollover rates. 51. Inflation has been higher than expected in 2001, and will exceed the 6 percent ceiling for the official inflation target. The failure to achieve the 2001 inflation target is unfortunate but perhaps inevitable, given the large unexpected shocks that have affected Brazil this year. In these circumstances, the review discussions with the staff during the first quarter of next year will focus on ensuring that policies remain broadly on track for achieving a 2002 inflation result of between of 31/2-5X percent, within the upper consultation bands under the arrangement. Weak domestic demand, and-if they persist-the recent decline in oil prices and appreciation of the real should contribute to reduced price pressures in 2002. However, the inflation forecast is subject to considerable uncertainty, with respect to both the size of administrative price increases next year and the possible delayed effect of the exchange rate adjustment this year. Thus, despite the economic slowdown there is little scope at present to relax monetary policy, and the authorities should stand ready to tighten policy as needed to defend the inflation target. 52. More generally, the authorities’ intention to rebalance in 2002 the mix of monetary policy and intervention in the foreign exchange market is welcome. After raising interest rates between March and July, the authorities have left the overnight interest rate unchanged, relying exclusively on small daily spot market interventions and the sale of foreign exchange-indexed debt (along with regulatory measures affecting bank reserve requirements and provisioning) to stabilize the exchange rate and avoid the effects of depreciation on inflation. As a result, the share of foreign exchange-indexed debt in the public debt stock has risen markedly over the course of the year. A policy of continued large- scale sales of exchange rate-indexed debt would prove difficult to sustain and would expose the public sector to considerable risk in the event of a renewed depreciation of the real. The authorities plan to reduce the scope of daily spot market intervention, to limit the net sale of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - foreign exchange-indexed debt to exceptional circumstances, and to seek where possible to reduce the stock of these instruments through 2002. In addition, they will tighten liquidity further in concert with any net sale of exchange rate-indexed debt or a larger than planned spot market intervention. This new strategy represents an appropriate rebalancing of policies. 53. The banking sector appears fundamentally sound, with low levels of nonperforming loans and solid provisioning that should help banks ride out a slowdown in economic growth. In addition, banks appear to be well-positioned to withstand any additional volatility in the exchange rate in the coming months. A number of regulatory and supervisory reforms are planned for the financial system-in line with understandings under the program-and the upcoming FSAP exercise will provide an opportunity to review measures in place and identify areas where additional actions could be needed. In this respect, the delay in satisfying the structural benchmark for the revision and upgrade of the plan of accounts for financial institutions is unfortunate, although the authorities expect to complete this reform by end-December. Progress with the restructuring of the federal banks to date has been satisfactory. However, while measures to increase the transparency of operations and strengthen management capacity are critical, the most important element of the reform program is a shift in the corporate culture at these institutions to one more fully consistent with their new private sector orientation. Such a change in culture will by necessity take time. Progress in listing the shares of Banco do Brasil, the largest federal bank, on Bovespa’s Nova Mercado could hasten the process of increasing private sector participation in the banks. 54. Fiscal performance continues to be strong, with the public sector primary surplus exceeding the program target. The slowdown in economic growth has thus far had little net impact on revenue performance, as strong growth in collections from exchange rate sensitive taxes has offset a somewhat weaker outcome in other taxes. Some of this over-performance is expected to decline over the remainder of 200 1, but the staff advised the authorities to try to preserve some of the fiscal margin observed earlier in the year, both to avoid an undesirable expenditure acceleration in the last quarter of the year and to contribute further to recent improvements in market confidence. 55. The authorities’ commitment to maintain the program’s original nominal primary surplus targets for 2002 despite the projected slowdown in growth is welcome. Revenue forecasts for the budget are consistent with the projected macro framework, but a further deterioration in the economic environment could put pressure on budget receipts. In addition, spending pressures could rise as next year’s presidential election draws near. In this respect, both the Fiscal Responsibility Law and the debt rescheduling agreements signed by state and local governments with the treasury give considerable confidence that fiscal performance will not be severely disrupted by the political calendar. The good fiscal track record of the current administration and the authorities’ pledge to offset any performance shortfall at the subnational government level with overperformance at the central government level gives further cause for comfort that the primary surplus target for 2002 will be reached. However, in part owing to the rapid increase in foreign exchange linked debt this year, the overall fiscal balance and debt/GDP ratio are highly sensitive to a further depreciation of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - real, and the authorities should therefore stand ready to tighten fiscal policy further in 2002 should external conditions warrant. 56. The mixed progress to date in structural reforms stands in marked contrast to the otherwise strong performance under the program, and the authorities should redouble their efforts in this area. While the limited time remaining on the congressional calendar may constrain the scope for further reforms, the authorities should nevertheless make every effort to attain progress on remaining items in the structural reform agenda, including the reform of the central bank law, which would contribute substantially to increased investor confidence in the run up to next year’s presidential election. Pending structural reforms in the fiscal area are also important to strengthen the medium-term fiscal policy stance. 57. The continued successful implementation of the government’s energy saving plan, better-than-projected rainfall, and reduced demand due to the slowdown in economic activity have combined to reduce concerns about the impact of the energy shortage. However, this should not weaken the authorities’ determination to make further progress in strengthening the energy regulatory framework, to encourage private investment in the sector and pave the way for the eventual privatization of public sector energy generation companies. 58. The maintenance of public sector primary surpluses on the order of 3% percent of GDP should contribute to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio and a strengthening of the current account in the medium term. External adjustment would also be aided by further progress in liberalizing the trade regime and reducing external barriers to Brazilian exports. The authorities’ ongoing efforts to enhance trade liberalization on a bilateral, regional and multilateral basis, and to seek the removal of restrictions placed by advanced countries on key Brazilian exports are therefore encouraging. 59. Brazil’s statistical base is adequate for effective surveillance. Brazil has subscribed to the SDDS, and has recently begun the publication of broad monetary aggregates on a redefined, internationally comparable basis and of quarterly GDP data by expenditure categories at current and constant prices, thereby satisfying the two end- September statistical benchmarks under the program. In addition, the authorities are continuing to work on the preparation of an official producer price series. The Fund’s Statistics Department envisages sending a technical assistance mission to Brazil early in fiscal year 2003 to prepare the ROSC data module. 60. In summary, Brazil has performed strongly under the program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund, and all end-September performance criteria and indicative targets have been met. Although one structural benchmark was delayed, it is expected to be completed by end-December. The overall stance of macroeconomic policies is appropriate, and the staff is confident that the authorities will continue to adjust policies as needed to achieve the objectives of the program. Accordingly, the staff recommends the completion of the First Review under the Stand-By Arrangement. It also recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Brazil take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Safeguards Assessments The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) is subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the stand-by arrangement. Under the Fund’s safeguards policy, the safeguards assessment should be completed by no later than the first review of the stand-by arrangement. A Stage One safeguards assessment of the CBB is underway, but is not expected to be completed by the time of the Executive Board discussion of the first review. Nonetheless, based on the analysis completed so far and discussions with the external auditors, staff has not identified widespread areas of vulnerabilities in the CBB’s safeguards which should delay completion of the first review. Staff expects to complete the safeguards assessment by no later than the second review of the arrangement, which would incorporate any needed remedial measures. VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement On July 1, 1994 the Brazilian authorities introduced a new currency, the real, with a floating exchange rate subject to a floor of parity with the U.S. dollar. On March 6, 1995 the authorities adopted a system of adjustable exchange rate bands consisting of a wider band (adjusted once a year) and a more narrow band (adjusted several times a month). The operational band was the miniband until January 12, 1999, and the maxiband thereafter. On January 12, 1999 the miniband was R$1.1975-R$1.2115 per U.S. dollar. On January 13, 1999 the miniband was abolished and the exchange rate was allowed to fluctuate within the wider band (maxiband). Also on January 13, 1999, the maxiband was widened from R$l .12- R$1.22 per U.S. dollar (established on January 20, 1998) to R$l.20-R$1.32 per U.S. dollar. On January 15, 1999, the wider band was also abolished and the real left to float for the day. On January 18, 1999, the independent floating of the real was confirmed as the new foreign exchange regime. Through November 1999, Brazil continued to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, although it no longer maintained restrictions under this Article. The dual exchange rate arrangement-consisting of an official (or “commercial”) market for most current and capital transactions and of a “fluctuating” market for tourism, some nontrade related services, private unilateral transfers and nonregistered capital account operations-was eliminated as of February 1, 1999. Still, two issues-the rate of the financial operations tax (IOF) on exchange operations carried out in relation to credit card purchases abroad by residents, and the requirement that importers enter into forward FX contracts for the payment of imports financed under certain conditions-had been giving rise to restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. With a letter dated November 11, 1999, the Brazilian authorities informed the Fund that they had decided to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, effective November 30, 1999. Subsequently, they abolished, as of October 30, 1999, the requirement for importers mentioned above; the other remaining Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - APPENDIX I restriction was removed on February 1,2000, when the IOF rate on exchange operations carried out in relation to credit card purchases abroad by residents was lowered to 2 percent. IX. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation with Brazil was concluded by the Executive Board on November 27, 2000 (EBS/00/223). Brazil is on the standard 12-month cycle. X. Technical Assistance in 1998-01 The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), in September 1998, provided technical assistance (TA) to Brazil on estimating the extent of evasion of social security contributions and improving the collection of social security contributions. A mission from FAD, with the participation of World Bank staff, visited Brazil in January 1999 to provide TA assistance for complementary social security reforms. A follow-up mission, which evaluated the sustainability of the social security system in light of the reforms that had already been carried out, and focused on advising on reforms of the social security system for public sector workers, visited Brazil in January 200 1. In February 1999, FAD provided TA on social safety nets while participating in the area department mission; FAD staff also did follow-up work in the same area while participating in area department missions in March 2000 and July/August 2000. Brazil has also continued to receive technical assistance from FAD on reforming the social security administration through various visits by an FAD staff member, including in the context of the January 200 1 mission. In September 2001 an FAD mission conducted a fiscal ROSC, and in December 2001 an FAD mission provided TA on tax reform. The Brazilian authorities have a good track record in implementing TA recommendations in the fiscal area. Several missions from the Statistics Department (STA) visited Brazil during 1998-2001 to provide TA on money and banking statistics, quarterly national income accounts, and government finance. These missions conducted a detailed evaluation of Brazil’s economic statistics, examined the legal and institutional framework for compiling and disseminating statistics, and assessed Brazil’s data dissemination practices. These missions also assisted the national authorities in the subscription of Brazil to the SDDS in early March, 200 1. In April 2001 a money and banking statistics mission visited Brazil to continue the ongoing work with the BCB in improving the analytical quality of Brazil’s monetary aggregates. In the context of Fund surveillance, a mission from the Legal Department (LEG) and the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department (MAE) visited Brazil in October 1999 to review exchange regulations and discuss issues related to Brazil’s acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. As mentioned above, Brazil consequently accepted, effective November 30, 1999, the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and abolished the two remaining restrictions that were identified. Two missions from MAE visited Brazil in January and February 2000, respectively, to assess compliance with the Base1 Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, and to assess Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - APPENDIX I the observance of the Code of Good Practices and Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies (Code). The former mission was carried out jointly with the World Bank. XI. Resident Representative The Fund maintains a resident representative office in Brasilia.

The Board approved the 2001 CAS Progress Report in May 200 1. The first programmatic fiscal reform adjustment operation (US$750 million plus one percent) was approved in the first quarter of CYO 1. A complementary technical assistance program covering budget, financial, and debt management reforms was approved a few months later. The first programmatic financial-sector adjustment loan (US$400 million plus one percent), covering banking and corporate reforms, was approved in the second quarter of CYOl and technical assistance support in these areas has also been approved. Further adjustment lending is envisaged in CY02 in these two areas, as well as in energy sector regulation. The World Bank has pursued an investment-lending program both through new loans and equally importantly by pursuing existing operations. New investment and guarantee operation approved by the Board in FYOl and so far in FY02 have been the following: Investment Loans/Guarantees, FYOl/FYO2 Amount, US$ Million Land-Based Poverty Alleviation 202.1 Gas Sector Development Guarantee 180.0 Bahia Basic Education 1 69.6 Ceard Basic Education 90.0 Fiscal & Financial Management Technical Assistance 8.9 Cear6 2nd Rural Poverty 37.5 Bahia 2nd Rural Poverty 54.4 Pernambuco 2nd Rural Poverty 30.1 Piaui 2nd Rural Poverty 22.5 Goi6s State Highway 65.0 Financial Sector Technical Assistance 14.5 Among analytic and advisory services, the World Bank continues to cooperate with the Brazilian Federal Treasury and the BCB in the areas of public debt management as well as access to financial sector services. The Bank collaborates with the Ministry of Social Security on various aspects of social security reform and with the Ministry of Planning on the Piano PZurianuaZ. The Bank is just completing a study of growth policies for Brazil and another of the causes and effects of inequality. Other studies completed in the past year have been on fiscal federalism, on transfer programs directed at school attendance and eradication of child labor, on poverty reduction policies in CearB, and on progressive housing policies. Work is advancing on state economic memoranda for Rio Grande do Norte, Piaui, and MaranhZo, on trade policy, on labor market reforms, and on the federal education fund, Fundef Support for further improvements in the quality of social spending is embedded in several non-lending and lending operations. ’ Prepared by the staff of the World Bank.

Both of the loans approved in 1999 have a repayment period of live years and a grace period of three years. The interest rate is LIBOR + 400 basis points and a 0.75 percent commitment fee and a one-time service charge of 1 percent applies. There is no national counterpart requirement. The basic features of each operation are described below: Sectoral loan for social protection and reform This program included support for programs being implemented and was aimed at improving the efliciency and targeting of social spending-programs which constitute Brazil’s social safety net-as well as funding for new reforms in health, education, labor, and social welfare. The conditionality of the tranches was based on the continued satisfactory execution (material and financial) of the selected programs, and on progress in implementing social policy. This program receives partial funding from the World Bank. After an extended analysis by its Social Affairs Committee, the Federal Senate approved this loan in October 1999. The contract was signed on November 5, 1999 and disbursement of the first tranche (US$l .122 billion) was immediately disbursed. The second tranche (US$660 million) was disbursed on April 2000, and the third and last tranche (US$418 million) was disbursed on December 2000. ’ Prepared by the staff of the IDB.

The loan contract for this program was signed on July 28, 1999 and was completely disbursed by December 2000. Existing investment program and activities The ongoing lending program of the IDB in Brazil consists of 50 loans, with a total committed value of US$9,436.7 million (The two emergency loans, already disbursed, are not included in this figure). There are also 26 technical assistance projects, with a total budget of US$37.7 million; 22 microprojects totaling US$3.9 million, and 26 operations of the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) for US$61.2 million. The IDB’s strategy in Brazil comprises four areas for action: (i) public sector reform and modernization of government at all levels; (ii) opening up the economy and modernization of the productive sectors, and reduction of Brazil cost; (iii) poverty reduction and provision of basic social needs; and (iv) the environment and natural resources. The basic sectoral composition of the lending program is set out below, in accordance with the four strategic areas. It should be noted that the majority of the programs contribute to progress in more than one of the strategic areas.

In general, Brazil’s statistical base is broadly adequate for surveillance. Nevertheless, weaknesses in some areas hamper policy analysis and formulation. In particular, the national accounts suffer from inadequate data on the aggregate demand components. The coverage and timeliness of public sector statistics outside the federal government need to be improved. Although statistics on money and banking, balance of payments, and external debt are generally good, the classification of data, particularly on money and banking, need to be improved. National Accounts The Brazilian authorities compile national accounts in accordance with the System of National Accounts recommendations from 1993 (SNA 1993). The annual GDP estimates are generated from supply and use tables, which ensures that the estimates are consistent. A main problem of these estimates is a lack of basic time series data, which requires compilers to rely extensively on extrapolation techniques using levels from the 1985 base year, the last year for which economic censuses were conducted. With these data, there is a strong possibility of price assessment errors due to the high inflation that prevailed until mid- 1994, that may affect the accuracy of current-price GDP estimates. Quarterly estimates of GDP (both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted), are compiled in constant prices using the production method with estimates disaggregated by sector of origin. The authorities have published annual national accounts through 1999, and these are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS). Prices There is no official consumer price index (CPI). The IBGE, the private Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), and the University of Sao Paul0 all prepare their own consumer price indices with a different coverage of regions and population groups. The CPIs produced by the IBGE-the National Consumer Price Index (INPC) and the Expanded Consumer Price Index (IPCA)-use the same methodology but cover different income groups in 11 major metropolitan areas. The weights of both indices have been updated in August 1999 on the basis of the 1995-96 household survey. The IPCA has the broadest geographical and population coverage; this index is used by the BCB for the purpose of inflation targeting. Wholesale price indices data are published only by the FGV. Wholesale and consumer price indices are reported regularly for the IFS. The export price data reported for the IFS are total unit values of exports and unit values and wholesale prices of coffee exports. A producer price index is not yet compiled, but could be introduced in 2002. Government Finance Statistics Data on public sector operations suffer from problems of coverage and timeliness, which diminish their usefulness for surveillance. Summary data on revenue and expenditure of the national treasury are reported regularly for publication in the IFS, albeit with some delay. However, no details on the financing of government operations have been reported. Data on Brazil’s government finance statistics for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 64 - APPENDIX IV Yearbook (GFSY) are provided with a lag of 2-3 years and contain important gaps. For example, no data have been reported for 1995, 1996, and the latest data published refers to 1998. Monetary and Financial Sector Data Several missions from the Statistics Department (STA) visited Brazil during 1998-2001 to provide technical assistance on money and banking statistics. The missions found that some problems remained in the sectorization of certain financial system accounts, which undermined the accuracy of the monetary aggregates and the consistency with external and fiscal accounts. STA agreed with the authorities on an action plan to improve the monetary accounts classification by sector and by instrument. The missions also highlighted the importance of expanding the coverage of banking survey data to include financial investment funds and cooperatives, and to expand the coverage of the financial survey to include supplementary pension funds and insurance companies. The BCB is in process of reviewing the national definitions of monetary aggregates to make them compatible with international definitions. A mission by STA that visited Brazil in March-April 2000 conducted a training seminar for BCB staff on the main aspects of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Balance of Payments Brazil has recently began to provide balance of payments information according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM.5). The status of implementation of some of STA’s 1999 mission recommendations still needs to be ascertained. These recommendations include: the exclusion of claims against residents (holdings of Brady bonds issued by the government) from the international reserves data; the use of market prices instead of face values for the recording debt conversions undertaken by Brazil in 1997 and 1999; the introduction of accrual accounting for interest on foreign assets and liabilities of the BCB; the overall revision of the classification of transactions in the exchange record to bring them closer to the standard components of the BPiW.5. For international reserves, valuation adjustments arising from exchange rate changes are now excluded from reserves, and monetary gold is valued at the London market price on the day of the transaction. Brazil does not compile data on the international investment position (IIP); however, work has been started in compiling data in this regard. Quarterly balance of payments data are reported regularly for publication in the IFS, albeit with considerable delay. Statistical Benchmarks The stand-by arrangement includes the following statistical benchmarks to be completed by end-200 1: (1) begin publication of broad monetary aggregates on an internationally comparable basis; and (2) begin regular publication of full quarterly demand-side national accounts at current and constant prices. The list of statistical benchmarks will be reassessed and amended as necessary during reviews of the program.

That letter had attached a Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) describing the government’s program of policies supported under the SBA. The Government remains fully committed to that program. The MEP attached to this letter outlines recent progress in implementing the Government’s economic policies and discusses its current economic program, as well as the economic outlook for 2002. Also attached is a Technical Memorandum of Understanding that sets out the specific quantitative targets (in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks) that are to be observed under the SBA, which expires on December 13,2002. The strong macroeconomic and structural policies implemented by the Government under the current and previous SBAs have enabled the Brazilian economy to weather recent turbulence in global financial markets. The continued implementation of these policies and further progress on the Government’s structural agenda, as detailed in the attached MEP, will leave Brazil poised to resume more rapid growth of output and employment as the global economic environment improves next year. The Government stands ready to take additional policy measures as appropriate to ensure the attainment of its objectives. During the period of the arrangement, the authorities of Brazil will maintain the usual close policy dialogue with the Fund. Yours sincerely, IS/ Pedro Sampaio Malan Minister of Finance IS/ Arminio Fraga Neto President of the Central Bank of Brazil Mr. Horst Kiihler Managing Director International Monetary Fund Washington, DC 2043 1 United States of America Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - ATTACHMENT II BRAZIL-MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC POLICIES Since the preparation of the last Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) in August 2001, the global economy has sufferedfrom a series of economic shocks that are likely to result in slower economic growth and a more dtfjcult external environment than previously expected. Nevertheless, the more depreciated real exchange rate is already stimulating an improved trade balance, partially offsetting soft domestic demand growth, while monetary andfiscal policy have kept inflationary pressures in check and contributedpositively to external confidence. The maintenance of these policies, along with further progress on the structural reform agenda, will leave Brazil poised to resume more rapid growth of output and employment as the global economic environment improves over the course of 2002. I. RECENT PERFORMANCE OF THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMY 1. Data released since the preparation of the last MEP confirm that a combination of negative economic shocks and necessary policy responses had slowed growth in Brazil even before the events of September 11. Real GDP growth decelerated from 4.5 percent in the first quarter to 1.8 percent in the second quarter of 200 1 (over the corresponding quarters of 2000), mainly due to a slowdown in the manufacturing sector. However, growth in demand for domestically-produced and imported capital goods, principally energy-generating equipment and agriculture machinery, indicates that investment was strong in the first half of 200 1. Economic performance remained weak through the third quarter, with industrial production falling on a seasonally-adjusted basis by 1.8% relative to the second quarter and capacity utilization in industry reaching its lowest level since 1999. Consumer confidence recovered during the third quarter after a steep fall in June following the announcement of energy rationing, but gave up much of that gain in October as the extent of the deterioration in the external environment and its implications for Brazil became clearer. 2. Labor market conditions have begun to reflect the economic deceleration. Employment fell by 0.1 percent in August and 0.6 percent in September compared to the same months in 2000, interrupting a sequence of 22 consecutive monthly increases. However, an even sharper decline in the labor force meant that the 7-day unemployment rate fell by ‘/z percentage point to 6.2 percent from September 2000 to September 2001. Despite recent labor market sluggishness, performance accumulated over the year remains positive: the 7-day unemployment rate averaged 6.2 percent during the first nine months of 2001, well below the 7.5 percent observed during the same period of 2000; average employment was 0.9 percent higher comparing the same periods; and nearly 250 thousand new jobs were created in the formal sector during the last 12 months. 3. The impact of the energy crisis on economic activity has been smaller than initially expected, as households have substantially reduced energy demand in response to price incentives and overconsumption penalties implemented by the Government. Investment by firms in private generation capacity and energy-saving equipment, and the fostering of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - ATTACHMENT II market mechanisms for buying and selling firms’ energy consumption quotas, contributed to minimizing the potential impact of the energy shortage on aggregate supply. 4. The government expects the need for energy savings next year to be considerably lower than in 200 1, with a reduction of quantitative restrictions in most of the country and greater reliance on price mechanisms to restrict demand. Reservoir levels of hydroelectric power stations have recovered satisfactorily in most regions, reflecting the success of the energy saving program and increased rainfall.’ Furthermore, the potential supply of electricity is expected to increase 13.4 thousand MW in 2001-02 by the purchase of electricity from neighboring countries and the beginning of operation of 23 thermoelectric and 15 hydroelectric plants. In addition, as a result of contracting of companies using readily available thermoelectric power generators, electricity supply can potentially be increased by approximately 4.0 thousand MW. The Government will contract capacity up to a limit to be established by the High Level Energy Committee (GCE) on a precautionary basis: the equipment will be installed, but will be operated only if necessary. The fixed costs associated with this installation will be passed on to tariffs nationwide. If operation of these generators becomes necessary, the marginal operating costs will initially be borne by the distributors that purchase this energy and be passed to tariffs at the next adjustment date. 5. Other measures have been taken to spur increases in electricity supply over the medium term. The government has included 9 additional thermoelectric plants in its priority energy program, which now guarantees the supply of natural gas to 32 thermoelectric plants that are expected to increase the total supply of energy in the period 2001/2003. Auctions for licenses to build 7 new hydroelectric plants are scheduled to take place before the end of the year. 6. The progress made in improving the regulatory framework in the electricity sector will reduce uncertainty about the financing of long-term projects and stimulate new investment in the sector. The tariffs charged by distribution companies will be adjusted according to more realistic estimates of cost increases. The new formula will take into account the financial impact of changes in costs incurred within the tariff adjustment period. 7. Inflation has been higher than expected in 2001, largely reflecting the impact of increases in food and administered prices. The passthrough to prices of the depreciation of the real of nearly 40 percent until October has been limited both by macroeconomic policies and by weakening domestic demand. The 12-month rate of consumer price inflation (IPCA) stood at 6.5 percent in September, within the 5.0-7.0 percent bands established under the Stand-By Arrangement for informal consultations with IMF staff. The cumulative increase in ’ Low rainfall and a recent decline in savings in the Northeast required implementation of additional energy saving measures in that region, including the decree of three official holidays in October and November and stiffer penalties for noncompliance with the electricity consumption quotas. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 69 - ATTACHMENT II the IPCA during the first nine months of the year amounted to 5.35 percent, of which about 2.14 percentage points reflected adjustments in contractual prices (including electricity, telecommunication, and transport tariffs, and prices of petroleum products). 8. Wholesale petroleum product prices were increased in early October in line with the formula for quarterly price adjustments, which is based on changes in the exchange rate and in international oil prices. In addition, a schedule for adjustments in electricity tariffs was defined so as to better reflect marginal costs of production and stimulate private investment in the electricity sector. The adjustment will also seek to reduce or eliminate cross-subsidies to the business sector, which should contribute to increased allocative efficiency while minimizing the impact on consumer price inflation. 9. The external current account has strengthened in recent months, in line with the more depreciated real and the deceleration of the economy. The trade balance, which was close to equilibrium in the first half of 200 1, registered a US$ 1.3 billion surplus in the third quarter of 2001, compared to a deficit of US$ 0.1 billion in the same quarter of 2000. This improvement of the trade balance was brought about by an 8.0 percent decline in imports and a 1.3 percent increase in exports in the third quarter (year-on-year). For the first nine months of the year, however, the current account deficit was higher than in the same period of the previous year (US$l7.4 billion, compared to US$l5.6 billion). The major reason underlying this performance was the increase in the remittances of profits and dividends (US$ 1 billion), equipment rentals (US$ 0.9 billion) and interest payments (US$ 0.6 billion). 10. The events of September 11 had a very negative impact on capital market access for emerging markets in general. Nevertheless, net FDI flows to Brazil amounted to US$1.5 billion in September, slightly above the August level. For the first nine months of the year, net FDI stood at US$15.3 billion, down from the extraordinary level of US$22.6 billion recorded in the same period last year. External bond issues earlier in the year have allowed the government to more than cover its external amortization needs for 200 1. The private sector continues to have access to international capital markets, although typically through collateralized or securitized operations at higher interest rates, and some private sector entities have chosen to repay external obligations with domestic resources rather than renew external obligations at higher interest rates. For the four weeks ending October 19 the rollover rate on interbank credit lines averaged 103 percent. 11. Gross international reserves, which stood at US$35.6 billion at end-July, increased to US$40.1 billion as of end-September, reflecting mainly the drawdown of funds made available under the new Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved on September 14. Gross reserves rose from 56 percent of short-term debt (on a residual maturity basis) at end- 2000 to 78 percent at end-September 2001. Also at end-September 2001, net international reserves (NIR), as measured under the program, stood at US$3 1.5 billion, US$l 1.5 billion above the program floor. 12. At end-September, total external debt amounted to US$214.1 billion (40 percent of estimated GDP), broadly unchanged from end-2000, and its public sector component also Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 70 - ATTACHMENT II remained stable, at US$95.9 billion. The short-term component of the external debt, measured on an original maturity basis, decreased to US$25.3billion at end-September from US$27.4 billion at end-2000. Net of debt to the Fund, the nonfinancial public sector external debt stood at US$87.4 billion, below the ceiling under the Stand-By Arrangement of US$95.0 billion (a performance criterion under the program), while the short-term external debt of the nonfinancial public sector equaled US$O.5 billion, also below the ceiling under the Stand-By Arrangement. 13. Fiscal performance remains above programmed levels. The accumulated primary surplus of the consolidated public sector reached R!$41.2 billion in September, R$6.8 billion (about 0.6 percent of estimated annual GDP) higher than the program target. However, reflecting primarily the more depreciated exchange rate, the accumulated public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) reached 7.5 percent of period GDP (R$65.9 billion) in September. The BCB now publishes harmonized PSBR statistics, which exclude from the PSBR depreciation- or appreciation-induced changes in the valuation of the domestic foreign exchange-indexed debt stock incurred but not actually paid during the reference period. Using this harmonized methodology, the PSBR was R$20.5 billion, about 2.3 percent of GDP. In line with the increase in the public sector borrowing requirement, the net public debt rose to 5 1.9 percent of GDP at end-September from 49.4 percent of GDP at end-2000, still below the indicative target ceiling for the net public debt. 14. All levels of government have contributed to the improved fiscal position. For January-September 200 1 the central government primary surplus reached 2.9 percent of period GDP, reflecting strong revenue performance and continued expenditure restraint. The states and municipalities posted a primary surplus of 1.1 percent of period GDP in January- September 2001 (municipalities accounted for 0.8 percent of period GDP) in compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law and the debt rescheduling agreements with the Treasury. The primary surplus of the public enterprises - at 0.8 percent GDP in January-September 2001- reflects not only the favorable impact of the more depreciated exchange rate on the profits of Petrobras (the federal oil company) and Itaipu (the bi-national hydroelectric power plant) but also the strong performance of other public enterprises at all levels of government. On August 3 1, the government submitted to Congress the 2002 budget proposal, which envisages an increase of the public sector primary surplus to 3.5 percent of GDP while preserving social expenditures and capital investment in key areas such as energy generation and transmission. 15. The debt management strategy continued to lengthen maturities and increase duration, despite market turbulence. The average maturity of competitively-placed outstanding securitized federal debt rose from 15.8 months at end-2000 to 24.8 months at end-September 2001 (from 29.9 months to 35.7 months for all securitized federal debt), while average duration grew from 6.3to 11.2 months over the same period. However, in light of increased foreign exchange pressures, the government was unable to further reduce the share of its outstanding foreign exchange-indexed debt or to increase the share of its fixed- return instruments. By end-September, the share of foreign exchange-indexed debt had increased to 3 1.4 percent of outstanding securitized federal debt, up from22.3 percent at end- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7l- ATTACHMENT II 2000. This reflects the depreciation of the exchange rate (6 percentage points) as well as the impact of sales of dollar-indexed debt that took place mainly after September 11 (4 percentage points). 16. Mindful of the potential impact of a continuing decline in the real on inflation, the Central Bank (BCB) adopted a series of regulatory measures to relieve pressure on the exchange rate. At the end of September, the BCB established a 10 percent reserve requirement on time deposits and increased from 60 percent to 80 percent the minimum proportion of required reserves on demand deposits that banks must maintain at the BCB on a daily basis. These measures have substantially reduced the scope for banks to enter into short-term operations that could result in greater exchange rate volatility. In addition, capital requirements on banks’ net foreign exchange positions were recalibrated through an increase in the requirement rate from 33 to 50 percent of exposure, and a reduction in exemption limits from 20 percent to 5 percent of banks’ required capital. With a view to reducing accounting-driven private sector demand for hedge, the stock market regulatory agency (CVM) and the tax authority (SRF) introduced a regulation allowing listed companies to amortize balance sheet losses associated with the depreciation of the real in 2001 over the next four years. The BCB has continued its policy of increasing liquidity in the spot foreign exchange market through daily sales of US$50 million. In addition, on September 1 l-l 3 the BCB responded to extraordinary illiquidity in foreign exchange markets by selling a further US$220 million in the spot market. 17. Bank credit continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace, driven mainly by the deceleration in aggregate demand, uncertainties regarding the domestic and international scenario, and an increase in bank lending rates. Total credit increased by 10.5 percent in the 12 months to September, compared to 16 percent in the 12 months to May 2001. Total credit increased by just 7.2 percent in the third quarter of 2001 (year-on-year), mainly reflecting the debt restructuring and recapitalization of the four main federal banks in June 200 1. 18. As a result of the tightening of monetary policy and increased risk aversion associated with the slowdown in economic growth, average bank lending rates increased from 54.7 percent in May to 62.9 percent in September, while average spreads rose from 38.2 percent to 44.0 percent in the same period. The share of loans with interest payments overdue for 120-l 80 days fell from 7.2 percent of total credit in May to 5.3 percent in September. Prudential indicators remained broadly stable, with the share of illiquid loans (risk category H) declining to 3.6 percent of total loans and total bank provisions equaling R$2 1.7 billion at end-September, more than fully meeting minimum provisioning requirements. 19. Notwithstanding the adverse economic and political environment, the government continued to implement important structural reforms. In November, after congressional approval, the President signed a new corporate law that strengthens the rights of minority shareholders, makes the CVM operationally independent, and improves corporate transparency and governance. The Lower House of Congress approved a constitutional amendment introducing the explicit domestic taxation of petroleum products, paving the way Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - ATTACHMENT II for the full liberalization of the domestic oil market in 2002. This proposed constitutional amendment is now being considered by the Senate. The Government also continued to implement its privatization program, successfully auctioning various oil prospecting licenses and concessions for hydroelectric power plants. In September, the Brazilian Statistical and Geographical Institute (IBGE) began regular publication of quarterly GDP data by expenditure category, and the BCB has begun publication of broad monetary aggregates as redefined on an internationally comparable basis, satisfying the Stand-By Arrangement’s two statistical benchmarks. II. POLICIESANDPROSPECTSFORTHEREMAINDEROF 2001 AND 2002 20. The economic shocks that hit emerging markets underscore the need for firm but flexible management of macroeconomic policies and continued progress on structural reforms, in order to increase the resilience of the economy and to sustain market confidence. As has been the case for many years, the Government therefore remains fully committed to its economic and structural reform program, including the policies and measures outlined in the previous MEP. Thus, fiscal policy will continue to target consolidated public sector primary surpluses of 3.35 percent of GDP in 2001 and 3.5 percent of GDP in 2002; monetary policy will remain geared toward the achievement of the inflation target of 3.50 percent for 2002 minus and plus 2 percentages points; and the structural reform agenda will maintain its focus on the fiscal and financial sectors. 21. The macroeconomic framework for 2001 and 2002 is based on real output growth of 2 percent in 2001 and 2-2s percent in 2002, below the levels projected in the previous MEP. These reduced growth projections reflect the impact of a more difficult external environment. Despite slower import growth in partner countries, the external sector’s contribution to growth is projected to increase in 2002, due in large part to the significant depreciation of the real. On the supply side, growth in 2001 and 2002 is expected to be led by agriculture. The services sector is projected to grow moderately, while growth in the industrial sector-which has slumped in recent months-is expected to recover over the course of 2002. 22. Overall, the current account deficit is projected to narrow marginally, from US$24.6 billion in 2000 to US$23.8 billion in 2001, on the strength of the improved trade balance. Export volumes are projected to rise by about 9 percent in 2001, thanks to the depreciated real and efforts to increase access by Brazilian enterprises to foreign markets, while import volume growth is projected to fall to 6 percent, from 13 percent in 2000, due to relative price effects and the slowdown in domestic demand growth. The terms of trade are expected to improve moderately, reflecting a decline in import prices. 23. The current account balance is expected to improve substantially in 2002, recording a deficit of less than US$20 billion, with the help of continued growth in the trade surplus. While real export growth is projected to slow to 6 percent due to slack international demand, continued weak domestic demand and the lagged impact of the sizable depreciation in 2001 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 73 - ATTACHMENT II are projected to lead to a fall in imports in volume terms of about 2 percent. In addition, a further improvement in the terms of trade of about % percent is forecasted. As a result, the trade surplus is projected to widen to about US$6 billion next year, consistent with recent monthly trends. 24. The capital account projections for the remainder of this year and for 2002 are based on conservative assumptions about investment flows and rollover rates for lending. Net FDI is expected to slow from the record level of US$32.8 billion in 2000 to about US$19 billion in 200 1 and US$l6 billion in 2002, implying monthly flows over the next 15 months about equal on average to those recorded in September of this year. Even at these reduced annual levels, net FDI is expected to cover some 80 percent of the current account deficit in 2001 and 8 1 percent in 2002. Reflecting the assumption of lower rollover rates, the sum of portfolio and other short- and long-term capital flows is expected to turn slightly negative in the fourth quarter of 2001 and in 2002. Nevertheless, the balance of payments is expected to record an overall surplus of slightly more than US$6 billion in 2001, leaving gross reserves at about US$39 billion and NIR at about US$30 billion. For 2002, the overall balance of payments is forecasted to run a deficit of about US$4 billion, leaving gross reserves at US$35 billion and NIR at about US$29 billion. 25. The Government aims at achieving a primary surplus of the consolidated public sector of at least 3.35 percent of GDP in 2001 and 3.5 percent of GDP in 2002, as set out in the attached TMU. The achievement of these fiscal targets, in a less favorable economic environment, underscores the Government’s firm commitment to fiscal consolidation. Achievement of the fiscal targets will be facilitated by the strong performance of all levels of government so far this year, expenditure restraint, and continued efforts to improve the efficiency of the tax system in support of macroeconomic sustainability-an area in which technical assistance will be received from the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF. Prioritized social programs will be preserved in line with the government’s on-going efforts to strengthen social policies. The Fiscal Responsibility Law will continue to be instrumental in guiding fiscal policymaking. 26. Further improvements in state and municipal finances are expected within the framework of the debt rescheduling agreements with the National Treasury and the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The central government will continue to monitor the fiscal performance of the subnational governments and remains committed to adjust its fiscal targets to offset slippages at that level. The public enterprises will continue to perform strongly, helped by the improved prospects for easing the energy saving program in most parts of the country, and the impact of a more depreciated exchange rate on the revenues of Petrobras and Itaipu. 27. Reflecting primarily the more depreciated exchange rate, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is expected to rise to 8.2 percent of GDP in 2001(or 3.6 percent of GDP in the B,CB’s new harmonized methodology), bringing the domestic debt of the consolidated public sector to approximately 56.3 percent of GDP this year. Public debt management will continue to seek to reduce rollover costs, lengthen maturities, increase duration, and diversify the indexation composition of the outstanding debt stock. The fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 74 - ATTACHMENT II targets for 2001 and 2002 are consistent with the stability, and subsequent gradual decline, of public sector indebtedness over the medium term. 28. The Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF has just concluded a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency for Brazil. The report recognizes that in the last few years Brazil has achieved a high degree of fiscal transparency, together with major improvements in the management of its public finances. As the main elements of these improvements, the report highlights: a) the Fiscal Responsibility Law, enacted in May 2000, which sets out for all levels of government fiscal rules designed to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, and strict transparency requirements; b) the medium term expenditure framework aimed at better aligning the allocation of budgetary resources over time to the government’s priorities and regional development strategy; c) and the firm enforcement of the debt restructuring agreements with most states and a large number of municipalities which has been instrumental in promoting sustained fiscal adjustment of subnational governments. The report also stresses that Brazil scores highly with respect to main indicators of fiscal management and transparency; that the coverage of both its fiscal targets and fiscal statistics is commendably broad; that the mechanisms of internal and external control are generally well developed; that fiscal statistics at the federal level are of high quality, timeliness, and detail; and that Brazil is at the forefront of countries at comparable level of development in the use of electronic means for the dissemination of fiscal data. 29. In support of fiscal policies, the Government remains committed to its structural reform agenda. It will seek congressional approval of the constitutional amendment allowing for the explicit domestic taxation of petroleum products, replacing the budget’s oil account and paving the way for the liberalization of the domestic oil market in early 2002. In line with efforts to reform the social security system, the Government will also seek congressional approval of legislation allowing for complementary pension funds for the public sector. Moreover, the Government will continue to work with Congress towards approval of a proposed constitutional amendment to extend the bank debit tax (CPMF) from June 2002, when it is scheduled to expire, through the end of 2004, while implementing measures to avoid or mitigate the negative impact of the CPMF on capital markets. 30. Monetary policy will continue to be conducted within the inflation-targeting framework. Given the shocks that have occurred this year end-year inflation will exceed the upper limit of 6.0 percent for the BCB’s inflation target, and it may also exceed the Stand-By Arrangement’s threshhold for consultation with the Fund staff. Based on current policies, end-2002 inflation is likely to be slightly above the Government’s central target of 3.5 percent. Midpoints and consultation bands established in the previous TMU for end-2001 and March, June, and September 2002 will remain in effect (see the attached TMU). Inflation prospects will continue to be among the aspects considered during quarterly reviews of the program, and the BCB will continue its regular exchange of views with the Fund staff about the evolution of monetary policy.

The BCB remains committed to the floating exchange rate regime, and will continue to avoid targeting any particular level of the exchange rate. Nevertheless, because of concern about the inflationary implications of exchange rate depreciation and volatility, the BCB has sought to offset recent pressures on the exchange rate arising from the extraordinary circumstances since early September by intervening in the foreign exchange market through the sale of foreign exchange-indexed debt. However, the BCB continues to believe that net increases in the stocks of these instruments should be limited to extraordinary circumstances, and maintains the goal of reducing the stock of these instruments as market conditions allow. The BCB stands ready to tighten monetary policy, if necessary, to defend the inflation target. 32. The Government is continuing to work with Congress toward the approval of a new bankruptcy law. In addition, the BCB continues to work to enhance the regulatory framework for banks and to strengthen its off-site supervision systems (see the attached TMU). The BCB is making further progress in its program for the privatization of six federalized state banks: auctions for three of the banks are expected to be completed by year end and those for the remaining banks by June 2002. The Government has committed to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and preliminary work with IMF and World Bank staff on the FSAP has already begun. Reforms to the system of housing finance are being implemented that pursue efficiency on market term transactions and that provide better protection to both lenders and homeowners. Moreover, the Government is working on measures to reduce differences between internationally-accepted accounting standards and those used in Brazil. 33. Brazil continues to pursue trade liberalization at the regional and multilateral levels, while working to enhance the institutional framework of Mercosur. Discussions within Mercosur have been undertaken to design a safeguard mechanism that would allow some flexibility in the implementation of the common external tariff. In addition, the list of exceptions to the common external tariff for member countries has been expanded to 100 tariff items (except for Paraguay, which retains additional exceptions) that can be maintained until end-2002. The tariff surcharge of 2.5 percent will be reduced by 1 percentage point in January 2002 and maintained until end-2002. In addition, there are ongoing reviews of the structure of the common external tariff with Mercosur members. Brazil is pursuing further regional trade liberalization with other members of Mercosur by negotiating preferential trade arrangements as a block with the EU and other countries interested in a FTAA. It is also exploring the possibility of negotiating bilateral trade arrangements with Mexico and China. Brazil is committed to full participation in the upcoming discussions for the possible launch of a new trade round within the World Trade Organization. Seeking the removal of trade restrictions placed by advanced countries on Brazil’s most competitive exports, such as certain agricultural products, steel, textiles and footwear, is a major priority for the Government. 34. Brazil has continued to improve its statistical database, including (as noted above) through the satisfaction of the two statistical benchmarks under the Stand-By Arrangement. In addition, work continues on the preparation of a producer price index. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 76 - ATTACHMENT II 35. In summary, Brazil has not been immune to the shocks that hit the international economy, and the expected decline in economic activity mirrors that occurring in the global economy. In this context, in order not to have the earliest availability date of the purchases associated with the second review close to when the performance criteria of the first quarter apply, we are asking that this earliest availability date be advanced from March 29 to March 22. The measures outlined in this MEP, building on previous policy actions of the Government, will contribute to further enhancements in economic stability and improvements in the well being of the Brazilian people, and will leave the economy poised for more rapid growth of output as the global environment improves over the course of 2002. In addition to the measures described in this MEP, the Government stands ready to adjust policy as needed to ensure the achievement of the objectives of its economic program, and looks forward to a continued close and constructive dialogue with the Fund.

The cumulative primary balance of the consolidated public sector is defined as the sum of the cumulative primary balances of the various entities that make up the public sector. The public sector is defined to comprise the central government, state and municipal governments, and the public enterprises (including federal, state and municipal enterprises); the central government includes the federal government, the social security system, and the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB). 4. For any given month, the primary balance of the consolidated public sector is measured, in Brazilian reais (R$), as the total net interest (i.e., net interest accrued on the consolidated net domestic debt of the public sector, plus the net interest due (compethcia contratual) on the net external debt of the public sector) minus the borrowing requirement of the consolidated public sector, where the public sector is defined as above. For foreign- exchange indexed government securities, the interest rate is the accumulated rate of change of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the R$, plus the fixed coupon rate. The fixed coupon rate applies to the nominal value of the security revalued by the rate of change of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the R$ from the issuance date to the relevant date. For any given month, the borrowing requirement of the consolidated public sector is defined as the change in the nominal outstanding net domestic debt plus the change in the net external debt, converted into R$ at the actual period average R$/US$ exchange rate. i The stock of the U.S. dollar-indexed domestic debt is revalued at the end of a given month to reflect any change in the value of the real vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar that has taken place during the month. The proceeds from ‘Foreign currency debt denominated in currencies other than the US$ is first converted into US$ at actual average exchange rates for the period.

Total net debt outstanding of the consolidated public sector is measured on an accrual basis (including accrued interest) for the domestic debt component, and on an interest-due basis (compethzcia contvatual) for the external debt component. The stock of external debt and of foreign-exchange indexed domestic debt is valued at the actual R$/US$ exchange rate prevailing at the end of each period. 7. The central government will continue to incorporate into its registered debt various unregistered liabilities that are currently outstanding. The above ceilings for the total net debt outstanding of the consolidated public sector are predicated on the paths for privatization receipts (defined here to exclude concession revenue) and the recognition of unregistered liabilities that are shown in Table 2 below. These ceilings will be adjusted downward (adjusted upward) to the extent that privatization receipts exceed (fall short of) the amounts implied by Table 2 below; they will be adjusted upward (adjusted downward) to the extent that the recognition of unregistered liabilities exceeds (falls short of) the amounts implied by Table 2 below.
