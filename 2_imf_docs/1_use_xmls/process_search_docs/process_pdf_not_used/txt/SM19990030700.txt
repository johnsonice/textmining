These positive effects have been recently compounded by efforts at fiscal consolidation and the recent recovery in international crude oil prices. As a result, the fiscal balance would revert to a surplus in 1999/2000, while the external current account deficit would decline significantly. With the coming on stream of sizable exports of LNG and other manufacturing products, Qatar’s medium-term prospects remain highly favorable. Staff appraisal l The authorities are to be commended for sustaining their fiscal consolidation efforts amidst rising oil revenue. The staff strongly endorses the authorities’ fiscal strategy, in particular their intentions to earmark the fiscal surplus to building up foreign assets and reducing the government domestic debt. It cautions, however, against a weakening in fiscal discipline, as the government is facing an exacting debt repayment schedule over the near term. The authorities are encouraged to mobilize non-oil revenue to broaden the tax revenue base and mainly to reduce waste. They are also advised to consider adopting a revenue stabilization fund for managing the long-term use of the hydrocarbon revenues. This fund would facilitate formulating long-term fiscal objectives within a framework that ensures intergenerational economic equity and enhance transparency of public finances. l The sta.fI’urges the authorities to lift the remaining ceiling on deposit interest rates, enhance the use of indirect instruments of monetary policy, and consider increasing the minimum capital adequacy requirements to 10 percent to Cuther strengthen Qatar’s banking system. They are encouraged to continue with their plans to sell minority stakes in publicly-owned enterprises to promote stock market activities and attract foreign investors and expertise and to implement steadfastly the planned pension scheme for nationals, covering as well those working in the private sector. Qatar’s efforts to increase the role of the private sector through the creation of a business-friendly regulatory environment are highly welcomed. l The authorities’ commitment to developing Qatar’s economic and financial data systems is greatly welcomed, as is the progress made at improving monetary sector statistics and enhancing data availability. However, this progress would need to be broadened to cover other key areas to strengthen the adequacy of data for surveillance. The authorities are encouraged to participate in the GDDS, regularly report data to the Fund on core economic indicators, and develop labor market indicators, They are also urged to participate in the fiscal and financial sector transparency exercise, publish the Recent Economic Developments report and issue a Press Information Notice.

Qatar’s heavy dependence on crude oil and its relatively limited oil reserves have prompted the authorities to adopt an outward oriented development strategy since the early 1990s. They have developed, with the support of foreign partners, the country’s massive liquefied natural gas (LNG) reserves, the world’s third largest, expanded crude oil output capacity, and promoted investment in energy-intensive industries, like petrochemicals and fertilizers. In addition, the preservation of Qatar’s natural environment has been an integral part of the development strategy.’ This strategy has led to a sharp increase in the external current account deficit and medium- and long-term external debt, which reached almost US% 10 billion or 90 percent of GDP at the end of 1998. However, the government guarantees only one third of this debt, while the LNG debt servicing is tied to its export proceeds. 2. In concluding the last Article IV consultation discussions on June 7, 1997 with Qatar, Directors supported the authorities’ development strategy and pointed out that the challenge for policymakers was to ensure that the transition to the stage when this strategy began to bear fiuit was managed prudently. To this end, they emphasized the need to strengthen the fiscal position to bring down the external debt level, achieve rapid progress in structural reforms, mainly privatization and deregulation, and foster human capital development. The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of increasing LNG exports and the upturn in international crude oil prices that have led to an improved fiscal and external situation. This improvement has been lately supported by efforts at reducing government expenditure and mobilizing non-oil revenue. With the coming on stream of sizable exports of LNG and other manufacturing products, Qatar would sustain rapid economic growth and experience a further improvement in its financial situation over the medium term. IL BACKGROUNDANDRETENTDEVELOPMENTS 3. Qatar is a small, open economy highly dependent on hydrocarbons and a large expatriate labor force.2 The exchange rate has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since the early 198Os, within a framework of a currency board-type arrangement.’ The exploitation over the past years of the country’s crude oil and massive LNG reserves has resulted in rapid economic i For the development of the latest LNG project &&as), the authorities completed a comprehensive environment impact assessment and have in place a monitoring program on ecological coastal biological health and water sediment quality. 2 For a description of Qatar’s trade regime, see Chapter 9 in Selected Issues and Recent Economic Developments report (to be issued shortly). 3 Under this arrangement, Qatar Central Bank is required to maintain reserve cover for currency issues of at least 100 percent. As of end-June 1999, this coverage was over 200 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- growth and investment. Real GDP growth accelerated from about 3 percent a year in the early 1990s to over 10 percent in recent years, while investment doubled, reaching almost 40 percent of GDP over the same period. In addition, growth has been also spurred by increasing output of petrochemicals, fertilizers and refined products, and strong construction activity. Moreover, the country’s economic transformation is taking place amidst an opening up of the decision-making process.4 4. The Qatari economy continued to grow rapidly in 1998, despite the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade, leading to a loss of export income equivalent to 3.5 percent of GDP. Increasing oil and LNG output, together with higher production of petrochemicals and fertilizers, mitigated the impact of this deterioration on economic activity and exports (Table 1 and Chart 1). Performance has been also good by comparison to other regional oil producer countries (Chart 2). Nevertheless, reflecting the terms of trade effects, real gross domestic income increased by only about 3 percent in 1998.’ 5. However, plunging oil prices negatively affected the country’s fiscal position in 1998. In response, the authorities tightened fiscal policy through budgetary cuts and mobilization of non-oil revenue. In fiscal year 1998/99 (the fiscal year starts in April), noninterest expenditure was reduced by 9.4 percent by lowering purchases, laying off expatriate civil servants, and cutting utilities capital outlays. Non-oil revenue (excluding investment income) increased by 17 percent due mainly to rising health care and education charges for expatriates and working permit fees, and higher gasoline prices. Notwithstanding these measures, the budget deficit worsened slightly to almost 10 percent of GDP in 1998/99, as total interest payments continued to rise and investment income declined sharply (Table 2 and Chart 3). This deficit was financed by the proceeds from the partial privatization of Qatar Telecommunication Company (Q-Tel), and foreign and domestic borrowing.6 In the past two years, the government also borrowed heavily from the domestic banking system to finance a capital contribution into the publicly-owned petroleum company. As a result, the central government’s debt reached 57 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 1998199. 4 In March 1999, Qatar held its first nationwide election for a new central municipal council, including female candidates and voters. In addition, in July 1999, the Emir established a committee to draw up a constitution, under which Qatar wiII have an e&ted parliament. 5 Real GDP is adjusted for the terms of trade effects (real gross domestic income) to capture the changes in real income generated by the changes in export and import prices. See Chapter 3 in Selected Issues and Recent Economic Developments report (to be issued shortly). 6 In December 1998, the government sold 45 percent of its stake in Q-Tel for the equivalent of US$742 million, of which US$640 million were used to finance the budget deficit.

Net domestic credit to the public sector rose by 25.3 percent, and credit to the private sector increased by 12 percent, mostly on account of higher lending for personal consumption and real estate (Table 3 and Chart 4). Although time and savings deposits in local currency increased significantly following the liberaliiation of long-term deposit interest rates earlier in the year, the commercial banks drew down their net foreign assets to finance the demand for credit. Also, Qatar Central Bank (QCB) occasionally injected liquidity for short periods. In addition, in order to discourage excessive credit expansion, QCB has limited, since August 1998, commercial banks’ real estate financing from 50 percent to 20 percent of the total value of a project. Broad money grew by 8 percent by the end of 1998, down from almost 10 percent in the previous year. 7. The external current account deficit worsened in 1998, on account of the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade. The deficit increased by 4 percentage points of GDP to 29 percent of GDP; excluding LNG-related imports, it reached 14 percent of GDP, of which about 80 percent reflected outward remittances by the large expatriate community in the country.7 Export volume grew by about 25 percent, in particular of LNG, in spite of the downturn in the Asian market, while import volume increased by less than 1 percent following the completion of some projects. The debt service ratio rose from the equivalent of 17 percent to 28 percent due mainly to maturing government loans, while gross official reserves stood at about US$l billion by the end of 1998.’ These reserves were equivalent to almost 90 percent of short-term government external debt (on a remaining maturity basis) and around 3 months of imports of goods and services (Table 4 and Chart 5). 8. The banking sector remained sound and its profits increased in 1998, while the financial sector was further strengthened, Banks in Qatar have capital adequacy ratios considerably above the international recommended level of 8 percent, while the average rate of return on equity of Qatar-i banks remained above the regional average (Box 1). This performance reflects, in part, the large spreads that the banks maintain between their lending and borrowing rates due to QCB cap on short-term deposit interest rates (Chart 4).’ Furthermore, despite the sharp drop experienced in 1998, commercial banks’ net foreign assets remained sizable. QCB’s self-assessment of its supervisory practices revealed that it was largely in compliance with the Basle Committee’s Core Principles. The authorities ’ The external current account figures should be interpreted with care because they do not fully incorporate the inflow of the nongovernment sector’s income and they misclassify some capital movements as current transfers. 8 These reserves only include QCB gross foreign assets, as no information is available on the government’s foreign assets. ’ A flexible ceiling remains on deposit interest rates with a maturity of less than 12 months, ‘set at one percentage point above QCB central rate.

Moreover, Qatar’s equity market increased by 35 percent by the end of 1998 relative to the end of 1997, outperforming other GCC countries’ stock market (Chart 2). Box 1: Qatar’s Banking Sector” l Qatar’s banking system is highly concentrated and exposed to the government sector. In 1998, the three largest local banks, out of 15 banks, controlled about 67 percent of total assets of the banking system and accounted for about 70 percent of total loans extended in that year. Credit to the public sector covers about half of commercial bank credit. Owing mainly to the sharp increase in government borrowing in 1998, the loans-to-deposits ratio increased to 106 percent. l Recent liberalization and modernization of the banking system activity includes: (i) the introduction of a country-wide ATM and POS SWITCH system (NAPS) in April I997 and the extension of the system, as the fist element of the GCC net linking, to the Kuwaiti (October 1997) and the U.A.E. (May 1999) banking systems; (ii) the elimination of the interest rate cap on local currency time deposits with a maturity beyond 15 months (April 1998), later on extended to maturities beyond 12 months (January 1999); (iii) the unification of reserve requirements; and (iv) the adoption of foreign exposure limits. l To complement the liberalization process, the authorities have strengthened supervision and prudential regulations. In particular, limits on risk concentration have been tightened. Any single or related group of borrowers may borrow up to the equivalent of 20 percent of bank capital and reserves. Bauks are required to submit a quarterly report on large exposures (10 percent of capital and reserves); credit exposure to all board members is capped at 35 percent of capital, with the lending to a single board member limited at 7 percent. In addition, in 1998, QCB introduced new guidelines for accounting standard and policies for Islamic banks, and the period of loan classification for under performance was shortened from 6 to 3 months. Most banks meet comfortably the capital adequacy requirements, set at 8 percent, which ranged between 10-54 percent in June 1999, reflecting the comfortable level of capital and the large share of claims on government (a zero risk borrower by Cook’s standards) in their portfolio. Iu addition, banks are required to comply with International Accounting Standards, publish annual financial statements approved by QCB and verified by two independent external auditor firms. Also, iu order to discourage credit expansion to the real estate sector, QCB has limited since August 1998 commercial banks’ real estate financing from 50 percent to 20 percent of the total value of a project. l Available information on the nonperforming loans of the two largest Qatari banks (covering 60 percent of total loans extended by the banking system) indicates that the ratio of nonperforming loans to gross assets has steadily declined since 1995, and stood at about 2 percent in 1998. Also, the average rate of return on equity of the Qatari banks rose steadily in the past few years to 17 percent iu 1998, with the performance of I I banks above the regional average. lo For a detailed analysis of Qatar’s banking system see Chapter 7 in Selected Issues and Recent Economic Developments report (to be issued shortly).

Preliminary information for 1999 indicated a significant improvement in the focal accounts and lower credit growth. Fiscal performance during the first two quarters of the 1999/2000 fiscal year (April-September) indicated that the budget reached a surplus of about QR 1 billion, as total expenditure remained broadly within the budgeted amount, and oil revenue was 33 percent higher than budgeted. Monetary developments showed a deceleration in net credit growth to both the public and private sector, with broad money growing by 6 percent to the 12 months ending in June 1999 and net foreign assets recovering. In addition, the stock market dipped 8 percent from end-December 1998 to end-April 1999, but it fully recovered by end-September 1999. In contrast, Q-Tel shares remained 4 percent below their December 1998 level. In addition, the government issued a lo-year eurobond for US$l billion and 3-year government bonds for QR 2 billion in the first half of 1999. Also, in February 1999, the authorities transferred the operation and maintenance of the country’s largest and newest power and water desalination plant to the private sector. They amended in 1999 the copyright, trademark, and intellectual property right laws in compliance with WTO agreements. III. REPORT ON mm DIXUWONS 10. The policy discussions focused on: (a) the outlook and policies for 1999 and 2000, medium-term prospects, and the long-term management of the windfall gains from LNG; (b) the progress made in advancing deregulation and private sector development and the labor market; and (c) the ongoing efforts to strengthen the quality and availability of economic and financial data. A. Outlook and Policies for 1999-2000 and Medium-Term Prospects 11. The economic outlook in 1999 and 2000 is highly favorable. As a result of long- term contracts with Korea and Japan, LNG exports would surge to 6 million tons by the end of 1999. Although Qatar has cut daily oil production by about 10 percent to comply with the March 1999 OPEC quota agreement, crude oil export earnings are expected to increase, as average crude oil prices would rise 38 percent to US$16.8 per barrel in 1999. Thus, oil revenue could be more than double the budgeted level in 1999/2000 fiscal year. In 2000, LNG exports would rise further to 9.2 million tons, while, on average, oil prices would increase to almost US$l9 per barrel (Table 1). l1 In addition, most vulnerability indicators would show an important improvement in the near term (Table 5). Economic activity and growth 12. Real GDP would grow at about 8 percent a year, on average, in 1999-2004. The expansion of LNG exports and oil output capacity together with the investment in the I1 The projected growth rates of crude oil prices over the medium term are based on the October 1999 WE0 projections.

Non-oil/LNG activities would also remain strong, reflecting mainly the investments in the electricity and water sector, rising output capacity in petrochemical and refined products and strong LNG-related construction activities. As a result, real GDP per capita would increase significantly over the medium term, despite rapid population growth. The authorities explained that their economic strategy was to derive maximum benefit from the country’s large resource endowments. In this context, they intend to become a leading world supplier of LNG and continue with their ongoing efforts at divers-g into energy-intensive heavy industries using gas as a feedstock, allowing Qatar to achieve output and employment growth well above the regional average. In fact, as a result of contract recently signed to supply the Indian market, LNG exports would surge to almost 18 million tons by 2004, bringing in as much export revenue as oil. In addition, despite OPEC quota constraints, the authorities intend to continue with the expansion of the country’s oil output capacity through new discoveries and improved technology and recovery methods. 24 24 22- Real GDP per capita CH- - 0 22 (In thousands of U.S. dollars at 1’190 prices) #@ 20 - (/-- -d - 20 H0 18 - #’ - 18 *H M 16 - - 16 14 - --.,e-‘. .

Public finances 13. The authorities confirmed that the increase in oil revenue in 1999 has not deterred their efforts at lowering spending. Expenditure would decline mostly on account of a tirther reduction in the wage bill through the layoff of expatriate civil servants, lower general administration outlays, and a sharp cut in utilities and land reclamation development expenditure. Consequently, expenditure, which peaked in 1997/98 at QR 17.6 billion (US$4.8 billion), would be cut by about 14 percent in the current fiscal year (1999/2000). Therefore, the fiscal balance could revert to a surplus of QR 1.7 billion, equivalent to 3.6 percent of GDP. The expected increase in oil prices in 2000, compounded by expenditure restraint policy in place, would lead to a fiscal surplus of 6.6 percent of GDP in 2000/01 (Table 2). In these circumstances, the staff suggested that the windfall gain from the upturn in oil prices should be saved to build up government’s foreign assets, after more than a decade of drawing down reserves to finance large fiscal deficits, and to reduce government domestic debt. 14. The authorities are confident that the expenditure cuts are sustainable.

This process is also being supported by structural changes. The number of ministries is being reduced, the electricity and water sector restructured (see below), and some expenditure outsourced, while the increase in health service charges for expatriates-albeit small-would help moderate the demand on these services.” In addition, following a 16 percent cut from its peak in 1997/98, defense expenditure, which currently accounts for about one fourth of total expenditure, would be reduced further in the coming years. Moreover, a pension scheme, initially covering nationals working in the public sector, is currently under review by the Cabinet. This scheme would represent important savings vis-a-vis the current system in which retirement payments are fully covered by the budget. l3 The rationalization of expenditure, together with the expected decline in interest payments over time, would allow an important restructure of government expenditure toward social and training outlays to satisfj the demand of a rising young population. 15. The medium-term fiscal prospects are highly favorable. Assuming an average oil price of about US$16.7 per barrel in the period 2001-04 and moderate expenditure growth, Qatar would be able to sustain, on average, fiscal surpluses of around 6 percent of GDP a year in that period, while the government debt would decline to less than 20 percent of GDP by 2004 (Table 6). Even ifthe oil price declines to US$13 per barrel in the period 2000-04, the overall fiscal balance would still show a surplus over the medium term-albeit significantly lower (Table 7). In this context, any weakening in fiscal discipline should be avoided, as the official external debt service is increasing over the near term due to an exacting debt- repayment schedule. <” <” Fiscal Balance (In percent of ODP) Ovet~llfircal balance -30 e--s _-- - -/N C- - Non-oilLNG fiscal balance l/ - -30 /- --(H- -45 ’ -45 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 ZOOI 2002 2003 2004 Sources: Data provided bv the Qatari authorities: and Fund staRestimates.

Despite the expected fiscal surpluses, non-oil/LNG revenue must be mobilized to broaden the revenue base and, in particular, reduce waste. In this context, the authorities are considering the introduction in the near term of electricity and water charges on Qatari-citizen households’ consumption above a set threshold. The sttisuggested that the authorities consider eliminating the subsidy on household and industrial consumption of electricity and water, tirther increasing health service charges for expatriates, and introducing these charges for nationals. The authorities could also adopt a sales tax at the import and producer levels at an initially low rate and selected excises on luxury goods to broaden the tax base. In fact, despite rising LNG revenue, crude oil earnings are still expected to account for over 60 percent of government revenue over the medium term.14 The authorities believed that the net revenue from these taxes would be limited, as the cost of the institutional framework to collect them would be most likely high. They indicated, however, that given Qatar’s low import tariff, the adoption of a common external tariff rate within the GCC would have a positive effect on customs revenue. Is Also, they stand ready to increase and/or impose additional charges and fees for state-provided services. Long-term management of the windfall gains from LNG and oil 17. The staff suggested that the authorities consider the advantages of adopting a revenue stabilization fund for managing the long-term use of the hydrocarbon revenues, along the lines of other countries, which have similar funds with clearly defined saving- investment rules and transparent operations. l6 Such a fund could help reduce the distortions caused by booms and busts in government expenditure stemming from oil income volatility. It would also enable fiscal policy to be implemented from a long-term perspective, addressing intergenerational economic equity objectives (Box 2).*’ This &nd would also enhance transparency of the public finances. The authorities indicated that they intend to allocate the fiscal surpluses to build up foreign assets and reduce government domestic debt, as was the case in the 1970s and early 1980s when fiscal surpluses reached over 10 percent of GDP due l4 The government would initially only receive royalty payments from the LNG exports. Dividend payments would be limited due to the need to finance ongoing LNG projects, while these projects have been granted a lo-year tax holiday. l5 The impact of the import taritf increase on revenue would be equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP. ” Oil stabilization funds or similar schemes were established in the state of Alaska and Norway for oil and Chile for copper. See Chapter 6 in Select Issues and Recent Economic Developments report (to be issued shortly). ” For a more in-depth analysis of fiscal sustainability and intergenerational economic equity objectives, see Chapter 5 in Selected Issues and Recent Economic Developments report (to be issued shortly).

Box 2: Fiscal Sustainability and Intergenerational Economic Equity In the case of Qatar, where wealth is derived t?om nonrenewable resources, oil and gas, the assessment of fiscal sustainability must take account of the depletion of this wealth to ensure intergenerational economic equity. Then&ore. it is necessary to de-e the country’s permanent rent available f?om hydrocarbon exploitation. This rent represents the level of public consumption that can be currently enjoyed without increasing the country’s debt and depleting its resources. Several criteria may be applied to de&mine the permanent rent. Two reasonable ones are to maintain the same wealth in (i) per capita terms or in (ii) real terms. The choice would depend on the authorities’ preference between present and future generations. This preference is rekted in the non-oil current fiscal balance, defined as current balance excluding oil and gas revenue. Estimates of the permanent rent rely on several assumptions, including the volume of proven oil and gas reserves and the long-run international oil/gas price. Thus, the issue of sustainability must be oflen revisited because new information may lead to new estimates of the permanent rent over time. Assuming a long-m price of US$I 3 per barrel, under criterion (i), the annual usable amount of oil and gas reserves for public consumption was estimated, on average, at around 11 percent of GDP during the next decade, and under criterion (ii), at 22 percent of GDP over the same period. However, these estimates are, in particular, very sensitive to the long-run oil and gas price assumptions. For instance, if these prices were US%16 per barrel, the permanent rent would increase to about 13 percent of GDP under criterion (i) and to 27 percent of GDP under criterion (ii). Therefore, as a result of the high oil/gas price uncertainty, there may be a need for precautionary savings over and above the level implied by the permanent rent. Given the authorities cun-ent fiscal consolidation strategy, current outlays would be more in line with the long-term rent of Qatar’s oil and gas wealth, as the non- oilLNG deficit is expected tc decline to about 16 percent of GDP in 2000/O 1 and to 12 percent of GDP over the medium term. External sector 18. The external current account balance would revert to a surplus in the coming years on account of a sharp increase in exports. Total exports are expected to double vis-&vis the 1998 level to UB8.2 billion in 2000 and to over US%10 billion by the end 2004. Although LNG-related imports are expected to gradually decline over time following the completion of some projects, total imports would remain stable at about US$4.4 billion a year during much of the medium term. As a result, the external current account would revert to small surplus in 2000 that would gradually rise until reaching about 9 percent of GDP by 2004. Qatar’s medium- and long-term external debt would decline in the coming years to less than 45 percent of GDP, as government and LNG debt is repaid (Table 6 and Chart 6). If the price l8 Given its current amortization profile, most of the government’s external debt would be paid off by 2004.

However, it would gradually improve thereafter, as a result of rising LNG exports to India, being practically eliminated by 2004 (Table 7). Monetary and exchange rate policy 19. The authorities intend to continue implementing monetary policy aimed at maintaining price and exchange rate stability and to strengthen further the financial sector. The remaining ceiling on deposit interest rates would be lifted shortly, which would allow interest rates to adequately reflect liquidity conditions in the economy, strengthen banks’ deposit base, and promote a more efficient allocation of resources and competition in the banking sector. The authorities also plan to issue government domestic bonds in the coming months to facilitate the introduction of repo operations as the main instrument to enhance the use of indirect monetary instruments. This would foster a deeper and more liquid secondary government bond market, improving the liquidity position of commercial banks. To this end, the staff encouraged the authorities to open the government bond market to all market participants and not to set minimum holding periods.rg In addition, foreigners, initially GCC citizens and resident expatriates, would be allowed to trade on the country’s stock market in the coming months. With all banks in the system currently at least at 10 percent capitalization, the staff suggested to the authorities to consider increasing the minimum capital adequacy requirements to this level to fbrther strengthen Qatar’s banking system. 20. The authorities stressed that Qatar’s exchange rate policy has served the economy well both in terms of stabilization and development. They argued that the growing importance of LNG and energy-intensive industries, rising export volumes, and the improvement in the fiscal and external position support the current exchange rate regime and level. In addition, the rising export volume of energy-intensive industries, in particular petrochemicals, highlighted the strength of Qatar’s position in a very competitive world market. Furthermore, reflecting Qatar’s relatively low inflation and the movement of the U.S. dollar in the international market, the real effective exchange rate depreciated in 1998 and remained relatively stable through September 1999 (Chart 7).m The staff shared the authorities’ views, and highlighted that deregulation, private sector development and labor market reforms would further enhance competitiveness. lg The first government bond issue in 1999 was limited to local banks, which had to hold them for at least one year. 2o The real effective exchange rate index should be interpreted with care because Qatar’s CPI is deficient in many ways (see Appendix III).

Progress is being made in creating a business-friendly regulatory environment aimed at enhancing the role of the private sector. To this end, significant changes to the company, agency, and foreign investment laws would be enacted shortly. In particular, the revision of the foreign investment law would pave the way for 100 percent foreign ownership in most sectors, except retail and real estate, make preferential business tax treatment more transparent, and streamline the investment approval procedure. In this context, the stti expressed reservations about the use of tax holidays and customs exemptions to encourage (foreign) investment, which would erode the tax base and contribute very little in a company’s decision to invest in Qatar. It also pointed out that most industrialized countries tax their companies on the basis of their worldwide income; thus, reducing the impact of tax incentives granted in the source country. 22. The authorities stressed that the private sector would play an important role in supplying Qatar’s growing energy demand. The electricity and water sector is undergoing important structural changes in preparation for its corporatization by the end of 1999, followed by the privatization of all power stations in the near term and, at a later stage, of the distribution and transmission system. Moreover, in early 2000, the authorities expect to select the first independent power generation and water project to supply energy to the country’s newest industrial city. The authorities consider that these developments would bring new technology, improve efficiency, and reduce government subsidies. The staff welcomed the important structural changes underway in the sector, and encouraged the authorities to bring forward the privatization of the energy distribution system to ensure that the gains in efficiency and lower cost brought about by these changes would be transferred to the final consumer. 23. The authorities plan gradually to offer government shares in public enterprises on the stock market. *I However, they indicated that the timing of fLture sales would take into account the ongoing recovery in the stock market, while most of the receipts from these sales would be used to finance Qatar’s development. Although there is ample evidence that the public enterprises are well managed, efficient, and profitable, as reflected in their contribution to the budget, the staff encouraged the authorities to continue with their (partial) privatization program and to broaden it to include port and airport services and the banking sector. This would help expand the range of activities in which the private sector can operate, promote the stock market, and attract foreign investors and expertise. Indeed, even though an increasing number of investments were being undertaken as joint ventures with private international and domestic partners, Qatar’s economy remains dominated by the public sector. The staffrecommended that thk authorities use the privatization receipts to build up the proposed stabilization fund and/or reduce the domestic debt. *’ The enterprises currently considered for (partial) privatization include Qatar Fertilizer Company, Qatar Steel Company, and Qatar National Hotels Company.

Although information on the labor market is scant, there is no evidence of increasing pressures or open unemployment. The government has in place a policy that aims at gradually increasing the proportion of Qataris in the workforce, particularly in the nongovernment sector where nationals currently account for about 22 percent of the labor force. This policy relies on the adoption of market-based strategies such as appropriate training, curtailing the role of the government as employer, and improving job placement services. In parallel, the authorities have maintained a flexible policy toward hiring expatriate workers. They recently abandoned a quota system under which work visas were issued on the basis of nationality. This measure was highly welcomed by the business community. The staff encouraged the authorities to focus their efforts on improving the education and training provided in public educational facilities to match the required job skills in the economy. In addition, it suggested expanding the benefits of the pension find under consideration to all nationals, including those working in the private sector to avoid a preference toward government and public enterprises employment and facilitate workers’ mobility across sectors.u C. Statistical and Other Issues 25. Progress has been made in improving data availability and Qatar’s statistics, particularly in the monetary sector. However, there is a need for a substantial firrther improvement. In particular, the &&urged the authorities to address the deficiencies in the coverage, timeliness, and quality of statistics that still remain in several key areas, notably national accounts, prices, the capital and financial account of the balance of payments, and government finances. The authorities indicated that they attach high priority to the development of the country’s data systems. To this end, some initial steps were taken, including allocating adequate resources to the compilation of data, and organizing the coordination of government agencies in charge of collecting basic economic and financial tiormation through a computerized national network system. In addition, plans for introducing the 1993 SNA over the 1999-2005 period are being implemented. A STA mission on national accounts and prices is also expected to visit Doha in March 2000, while technical assistance on balance of payments statistics was also requested by the authorities. All these developments would help strengthen the adequacy of data for surveillance and facilitate the economic decision process in both the public and private sector. The staffwelcomed the authorities’ commitment to developing the country’s statistical systems and called for the forceful implementation of the outstanding 1994 STA recommendations, particularly on national accounts, prices and public finances (see Appendix III). ** The proposed pension fund would not increase the labor cost of nationals vis-A-vis expatriates who also receive a payment every year to compensate them for the lack of retirement benefits.

This would provide an internationally accepted framework to help improve the quality and availability of economic and financial data in Qatar. In addition, they are encouraged to participate in the fiscal and financial sector transparency exercise, publish the recent economic development report and issue a press information notice. In addition to monetary statistics, the staEunderlined the need for regular reporting to the Fund of data on other core economic indicators. This would help enhance monitoring-of economic and financial developments in between consultations. Iv. STAFF APPRAISAL 27. Qatar’s outward-oriented development strategy has started to bear fruit on government revenue, economic growth and exports. As a result, despite the downturn in oil prices in 1998, the country sustained output growth and equity prices increases well above the regional average. The recent sharp increase in oil prices, together with the coming on stream of sizable exports of LNG and the ongoing investments in energy-intensive industries, would sustain in the coming years a robust economic expansion and lead to a sharp improvement in the country’s financial situation. 28. The positive effects of the government’s development strategy have been compounded by the ongoing efforts at reducing expenditure. The staff endorses these efforts and commends the authorities for sustaining them amidst rising oil revenue, as well as sparing social services Corn the cutbacks. As a result, current outlays would be more in line with the permanent rent of Qatar’s oil and gas wealth, ensuring intergenerational economic equity. In this context, short- and medium-term fiscal prospects are highly favorable, with Qatar expected to post large fiscal surpluses. The staff strongly endorses the authorities’ intention to allocate the budgetary surpluses resulting from fiscal consolidation at building up foreign assets and reducing the government domestic debt. However, it cautions against any weakening in fiscal discipline, as the government is facing an exacting external debt repayment schedule over the near term. 29. The authorities are encouraged to adopt measures to mobilixe non-oil revenue to broaden the revenue base and, in particular, to reduce waste. These measures could include eliminating the subsidy on household and industrial consumption of electricity and water, further increasing health service charges for expatriates, and introducing these charges for nationals. In addition, the authorities could consider introducing a sales tax at the import and producer levels at an initially low rate and selected excises on luxury goods, as a way to broaden the revenue base. 30. The staff suggests that the authorities consider adopting a revenue stabilixation fund for managing the long-term use of the hydrocarbon revenues, along the lines of other countries that also extract substantial revenue from nonrenewable resources. This fund, which should have clearly defined saving investment rules and transparent operations, would reduce the distortions caused by booms and busts in government expenditure stemming from oil and gas price fluctuations and facilitate formulating of long-term fiscal objectives.

Prudential regulations and bank supervision have helped promote a sound banking sector. In this context, the staff urges the authorities to lift the remaining ceiling on deposit interest rates and enhance the use of indirect instruments of monetary policy, as well as consider increasing the minimum capital adequacy requirements to 10 percent. These policies would strengthen banks’ deposit base and improve their liquidity position and financial standing, while fostering competition in the banking sector. 32. Efforts at enhancing the role of the private sector and foreign investment through the creation of a business-friendly regulatory environment are highly welcomed. In particular, the staff welcomes the opening up of most sectors-including the stock market-to foreign investors, and the increasingly important role that the private sector would play in expanding the electricity and water sector. It urges the authorities to continue with their plans to sell minority stakes in publicly-owned enterprises. This would promote stock market activities and attract foreign investors and expertise. The staff also suggests to mainly use the receipts from these sales to build up the proposed revenue stabiliiation fund and/or repay government domestic debt. The stat?? commends the authorities for abandoning the quota system for foreign workers in their labor policies. In addition, in an effort to encourage hiring of Qatari nationals in the nongovemment sector, the authorities should continue to base their policies on market-based instruments, including training and development of skills. Moreover, the authorities are encouraged to implement steadfastly the planned pension scheme for nationals, covering as well those working in the private sector. 33. The staff continues to endorse the authorities’ commitment to the exchange rate pegged to the U.S. dollar, underpinned by a currency board-type arrangement and strong performance in the fiscal and external sectors. The current exchange rate regime in place has anchored economic stability, enhanced development, and strengthened confidence. 34. The authorities’ priority to developing Qatar’s economic and financial data systems is greatly welcomed. In spite of the progress at improving the country’s statistics and enhancing data availability, Qatar’s economic and financial data systems still suffer from several important deficiencies that could hinder the formulation of economic policy. The staff welcomes the initial steps taken to coordinate the collection of economic and financial data among government agencies. It encourages the authorities to implement the outstanding actions recommended by the 1994 Fund technical assistance mission, particularly on national accounts, prices, and public finances. Sustained efforts to address remaining shortcomings in the quality and availability of national statistics would help strengthen the adequacy of data for surveillance and facilitate the economic decision process in both the public and private sector. The staff also encourages the authorities to participate in the GDDS, regularly report data to the Fund on core economic indicators, develop labor market indicators, and participate in the fiscal and financial sector transparency exercise. They are also encouraged to publish the recent economic development report and issue a press information notice. 35. The next Article IV consultation with Qatar is expected to be held on the 24-month cycle.

Timeliness of &ta on core economic indicators is summarized in the attached table. 1. Data reporting The Central Statistical Office (CSO) has been integrated into the Planning Council since 1998 with a view to providing it with sharper and high-profile focus on data coordination and compilation. There has been lately an improvement in the quality of data provided to MED missions. Following the STA multisector mission of 1994, the timeliness, coverage, and quality of monetary statistics have improved, including the proper classification of the government sector and the regular publication of analytical accounts of banks. Also, some steps to strengthen the external current account data, particularly the trade and service data such as better estimation of workers’ remittances, have been taken. In the national accounts area, steps have been taken to publish a wider range of aggregates including savings and private final consumption expenditure. In addition, detailed data on oil, gas, and medium- and long-term external debt were also provided to the missions. However, fiscal, national accounts, and price statistics need to be improved in timeliness and quality. The more frequent reporting of key economic indicators between missions is desirable to keep the Fund abreast of economic developments on a current basis. Although monetary data are reported to the Statistics Department (STA) on a regular basis, there are long lags in reporting of price indices and other real sector statistics, for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Interest rate data for publication in the IFS have not been reported for several years. Furthermore, international trade statistics to be published in the Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) are reported only sporadically and public finance and balance of payments data are not being reported for publication in IFS or other specialized Fund’s publications. 2. Data publications policy While data provided to MED missions are made available in the Fund documents for internal circulation, the authorities favor the publication only of officially finalized and approved data for the central bank balance sheet and detailed budgetary data. Qatar Central Bank’s web page presents some macroeconomic information about the country, but as of October 1999, the latest data available corresponded to 1996. 3. Data issues in each sector a. National accounts and prices Data on national accounts remain deficient. National accounts data suffer from inadequate coverage of enterprises and poor responses to survey questions, resulting in low quality and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - APPENDIX lII untimely data. Sometimes data are estimated. Constant price estimates of national accounts suffer from the outdated base period of 1988. The latest data at constant prices is available for 1997 and at current prices for 1998. Price data is available through 1998. However, the index is deficient in several ways. Prices of nonfood items are collected mainly at annual intervals, posing problems when prices are subject to significant fluctuations. Also, CPI weights are based on a 1988 Household Expenditure Survey, which is outdated and does not reflect current consumer spending. Moreover, no monthly CPI data are available. A STA technical assistance mission on national accounts and prices is planned for March 2000 and on balance of payments for fiscal year 200 1. b. Hydrocarbon sector Detailed data on the oil and gas sectors are supplied by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum and the QGPC at the time of the Article IV consultation discussions. In addition, the authorities also provide information about medium-term plans for oil and gas and LNG financing and other QGPC industrial-related activities. C. Government sector The government budget data could be presented according to the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) guidelines, including greater detail on major expenditure and non-oil revenue categories. In fact, the 1994 multi-sector mission proposed the establishment of a database for the consolidated central government, including all budgetary institutions, extrabudgetary accounts, which is now included under “other accounts” in the Government’s Final Accounts and the three government funds managed by the Qatar National Bank. In addition, the budget data should be made consistent with the data in the monetary survey and the balance of payments. d. Monetary sector Following Fund technical assistance recommendations, monetary data for the QCB and commercial banks have improved in timeliness and quality. Monthly and quarterly data are now available, although at times with some lag. However, monthly reports to STA are not sufficiently comprehensive to allow the regular update of country desk data. Furthermore, interest rate data for publication in the IFS have not been reported for several years.’ e. Balance of payments Data on current account transactions, particularly services and transfers, have lately improved. However, serious omissions remain in the balance of payments statistics reflected ’ No information on lending and deposit interest rates is regularly collected by QCB.

In addition, balance of payments data do not conform to the 5* Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Moreover, official statistics seem to underestimate the total level of imports while there are discrepancies in the export data provided by Qatar Central Bank and Qatar General Petroleum Corporation. The latest official balance of payments estimates are available through 1998 and detailed foreign trade statistics through 1997. The authorities have recently requested for technical assistance on balance of payments statistics. No information is made available on the government’s portfolio of investment. f External debt No offkial information is made public on Qatar’s external size, scope, and performance of debt. However, detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are provided at the time of the Article IV consultation discussions.
