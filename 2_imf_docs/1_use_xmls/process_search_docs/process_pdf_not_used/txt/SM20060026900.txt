Real GDP grew by 6.6 percent in 2005 and inflation remained negligible (0.7 percent). The central government fiscal surplus increased by 8.8 percentage points to 18.4 percent of GDP in 2005. The external current account recorded a surplus of $91 billion (29.3 percent of GDP) and gross foreign assets of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) increased to $153 billion, the equivalent of 16 months of imports. The stock market price index rose by 104 percent in 2005, and by a further 24 percent through its peak on February 25, 2006, before it started a major correction that reduced it by about 45 percent by end-May 2006 (33 percent below the beginning of the year level), but still 3½ times above its end-2002 level. The medium-term outlook is very positive on the expectation that oil prices will stay high, the fiscal stance will remain expansionary, and structural reforms will continue to be implemented in a phased manner. Average real GDP growth is projected at about 6 percent, supported mainly by strong non-oil sector growth (7 percent). The fiscal and current account surpluses will remain sizable, albeit declining steadily over the medium term.  Policy Discussions • The authorities reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s constructive role in support of global oil market stability. Implementation of the large investment plan to expand crude oil production capacity is ahead of schedule. Plans to increase gross refining capacity for processing of Saudi heavy crudes by over 44 percent over the next five years are also being implemented through domestic and international investment projects. • Fiscal policy entails a strong expansion of infrastructure and social expenditure in support of private sector growth and job creation. The favorable outlook for oil revenues, the reduction of interest payments (because of the reduction in government debt), and the comfortable net assets position at the general government level, should provide space for implementing the expenditure programs while still saving a part of the higher revenues. This strategy, by increasing imports of goods and services, would also contribute to the reduction of global current account imbalances. Staff emphasized the need for maintaining expenditure quality, strengthening expenditure management, and broadening the non-oil revenue base. The recent reduction in domestic fuel prices is, however, questionable on both efficiency and equity grounds. • The impact of the stock market correction on financial stability and economic growth is not expected to be significant due to early implementation of prudential measures. Also, the wealth effect is expected to be small because of substantial capital gains despite the correction, strengthened investor confidence arising from high oil prices, and the expansionary fiscal stance. However, strong oversight of markets is still needed in light of the volatility of asset prices. The authorities reaffirmed that, despite the sharp reduction, stock prices would continue to be determined by market forces without government intervention. • Progress in structural reforms has contributed to rapid private sector growth. Staff encouraged the authorities to sustain this progress on the structural front, apply the Saudiization labor policy with flexibility, and further encourage private and foreign participation in the economy.

The 2006 consultation discussions were held against a backdrop of high oil prices, continued strong economic growth, and overall macroeconomic stability. The improved investment climate resulting from the steady implementation of structural reforms, the significant increase in government spending, and the confidence effect generated by high oil prices have all contributed to higher private sector activity. Fiscal and monetary policies are geared to ensuring macroeconomic stability, thereby supporting private sector development and growth. 2.      Macroeconomic and structural policies have been consistent with the domestic objectives of growth and employment, as well as contributing to reducing global imbalances. The authorities have made commendable progress in implementing measures aimed at further enhancing the economic outlook and resilience to shocks by: (i) allocating a sizable portion of oil revenues to social and infrastructure expenditure programs, as well as reducing government debt; (ii) initiating an ambitious investment program to expand oil production and refining capacity; (iii) opening further the banking sector to enhance competition; and (iv) strengthening capital market regulation and supervision.  3.      Fund policy advice has centered on the following key areas: accelerating non-oil growth over the medium term through implementing the reform agenda in a sustained manner; maintaining the constructive role of Saudi Arabia in supporting oil market stability; improving fiscal management; further strengthening of the financial sector; and improving the statistical database. Overall, policy implementation has been in line with Fund advice. In particular, private sector activity continued to strengthen through an improved business environment, structural reforms, and fiscal stimulus. Furthermore, to enhance transparency, the authorities agreed in November 2005 to participate in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). B.   Recent Macroeconomic Developments 4.      Economic conditions continued to improve in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006. Real GDP grew by 6.6 percent in 2005, with strong expansion in both oil (5.9 percent) and non-oil GDP (6.8 percent) (Table 1). Faster credit growth facilitated increased private sector activity, while the record oil revenues led to higher domestic demand through increased public spending. As a result, both the private and public non-oil sectors recorded their                                                  1 Saudi Arabia’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendixes I and II, respectively.

Saudi Arabia maintained a remarkable degree of price stability with CPI inflation remaining very low at 0.7 percent, in contrast with a pickup in inflationary pressures in some other GCC countries (Box 1). The official unemployment rate of the Saudi workforce decreased from 9.7 percent in 2002 to 7.1 percent in 2004, although unofficial estimates place the rate substantially higher (near 15 percent). Despite a sharp increase in imports in 2005 (32.8 percent), the external current account surplus rose to 29.3 percent of GDP (Table 5), reflecting mainly higher oil export receipts and a strong growth in petrochemicals exports. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 3.4 percent during the 12-month period through end-March 2006 basically due to movements in the U.S. dollar/Euro rates.                                                    2 Non-oil growth was primarily driven by manufacturing (8.1 percent), transport, storage, and communications (9.6 percent), and financial, insurance, real estate, and business services (6.8 percent). 3 The Ministry of Commerce and Industry issued 1,333 new licenses in 2005, with an authorized capital of SRls 177.7 billion. The increase in authorized capital was particularly strong for chemicals, rubber, plastics, ceramics, glassware, construction material, metal, machinery, and equipment.

Why Inflation is Still Very Low in Saudi Arabia Although GCC countries generally have good track records on inflation, the degree of price stability achieved by Saudi Arabia has been remarkable. Saudi inflation, averaging only about 0.1 percent during 2001–05, compares very favorably with industrial countries and also with other GCC countries. Price stability has been maintained despite the: (i) effects of the positive terms-of-trade on confidence; (ii) sizable government spending; and (iii) large increases in private sector credit.   Several factors can help explain the continued very low inflation in Saudi Arabia. While the first two factors are common to GCC countries, the remaining factors explain Saudi Arabia’s much lower inflation relative to other GCC countries. The labor market is very open and flexible, attracting a high number of expatriates from developing countries at very competitive wages. According to the Ministry of Labor, Saudi nationals accounted for only 11.6 percent of total private sector employment in 2005.  Saudi Arabia’s open trade system and its dependence on imports contributed to the low inflation from the supply side. Saudi Arabia’s high import propensity and competitive sources of imports are key to continued price stability. Imports, growing at a pace well above the growth in domestic demand, clearly helped dampen price pressures. Administered prices, with a total weight of about 15 percent in the CPI basket, have remained unchanged for a long period of time. These administered prices primarily include water, electricity, and petroleum products. Utility prices have been increased in some of the GCC countries (U.A.E. and Qatar) reflecting adjustments in domestic fuel prices. Saudi Arabia’s larger non-oil economy and its more diversified base for production of goods and services, enable it to absorb the higher domestic demand better than its smaller GCC counterparts. The economy’s absorptive capacity has increased significantly over time with the expanding non-oil base, preventing the re-emergence of inflationary pressures experienced during the earlier oil booms. Although non-oil economic activity has been growing in Saudi Arabia for the last five years, on average the rate of growth has been lower than in other GCC countries. As a result, capacity constraints and associated inflationary pressures have not yet emerged in Saudi Arabia.  While consumer price stability has been remarkable, asset prices have increased substantially. High credit demand growth fueled the speculative increase in equity prices (see Box 2). Housing prices are estimated to have increased by 13.7 percent annually during 2002–05, with land (15.2 percent) and commercial real estate (16.5 percent) growing at an even faster pace. The rise in real estate prices, mainly driven by demographic factors and the income effect, shows up in the relatively high rental yield rates compared with other major cities in the world.

Buoyed by record oil revenues, both the central and general government fiscal positions strengthened in 2005 (Table 3). The central government fiscal surplus almost doubled to 18.4 percent of GDP despite a sharp acceleration of real government expenditure growth to 15.1 percent. The fiscal surplus was used to reduce central government debt by 25 percentage points to 39.6 percent of GDP, set aside resources to finance transfers for housing and municipalities and to invest in priority social sectors over a five-year period, and build up foreign assets with SAMA. Reflecting the surplus positions of the Autonomous Government Institutions (AGI) and the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the general government surplus improved by 12 percentage points to around 23 percent of GDP, and the net financial assets of the general government rose by 10 percentage points to 67 percent of GDP (Table 4).  7.      High investor expectations and a rapid credit expansion led to a stock market boom in 2005, well beyond what could be justified by the strengthening of fundamentals. In its third year of a bull-run, the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) increased by an additional 104 percent, bringing its total 3-year gains to about 600 percent. After reaching a peak in February 2006, the index dropped by about 45 percent in the following three months, reflecting concerns about corporate profit growth and the tightening of some operational regulations (Box 2). The stock market’s performance was also associated with a rapid credit expansion to the private sector (39 percent). However, the expansion of broad money was limited (11.4 percent) because of a substantial buildup of government deposits with SAMA4 (Table 6). Given the peg to the dollar and an open capital account, SAMA’s reference interest rates are closely benchmarked to the Fed Funds rate. However, during the first half of 2006 when stock prices were falling rapidly, SAMA did not increase the reference interest rates to avoid a tightening of monetary conditions.5 Banks’ financial positions strengthened further with record growth in profits in 2005, partly because of fees related to equity market operations (Table 7).                                                  4 The large increase in net foreign assets (NFA) was offset by an increase of government deposits with SAMA. 5 On June 29, SAMA raised the repo and reverse repo rates by 20 basis points following the recent increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Stock Market Developments in Saudi Arabia  The Saudi stock market recorded an extraordinary performance during 2000–05, well beyond other Middle East and North Africa (MENA) markets.  The Saudi market capitalization jumped from 22 percent of the entire MENA region in 2000 to 41percent in 2005. The increase in the value of trade was even higher, with the total value of Saudi shares traded in the MENA region increasing from 7.5 percent in 2000 to around 66 percent in 2005. This increase was mainly due to price gains, since the TASI recorded the third largest gain in the MENA region after Dubai and Egypt.  The TASI continued to increase in the first two months of 2006 before undergoing a sharp correction. By February 25, 2006, the market index advanced an additional 24 percent to reach its peak at 740 percent above the January 1, 2003 level. Since that date, the index suffered two episodes of sharp declines leading to a cumulative loss of about 40 percent from the peak value.   Worse than expected 2005 financial results for most listed companies and the tightening of some operational regulations and supervisory measures contributed to the market correction. Profits of listed companies grew at rates over 50 percent during 2003–04. Market valuations as of end-2005 suggest that market participants expected rates of profit growth continuing in the range of 50–60 percent. However, average profit growth was 37 percent in 2005, and some blue chip companies performed substantially below expectations. Coinciding with the reporting of these lower gains, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) introduced regulations to limit speculation, fined three stock traders for a record SRls 169 million ($45 million), and banned them for three years for market manipulation.    The high degree of price correlation among GCC equity markets resulted in a contagion effect. Market-specific factors prompted corrections in Qatar, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi a few months before Saudi Arabia. However, it was the decline in the Saudi market that accentuated the correction in the rest of the GCC. The large volume of cross-country investments, with a predominance of Saudi investors, was the main contagion channel. Margin calls on Saudi and other GCC investors might have exacerbated selling pressures. As a result, the price indices in Qatar and Abu Dhabi declined by about 40 percent, in line with the Saudi market, while the cumulative decline in Dubai was about 60 percent. 10030050070090011001300Feb-03Jun-03Oct-03Feb-04Jun-04Oct-04Feb-05Jun-05Oct-05Feb-06Jun-06DubaiEgyptS.A.QatarStock Price Indices in Selected MENA Countries: Jan. 2003-Dec. 2005(Normalized to 100 at Jan. 2003)Source: BloombergEquity Markets in Selected MENA Countries Selected Indicators: 2000 and 2005Market20002005200020052000200520002005Egypt28.579.530.779.511.7527.734.734.8Jordan4.9537.658.537.60.4123.87.7263.3Kuwait19.8123.956.1123.94.497.322.278.5Qatar8.287.12987.10.3828.34.532.4Saudi Arabia67.964635.721017.41103.725.6170.8U.A.E. 11.0231.415.7231.40.1140.6160.8MENA312.01,577.033.0105.0232.01,675.075.0106.0Market cap.

REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS 8.      Against the background of oil market developments and growing global current account imbalances, the increasing dynamism of the private sector, and the continuing stock market volatility, the primary focus of the Article IV discussions centered on three closely related areas:  •  Saudi Arabia’s role in the global and regional context as the world’s largest producer and exporter of oil, as a major investor in regional economies, and as an important party to global imbalances;  • Appropriateness of the fiscal stance, taking into account the need to utilize growing oil revenues in a way that promotes private sector development and job creation, while also recognizing capacity constraints;   • The factors driving the stock market and the resilience of the financial sector in view of the significant decline in stock prices and continued market volatility.  The discussions were cast in the context of the near- and medium-term outlook for the Saudi economy.  A.   The Near- and Medium-term Outlook Remains Highly Favorable 9.      Strong GDP growth and continued large fiscal and current account surpluses are expected in 2006.6 Real GDP growth is expected to remain robust (5.8 percent), despite lower oil sector growth (1.6 percent),7 supported by a further acceleration of non-oil activity (7.8 percent). Reflecting continued strong world oil demand and increased production, the external current account balance is projected to reach $112 billion (31.1 percent of GDP). The stock market correction is not expected to affect domestic demand and growth significantly (Box 3). Monetary expansion is expected to slow slightly, with broad money growing by 10.7 percent, due to a deceleration in private sector credit growth in the aftermath of the equity market correction.8 The authorities observed that the retirement of government debt would continue to be largely sterilized either through bilateral operations between SAMA and the AGIs (basically involving an exchange of government debt for deposits in SAMA) or , if needed, by issuing SAMA securities. Inflation in the first quarter of 2006 was about 2 percent (on an annual basis) but is projected to be around 1 percent for the year. Economic growth and terms-of-trade gains are expected to increase per capita GDP by 13 percent, to above $15,000 in 2006. While broadly agreeing with the near-term outlook described above, the authorities did not accept the WEO-based projections of oil prices, arguing that oil prices were likely to be significantly lower in the medium term (see paragraph 12).                                                  6 The outlook is based on the IMF WEO oil price forecasts (June 2006). 7 The average crude oil production for 2006 is projected at 9.5 million barrels per day (mbd). 8 The expansion in demand for bank credit in the first quarter of 2006 was in large part due to the exuberance of the equity market prior to the start of the price correction in late February 2006.

Impact of the Saudi Equity Market Correction  The Saudi economy in general, and the financial sector in particular, appear resilient to the sharp stock prices correction. The general view among market participants is that the impact of the equity market correction will be limited due to: (i) the introduction of prudential measures that limited banks’ exposure to equity market risk; (ii) the strength of the corporate sector; (iii) the retention of substantial capital gains, and other factors offsetting the potential negative wealth effect; and (iv) the lower risk for a further substantial price reduction with stock prices broadly in line with fundamentals after the correction.  The tightening of prudential regulations over the past two years has limited the impact of the stock market decline on the financial sector. In 2004, SAMA introduced capital charges for market risk; tightened collateral requirements on margin lending; and imposed a ceiling per customer to finance IPO purchases. Also, a regulation shortening the maturity of consumer loans from 10 to 5 years and capping the amount of debt service at one-third of the net monthly salary helped limit the risk to households and banks. Furthermore, banks have built up reserves to withstand an unlikely significant deterioration of their asset quality, as shown in their high capital adequacy and provisioning ratios.   The impact of a negative wealth effect is likely to be limited. A significant reduction in household demand is unlikely since the wealth gain was for a relatively short period and an average household could still retain sizable capital gains (300 percent since end-2002) if they were active in the market before May 2005.1/ The 15 percent general salary increase approved in August 2005 will also help boost household spending.  Domestic demand would be mainly driven by the corporate sector and a continued expansionary fiscal stance. Listed firms remain highly profitable with profits increasing by 27 percent in the first quarter of 2006, and they are continuing with their massive expansion plans. Despite the loss of income from stock market related activities, the outlook for bank profits remains strong, supported by growing credit demand from the corporate sector and the need for financial services and lending associated with numerous large projects.  The sharp correction experienced by the stock market has eliminated the gap opened in 2005 between the stock price index and the main economic fundamentals. As of mid-May 2006, the price index stood at about 30 percent above its end-2004 level. This valuation gain is broadly in line with the increase in corporate profits in 2005 (37 percent) and in the first quarter of 2006. The average trailing price-to-earnings ratio (PER) is currently at 20 (down from over 40 in February 2006). Although still somewhat above most other GCC and emerging equity markets, the current average Saudi PER is in line with its historical value and could be justified by high-growth companies. In addition to the continued strong banking sector profitability, profits of petrochemical and other oil-related companies have remained strong, supported by buoyant global demand and higher prices. These factors provide a sound basis for the growth of stock prices once the market stabilizes. _________________ 1/ Most small investors entered the market attracted by the large IPOs in 2004 and 2005.

The overall fiscal balance is expected to remain in comfortable surplus (17.2 percent of GDP) in 2006. The strong fiscal position will allow the authorities to achieve their dual objectives of a significant further increase in capital and social spending and a sustained reduction of central government debt. The authorities observed that large increases in capital expenditure, transfers for housing and industrial development, and income transfers would help sustain domestic growth and alleviate poverty and housing shortage for the poor.9 Accordingly, the fiscal stance, measured by the non-oil primary balance is projected to remain expansionary, widening by 3.0 percentage points to 51 percent of non-oil GDP. Consistent with the authorities’ stated debt reduction strategy, government debt is expected to be reduced further by about 23 percentage points to 17 percent of GDP. 11.      The medium-term outlook (2007–11) remains very favorable on the expectation that world oil prices will stay high, as indicated by WEO projections. Real GDP is projected to grow close to 6 percent annually on average, supported by continued strong non-oil sector growth (averaging 7 percent) and an expansionary fiscal stance. The main assumptions underpinning the baseline scenario are a gradual decline in oil prices, increased oil production with the capacity expansion envisaged under Saudi ARAMCO’s investment plan (0.3 mbd annually on average), sustained growth in religious tourism, and the implementation of a large number of investment projects.10 The external current account and fiscal surpluses are expected to decline steadily over time, due to higher imports, increased government spending, and the projected downward path of oil prices, but will remain at very comfortable levels.11 The authorities intend to make a substantial increase in social and capital expenditures (8 percent and 18 percent average annual growth rates, respectively).                                                   9 Other recent measures targeting the poor include construction of health clinics, schools, and assistance to the physically handicapped. 10 Large investments in the real estate, petrochemicals, mining, water desalinization, power generation, transport, and telecommunications sectors, will amount to about $150–200 billion over the next five years. 11 At the general government level, fiscal policy will be driven to a large extent by the central government stance. Other general government institutions are expected to remain in comfortable surplus over the medium term.

There are downside risks to this favorable medium-term outlook since it is based on historically high levels of oil price and output assumptions. In particular, the authorities observed that the WEO baseline oil prices incorporated a substantial risk premium that could quickly diminish should tensions in major producing regions decline, pointing to a somewhat less buoyant medium-term outlook than envisaged by staff. Furthermore, they were of the view that the current inventory build-up in major consuming countries may reverse, thus contributing to the potential price decline. As such, staff conducted an alternative scenario to stress-test for the impact of lower oil price projections on the major macroeconomic variables (Table 2). On the assumption that oil prices would be $10 below the baseline prices during the projection period,12 both the external current account and fiscal surpluses would still remain sizable. On average, the current account surplus under the alternative scenario is projected to be 3.5 percent of GDP lower than in the baseline scenario, reaching $47 billion (10.9 percent of GDP) by 2011. Similarly, the overall fiscal surplus would also be lower than the baseline scenario by an average of about 4 percent of GDP. SAMA’s net foreign assets will reach $411 billion by 2011, compared to $458 billion in the baseline scenario.13  B.   Saudi Arabia’s Systemic Role 13.      The authorities reaffirmed that Saudi Arabia would continue to play a constructive role in support of world oil market and price stability by implementing an ambitious investment plan to expand capacity and increasing oil production. The earlier-than-scheduled activation of the new Haradh field in February 2006, adding 0.3 mbd of light crude oil output capacity, is an important example of the authorities’ ambitious expansion plans. They also confirmed that additional investments aimed at increasing capacity to about 13 mbd by 2013 were under consideration (Box 4). Furthermore, a plan to                                                   12 Equivalent (approximately) to one standard deviation in the variation of oil prices during the last five years. 13 The outlook still remains favorable even if the reduction in oil prices from the baseline is assumed to be $20 per barrel—approximately two standard deviations. Under this scenario, on average, the current account surplus would be 9.2 percent of GDP lower than in the baseline scenario, reaching $24.8 billion (6.3 percent of GDP) by 2011. The overall fiscal surplus would also be lower compared to the baseline scenario by an average of about 9.6 percent of GDP. SAMA’s net foreign assets would reach $343 billion by 2011, compared to $458 billion in the baseline scenario. On average, GDP per capita would be lower by about 18 percent ($14,700 in 2011) vis-à-vis the baseline scenario.

Oil Production and Refining Capacity  Endowed with about one-fourth of global proven oil reserves and having among the lowest production costs, Saudi Arabia is the world’s leading oil producer and exporter. Saudi production and excess capacity decisions are based on the policy to maximize long-term benefits, which entails both ensuring stability in the oil market and the continued price competitiveness of oil compared to other forms of energy. Saudi Arabia is the only country maintaining significant spare production capacity (1.4 mbd), albeit of heavy crudes. In the current environment of strong global economic growth and recurrent disruptions in oil supply due to political or climatic reasons, Saudi Arabia’s role in containing volatility in the world market for oil continues to be crucial.   The authorities have started to implement large investment projects ($50 billion) aimed at increasing light crude oil output, and refining capacity. After the activation of the new Haradh field in February 2006, three other projects are at various stages of implementation to expand the country’s sustainable production capacity to 12.5 mbd by 2009.  The authorities are also considering an additional investment plan to raise production capacity further to 13.1 mbd by 2013. In the longer term, they expect capacity could increase further to 15 mbd, a level that could be sustained for over 50 years given the current level of proven reserves.    Saudi Arabia’s oil production has become more skewed toward lighter crudes, contributing to the alleviation of the current global mismatch between demand and supply for light crude. Despite the fact that much of the country’s oil reserves are heavy crudes, about 70 percent of Saudi Arabia’s total oil production capacity in 2005 was light gravity. This responds to the increase in demand for light crudes, refining capacity constraints for heavy crudes, and the tightening of environmental standards in major consuming countries.    ARAMCO’s refining capacity is being expanded and is expected to reach around 6 mbd by 2011, which will make it one of the top refining companies in the world, second to Exxon Mobil’s 6.3 mbd.  ARAMCO is upgrading the Rabigh refinery and plans to build two new refineries in Yanbu and Jubail in partnership with ConocoPhilips and Total. Other planned investments include expansion of refineries in the U.S. and China.       Figure 1.

The Saudi policy to maintain significant spare capacity to guard against sudden market disruptions is also contributing to alleviating some market uncertainties. Private sector investment to further expand production of non-associated gas is also progressing well.14 The Saudi authorities believe that while global demand for oil will continue to rise steadily (at about 1.5 mbd per annum), the current high oil prices incorporate a significant geopolitical risk premium and are not due exclusively to demand-supply imbalances. In fact, their view is that there is substantial excess supply, particularly of heavier crudes, in the market. The Saudi expansion plans, as well as those of other oil producers in the Gulf, combined with an easing of concerns about possible supply disruptions, should moderate world oil prices in the future. 14.      The authorities observed that fiscal spending was already growing at a rapid pace, and a part of oil revenues need to be saved due to the uncertain oil market outlook. The envisaged increase in public spending on social projects and infrastructure investment to record levels, and the acceleration of structural reforms to support private sector growth and demand, will contribute to the reduction of global imbalances through higher imports of good and services (Box 5). Also, Saudi Arabia’s acquisition of international financial assets is helping finance these imbalances. The authorities are of the view that, compared to the previous oil booms, the economy has now more absorptive capacity to sustain the ongoing strengthening of domestic demand and growth without threatening price stability. In their view, Saudi Arabia’s large current account surplus is qualitatively different from that of other surplus countries, as it is partly the result of their supply response to growing global oil demand. In addition, since this surplus is derived from nonrenewable resources, the country needs to save for the future to ensure intergenerational equity.                                                    14 Four international joint ventures licensed in 2003 have already started drilling in the south-eastern Empty Quarter to explore for non-associated gas fields to satisfy the growing domestic market for natural gas, particularly for the petrochemicals sector. Substituting the more expensive oil with gas in petrochemical crackers will contribute to their international competitiveness while releasing more oil for export.

Saudi Arabia’s Current Account Surplus in a Global Perspective  With the increase in oil prices, oil exporting countries have become an important party to global imbalances. Being the largest oil exporter in the world, and consistent with its constructive role in stabilizing the oil market through higher production, Saudi Arabia’s external current account registered a record surplus in 2005. This was equivalent to 0.2 percent of world GDP, up from 0.03 percent in 2001. While substantial, this surplus remains smaller than that of other important parties to global imbalances.    Taking advantage of the considerable increase in oil revenue, Saudi Arabia has embarked on an ambitious plan to raise its growth potential and further improve the population’s living standards. This effort has been reflected in a rapid growth in imports. While import growth has been broad-based, it was particularly strong for capital and intermediary goods. Total imports almost doubled from $28.6 billion in 2001 to $54.6 billion in 2005. Imports of services are also increasing, reaching $33.7 billion in 2005. Indeed, the growth of imports of goods and services in Saudi Arabia has been accelerating faster than other surplus parties to global imbalances, and was the highest among them in 2005. In addition, outward workers’ remittances also started to increase ($14 billion in 2005).     The rapid growth of imports over the past few years reflected in part increased public expenditure. Real growth in central government expenditure in Saudi Arabia picked up strongly since 2003, and surpassed expenditure growth in other large surplus countries.      Looking forward, the dynamism of domestic demand and its growth potential, coupled with the envisaged limited growth in oil export receipts, would reduce the Kingdom’s external current account surplus over the medium-term. The large number of initiatives undertaken by the public and private sectors would enhance long-term growth potential and bring the external current account surplus to a lower level. Under these projections, by 2011 merchandise imports would be equivalent to about 59 percent of exports (compared to 30 percent in 2005) and 34 percent of GDP (compared to 18 percent in 2005).      20012002200320042005United States-1.24-1.45-1.41-1.62-1.81Germany0.000.120.120.250.26Japan               0.280.340.370.420.37Emerging Asia       0.280.390.450.440.54  Of which:China, People's Republic of0.060.110.120.170.36Fuel Exporters0.270.200.300.460.78  Of which:Saudi Arabia0.030.040.080.120.20Source: WEO database.Current Account Balances(In percent of world GDP)20012002200320042005World               -2.94.216.021.012.9Germany-1.41.722.917.48.4Japan               -8.3-2.810.919.411.9Emerging Asia       -6.18.218.528.216.9  Of which:China, People's Republic 8.220.936.935.118.0Fuel Exporters10.410.716.422.722.6  Of which:Saudi Arabia-5.91.910.219.724.8Source: WEO database.Growth of Imports of Goods and Services(Change in percent)0501001502002503002002200320042005200620072008200920102011-50050100150200250300China,P.R.: MainlandGermanyJapan               Saudi ArabiaSelected Countries: Current Account Balances, 2002–11(In billions of U.S. dollars)Sources: National authorities, WEO;and Fund staff estimates and projections.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  17  15.      Saudi Arabia, as the largest economy in the region, plays an important role in promoting regional growth. Saudi foreign direct and financial investments have contributed to increased economic activity and growth potential in the region. Furthermore, by employing about seven million foreign workers, primarily from developing countries, and through its sizable and expanding development assistance program, Saudi Arabia contributes importantly to economic stability and growth beyond the Gulf. The integration of financial markets and free movement of national labor and capital among GCC countries will continue benefiting the GCC companies and promote regional growth. A flexible application of the “Saudiization” labor policy,15 in support of the rapid implementation of projects in the pipeline would create employment opportunities for both Saudi and foreign workers and increase remittance flows to developing countries. C.   Fiscal Policy: Maximizing the Growth Potential 16.      The authorities reaffirmed their intention to maintain a progressively more expansionary stance as long as the outlook for oil prices remains strong. This expansionary fiscal stance (measured by the non-oil primary deficit) contributed significantly to non-oil GDP growth in recent years. However, they underscored the need for striking an appropriate balance in utilizing higher oil revenues, between higher spending (capital and social) and maintaining an overall fiscal surplus. While the expansionary stance has been crucial in realizing the diversification and growth objectives, the substantial fiscal surpluses have served as a counterbalance at a juncture when favorable external conditions have resulted in higher domestic liquidity and private sector demand.                                                     15 The Saudiization policy aims at increasing the employment of Saudi nationals in the private sector by introducing sector-specific quotas and penalties for nonobservance.

The strong fiscal position will further contribute to a reduction in fiscal and macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The authorities stressed that, in addition to financing large expenditure programs, a substantial part of the surpluses will be used to continue the current policy of retiring domestic debt, contributing to a further improvement in the net financial position of the general government. The resulting lower interest payments and higher investment income will also create fiscal space needed to sustain higher social and infrastructure spending over the long term. The authorities do not foresee any risk to macroeconomic stability associated with the injection of liquidity through debt reduction, as SAMA stands ready to take corrective measures. 18.      Fiscal policy has not faced implementation constraints.  In light of large existing social and infrastructure needs, the authorities underscored the importance of increased allocations for capital and social expenditures. They noted that the slow pace of implementation of projects related to the surplus set aside in 2004 was not unusual given the nature of administrative procedures for expenditure control and implementation and the large number of projects involved.16 They were of the view that the pace would pick up, as projects would be tendered to both local and international firms, facilitating simultaneous execution of a larger number of projects. Given the openness of the labor market and contracting process, the authorities did not foresee any major bottlenecks, although they noted that there were some signs that municipal projects, which tended to be small and more numerous, were experiencing capacity constraints.  19.      Efficient execution of the planned sizeable increase in spending over the medium term, and sustaining the level thereafter, would require a substantial strengthening of expenditure management and broadening of the non-oil revenue base. The authorities are determined to strengthen budgetary controls, management, and statistics, for which they have requested technical assistance from the IMF on budget classification and the chart of accounts, and on the IMF’s Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM). They would continue to apply standard budgetary procedures to ensure proper utilization of earmarked funds out of the 2004 and 2005 fiscal surpluses. The authorities also expressed their intention to broaden the tax base by considering the introduction of an indirect tax as part of a GCC-wide initiative.                                                   16 About SRls 5.5 billion has been spent in 2005 from the total allocation of SRls 41 billion set aside out of the 2004 fiscal surplus to be spent over the next five years. These projects include, inter alia, 1,000 new schools and 1,800 health centers.

The authorities are aware of the need to improve the management of large fiscal surpluses in order to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. While surpluses are currently managed through a buildup of deposits at the central bank, the authorities are looking into various options for establishing a “fund for future generations” or an asset management agency. One alternative also under consideration is to allow the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to hold foreign assets. They acknowledge that any future vehicle should be flexible in permitting a mix of domestic and foreign investments on rates of return and risk management factors, and take over some of the foreign assets currently managed by the central bank.  21.      The authorities indicated that the recent decision to reduce domestic fuel prices by one-third was aimed at sharing a part of the oil wealth with the population at large.17 This measure was also introduced to soften the impact of the losses made by small investors in the stock market. The authorities observed that when domestic fuel prices were increased in 1995 under difficult economic circumstances, the government made a commitment to reverse the increase once the economic situation improved. Furthermore, given the lack of public transportation in the country, the authorities believe that the reduction in oil prices will alleviate the difficulties faced by the population. The implicit subsidy introduced by this measure (about ¾ percent of GDP)18 will be covered from ARAMCO’s profits and not from the budget, which will result in an increase in quasi-fiscal expenditures and impinge on the firm’s operating budget. The authorities indicated that the price reduction would be partially reversed at year-end, with the introduction of high-octane gasoline at a higher price. Since it is expected that most drivers would opt for high-octane gasoline, the average price paid would be significantly higher than at present. 22.      Social security institutions, while financially sound, are not fully funded. The Public Pension Agency (PPA) and the General Organization of Social Insurance (GOSI) have recorded surpluses over the years but suffer from an unfunded mandate owing to early retirement benefits on very generous terms. This has caused pension payments to rise sharply since 2004. In this connection, the government has received a number of the actuarial                                                  17 Prices of gasoline and diesel were reduced from SRl 0.9 to SRl 0.6 ($0.16) per liter and from SRl 0.37 to SRl 0.25 ($0.07) per liter, respectively, in May 2006.    18 Staff estimate based on data provided by the authorities.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies: Resilience to the Equity Market Correction and Meeting the Growing Intermediation Needs 23.      The recent correction in the stock price index is unlikely to undermine the economy’s growth potential or the financial sector’s soundness. The authorities observed that the strengthening of the prudential framework over the last two years, strict enforcement of the existing regulations, and close monitoring of bank exposure to equity market risks (including monitoring through specific stress tests), effectively kept equity market risk exposure at a manageable level. In particular, SAMA regulations helped limit the risk to households and banks, as discussed in Box 3. Although banks’ brokerage and advisory fees are expected to decline in 2006, income from the booming corporate credit demand and lending to a large number of mega projects is expected to offset lost brokerage fees. Based on these considerations, both the authorities and market participants expect bank profitability to grow in 2006, albeit at a more moderate pace.  24.      The capability of the financial system is being enhanced through further liberalization. New licenses have been granted to banks and securities-related companies.20 The authorities are also supporting the development of primary and secondary financial markets for riyal-denominated assets, which will help broaden the scope of potential monetary policy instruments.21 Furthermore, they have launched a small and medium enterprise (SME) guarantee fund in 2006 with funding from the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) and commercial banks, which will help job creation.  25.      Strengthening the financial system’s soundness and efficiency through high-quality supervision and regulatory reforms continues to be an important objective. Implementation of the insurance law and effective supervision of the soon-to-be-licensed companies will allow for the development of the insurance sector with strong forward linkages to private sector activity. The Financial Intelligence Unit started operations in                                                  19 The possible measures include, inter alia, increasing contributions, reducing accrual rates, and raising the retirement age, as well as cuts in other benefits. 20 Ten foreign banks and 29 firms engaged in equity market related activities were granted licenses to operate during 2004–05. A number of insurance companies were waiting for licensing under the new 2003 insurance law. 21 Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the largest petrochemical company in the country, is going to issue a riyal-denominated Sharia-compliant bond (sukuk) for SRls 3 billion, to be traded in the stock market. In addition, the Council of Ministers approved the establishment of a secondary market for government bonds in October 2005.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  21  September 2005, thus strengthening AML/CFT enforcement.22 The CMA’s efforts to eradicate manipulative market practices and enhance transparency and accountability of market participants are expected to strengthen investor confidence and enhance market stability. The authorities confirmed that all recommendations of the 2004 FSAP have been implemented or are underway, as considered appropriate by the authorities. 23 26.      The authorities reiterated their plan to maintain the currency peg to the U.S. dollar until the formation of the GCC monetary union by 2010. At that time, the GCC countries will decide on the exchange rate regime under the  monetary union. In view of the positive terms-of-trade shock and the associated wealth effect resulting from higher oil prices, the underlying equilibrium real exchange rate would be expected to appreciate. Given the nominal peg, adjustment in the actual real exchange rate could only take place through higher inflation as domestic demand expands. The authorities do not foresee any significant inflationary pressure in terms of the CPI in the near term, given Saudi Arabia’s open trade regime and flexible labor market. However, asset price inflation (stocks and real estate) remains a risk. If inflationary pressures emerge, they would undertake policies to contain such pressures, in addition to the measures that are being taken to prevent wage-push inflation by alleviating potential labor shortages (see paragraph 30).  E.   Enhancing the Investment Climate to Broaden the Structure of the Economy 27.      Saudi Arabia’s long-term strategy hinges on its ability to attract a larger amount of domestic and foreign investment to sustain the non-oil sector’s growth performance and create employment opportunities in the private sector. Wide-ranging structural reforms implemented in recent years have already improved private sector growth performance and the investment climate.24 The private sector’s contribution to growth has                                                  22 The establishment in 2005 of the MENA Financial Action Task Force in Bahrain, with the participation of 14 countries in the region, has also contributed to strengthening AML/CFT efforts. In addition, training is being provided to the judiciary and law enforcement services, as well as to banks, on AML/CFT issues.  23 The only major difference with the FSAP recommendations relates to the pricing mechanism of SAMA’s repo and reverse repo facilities. As stated in the FSSA (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2006/cr06199.pdf), page 18, “the authorities were confident that the issue on deepening systemic liquidity arrangements was not a constraint to resilience at this stage of development of the financial system.” 24 The IFC study on Doing Business in 2006, ranked Saudi Arabia first among the Arab countries and 38th globally. 859095100105110115120125130200020012002200320042005Oil SectorPublic SectorPrivate SectorSectoral Growth Performance (Normalized to 100 in 2000)Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  22  significantly outpaced that of the public and oil sectors and this  trend is likely to accelerate over the medium term. The authorities observed that the sharp increase in FDI demonstrated the strong private sector response to the favorable investment climate.25 Promotion of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and the provision of services that were formerly supplied solely by the public sector have created a wider scope for the private sector. Furthermore, broadening the economic structure and increasing competitiveness through an increased role of the private sector would enhance supply response and contain inflationary pressures. In order to build rapidly on these gains, the authorities recognize the need to expedite the adoption of the company and agency laws.  28.      Progress is being made in diversifying the economy through the four thrust sectors: petrochemicals, non-oil mining and related industries, religious and regional tourism, and infrastructure development. Comparative advantages resulting from abundant hydrocarbon resources, economies of scale, relatively low production costs, and the presence of SABIC have established Saudi Arabia as a major hub for petrochemical products and contributed to a surge in non-oil exports.26 However, sustaining this momentum will require a rapid expansion of non-associated gas production, access to a broader regional gas network, and market-based pricing of gas to encourage supply response and avoid a feedstock shortage. 29.      The strategy to boost the non-oil economy centers on the non-oil mining and tourism sectors. The announced partial privatization of Ma’aden in 2006 through an IPO and large investment projects in this sector would be an important step toward the realization of the sector’s enormous potential.27 Tourism activity has picked up strongly with the                                                  25 Excluding oil and gas, FDI increased by 138 percent to $4.6 billion in 2005 and licensed projects recorded by Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) built up to $55 billion. 26 Several large-scale private sector-led projects, including integrated petrochemicals and refining facilities, are in the pipeline, aimed at increasing Saudi Arabia’s share of world production capacity for petrochemicals to about 13 percent. 27 Ma’aden is the public entity, under the Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources, responsible for managing the growing mining sector operations. Its main investments include projects to develop gold mining ($300 million), an integrated aluminum plant ($5 billion), a phosphate project ($2.5 billion), and processing of other industrial minerals. In addition, the mining sector development strategy involves investment in railways and other infrastructure for over $2 billion. The government intends to spin off 50 percent of Ma’aden through the proposed IPO.

Increased flexibility in the application of the Saudiization policy will be critical for maintaining price stability and competitiveness. The booming private sector and the implementation of the massive infrastructure projects are exerting pressures on the labor market which, coupled with the ongoing implementation of the Saudiization policy, is leading to labor shortages in certain sectors. The Human Resources Development Fund is playing a proactive role, focusing on education and training of the workforce and job placement as key components of the Saudiization policy. The authorities are aware of the growing shortages of contractors and skilled laborers and accordingly decided to open construction projects to both domestic and foreign contractors. The recently adopted labor law, aimed at rationalizing employment procedures and increasing labor mobility, is an important positive development in improving labor market efficiency. 31.      The opening up of the domestic economy is strengthening the competitive base of the private sector. Saudi Arabia’s WTO accession is fostering private sector activity and FDI, not only through trade liberalization,30 but also through regulatory reforms linked to the agreement. Sustained progress toward the planned GCC monetary union would be needed to realize fully the benefits of the unified GCC market, and the authorities are in discussions with the other member countries to reach agreements on the common GCC convergence criteria, establishment of the GCC common market, the framework for a common central bank or monetary authority, and other important aspects related to the monetary union.31 F.   Statistical Issues, Technical Assistance, and Other Issues 32.      Progress has continued on improving the quality and coverage of economic data. The authorities have already started implementing the recommendations of the 2005 STA TA missions on disseminating the balance of payments data in line with the Fifth Edition of the                                                  28 The number of hotels increased by 10 percent, hotel rooms by 8.3 percent, and furnished apartments by 15.5 percent in 2005.  Tourism receipts increasing by 11 percent to $6.9 billion in 2005. 29 Developing the King Abdullah Economic City and the Makkah Hills project, together will require investments of $38 billion, with the bulk of the funding coming from private sources. 30 About 350 tariff bands have been reduced to zero, and further reductions are envisaged in line with the WTO commitments. There has also been progress in the streamlining of customs’ administration and procedures, facilitating the processing of the rapidly growing imports and a significant expansion in trans-shipment activities. 31 The GCC countries have reached an agreement to negotiate all new Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) on a multilateral basis, with the exception of those with the U.S.A. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  24  Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), and on improving monetary and financial statistics. The new 2003–04 economic census, which covered the whole country, will replace the 1993 census covering only 157 cities. New samples, based on the results of the latest economic census, are currently being used to conduct surveys throughout the Kingdom.32 The authorities have nominated a GDDS coordinator in the ministry of finance and are planning to create a permanent committee to address GDDS issues. Further work is required to address the outstanding weaknesses in the statistical area, including broadening the coverage of private sector activities in the national accounts statistics; improving unemployment statistics; and compiling data on the real estate market.33  33.      The authorities are aware of the need to harmonize the statistical standards at the national level and to develop new regional statistics for the successful implementation of the planned GCC monetary union by 2010. The GCC statistical agencies are meeting regularly to discuss technical issues related to harmonization and comparability of national statistics.34 This process could lead to the eventual establishment of a regional agency for statistics (“Gulfstat”), modeled on the experience of Afristat and Eurostat. The authorities underscored the importance of transparency in oil-related data and noted the progress achieved in disseminating oil data through on-line access to the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI) database.35 34.      Saudi Arabia continues to foster growth and stability in low-income countries through development assistance efforts, both in the region and globally. Debt relief under the HIPC initiative is estimated at about $600 million as of end-2005. Concessional loans provided by the Saudi Fund for Development to LICs are approaching $500 million per annum. In addition to its sizable bilateral development assistance, Saudi Arabia also supports multilateral initiatives. It has recently committed SDR 40 million to the IMF Exogenous                                                  32 These samples will be used as the basis for the compilation of the national accounts starting in 2007, which will considerably improve data quality and coverage both of national accounts and employment statistics. 33 Further improvements in transparency and timely provision of budgetary data, and more accurate and regular data on private capital flows are also important. 34 Two agencies, in principle, agreed to conduct a regionally coordinated household survey in 2006 and a population census in 2010 to establish source data for regional economic statistics. Workshops and seminars with the involvement of technical experts are also planned. At the request of the authorities, STA will organize a regional workshop in Riyadh on the harmonization of the monetary and financial statistics for the GCC member countries in July 2006. 35 Saudi Arabia has been one of the main driving forces behind the development of the JODI database, which was opened to the public in November 2005. Currently, 93 countries representing 95 percent of the world oil production and demand participate in the JODI. The authorities continue to provide support for the JODI, including by hosting the International Energy Forum Secretariat (IEFS) in Riyadh.

According to the authorities, total Saudi bilateral assistance per annum amounts to more than 1 percent of GDP. III.   STAFF APPRAISAL 35.      The growth momentum of the economy has strengthened further, supported by the optimism arising from high oil prices and the associated strong private sector response. Prudent macroeconomic management, efficient utilization of oil resources, and structural reforms implemented in recent years have laid the foundation for a sustained private sector-led economic expansion and prosperity for the Saudi population. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained with record levels of external current account and fiscal surpluses, a rapid decline in central government debt, and continued consumer price stability. Propped up by the sustained strong terms-of-trade gains, per capita income increased by 54 percent over the last four years. While the achievements on the macroeconomic front have been impressive, the challenge is to sustain the broad-based expansion of the non-oil economy in order to create sufficient employment opportunities for the rapidly growing Saudi labor force.  36.      Saudi Arabia’s role in support of oil market stability, by increasing oil production and implementing an ambitious investment plan to expand capacity, has been very positive. The authorities’ three-prong strategy, based on expanding oil production capacity, increasing heavy crude refinery capacity, and releasing more oil for exports by substitution of gas for oil in the domestic economy is comprehensive, timely, and responsive to the growing global demand for oil. In addition to serving its systemic role, this strategy will establish ARAMCO as one of the world’s largest oil refining companies and will make Saudi Arabia a global petrochemicals hub. Accelerated gas exploration and development through greater private sector joint-venture operations and an integrated regional gas network would be critical for sustaining the current momentum in the sector. Staff commends the authorities for their support of the launching of the oil-related database under the JODI and for fostering a dialogue between consumers and producers through the IEFS headquartered in Riyadh. 37.      Saudi Arabia’s growth-promoting policies are helping to mitigate global current account imbalances by sharply increasing imports linked to a large number of private and public sector investment projects. The major policy challenge is to utilize the growing oil revenues effectively to further promote private sector growth by increasing expenditure in areas where social and private returns are high and by sustaining structural reforms. Saudi Arabia is host to a large number of foreign workers, plays an important regional role in the form of foreign direct investment, and supports a sizable development assistance program, contributing to economic stability and growth beyond the GCC.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  26  38.      The sizable fiscal surpluses recorded in recent years have contributed to fiscal consolidation and a reduction in macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The authorities have been successful in striking an appropriate balance in utilizing higher oil revenues between higher spending and maintaining a fiscal surplus. This has helped expand private sector demand and overall economic activity, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Staff supports the authorities’ policy to use a part of the fiscal surplus for further reducing government debt, which would also facilitate higher social and infrastructure spending by creating fiscal space through lower interest payments. 39.      The favorable fiscal outlook and the growing net assets position at the general government level should allow sustained high levels of infrastructure and social spending over the medium term. Staff supports the authorities’ plan to direct more resources to priority areas, and underscores the importance of efficient resource utilization by strengthening implementation, evaluation, and monitoring capacity. In this context, staff recommends that a medium-term fiscal framework be formalized in a transparent way to improve the use of fiscal resources and all future allocations be included within the annual budget to facilitate greater transparency and enhance efficiency through competition for resources. Technical assistance for this purpose could be provided by the Fund. Efficient execution of the planned sizable increase in spending over the medium term, and sustaining the level thereafter, would require a substantial strengthening of expenditure management and broadening of the non-oil revenue base. Staff supports the authorities’ request for technical assistance from the Fund in this area, and their efforts to broaden the indirect tax base as part of a GCC-wide initiative. Staff has reservations about the recent reduction in fuel prices on both efficiency and equity grounds, and recommends the introduction of a market-based mechanism for pricing of petroleum products in the future. In view of the growing importance of the projected fiscal surpluses for Saudi Arabia’s long-term fiscal sustainability, staff welcomes government’s intentions to consider options for establishing a fund for future generations or an asset management agency.  40.      Staff concurs with the authorities’ assessment that the recent significant correction in the stock price index is unlikely to undermine the economy’s growth potential and the soundness of the financial sector. Preventive tightening of prudential regulations and strict enforcement effectively contained equity market risk exposure at a manageable level. Banks are financially sound, and have built up reserves to withstand some deterioration in asset quality. The possible negative wealth effect on demand, stemming from the losses in individuals’ portfolios, is expected to be offset by the expansionary fiscal stance and strong corporate sector demand resulting from strengthening confidence in the economy due to high oil prices. Staff strongly endorses the authorities’ position that stock prices should be left to market forces without direct intervention from the government. It also welcomes the CMA’s efforts to eradicate manipulative market practices and enhance transparency and accountability of market participants, as this would increase investor confidence and help enhance market stability. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  27  41.      The financial system has started to respond to the growing challenge of intermediating resources within the domestic economy to finance the large projects under consideration. The steady liberalization of the financial system through granting of licenses to foreign banks and securities companies is enhancing competition and financial product innovation. Staff supports the authorities’ policies to deepen the capital market, foster the development of a corporate bond market and asset-backed securities activities, and accelerate licensing of insurance companies. SABIC’s forthcoming issue of a riyal-denominated bond to be traded in the stock market is a welcome development in this regard. Staff also encourages the authorities to proceed with their plans to modify the legal framework to allow for the full development of a mortgage market.  42.      Monetary policy continues to be supportive of the exchange rate peg and has contributed to the remarkable degree of consumer price stability. The strong non-oil export growth indicates that competitiveness is not an issue. Staff supports the authorities’ stated objective to keep the current exchange rate peg unchanged until the monetary union by 2010 in view of its positive impact on anchoring expectations and instilling confidence and stability in the run up to the union. However, given the positive terms-of-trade effect and the underlying appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate, the economy may experience inflation in nontradables and in asset prices. In this connection, since the nominal rate is fixed, the authorities should continue to avoid sustained one way sterilization and allow the real exchange rate to adjust through inflation, should it prove necessary. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to remain open on the choice of the exchange rate regime under the monetary union, and encourages them to reach understanding on the remaining critical steps toward the monetary union, and continue internal deliberations on the future exchange rate regime. 43.      The improved investment climate has contributed to the non-oil sector growth and employment opportunities in the private sector. The response of the private sector in terms of FDI inflows and the large number of new projects in the pipeline is encouraging. The significant progress recorded in the four thrust sectors, as identified under the authorities’ diversification strategy, will also have a significant positive impact on job creation. The booming private sector and the implementation of the massive infrastructure projects are already exerting pressures on the labor market. Staff supports the proactive role of the Human Resource Development Fund and encourages the authorities to further focus on improving the quality of the national labor force by strengthening the expanding education and training programs for nationals.

It has an associated lending agreement for an amount up to SDR 1.5 billion with the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), which was renewed for another five-year period from December 26, 2003. It is also a participant in the New Arrangement to Borrow (NAB) for an amount up to SDR 1.76 billion. In March 2001, Saudi Arabia agreed to support the PRGF-HIPC Trust with investments totaling SDR 94.4 million, which as of end-May 2006, were received as scheduled. Since 1989, Saudi Arabia disbursed SDR 49.5 million in PRGF loans under the Associated Agreement with the PRGF Trust. This loan had been fully drawn and repaid as of end-May 2006. In April 2006, Saudi Arabia agreed to contribute SDR 40 million in end-2005 NPV terms in subsidy resources to support the Exogenous Shocks Facility.  Saudi Arabia provided about SDR 2.8 million in grant associated with the IMF’s Subsidization of Emergency Assistance for Natural Disasters.  VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement  Saudi Arabia maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Saudi Arabian riyal was formally pegged to the U.S. dollar, effective January 2003, as part of GCC preparations towards adopting a common currency in 2010. Prior to that, it was officially pegged to the SDR at the rate of SRls 4.28255=SDR 1, with margins of 7.25 percent even though in practice it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1986, with a middle rate of SRls 3.7450=$1.

The TCP with the Kingdom is still the World Bank’s largest reimbursable nonlending country program. The budget for this year’s program is about 13 percent higher than that of FY 2005 and represents 13 staff years. The Bank continues to have an increasing involvement in more substantive and broader scope TA (comprehensive sector strategies with the Ministry of Water and Electricity, as well as broader scope work with the Public Investment Fund on the North-South Railway and with the Ministry of Health on the global assessment of health financing). The above activities plus our ongoing TA to the electricity and telecoms regulators, the Food & Drugs Authority, the General Investment Authority, and the recently restructured Ministry of Communications and Information Technology now account for almost 75 percent of the total TA. 2.      Some of the important ongoing activities in FY 2005 include: • Institutional Strengthening: The nascent regulators for the telecommunications, electricity, and industrial estates development (Communications and IT Commission; Saudi Electricity Regulatory Authority and Saudi Organization for Industrial Estates and Technology Zones, respectively), as well as the Ministry of Water and Electricity, the Supreme Commission for Tourism, and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology.   • General Private Sector Development: Development of Industrial Estates; Industrial Sector Competitiveness Analysis; Technology Transfer and Diffusion, Expansion of Industrial Exports. • Privatization and PSP: Railway Network Expansion initiatives; privatization of the Grain Silos and Flour Mills Organization (GSFMO); and BOT for the new Hajj terminal in Jeddah. • General Reform Initiatives: Power Sector Restructuring and Regulation; Health Financing and Insurance; Investment Climate Assessment and Investment Promotion; Removal of Administrative Barriers; Environmental Strategy; Food and Drugs regulation. • Water Sector Strategy and Action Plan. In January 2004, Bank organized a major workshop attended by over 200 people. This successful activity held over several days, constituted phase 1 of the action plan. Phase 2, launched in May 2004 to help develop a strategy with a timeline for all deliverables, and was organized as a retreat over several days as well.

Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are considered broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. In November 2005 the Saudi Arabian statistical authorities decided to participate in the Fund’s GDDS. The authorities still need to appoint a national GDDS coordinator. Work is underway to finalize the metadata and plans for improvement. National accounts and price indices  2.      Up-to-date metadata on national accounts methodology are not readily available. Data on GDP, value added per sector at current and constant prices, and GDP deflators are available on an annual basis. The Central Department of Statistics (CDS) completed several major surveys and censuses in 2002, which aimed at providing a more accurate picture of sectoral developments, household income and expenditures, and demographic and labor force developments. However, the agricultural data included in the national accounts, although rebased to 1999, continue to follow an outdated methodology, and the last agricultural census took place in 1981. Following the completion of the 1999 household and income expenditure survey, the CDS revised national accounts data for the periods 1996–99 and 2000 on the expenditure side, based on the results of the survey, and adopted 1999 as a base year, replacing 1970 for the computation of aggregates in constant prices. On the production side, 2000 data are still estimated. For 2001, the establishment survey generated estimates for both expenditure and production. Those estimates will be finalized once oil sector data (exports and imports of oil and gas by quantity and value, intermediate consumption, and revenue and expenditures of companies in the oil sector) become available to the CDS. The building of a new base year is the first step in a global plan for transition from the 1968 System of National Accounts (1968 SNA) to 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). The objective of the CDS was to change all national accounts to the 1993 SNA by 2004. For that purpose, the CDS introduced questionnaires for its 1999 establishment expenditure survey so as to derive the information necessary to reconstruct the data according to the 1993 SNA. As a second step, the CDS published in September 2003 national accounts data for 1999 and 2000 following the 1993 SNA; estimates for subsequent years are now available. 3.      The completion of the 1999 household expenditure and income survey enabled the CDS to construct a new CPI based on an updated basket (the previous cost-of-living index was based on a basket dating back to 1985). The compilation and the dissemination of the new index started in January 2003. It covers all 13 regions and all main cities within those regions, in addition to rural areas, and includes 420 goods and services (versus 180 for the previous index). There is a quarterly wholesale price index referenced as 1988=100.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  39 4.      The CDS initiated in 2002/2003 a quarterly survey of establishments employing 50 or more in all sectors of activity except agriculture. It planned to carry out a general economic and population census, which was to include all sectors and agents (public, private, agriculture, nonprofit, foreign companies, and households) in all cities (the 1993 census covered only private establishments, excluded agriculture, and covered only 158 cities). The population census started in September 2004. Another project, still on the drawing board is the general GCC population census of 2010. 5.      More recent progress in the implementation of surveys and censuses conducted and planned by the CDS are as follows: • The annual economic survey of establishments for 2001 has been completed.  • The 1999 manufacturing sector five-yearly census was completed. The next census, which will be part of the above-mentioned 2004 census, will cover all establishments. • The transportation sector census of 1998 was completed. The next census is expected to be conducted with the global census of 2004. • The annual household-based labor force survey for 2002 has been completed and the results compiled. • The five-yearly census for 2001 on establishment-based wages and salaries was completed and 2001 data on private sector wages for all activities were published on the web (see below).  • The agricultural sector census for 1999 was completed (by the Ministry of Agriculture) and the census-based data were published. The next census will be part of the 2004 global census.  • The annual demographic survey of 2000 was completed.  • The annual survey for the compilation of import and export price indices, which started in 2001, has been completed. 6.      The processed surveys will allow the publication of the national accounts statistics in accordance with the 1968 and 1993 SNA presentation in the forthcoming CDS annual report.  7.      The authorities have also developed databases on labor markets available for use by the regional labor offices. These databases were completed and a weekly report on unemployment has been prepared and sent to the Council of Ministers since 2003.

The CDS established in July 2001 an internet website through which it started disseminating: (a) national accounts data for 1996–2001 (with the new base 1999); (b) population and labor force data for 2002; (c) private sector wages and salaries for 2001 for all activities; (d) all surveys from 1996 to 1999; (e) cost-of-living index; (f) exports and imports up to 2001; and (g) tables, definitions, and methodology. 9.      Coordination between the CDS, SAMA and the Ministry of Finance is well-established. The CDS collects data on imports and exports of merchandise, which are directly inputted into an on-line database shared with SAMA. There are also weekly coordination meetings between the CDS and SAMA’s research Department to settle outstanding data issues. With regard to the Ministry of Finance, the CDS receives data from the ministry on a regular basis and reclassifies them according to the SNA methodology, which differs from the aggregation used by the ministry for budgetary control purposes. In contrast to the above, there is no effective coordination between the CDS and the Ministry of Petroleum, except through the formal quarterly setting of the Data Committee which includes the CDS, Budget’s Final Accounts specialists, SAMA, and the Petroleum Ministry. Typically, oil and gas data are received by the CDS after a long lag following the end of the reference period. Fiscal sector 10.      During the consultation missions, the authorities provided detailed information on the operations of the central government, including data on amortization payments and financing. The financing data is broken down between bank and nonbank sources. The data reported also include stock of the gross domestic debt. The debt data is classified by holders. In addition, statistical information is provided on the Saudi Fund for Development and some data on the PIF, as well as on four other lending institutions (Saudi Agricultural Bank, Saudi Credit Bank, Saudi Industrial Development Fund, and Real Estate Development Fund). However, although authorities have recently given consideration to the publishing of detailed fiscal data and presenting consolidated public finances (central government, PIF, and AGIs), these data have not yet been published. 11.      Following recommendations by the STA/Government Finance Statistics (GFS) technical assistance mission (September 1997), the authorities are working to fully address remaining weaknesses in the fiscal data. As a first step, expenditure on wages and salaries has been reclassified to be fully captured in line with the UN System of National Accounts (SNA) methodology. However, there is no evidence of progress in compiling and reporting fiscal data in line with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) or in reporting data for either the GFS Yearbook or the IFS. The MOFNE is planning on using GFSM 2001 definitions to report its fiscal data in a format that is harmonized with 1993 SNA.

Most monetary and financial data are readily available in SAMA’s Monthly Statistical Bulletin, published with a lag of about one month and available since March 2000 on the SAMA website. In particular, commercial bank data are adequate and provided on a regular basis. Information on deposit interest rates is included (and published on a daily basis in the national press), but not interest rates on government securities. Monetary data for SAMA are provided to the Fund on a monthly basis. More disaggregated data on SAMA’s liabilities are only provided during consultation missions. The timeliness of data, however, has improved starting with the April 2001 submission, when lags were reduced to one month. Information on aggregates related to the stock market and mutual fund transactions are available monthly on SAMA’s website. More detailed data on the stock market, including selected data on listed companies such as share prices, dividend announcement, are instantaneously available on the new electronic platform TADAWUL which has, since October 2001, replaced the former electronic ESIS system for stock trading, clearing, and settlements. 13.      The authorities have revised the definition of official international reserves in light of the recommendations of a STA-MED mission (May 16–19, 1998) and reported revised data for January 1996 and onward. The authorities noted that the foreign exchange cover of the currency in circulation with the public was included in the revised definition, as were other investments in foreign marketable instruments in conformity with a strict interpretation of the balance of payments manual. No detailed information has been provided on the composition of foreign assets that were excluded from the revised official international reserves data. Balance of payments 14.      The May 2005 STA balance of payments (BOP) mission reviewed the status of work in implementing the recommendations made by the 1997 balance of payments technical assistance mission and observed that the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has made progress in implementing those recommendations, particularly in the design and dispatch of new survey forms used for data collection, including surveys for several government agencies and ministries, and a large number of private sector companies. The timeliness of data has improved, and the coverage of establishments has increased substantially, in addition to financial institutions from which the SAMA already received data on a regular basis. While noting the improvements in data coverage and timeliness, the mission saw the need for further work on improving source data and recommended the introduction of the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) as well as enhancements to the existing data reporting systems to address current gaps, especially in the financial account.

CDS is responsible for collecting, processing, and disseminating international trade data. Saudi Arabia does not compile an International Investment Position. Saudi Arabia reports international liquidity data on a monthly basis and BOP data on an annual basis to STA. STA has published 2004 data in the 2005 Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and 2005 BOP data are published in the International Finance Statistics (IFS). Data publication 16.      Publication is generally limited to officially finalized and approved data. Data on real sector, national accounts, financial sector, limited budgetary accounts, and balance of payments are published in official documents, such as the CDS and the SAMA annual reports. In addition, as mentioned above, main financial data are available in SAMA’s Monthly Statistical Bulletin with a lag of about one month, and since March 2000 on the SAMA website. The budget document is not published but limited actual fiscal data are published in SAMA’s annual report. Data provided to the consultation missions are available in the Fund documents and intended for internal circulation only. The authorities issued in May 2001 a directive requiring departments and ministries to publish relevant data, including information on GDP and other vital statistics on a regular basis. As a result of the new directive, a Data Committee was established in 2002, including the CDS, Budget’s Final Accounts specialists, SAMA, and the Petroleum Ministry. The Committee meets in principle on a quarterly basis to discuss data issues and decide about the publication of quarterly data. Data dissemination  17.      Saudi Arabia participated in a regional GDDS Metadata Development Workshop, in Abu Dhabi during February 27-March 9, 2005. Several metadata tables were prepared during the workshop, but substantial additional work is required to finalize the metadata and plans for improvement needed for participation in the GDDS. Although Saudi Arabia has indicated its intention to participate in the GDDS, the authorities have not appointed a GDDS coordinator as yet.

Real GDP growth was strong (6.6 percent) with oil and non-oil GDP growing at 5.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. Inflation remained very low at 0.7 percent, reflecting mainly the very open and flexible labor market and the open trade system. The Saudi authorities continued to respond constructively to alleviate the pressures created by the fast growing global demand for oil by increasing oil production, implementing an ambitious investment plan to expand the country’s sustainable gross production capacity to 12.5 million barrels per day by 2009, and expanding its refining capacity by 44 percent over the next five years.                                                   1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [August 28,] 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

C. 20431 USA  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public   45 External and fiscal developments were dominated by the high world market oil prices. The external current account surplus increased by 8.6 percentage points to reach 29.3 percent of GDP in 2005. The central government overall surplus almost doubled to 18.4 percent of GDP, despite a sharp increase in expenditures. A part of the surplus was used to reduce central government debt by 25 percentage point to 39.6 percent of GDP. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) net foreign assets increased by $66 billion to $150.5 billion, an equivalent of around 16 months of imports of goods and services.   Strong economic fundamentals, high investor optimism, and a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector (39 percent) helped sustain the stock market boom in 2005. The Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) increased by 104 percent in 2005, and further by 24 percent to reach its peak on February 25, 2006. Thereafter, the index declined by about 45 percent through end-May 2006 (33 percent below the beginning of the year level), but still remained at 3½ times above its end-2002 level. The banking sector performance strengthened further in 2005, partly due to income from stock market-related activity. SAMA introduced measures to limit bank credit exposure to the equity market and strengthened oversight. Despite increases in international interest rates, SAMA did not revise the benchmark interest rates from February to June 2006, but increased the repo and reverse repo rates by 20 basis points on June 29, 2006, broadly in line with the latest increase in the FED funds rate. The Saudi riyal appreciated by 3.4 percent in real effective terms during the 12-month period through March 2006, reflecting the movement of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies.        Prospects for 2006 are very favorable in light of the expected sustained increase in global demand for oil. Real GDP growth is expected to remain robust at almost 6 percent despite lower oil sector growth (1.6 percent). Inflation in the first quarter of 2006 was about 2 percent (on an annual basis) but is projected to be 1 percent for 2006 as a whole. Both the external current account and the central government overall fiscal balances are expected to register substantial surpluses of 31.1 percent of GDP and 17.2 percent of GDP, respectively. Reflecting the government policy to use a part of the fiscal surplus to reduce public debt, central government debt is projected to decline by around 23 percentage points to 17 percent to GDP.

Steady implementation of structural reforms has improved the investment climate and paved the way for Saudi Arabia’s accession to the WTO in December 2005. In order to sustain the momentum, privatization of government activities is being advanced steadily and a large number of mega projects in the non-oil sector are being implemented through public-private partnerships. The Saudiization policy, aimed at creating private sector employment for Saudi nationals, continued to be applied in a flexible manner, thus contributing to wage and price stability in an environment of accelerating economic growth.   Executive Board Assessment       Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
