A staff team, comprising Messrs. Pellechio (Head), Pearson, Samuel, Verreydt, and Visconti (all WHD), held discussions in St. Johns during May 22-June 2,2003. The team was assisted by staff of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). Mr. Bennett and Ms. Gust (OED) attended key meetings. The team met with the Prime Minister, Minister of State for Finance, Financial Secretary, Budget Director, other senior government officials, and representatives of labor, business, and the financial sector. l Exchange system. Antigua and Barbuda is one of eight Eastern Caribbean countries comprising the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU); six are Fund members. ECCU countries share a common central bank (the ECCB) and a common currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Fund Relations are summarized in Appendix I. 8 Political situation. The Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party has been in power since 1976. Elections are due no later than end-June 2004. Early elections have been announced but no firm date has been set. Strong public concerns have been raised about governance, related mainly to alleged misuse of medical benefits funds, nontransparent financing of government, and the granting of large discretionary tax concessions. 8 Previous consultation. At the conclusion of the previous consultation on March 15,2002, Directors recommended a strong upfront adjustment to raise public savings and support growth- oriented investment. Directors urged implementation of measures to bolster tax revenue and cost recovery in public enterprises, including through reduction of public sector overstaffing. Concerns were raised about nontransparent offshore financing of government operations. . Effectiveness of Fund policy advice. The authorities acknowledged that previous Fund advice has largely not been followed. While agreeing with the need for fiscal consolidation, they stressed their belief in a gradual approach so as to minimize social costs. In their view, a lack of private sector dynamism has warranted the government’s policy as employer-of-last-resort. 0 Surveillance issues. The authorities face a deepening fiscal crisis. Public debt exceeds GDP, external and domestic arrears are rising (from 33 percent of GDP at end-2002), and the central government has a financing gap for 2003 estimated at 13 percent of GDP-implying a risk of forced, disorderly adjustment. A comprehensive program is urgently needed, with both strong upfront fiscal adjustment and a strategy for medium-term sustainability based on structural reforms to improve competitiveness and governance. Antigua and Barbuda will participate in the FSAP for the ECCU, which should give more information on banking soundness and the effectiveness of supervision. 8 Statistics are inadequate for surveillance. Significant weaknesses are described in Appendix II.

Inflation remained low, reflecting the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by just under 5 percent, in line with the weakening of the dollar. The external current account deficit widened by 4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 11 percent, as tourism receipts fell and scheduled interest obligations rose. l The authorities see fiscal expansion as necessary to compensate for sluggish private activity. The 2003 budget represents a further relaxation of the fiscal stance, with tax cuts and significant spending increases, particularly on wages. The overall deficit of central government is estimated to widen to over 12 percent of GDP in 2003, and the primary deficit to reach 8 percent of GDP. a Antigua and Barbuda is facing an eventual fiscal crisis. Public debt is 115 percent of GDP. External and domestic arrears are estimated at 33 percent of GDP and the central government’s 2003 financing gap at over 13 percent of GDP. The government is encountering a severe cash constraint, resulting in mounting external and domestic arrears, including on wages. There is a risk of a forced, disorderly adjustment. a In the past, the authorities have managed to avert a full crisis, by accumulating arrears and obtaining financing in a nontransparent manner from offshore banks run by influential individuals with substantial direct investment interests in the country. Their continued willingness to finance government will determine whether a crisis can be avoided. a Putting fiscal balances on a sustainable path requires a strong upfront fiscal adjustment, as well as continued efforts over the medium term. Staff recommended a package of measures beginning with an upfront adjustment of 4% percent of GDP as a minimum step toward a primary consolidation of at least 11 percent of GDP needed over the medium term. The substantial medium-term adjustment should be feasible if far-reaching fiscal reforms can be implemented, including introduction of a value-added tax in a regional context, streamlining capital expenditure, and civil service and public pension reforms. Long- standing governance issues in tax and customs administration need to be addressed. a The authorities are planning bilateral negotiations with creditors to reduce and reschedule debt, including through asset sales and refinancing at lower rates. Staff stressed the need for debt restructuring to be part of a comprehensive adjustment program, as well as the importance of transparency in negotiations with offshore financial centers. The authorities are moving toward participation in the regional FSAP, but have serious concerns about the methodology.

Through the 1990’s, Antigua and Barbuda enjoyed relatively high growth with strong social indicators, despite chronic fiscal weaknesses (Figure 1). Excluding the hurricane year of 1995, growth averaged 4% percent a year for the decade. But since the mid- 1990s growth has been decelerating, reflecting declines in the key tourism sector and in private investment as competitiveness has eroded (Table 1). 2. The authorities gradually relaxed the fiscal stance in an attempt to sustain growth and employment, but financed this by accumulating external arrears. The private sector remained largely insulated from the fiscal problems as membership in the currency board ensured nominal exchange rate and price stability-by precluding any attempt to inflate the debt away; and the government did not try to raise the tax burden on domestic firms to close the imbalances. Per capita income has been maintained at more than double the ECCU average and social indicators are among the highest in the region. 3. Debt reschedulings in 1997-2000 provided an opportunity to correct the macroeconomic imbalances, but fiscal and structural weaknesses were not addressed. Official and private creditors agreed on a bilateral basis to large reschedulings-including partial write-offs and reduced interest rates-lowering the stock of external arrears from a peak of 90 percent of GDP in 1995 to 14 percent of GDP at end-2000. However, in the face of a further weakening in growth, the authorities again increased the fiscal stimulus rather than implementing structural reforms to improve the private investment environment. Public debt remained high, surpassing GDP in 2000 and on an upward path. II. ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS, 2OOO-M1~-2003 4. The economy continued to slow, as tourism declined and the investment climate deteriorated. The global economic slowdown, coupled with the events of September 11 and subsequent security concerns, contributed to a further drop in tourism receipts. Despite a real exchange rate depreciation as the US dollar weakened against major currencies, private investment rose only modestly in 2002, reflecting growing concerns about the business climate. Public investment, in contrast, rose sharply. Preliminary indicators suggest some recovery in activity during the first half of 2003 on account of higher government spending, stay-over visitors, and construction activity.

The central government’s overall fiscal deficit widened to more than Primaty deficib have widened... 30 (In percent of GDP) 28 11 percent of GDP in 2002, and the primary deficit to 6% percent of GDP. The public sector deficit has been about 1% percent of GDP lower than the central government balance, reflecting the surplus of the social security scheme (Tables 2 and 3). 6. The fiscal deterioration was driven by growth in spending, and occurred despite an important improvement in revenue effort. Noninterest expenditures rose by 6 percent of GDP from 2000 to 2002, split equally between capital outlays and other goods and services. While the wage bill did not rise significantly, part of the higher cost of other goods and services reflected pay for temporary employees. Direct government employment rose sharply in late 2002 and early 2003, as decisions were taken to expand public employment significantly before approval of the election-year budget. Preliminary data indicate that the central government’s wage bill grew by over 8 percent in the first half of 2003 relative to the same period in 2002. . ..a~ noninterest expenditures rosa 35 35 30 I 0 Othernon-interest expend&m 30 0 Capilalspending n Wage bill 25 r-l rl I 25 20 20 15 15 10 10 5 5 0 0 898 1999 2000 2001 2002 7. Current revenue rose by 2% percent of GDP during 2001-02, largely due to improvements in tax and arrears collection, and a higher customs service charge. However, as part of the authorities’ efforts to reinvigorate growth, the 2003 budget provided for expanded tax concessions to the tourism sector, a reduction in withholding tax from 40 percent to 25 percent, and a reduction in the tax on the purchase (or import) of motor vehicles. The corporate tax rate was lowered from 40 percent to 35 percent, which will affect revenues from 2004 on. 8. Public sector deficits have been covered by specially negotiated loans and by arrears. Financing has been provided nontransparently by offshore banks run by influential individuals with large direct investment interests in the country; little timely public information is available on the loans. New financing flows from both offshore and domestic banks have been secured by earmarking revenues to reduce default risk.

External arrears, mainly to bilateral official creditors (principally, Italy and Japan) and commercial banks, increased sharply to over 19 percent of GDP at end-2002 (Tables 4 and 8). In early 2003 the government started to seek a substantial bilateral external debt write-off. Domestic arrears of the public sector reached 14 percent of GDP, almost half of which was owed to commercial banks.’ In the first half of 2003 the government renegotiated most of these loans, and in August proposed a go-day moratorium on amortization payments (not concluded yet), to enable it to fulfill other current commitments, mainly the wage bill whose payments have been late by 2-3 weeks. Intra-public sector arrears are also substantial: the unpaid employer and employee contributions of government to the social security and medical benefits schemes and board of education reached 18 percent of GDP at end-2002. 10. Antigua and Barbuda’s imputed reserves at the ECCB rose, despite a jump in the external current account deficit to 11 percent of GDP in 2002 (Table 5).2 Tourism receipts fell in 2002 in spite of a modest recovery in stay-over visitors, due to discounting of tourism services and a fall in cruise ship arrivals. Imports remain below historical levels in terms of GDP, though construction-related imports linked to investment projects and hotel refurbishment picked up. About half of the current account deficit was financed by direct investment, the remainder through arrears and other short-term flows. At end-2002, net External Sector Developments -6 , , 90 1998 l999 2000 2”” I 2002 imputed international reserves at the ECCB had risen to more than three months of imports. 11. The expansion of monetary aggregates accelerated in 2002. In the context of the imputed reserve build-up, broad money rose by 6% percent and private sector credit by 4% percent (Table 6). With continuing excess liquidity, banks further accumulated net foreign assets in 2002. Deposit rates were lowered when the ECCB cut the floor interest rate on saving deposits by 1 percentage point to 3 percent in July 2002. Banks’ average prime rate fell by only % percent, which bankers attributed to increased lending risks in an uncertain fiscal environment. Broad money increased by 16% percent in the first half of 2003, mainly due to a large time deposit. Commercial banks continued to face excess liquidity and increased their net foreign assets. i A government proposal to redefine its accounting with the medical benefits scheme puts its net debt to the scheme at 10% percent of GDP. A reconciliation of accounts is underway. 2 Given the gaps in trade data, balance of payments developments need to be interpreted with caution.

Indicators of banking sector soundness are mixed: prudential indicators are on average close to the norm, but profitability is low. The ratio of commercial banks’ nonperforming loans to total loans rose from just over 9 percent in December 2000 to just over 11 percent in December 2002, while provisioning increased from 19% percent to nearly 24 percent of nonperforming loans (Table 7).3 The capital-adequacy ratio declined by around half a point to just below 12 percent, but remained well above prudential norms. Banks have taken steps to limit their exposure to the government; though unsecured credits to government remain a source of vulnerability, net credit to government has declined as a share of bank assets since 2000 and new financing flows are generally secured by earmarked government revenues. Profitability has increased marginally, but, at 0.4 percent in 2002, the return on assets was the lowest in the ECCU. 13. Supervision of the offshore sector has been strengthened. The regulatory framework was enhanced by amendments to the International Business Corporations Act and the Money Laundering Prevention Act, as well as anti-terrorist financing legislation. Staffing of the two principal agencies, the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) and the Office of the National Drug and Money Laundering Control Policy (ONDCP) was increased, and the two agencies have formalized an effective working relationship. The ONDCP has been admitted to the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units. Enforcement has also improved, particularly of the rule that all offshore banks have a physical presence in Antigua and Barbuda-which resulted in a decline in licensed institutions from 22 in 2002 to 15 in 2003. 14. Implementation of structural reforms has been slow. The government’s plan to privatize the management of the international airport has not reached its final stage. There has been little movement toward cost recovery or reduction of overstaffing in public enterprises, which have continued to run losses. Recommendations of a study on public sector reform and civil service downsizing funded by the Caribbean Development Bank have not been implemented, owing to concerns about employment losses. The introduction of the automated system for customs administration (ASYCUDA) has been repeatedly delayed. The final phase of CARICOM’s common external tariff, scheduled for adoption on February 28, 2003 but linked to the introduction of ASYCUDA, was not implemented.4 State import monopolies for petroleum and vegetable products remain. However, flexible retail fuel prices were adopted in April 2003, providing for pass-through of oil costs. 3 The ECCB’s prudential guidelines stipulate a maximum nonperforming to total loan ratio of 10 percent. 4 CARICOM’s schedule for reducing the maximum rate of the common external tariff was to be implemented in four phases, lowering the maximum tariff from 35 to 20 percent between 1993 and 1998. Tariff rates in Antigua and Barbuda still range from 0 to 35 percent for most goods, with an unweighted average of 10 percent.

In light of a large financing gap in the 2003 budget, the government was encountering a severe cash constraint, resulting in mounting external and domestic arrears, including on wages. 16. In the previous Article IV consultation, Directors had stressed that fiscal consolidation would have to be a top policy priority, despite the unfavorable environment. They supported an adjustment program elaborated with the ECCB, which recommended reductions in tax concessions, a wage freeze and cuts in government employment, and they emphasized the need for fiscal structural reform. The authorities pointed to stronger efforts to collect tax arrears and the liberalization of retail petroleum prices in 2003 as indications of their commitment to adjustment, but explained that post September 11 repercussions had continued to disrupt their plans for controlling spending, since it was difficult to shift government employees to the tourism sector. They were skeptical about the efficacy of policies to encourage private investment and employment. The staff responded that this view risked being self-fulfilling as long as public employment remained the anchor of social policy, with the government’s heavy demand for financing and its arrears to suppliers crowding out the private sector. 17. Discussions focused on three key issues: prospects for the rest of 2003; the extent and pace of fiscal reform needed to move toward a sustainable debt level; and structural reforms in other areas needed to improve competitiveness and reinvigorate the private sector. A. Prospects for 2003 18. Unless a financing shortfall sparks a crisis, further fiscal expansion is expected to drive a modest upturn in activity in 2003. Given global uncertainties and steep competition, a sharp rebound in gross receipts from the tourism sector is not expected, despite a further recovery in tourist arrivals. The approved budget for 2003 provides for a significant further relaxation of the fiscal stance through spending increases-especially the wage bill-and tax cuts. Higher consumption is likely to raise imports, resulting in a widening of the external current account deficit. Selected Economic Indicators, 2002-04 Prel.

The budget also contains a number of tax cuts designed to provide short-term stimulus to growth. 20. On current trends, the 2003 budget has a financing shortfall in excess of 13 percent of GDP. The authorities broadly agreed with the staffs projected financing gap and noted that they are exploring alternative financing sources. In the first half of 2003, the government renegotiated most of its domestic loans that were in arrears, partly relying on revenue earmarking as a means of ensuring debt service. Discussions for additional relief are underway with domestic banks and also with offshore financing centers. The authorities discussed their plans for bilateral negotiations with creditors to reduce and reschedule debt, including through asset sales and refinancing at lower rates. 21. Staff encouraged the authorities to make debt restructuring part of a comprehensive adjustment program that would establish a clear strategy for returning to sustainability. They emphasized that the authorities’ current plans, even if successful, would not be enough to close this year’s financing gap, and urged substantial fiscal adjustment as a critical part of an orderly resolution. Though revenue earmarking might help to postpone the adjustment, it would do so at the cost of limiting the government’s future options. Staff also stressed the need for transparency in the government’s dealings with the offshore financing centers. 22. The mission identified a package of measures, which could yield 4% percent of GDP, to supplement the authorities’ plans to deal with the financing gap. Key elements would include restricting retired workers from receiving both a regular wage and a pension, cutting back overstaffed public entities; and aggressively reducing discretionary tax concessions. Staff estimates suggest the package would reduce the wage bill and other noninterest spending by 2l/4 percent of GDP, and raise tax revenue by a similar amount. 23. Staff recommended the package also as a much needed signal to creditors and investors of the government’s resolve to tackle fiscal and governance problems. This is a minimum upfront step toward the primary consolidation of more than 11 percent of GDP needed over the medium term for sustainability. Such a substantial medium-term adjustment would be feasible if civil service overstaffing were addressed and capital expenditure scaled back to identifiable projects with official financing. The authorities broadly agreed with the staffs recommendations and analysis. However, they indicated their preference for a gradual approach to fiscal consolidation, owing to their lack of confidence in the private sector’s willingness to invest and generate employment to absorb public sector workers.

In addition to the urgent need for upfront consolidation, far-reaching fiscal reforms are needed to put the budget on a sustainable medium-term path. Priority areas include: a broadening the tax base through the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT); l strengthening tax and customs administration, notably reducing corporate tax arrears and the under-invoicing of imports; a improving public expenditure management and budgetary practices; and a retrenchment of public employment in the context of a well-designed public sector reform. 25. Staff made the point that tax rate reductions should have been delayed until they could form part of a comprehensive tax reform that would offset the revenue loss. This would include the introduction of a VAT. The authorities recognized that tax reform, especially the introduction of a VAT, is essential to raise revenue. Such a measure, which is under discussion for the ECCU region, would reduce the budget’s reliance on trade and corporate taxes, which adversely affect competitiveness. The authorities were hopeful that a VAT could be introduced in 1% to 2 years, but staff advised that preparations would take at least 3 years, given international experience and the need for coordination within the region. However, preparations would necessarily include a major restructuring of the tax and customs administrations, and this could significantly raise revenues even prior to the VAT. 26. Long-standing governance issues in tax and customs administration need to be addressed and tax concessions significantly reduced. Staff reiterated the need for fundamental reforms to improve the effectiveness of the tax and customs administrations. Laws are not consistently enforced, and there is widespread under-invoicing of imports. Tax concessions, both statutory and discretionary, have been estimated at 12% percent of GDP in 2000. The establishment of a commission to limit exemptions is a welcome step, but substantial revenue could already be raised by eliminating or restricting existing concessions. 27. Budget execution should be strengthened by more effective expenditure management and improved budget practices. The authorities noted that they had little control over outlays by line ministries, which pursue projects without coordination, leading to unexpected delays and interruptions which reduce efficiency and returns. Cash management is also severely constrained by revenue earmarking for debt service. The mission noted that the underlying cause of the difficulties is not earmarking but insufficient budgetary resources to meet commitments. 28. Civil service reform is critical. Public sector employment is estimated at 13,000- one in six of the population or about half of the labor force-10,000 of whom are employed by the central government. The authorities acknowledged the need to review the size of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - civil service but have not adopted a fully formulated strategy and indicated that any retrenchment would need to take place only very gradually. C. Public Sector Reform and Governance 29. The financial performance of public enterprises needs to be improved, with the aim of privatizing some operations. Staff stressed the importance of improving efficiency, to lower the costs of utilities and other services. The authorities acknowledged the need to address overstaffing in many enterprises as key to reducing costs and moving toward lower tariffs. They stated their intention to do so in the context of civil service reform and noted plans to privatize key public enterprises, in particular, airport management, port services, hotels and telecommunications, with the proceeds to be applied to arrears and debt reduction. 30. Steps are underway to improve transparency and governance. Public debate identified three principal concerns: (i) alleged misuse of funds of the medical benefits scheme; (ii) nontransparent government financing by a few influential investors; and (iii) sizeable discretionary tax concessions for investment. The authorities highlighted ongoing efforts to reconcile finances between the government and medical benefits scheme and the formation of a committee to evaluate requests for tax concessions, with a view to limiting them. The staff supported these efforts, adding that the concessions committee should also monitor whether intended benefits for investment and growth are realized. The authorities also acknowledged long-standing governance problems in customs administration. 31. The authorities broadly discussed plans for a comprehensive pension reform. They expressed concern about the cost of the present defined-benefit structure given an aging population. The staff highlighted the importance of ensuring actuarial balance over the long term and stressed the need for the government to clear its arrears on employer and employee contributions to the Social Security Scheme. Staff also cautioned about initiatives to make the scheme lend to the national development bank and finance lease payments on recently constructed government buildings. The authorities discussed their intention to start paying contributions and to clear some arrears by transferring land to the Social Security Scheme. The staff noted that this was not necessarily the optimal way to finance social security. D. Financial Sector Policy 32. The authorities expressed confidence in the soundness of the banking system and the quality of its supervision. Foreign-owned banks-backed by parent companies with strong capital bases-account for two thirds of banking sector assets so that risks are probably concentrated in locally owned banks, which also have larger exposure to government debt. Staff noted that linkages between onshore and offshore banks through common controlling shareholders create a risk that gaps in the regulatory and supervisory frameworks of the two sectors could be exploited, in particular for nontransparent external financing of government, to shift resident deposits to offshore accounts, or for money- laundering. A formal working relationship should be developed between the supervisory Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- agencies-the FSRC and the ECCB. Staff expressed serious reservations about a proposal to allow the loss-making national development bank to take deposits. 33. The fiscal difficulties have spilled over to the financial sector, raising delinquency risks, keeping lending rates high, and depressing private investment. While the government regularized its debt to most commercial banks in early 2003 and has proposed a moratorium, government arrears to suppliers and workers create delinquency risks for banks. The cause of the large interest rate spread was a source of dispute: staff queried whether the spreads could be explained by recent high time deposit rates paid by commercial banks-which the authorities saw as the main explanation, and considered that spreads would subside once these deposits matured. In the staffs view, the main explanation was more likely to be a growing risk premium. 34. Debt-servicing difficulties of Antigua and Barbuda pose contagion risks through their possible effects on confidence in the rest of the ECCU. However, direct channels of contagion are limited. Domestic public debt is held mainly by local institutions, as most regional financial institutions have limited their exposure.’ Intra-ECCU banking exposures are also limited, largely confined to the interbank market. The potential impact from trade links is small, since the ECCU accounts for less than 5 percent of Antigua and Barbuda’s imports. Contagion would arise if a failure of a locally-owned bank led to runs on the deposits of banks in other ECCU countries, currency conversion, or capital flight, 35. The authorities expressed their frustration at restrictions on offshore services imposed by other countries. They viewed the restrictions as penalizing efforts to diversify the economy and noted that since 2002, the number of offshore casinos and gambling companies had fallen from 77 to 32 and the number of international businesses by over 750. However, they expected renewed growth in the sector due to the strengthened supervisory framework and its impact on Antigua and Barbuda’s standing as a reputable offshore center. They described plans to improve the legal framework for the FSRC and ONDCP, as well as for banks, insurance companies, and trusts. 36. The authorities have agreed to participate in the FSAP for the ECCU, although the scheduling of the missions remains under discussion. The mission recommended the FSAP as a vehicle for a timely review of: (i) the effectiveness of the supervisory and AML/CFT framework; (ii) bank exposure to government; and (iii) the potential for contagion risk between the offshore and domestic financial sectors. The authorities have, however, raised concerns about the assessment, on the basis of standards and codes to the design of which Antigua and Barbuda has not contributed. 5 A small percentage of treasury bills is held by commercial banks outside Antigua and Barbuda, purchased through the discount window of the ECCB, which bears the risk.

The currency board has delivered price stability, but competitiveness is a concern. The authorities pointed to low inflation as an important outcome of exchange rate stability. However, the gradual loss in competitiveness combined with the repeated hurricanes had been key factors in the decline of tourism over the last decade.6 The staff agreed, adding that high operating costs, including for labor, energy, insurance, and telecommunications, cast doubt on the long-term competitiveness of the tourism industry. 38. Restoring competitiveness and growth under the currency board requires fiscal consolidation and an acceleration of structural reform. Staff emphasized that the current fiscal stance is not supportive of the fixed peg. Fiscal retrenchment and measures to enhance external competitiveness, including economy-wide wage restraint and flexible labor markets, are critical to strengthen the currency board. The cost of doing business could also be reduced by liberalizing the telecommunications sector and by enhancing productivity, including by reducing overstaffing, and improving efficiency in public enterprises, especially the utility company, which would lower rates for telephone and electricity service. 39. The trade regime is generally free of restrictions but potential benefits are limited by the delay in implementing the final phase of the common external tariff and by tolerance of governance problems. Given concerns over potential revenue losses, the authorities argued that implementation of the common external tariff should await the introduction of the VAT, rather than only deployment of ASYCUDA as earlier intended. As a result, import tariffs remain higher than in other CARICOM countries. Staff noted that governance concerns surrounding customs administration are a significant deterrent to trade, and they urged the elimination of remaining import monopolies, F. Medium-Term Outlook 40. The medium-term outlook is Medium-Term Baseline (% GDP) extremely difficult. A baseline scenario broadly accepted by the authorities assumes that a full crisis can, as in the past, be averted by a combination of offshore financing and substantial arrears accumulation. This depends crucially on a few influential individuals whose continued willingness to finance government may depend on their substantial direct investment interests in the country. If so, public 6 During 199 l-2002, the cumulative declines in the number of stay-over visitors and Antigua and Barbuda’s share in the Caribbean stop-over tourism market were 3 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- debt would rise to almost 150 percent of GDP by 2007 (Box 1 and Table 9). The baseline incorporates measures that the government has already indicated will be taken to limit public sector wage increases and employment, and discretionary tax concessions. Growth dissipates as rising debt service ultimately restrains public employment and capital outlays, and large government financing crowds out private investment. The scenario has considerable downside risks, mainly interruptions in financing or a banking sector problem, which could precipitate a crisis at any time. The debt sustainability analysis underscores the fragility of the fiscal outlook, since most shocks would lift the debt ratio to even more unsustainable levels (Tables 11-12). 41. The staff developed an alternative scenario based on strong fiscal adjustment that would halt arrears accumulation and put the debt to GDP ratio on a declining trend. The primary balance would have to shift from a deficit of almost 5 percent of GDP in 2003 Medium-Term Adjustment (% GDP) to a surplus of at least 6 percent of GDP by 2007. I’“- - IX , Reduced fiscal deficits would enhance competitiveness, stimulating private sector development that would generate annual real GDP growth of 2-2s percent, leading to a declining public debt-to-GDP ratio by 2007 (Table 10). Stress tests show that additional fiscal effort beyond the adjustment scenario might be necessary if shocks were to push the debt-ratio to higher levels (Tables 13 and 14). IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 42. Antigua and Barbuda’s economy has proven surprisingly resilient, but an eventual crisis looks difficult to avoid without a sharp change in policy direction. Growth has remained higher than in most other ECCU countries in recent years, despite the slowdown in tourism. Fiscal relaxation, which has increasingly been used to support growth, cannot be sustained. Absent concerted efforts to correct the fiscal imbalance, prospects are likely to deteriorate as fiscal problems spill over into other segments of the economy. 43. The 2003 budget entails a significant further relaxation of the fiscal stance rather than much needed consolidation. Increases in the wage bill and capital outlays combined with tax cuts are likely to produce a substantial financing gap leading to continued accumulation of domestic and external arrears and ad hoc expenditure sequestration. If the authorities’ plans to tap alternative financing sources fall short of filling the gap, the government’s cash-strapped position could deteriorate into a forced, disorderly adjustment. 44. Placing fiscal balances on a sustainable path will require a strong upfront adjustment, as well as continued efforts over the medium term. A credible near-term adjustment is needed as a signal of the government’s determination to tackle its fiscal difficulties, with measures to contain public wages, pensions, and employment, and to cut Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- discretionary tax concessions. The adoption of a realistic, fully financed budget and steps to strengthen the budget process by reducing reliance on revenue earmarking and by enhancing expenditure management are important initial steps. 45. The fiscal adjustment needed over the medium term is large. The staff sees it as a matter of urgency for the authorities to develop a comprehensive reform strategy capable of moving the economy to a sustainable path. Key actions could include advancing preparations for introducing the VAT in a regional context, progress with plans to improve the financial performance of public enterprises, and the articulation of a pension reform strategy. 46. Even with determined implementation of fiscal and structural reform, the debt burden will remain large. Efforts to refinance and reschedule public debt through negotiations with creditors should continue as part of a strategy to lower the debt and the cost of debt service. The authorities are encouraged to continue their discussions to regularize relations with all creditors. 47. Participation in the currency board has delivered price and exchange stability, but competitiveness needs to be pursued more actively. The current fiscal stance is not supportive of the fixed peg and will increasingly infringe on private sector prospects. Fiscal adjustment and improvements in the business climate would support the productivity growth needed to maintain Antigua and Barbuda’s relatively high living standards. The authorities are urged to implement CARICOM’s common external tariff and eliminate import monopolies as soon the revenue situation permits, to position the economy to take advantage of participation in the FTAA. Privatization of airport management, port services, telecommunications, and hotels should proceed expeditiously, both to contribute to debt reduction and enhance productivity and competitiveness. 48. The government’s ability to address governance concerns will be a critical factor in enhancing the investment climate. The staff welcome the steps taken to reconcile government finances and the medical benefits scheme and urge the authorities to institute regular reporting of the medical benefits scheme’s finances in a timely, transparent manner. Staff also support the steps taken to limit discretionary tax concessions to investors and recommend elimination of the discretionary element by granting only concessions allowed by statute. Concerns about governance in customs administration remain and, at a minimum, the authorities should implement the long-delayed planned automation and reform procedures to reduce under-invoicing of imports. 49. The authorities are to be commended for improving the regulatory and supervisory framework for the onshore and offshore financial sectors. Implementation of the authorities’ plans to formalize working relationships between Antigua and Barbuda’s regulatory and enforcement agencies and the ECCB will be key for addressing potential gaps in the regulation and supervision of the onshore and offshore sectors. Further strengthening will depend on the agencies’ effective use of resources and implementation of planned improvements in the legal framework for banks, insurance companies, and trusts.

The issues to be covered by the FSAP are fundamental to the development of financial markets in the region and will provide valuable input into the design of future reforms and detection of vulnerabilities. 51. Statistical reporting is limited and impedes a satisfactory assessment of economic developments and policies. In particular, the quality, consistency, and timeliness of fiscal, external and real sector statistics need significant improvement. The authorities are encouraged to seek technical assistance through CARTAC and other donors. 52. It is recommended that Antigua and Barbuda remain on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

The main developments in 2003 are: continued real growth sustained by the expansion of government services; fiscal deterioration owing to revenue losses, mainly from tax concessions, and total spending increasing with GDP; further accumulation of domestic and external arrears is likely; and, based on the identified financing and not projecting arrears, the emergence of a significant financing gap. The central government primary deficit is estimated at 8% percent of GDP and the overall deficit at 12% percent, with a financing gap of over 10 percent and total public debt exceeding GDP. Based on the anticipated outcome for 2003, two scenarios were developed: a baseline in which current policies are maintained and an adjustment scenario. Beginning in 2004, the baseline scenario projects a continuation of current policies and sources of financing. However, growth performance would weaken as the wage bill (and public employment) would level off at 13 percent of GDP and investment decline. Tax revenue, in mm, would remain at about 19% percent of GDP, its 2003 level. The mounting and unsustainable financing gap is assumed to be covered, as in the past, by offshore funds and further accumulation of arrears. As long as these sources of financing are available, domestic demand and inflows of externally-financed investment would keep output growing albeit at declining rates. This scenario carries, however, the risk of a sudden crunch that could be prompted by the drying up of financing sources. Widespread arrears could follow with severe effects on output and the payments system. The unsustainable path of public debt is underscored by the debt sustainability analysis. Adverse exogenous shocks would push the debt ratios further up, making it increasingly unlikely for the government to meet its debt service obligations. Moreover the primary balance of the public sector is projected in the baseline scenario to continue, as in the past, deviating from the debt-stabilizing primary balance implying increasingly higher indebtedness. The adjustment scenario is based on the implementation of strong stabilization measures starting in 2004, once the new government takes office. The fiscal position would improve significantly during 2004-2007 through a combination of revenue raising and expenditure cutting actions. On the revenue side, tax exemptions would be curtailed alongside with improvements in tax administration, with the introduction of a value-added tax in 2006. This effort would bring the total revenue effort of the central government close to 26 percent of GDP by 2007, which is historically high for the country but in line with the average for the ECCU during 1998-2002. On the expenditure side, a concerted effort would reduce the wage bill, through public sector reform, and other current spending, allowing some recovery in public investment in infrastructure. By 2007 current expenditure would be around 26 percent of GDP, close to the ECCU area in 1998-2002. This considerable adjustment effort would also produce a leveling off in total public indebtedness, albeit at a high level of 116 percent of GDP, and would induce a pick up in private investment ratio to GDP, which would return to its 1998-2000 level. Output growth would stabilize at the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35 - ANNEX I 2-3 percent a year. Furthermore, while the adjustment scenario contemplates no further accumulation of arrears, it also assumes that the government would lack the resources to repay the previously built-up stock. The clearance of arrears would, therefore, require a separate rescheduling/negotiation process. The debt sustainability analysis suggests, however, that in light of the country’s vulnerability to shocks even a strong stabilization effort would not necessarily be enough to bring public debt to sustainable levels. Stress tests illustrate the negative impact of economic shocks on the debt-to-GDP Figure 1. Public Debt (XGDP) ratio (Figure 1). As expected, the worst case would be prompted by a large devaluation, which is unlikely in light of the high foreign exchange coverage in the currency union. More likely outcomes would be generated by EL&IS N ~0. ,/‘-_~._~~---~ ~- -~-- --~ setting the main macroeconomic variables at their average historical values or by an 100 . -adIrt ~~~~~-- aws - - - - i shock -?.O%nomdeor interest rate shock. In such cases the debt 90 ? ratio would reach 2007 at around L+ i2 Ei E E i 130 percent of GDP, more than 20 percentage points of GDP higher than in the case of no shocks. The results show, therefore, the additional fiscal effort that would be necessary just to bring that ratio back in line with the adjustment scenario, which already entails the elimination of fiscal deficits by 2007, from a deficit of about 9% percent of GDP in 2002/03.

Antigua and Barbuda’s statistical database is deficient in both quality and scope, preventing an accurate assessment of the flows of funds within and among sectors in the economy. There are significant problems with real, fiscal and balance of payments data. 1. Real sector National accounts compilation has been plagued by the continued absence of trade data since 1991. This has had a serious impact on the estimation of value added in some sectors, especially construction and wholesale and retail trade. For construction, alternative data sources include building applications approved annually and the government’s public sector investment projects. Wholesale and retail trade estimates are inflated based on movements in the CPI and patterns of consumer spending where there is not enough data derived from annual surveys. The consumer price index is not reported in a timely manner and has weights that are over 30 years old. An income and expenditure survey for 1998/99 has been completed with assistance from the ECCB and a revised CPI has yet to be introduced. Foreign trade data have not been compiled for over five years. Data on production have not been reported in recent times to STA. STA reports data received from bulletins produced by the ECCB. There is little coverage of labor market developments, as no official data for wages or unemployment are available. The labor ministry does produce annual estimates of employment based on information from the Social Security Board, but these are suspect. 2. Government finance Annual and quarterly data on central government finances published by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank are broadly in line with the methodology set up in the 1986 GFS Manual. However, Antigua and Barbuda has not been reporting statistical information in recent years to STA for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook and IFS publications, which needs to be rectified. 3. Monetary statistics Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag of six weeks. The data are reported to the Fund regularly. The monetary survey, however, does not include the accounts of credit unions that accept demand and other deposits. The ECCB is aware of the need to improve coverage of the monetary statistics and is taking steps to collect reliable data on credit unions.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Antigua and Barbuda On October 24, 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.’ Background Through the 1990’s, Antigua and Barbuda enjoyed relatively high growth with strong social indicators, despite chronic fiscal weaknesses. Excluding the hurricane year of 1995, growth averaged 4’/2 percent a year for the decade. But since the mid-1990s growth has been decelerating, reflecting declines in the key tourism sector and in private investment as competitiveness has eroded and the investment climate deteriorated. The global economic slowdown, coupled with the events of September 11 and subsequent security concerns, l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the October 24, 2003 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Despite a real exchange rate depreciation as the US dollar weakened against major currencies, private investment rose only modestly in 2002, reflecting growing concerns about the business climate. Public investment, in contrast, rose sharply. Preliminary indicators suggest some recovery in activity during in the first half of 2003 on account of higher government spending, stay-over visitors, and construction activity. The central government’s overall fiscal deficit widened to more than 11 percent of GDP in 2002, and the primary deficit to 6’/2 percent of GDP. The public sector deficit has been about 1% percent of GDP lower than the central government balance, reflecting the surplus of the social security scheme. The fiscal deterioration was driven by growth in spending, and occurred despite an important improvement in revenue effort. Non-interest expenditures rose by 6 percent of GDP from 2000 to 2002, split equally between capital outlays and other goods and services. While the wage bill did not rise significantly, part of the higher cost of other goods and services reflected pay for temporary employees. Preliminary data indicate that the central government’s wage bill grew by over 8 percent in the first half of 2003 relative to the same period in 2002. The public sector deficit has been mainly financed from external sources and accumulation of debt service arrears. Public sector debt amounted to 114 percent of GDP at end-2002, with external and domestic arrears estimated at 33 percent of GDP. The expansion of monetary aggregates accelerated in 2002. In the context of a build-up of imputed reserves, broad money rose by 6’% percent and private sector credit by 43/4 percent. With continuing excess liquidity, banks further accumulated net foreign assets in 2002. Deposit rates were lowered when the ECCB cut the floor interest rate on savings deposits by 1 percentage point to 3 percent in July 2002. Banks’ average prime rate fell by only 1/2 percent, which bankers attributed to increased lending risks in an uncertain fiscal environment.

Commercial banks continued to face excess liquidity and increased their net foreign assets. Antigua and Barbuda’s external current account deficit rose from 7 percent of GDP in 2001 to 11 percent in 2002. Tourism receipts fell, despite a modest recovery in stay-over visitors, due to discounting of tourism services and a decline in cruise ship arrivals. Imports remain below historical levels in terms of GDP, though construction-related imports linked to investment projects and hotel refurbishment picked up. About half of the current account deficit was financed by direct investment, the remainder through arrears and other short-term flows. Net imputed international reserves at the ECCB rose to more than three months of imports at end- 2002. However, external arrears grew by more than 4 percent of GDP during the year, with the stock amounting to more than 19 percent of GDP at end-2002. Supervision of the offshore sector has been strengthened. The regulatory framework was enhanced by amendments to the International Business Corporations Act and the Money Laundering Prevention Act, as well as anti-terrorist financing legislation. The Office of the National Drug and Money Laundering Control Policy (ONDCP) has been admitted to the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units. Enforcement has also improved, particularly of the rule that all offshore banks have a physical presence in Antigua and Barbuda-which resulted in a decline in licensed institutions from 22 in 2002 to 15 in 2003. Executive Board Assessment Public lnformafion Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
