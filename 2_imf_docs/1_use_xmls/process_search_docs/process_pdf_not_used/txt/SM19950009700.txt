Deppler and Jan van Houten May 3, 1995 I. Introduction A staff team visited Vienna from March 3 to 14, 1995, to conduct the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions. Meetings were held with the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Austrian National Bank, other officials of the Bank and various government agencies and representatives of the banking sector, the research institutes and the Chamber of Labor. l-/ Hr. Prader, Alternate Executive Director, participated in the discussions. The previous consultation was concluded at the Executive Board on April 29, 1994 (EBM/94/38). At that time, Directors called for a swift resumption of fiscal consolidation efforts in view of the improving economy, and broadly supported the authorities' hard currency policy, which was .seen as a source of stability for external transactions and of discipline for wage behavior and the public finances. Directors also observed that further structural reforms were needed in order to reverse the upward trend in unemployment, raise productivity, and help meet the challenges posed by prospective EU membership. On January 1, 1995, Austria formally joined the European Union (ELI) and the European Monetary System (ENS), and a week later the schilling entered the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the EHS. &/ For the past eight years, Austria has been governed by a coalition of the social democrats (SPB) and the more conservative People's Party (66'6'). After parliamentary elections held on October 9, 1994, the coalition remained in power but with a significantly reduced majority. Subsequently, Austria's system of social partnership has come under some strain, as proposals to cut certain benefits in the context of the government's renewed efforts to tackle fiscal imbalances have met with stiff opposition. l-/ The staff team consisted of Hessrs. Vittas, Huybrechts, Putscher (all ElJl), Ms. Westin (TRE), and Mrs. White (SEC). 2/ In the membership referendum, held on June 12, 1994, the turnout was very high (over 81 percent), with a two thirds majority voting in favor.

Backeround The Austrian economy experienced a robust upturn in 1994 following a relatively mild recession in 1993. The upturn, which was significantly stronger than anticipated a year ago, was supported by vigorous growth in both foreign and domestic demand. Exports benefited fro&the cyclical rebound of demand in major western European markets, while business investment was buoyed by rising capacity utilization rates in most branches of industry and a scheduled reduction in investment tax allowances on April 1, which brought forward the implementation of many projects. Private consumption also strengthened during the year, as confidence improved and fiscal policy remained expansionary. All in all, domestic demand grew by close to 4 percent in 1994. Although the net foreign balance weakened, as imports surged in response to the revival in demand, the growth of real GDP at about 2 3/4 percent was higher than potential (estimated at between 2 l/4 percent and 2 l/2 percent). Despite some tightening of labor market conditions, the growth in wage earnings continued to decelerate in 1994. The deceleration reflected mainly the effects of a stabilization pact (concluded in the fall of 1993 between the federal and local authorities and the social partners) which provided for moderate wage settlements in return for a general income tax cut and restraint in adjusting administered prices. Meanwhile, productivity growth picked up, in line with the typical cyclical pattern, helping to dampen the rise in unit labor costs. In view of this development and the near stability of import prices, the deceleration in the rate of consumer price inflation (from 3.6 percent in 1993 to 3 percent in 1994) remained disappointingly slow. This was due to some extent to persistently high increases in rents and the inability of public authorities to fully meet their commitment to avoid increases in fees and charges. At the same time, profit margins in the services sector appear to have increased, while profitability in manufacturing, which had held up well during the recession, rose to its highest level since the early 1970s (Chart 1). Monetary policy in 1994 continued to be guided by the maintenance of a close link of the Austrian schilling to the deutsche mark. With the credibility of this policy well established and Austria benefiting from capital inflows, the authorities were able to allow monetary conditions to ease further in the course of 1994. Indeed, short-term interest rates remained slightly below those in Germany throughout the year. On the other hand, long-term interest rates rose significantly, in line with global trends. However,. their rise in Austria was among the lowest and the bond yield differential relative to Germany was only marginally positive (Chart 2). The nominal effective exchange rate of the schilling was broadly stable in 1994, following several years of a clearly upward trend, but the real effective exchange rate, as measured by relative unit labor costs in manufacturing, depreciated modestly and was close to its average level in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Chart 3).

Nevertheless, the external current account deficit widened in 1994 to about 1 percent of GDP, reflecting the strong cyclical rebound in imports and a sizable decline in net earnings from tourism. Although net capital inflows were substantially lower than in 1993, they were sufficient to finance the current account deficit and maintain the import cover ratio of official reserves at a satisfactory level. For the second year in a row, the underlying position of the public finances deteriorated in 1994 and much of the consolidation that had been achieved in the preceding few years was reversed (Chart 4). To be sure, the general government deficit (at 4 percent of GDP) was not out of line with budget projections but this was by no means a satisfactory outcome, considering that economic growth exceeded original expectations by a significant margin. Indeed, the structural deficit, which had increased by nearly 1 percent of GDP in 1993, rose further to approach 3 percent of GDP in 1994 (Table 1). The increase reflected mainly higher than expected expenditures on some new entitlement programs (introduced in 1992-93) benefiting the elderly and the disabled and shortfalls on receipts from corporation tax and tax on interest income. In addition, the general tax cut which was introduced at the beginning of 1994 appears to have had a somewhat larger negative effect on revenue performance than anticipated. 1/ In the two years to 1994, the gross public debt, as a ratio to GDP, increased by 5 percentage points to reach 63 percent.

Although the growth of domestic demand may slow somewhat in response to the increase in long-term interest rates in 1994 and recently introduced fiscal consolidation measures, real GDP is expected to increase by close to 3 percent in 1995 and about 2 l/2 percent in 1996, with unemployment remaining on a mild downward trend. Despite a modest pick up in wage settlements in the 1994-95 wage round, the rate of inflation is projected to slow further, as EU membership implies a significant lowering of food prices. However, recent and prospective increases in indirect taxes make it unlikely that the annual rise in the CPI will fall below 2 l/2 per- cent. The external current account deficit is projected to increase further, as the impact of net transfers to the EU and a continued decline in net earnings from tourism will more than offset a modest improvement in the trade balance. The risks to the outlook are evenly balanced. In addition to weakening Austria's competitiveness, recent exchange rate developments could slow economic growth in the most important trade partner countries, especially in 1996, with adverse implications for the pace of the recovery and the balance of payments. On the other hand, the effects of output growth on employment may turn out to be larger than assumed in the projections, and the price effects from EU membership more favorable than expected, boosting real disposable incomes and consumer spending. Medium-term prospects will depend mainly on the evolution of demand in the main trading partners and progress in redressing fiscal imbalances. On the assumption that the authorities will make substantial progress towards fiscal consolidation (see section III below) and that the European economic recovery will continue, the staff forecasts that GDP growth will remain somewhat above potential with the output gap (currently about 1 percent) being eliminated by 1998. In this scenario, unemployment would fall modestly, the current account deficit would narrow, and the rate of inflation would decline to about 2 percent. &' Failure to pursue fiscal consolidation would be reflected in a further substantial buildup of the public debt and a weaker external current account position. This could undermine private sector confidence and, possibly, lead to a widening of risk premia on interest rates, with adverse effects on growth potential. III. m Poli The authorities noted that over the past few years Austrian economic policy had been oriented mainly towards medium-term goals, with the overriding objective of coping with the challenges posed by the profound changes in western as well as eastern Europe. A broad array of structural reform measures had been introduced in order to strengthen the ability of the Austrian economy to compete internationally: the regulatory framework had been adapted to EU standards; hitherto sheltered sectors had been lJ Appendix III outlines the staff's medium-term macroeconomic scenarios.

With the implementation of the EEA agreement in 1994 and Austria's accession to the EU in 1995, these major policy efforts had been brought to a successful conclusion. However, fiscal developments had slipped from the consolidation path, contributing to some weakening of the external current account position. Accordingly, the main policy priority for the new legislative period, which runs through the end of 1998, was to restore fiscal equilibrium, mainly by expenditure restraint. This was seen as essential to allow Austria to meet the Maastricht criteria for timely entry into EMU, strengthen the external accounts and restore room for maneuver. At the same time, the authorities intended to proceed with structural reform, mainly in areas where progress has so far been slow (e.g., agriculture) or where further progress is crucial for fiscal consolidation or future growth (e.g., privatization of public assets). 1. Fiscal uolicy The authorities shared the mission's concern about the worsening of the public finances in 1993-94 which they recognized could only partially be attributed to the effects of the 1992-93 recession. Their concern was heightened by the prospect that the fiscal situation would worsen further in 1995 and beyond, largely because of the direct and indirect budgetary costs of EU membership. Including a one-off loss of tax revenue of about l/2 per- cent of GDP resulting from a need to harmonize VAT collection lags to those of the EU, these costs were now estimated to exceed 2 percent of GDP in 1995. lJ However, they would fall to about 1 percent of GDP by 1998 as tax collections return to normal and compensatory payments to farmers and the food industry are phased out. Additional pressures on the budget were expected to emanate from continued high growth in entitlement programs, the full-year effects of recent (revenue-reducing) tax reforms and changes in the compensation system for civil servants intended to increase productivity and reward performance. All in all, it was estimated that on unchanged policies the general government deficit would rise to about 5 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 and decline only modestly thereafter. Soon after taking office, the new government proposed a package of measures intended to contain the deterioration in the federal finances in 1995 and to allow Austria to meet the Maastricht fiscal criteria by 1998. Initially, the package consisted only of spending cuts and privatization lJ These costs turned out to be significantly higher than previously expected, as Austria did not succeed in its efforts to obtain a transitional period for adjusting its agricultural support policies to those of the EU. Instead, an agreement was reached which provides for compensatory payments to farmers and the food industry to ease their adjustment to the EU regime. The total costs of membership in 1995 include net transfers to the EU of about 1 percent of GDP and compensatory payments to domestic agents equivalent to about half a percent of GDP.

However, in the face of strong opposition from various interest soup=, the package was subsequently modified significantly. In particular, the expenditure savings targeted for 1995 were substantially scaled down, reliance on privatization proceeds was increased, and measures were introduced to raise revenue from the mineral oil tax and civil servants' pension contributions. u Notwithstanding the impact of the austerity package, which is estimated to cut the deficit by 1 percent of GDP, the general government financial deficit is officially projected to rise to 4.5 percent of GDP in 1995. The mission welcomed the government's resolve to introduce much needed, if unpopular, adjustment measures and its intention to restore a sound fiscal position over the medium term. It noted, however, that the fiscal consolidation effort embodied in the 1995 budget would do little more than offset built-in expansionary impulses in government programs and transfer payments to sectors adversely affected in the short-run by EU membership. Thus, most of the adjustment remained to be addressed in subsequent years. The staff also expressed some misgivings about the reliance on tax measures, noting that they might jeopardize prospects for lowering inflation further and the government's stated goal not to raise the overall tax burden. Moreover, the emphasis on asset sales increased uncertainty as to the feasibility of the 1995 fiscal targets, given that significant slippage had consistently been experienced in the past in meeting privatization objectives. The authorities observed that in assessing the significance of the adjustment effort in 1995 it was important to keep in mind (a) that membership had entailed a very large budgetary shock, part of which would be transitory, and (b) that the full-year effects of the measures taken were considerably higher than the initial (1995) effects. Moreover, EU membership implied substantial redistributional effects, which it was appropriate for public policy to try to iron out and spread over a period of years. They added that, while in the prevailing socio-political climate it had not proved possible to avoid increases in taxes, the government's intention remained to focus on expenditure restraint in the future. Finally, officials emphasized that proceeds from asset sales had been conservatively estimated in the budget and the risk of slippage was very small, especially because preparations for the sale of the government's equity in two large commercial banks, which accounted for the bulk of the 1995 asset sales program, were already at an advanced stage. 1/ The expenditure savings now account for about half of the package and include small cuts in the public sector wage bill, pension reforms, reductions in family allowances and other social security benefits, and improvements in administrative efficiency. In addition, privatization proceeds (which do not reduce the general government deficit) are expected to amount to S 13 billion (about l/2 percent of GDP).

The broad intention is to lower the federal deficit (on an administrative basis) to about 3 percent of GDP by 1998. On the assumption that the lower levels of government as a whole would continue to run a small surplus, this would permit the general government deficit to fall below the Maastricht Treaty criterion by 1997. The mission questioned whether mere compliance with the Maastricht deficit criterion, at a time when economic activity was projected to be at a cyclical peak, was a sufficiently ambitious objective. For one thing, it would only allow the debt ratio to stabilise at about 65 percent of GDP, well above the relevant Maastricht criterion. Moreover, it did not seem prudent to assume that the lower levels of government would continue to run a surplus. The staff suggested that a more substantial reduction in the federal deficit was needed in order to reverse the debt dynamics, restore policy flexibility and enable Austria to meet additional demands on the budget from the aging of the population. Such a reduction might also be needed to maintain a satisfactory external current account position in the future. The staff noted in this context that historically, the private sector in Austria has had a high savings propensity, sufficient to finance private investment and a small general government deficit, averaging less than 2 l/2 percent of GDP per y===, thus leaving the external current account roughly in equilibrium (Chart 5). In the future, the propensity to save in the private sector may well show a tendency to fall, as closer integration of the Austrian economy with both its western and eastern neighbors could put downward pressure on business profits, especially in hitherto sheltered sectors, while the ageing of the population could lower household savings. If such a decline in savings is to be accommodated without a decline in private investment or a sustained deterioration in the external accounts, the general government financial deficit would probably have to be lowered well below its historical norm. u In light of the difficulty that had been experienced in obtaining consensus on the modest consolidation aims of the 1995 budget, the authorities were not convinced that it would be wise for the government to set more ambitious targets than those it had so far contemplated. At any rate, they were confident that the lower levels of government would also contribute to the fiscal consolidation task. Officials noted, furthermore, that there was substantial room for asset sales in the future, not least by the local authorities which owned a substantial portfolio of claims on the household sector. Such sales would facilitate the attainment of the Maastricht debt criterion. Some officials doubted whether there was reason to expect the private sector savings ratio to fall, noting that studies had I/ Other things being equal, the investment ratio in the private sector might show a tendency to rise in response to EU membership, which would also increase the need for a reduction in the public sector deficit.

Other officials, however, had sympathy for the mission's views, the more so because there were signs that the new generations are less thrifty than the older ones. The authorities agreed with the mission that it "as desirable for fiscal consolidation to be achieved mainly through expenditure restraint and stressed in this respect that reforms in entitlement programs would bl$ essential. They recognized that for the time being it "as political1.y difficult to implement substantial reforms because the illusion had been created that EU membership would only entail benefits (except for the agricultural sector); public opinion "as therefore ill prepared to accept the need for sacrifices. HOWeVer, they remained optimistic that consens-1s for the requisite changes in public expenditure policies would gradually build up. As for taxation policy, officials did not foresee that there would be room for tax cuts in the near future. Efforts to improve the tax system would continue to receive attention and in this context proposals to extend the recent increase in the tax on mineral oil to other energy products and to bring to the income tax net incomes that are at present exempt (for example, Christmas and holiday bonuses) were under consideration. 2. Monetarv and exchaxe rate uolicv and the balance of uavments The authorities noted that monetary policy continued to be oriented toward maintaining the close peg of the schilling to the deutsche mark, mainly through appropriate adjustments in domestic interest rates. Monetary conditions remained relatively easy in 1993-94 as bank liquidity "as boosted by net inflows of foreign capital. These reflected mainly the (new-found) interest of fund managers abroad to include in their portfolios modest amounts of schilling-denominated securities. It had been expected that the inflows of portfolio capital would taper off as this stock adjustment process came gradually to an end and this indeed appears to have happened in the course of 1994. With corporate profitability at a high level, the demand for credit "as subdued and the banks took advantage of ample liquidity to build foreign assets and/or to reduce their indebtedness to the Austrian National Bank. Thus, utilization of the Bank's refinancing facilities fell sharply and the growth of M3 (at about 5 l/2 percent in 1994) remained quite moderate. 1/ JJ Although the Austrian National Bank does not set any monetary targets, i.~ r.-gularly analyzes developments in the monetary aggregates as they may pYvvide insight into the effect of its policy measures and may enhance understanding of the transmission mechanism. Recently, efforts to improve :hc quality and analysis of monetary data have been stepped up in view of .x!lst:-ia's accession to the EU and the preparatory work that is currently caking place in EMS countries to facilitate (in due course) the design of a ;::un~t.ar;; policy strategy at the European level. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - The authorities added that the participation of the schilling in the ERM did not imply any change in the design and conduct of Austrian monetary policy. While the widening of the ERM bands (prior to Austria's entry into the system) was seen as a wise decision as it had helped restore calm in the foreign exchange markets and had made the law of two-way risk apply again, the authorities (and the staff for that matter) did not consider that Austria would have any advantage to gain from making use of the wider fluctuation margins. The authorities were concerned by the renewed turmoil in currency markets in early 1995 and the large exchange rate changes associated with it, not least because these developments had the potential to jeopardize the sustainability of the European economic recovery and exacerbated the adjustmwt pressures confronting some sectors of the Austrian economy, including notably the tourism industry. At the same time, however. the authfirities were pleased to note that the turmoil had had virtually no efiect on the exchange rate of the schilling vis-A-vis the deutsche mark and unly a minor impact on interest rate differentia1.s reIative to Germany. This they interpreted as a further demonstration of the high credibility of Austria's hard currency policy which had tended to give the schilling the status of a safe haven currency and had led to the virtual elimination of risk premia on domestic interest rates (Chart 6). While concurring with this assessment, the mission stressed the importance of adequate action to redress fiscal imbalances if investors' confidence in the viability of the hard currency policy was to be maintained. 3. The Since the early 198Os, the external current account has been remarkably close to equilibrfum, with the balance fluctuating narrowly between a surplus of less than 1 percent of GDP to a deficit of a similar magnitude (Chart 6). This broad equilibrium comprised a large trade deficit (averaging more than 5 percent of GDP) and a small deficit on investment income, which were offset by a large surplus on the travel account (about 3.5 percent of GDP per year) and small surpluses on transit trade and other services. From a savings-investment perspective, the balanced external current account was the result of modest excess savings in the private sector which were offset by roughly equivalent general government deficits. The authorities observed that the weakening of the current account in 1994, which represented a continuation of a mild trend that had begun in 1992, was to a considerable extent the result of cyclical factors (Table 2). In particular, the large gap in the growth of private disposable income between Austria and Germany had a significant adverse effect on both the trade and (especially) the travel account.

The authorities were confident that the current account would strengthen again as progress was made in reducing fiscal imbalances and pointed out that the structural decline of the tourism sector could hardly be tackled by monetary policy measures. Rather, this issue called for a sectoral policy designed to upgrade the quality of services provided to tourists and to focus more on the (price-insensitive) top end of the market. Efforts to develop and implement such a policy were under way. Austria's overall competitive position has been broadly stable over the past few years and appears quite strong from a longer-term perspective .as for much of the 1980s and early 1990s a comparatively good productivity performance, coupled with a moderate growth in wage earnings, more than compensated for the nominal effective appreciation of the schilling. The authorities nevertheless agreed with the staff that the competitive position of the tradable goods sector would need to improve further in the period ahead to help offset the declining surplus on the travel account, finance the transfer payments to the ELI, and eventually enable Austria to become a net capital exporting country (as is appropriate given its stage of economic development and the fact that it is well placed to take advantage of the investment opportunities emanating from the opening of eastern Europe). 4. Other issues By comparison with most other industrial countries, Austria's labor market has performed rather well. In particular, the unemployment rate, at about 4 percent, has remained relatively low, even though, as elsewhere, it has shown a tendency to increase over time. This satisfactory performance is related in part to Austria's centralized wage bargaining system, which has contributed to a high degree of real wage flexibility enabling the economy to adjust fairly smoothly to shocks. u Low unemployment, however, has coincided with a relatively low and declining labor force participation rate among older workers. The authorities readily accepted that this was mainly due to a wide array of early retirement schemes, including easy access to disability pensions, which have reduced the effective (average) retirement age to 58 for males and 57 for females. Officials noted that the 1995 fiscal package included measures to raise the retirement age of civil servants by 1 year and to tighten eligibility rules for disability. Nevertheless, they accepted that further, more radical changes in pension arrangements would be necessary in u Remarkably, the high flexibility of the average real wage does not appear to have been associated with an excessive compression of wage relativities (Chart 7). However, for many years wage increases tended to be uniform across sectors, despite significant differences in relative productivity performance. This may have contributed to the emergence of disequilibria in some sectors, including for example the tourism industry.

The authorities observed that, with the economic recovery firmly established, the financial performance of the nationalized industries improved in 1994 and the industrial holding company (bIAG, which is a" off- budget agency) made some progress with its privatization program. Meanwhile, the restructuring and reorganization efforts in other 6IAG companies were continuing and it was expected that by 1996 all but a few of them would be sold to the private sector, with bIAG retaining only a minority stake. Proceeds from asset sales, which are used to retire dIAG debt, amounted to S 11.5 billion in 1994 and were expected to rise to S 15 billion in 1995. The authorities said that EU membership had engendered significant adjustments of economic policy in several key areas. EU competition rules had been implemented, including legislation covering cartels, merger controls, abuse of dominant positions, and state aids. The monopoly for salt had been abolished recently, and there were plans for the elimination of remaining state monopolies, e.g., concerning the distribution of alcoholic beverages (by early 1996) and tobacco (by 1998). Liberalization was also underway in telecommunications and the financial services sector, and private radio broadcasting would begin in September 1995. It was expected that over a period of several years, EU membership would raise real GDP by more than 2 percent and lower prices significantly. By comparison, the additional benefits from trade liberalization associated with the Uruguay Round would be small. Austria's exports to the central and eastern europea" countries (CEECs) increased sharply again in 1994 and their share in total exports rose to 13 l/2 percent, compared with less than 10 percent in the late 1980s. Imports from the CEECs expanded even more sharply though, and Austria's trade surplus vis-8-vis these countries declined modestly, for the first time since the beginning of the transition process. The authorities noted that during 1994 the last quantitative restrictions on imports from CEECs (concerning cement and fertilizer) were terminated and calls for protection had declined. They added that Austria supported EU enlargement to include the CEECs eve" though it was clear that further revisions of the common agricultural policy of the ELI would be needed to make this goal possible. Official development assistance is estimated to have remained somewhat below 0.3 percent of GDP in 1994. However, the authorities expected that accession to the European Union will lead to a substantial increase in the "ear future, both directly through contributions to the European Development Fund, and indirectly through contributions to the General Budget and participation in the European Investment Bank.

Staff Auuraisal The Austrian economy is in reasonably good shape: output has recovered strongly from the brief--and by international standards remarkably shallow-- recession of 1992-93; business investment has strengthened; unemployment has remained comparatively low; and inflation has continued to edge down, ev?n if only sluggishly. With the upturn in many European trading partner countries still in full swing, and confidence at a high level following Austria's smooth accession to the EU, it is plausible to expect roL:kst noninflationary growth to continue, at least in the near term. The weakening of the external current account position, which is only partlyi due to unfavorable cyclical conditions, is a matter that needs some attention, however. A related and much greater concern is the substantial deterioration in the public finances over the past two years. Admittedly, this reflected to some extent the effect of tax measures which contributed in 1994 to wage restraint and the cyclical recovery in output and will continue to have beneficial effects on incentives over the medium term. However, a strong upward trend in social spending has also been a powerful influence. Moreover, the fiscal position is set to deteriorate further in the short term as a result of net budgetary transfers to the EU, the measures taken to support adjustment to EU membership and the continued upward momentum of social spending. Given this background, a key priority for the next few years must be the restoration of a sustainable fiscal position. The federal budget for 1995 may be viewed as a first step in this direction. The consolidation effort embodied in the budget appears modest, however: it does little more than offset the expansionary effect on domestic spending of earlier fiscal policy decisions and would not prevent a further increase in the structural deficit in 1995. In addition, the substantial shift in the composition of the 1995 fiscal package, from the original intention to rely purely on spending cuts to a package that contains a sizable contribution from revenue raising measures, is worrisome. It may retard progress in lowering inflation and, be&use of the emphasis on asset sales, it increases the risk of slippage in the implementation of the federal budget. It is therefore important to have contingency plans at hand to compensate for any deviations from budgetary plans in the course of the year. including in particular, any shortfalls in asset sales. In any case, the 1995 budget needs to be followed by more substantial adjustment efforts in 1996 and over the medium term. In this connection, the achievement of the Maastricht deficit criterion at the peak of the business cycle, as is broadly intended at present, would not seem to be a sufficiently ambitious objective. Even if fully attained, it would allow little progress to be made toward reversing the recent (and continuing) large accumulation of public debt and would leave the public finances vulnerable to adverse economic shocks. In the staff's view, a significant reduction in the debt ratio (and the associated debt interest payments) should be targeted in order to restore some scope for discretionary budgetary management and create room for meeting new demands on the budget stemming from the ageing of the population. Furthermore, a greater fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - adjustment effort than is at present contemplated may well be needed to safeguard the external position as it is likely that the hitherto high propensity to save in the private sector would tend to decline in the future for demographic and other reasons. Austria's relatively high tax ratio, and the increasing competitive pressures that it is facing as European integration proceeds, dictate that this adjustment effort should focus on expenditure restraint. In particular, a streamlining and better targeting of entitlement programs would seem to be in order. In contrast to the difficult challenges that the authorities have been facing on the fiscal front, monetary policy has enjoyed smooth sailing. This is all the more remarkable given the recurrent bouts of instability in international financial markets and attests to the high degree of credibility which Austria's hard currency policy has earned at home and abroad. Preservation of this credibility--and of the important benefits that it confers in terms of a stable framework for wage negotiations and business decisions, comparatively low real rates of interest, and low spreads on bond yields relative to Germany--will hinge in the medium term on restoring a sustainable fiscal position. It will also require continuation of Austria's tradition of securing needed adjustments in the external competitive position through nominal wage restraint and productivity enhancements. In this respect, the present level of competitiveness appears satisfactory from a historical perspective. Nevertheless, some modest further improvement is likely to prove necessary over the medium term to compensate for the shrinking structural surplus on the travel account and transfers to the EU as well as to allow Austria to become, in time, a net capital exporting country. In recent years, preparations for the implementation of the ERA agreement end EU membership, and the challenges posed by the opening of eastern Europe, have provided a significant impetus to structural reform. As a result, much progress has already been made in deregulating the economy and exposing hitherto protected sectors to increased competitive pressures. With the completion of the Uruguay Round and ongoing economic integration with neighboring countries, this process is bound to continue for many years to come, contributing both to higher growth in output and employment and a decline in inflation. Nevertheless, it is possible and desirable to augment such benefits by easing restrictive practices and entry barriers in sectors where direct advantages from trade integration are small. In a similar vein, there is a strong case for reducing incentives for early retirement as well as for sustaining the progress made recently in privatizing state-owned enterprises, including the state's equity holdings in the banking sector. Increased labor force participation may well become necessary to ensure the viability of pension schemes and, indirectly, of the public finances. As for asset sales, these are desirable primarily because they are likely to promote increased efficiency in the economy, although they too can facilitate fiscal adjustment and compliance with the debt convergence criterion of the Maastricht Treaty. By virtue of its geographic location and historical relationships, Austria is well positioned to continue to take advantage of the significant Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - trade and investment opportunities offered by the opening up of eastern Europe. In this regard, maintenance of a liberal trade regime is in Austria's interest, while also facilitating the reform efforts of the transition countries. The authorities' decision to remove quantitative restrictions on imports from eastern European countries is therefore welcome, as is their intention to continue to resist protectionist pressures and to work toward the fuller integration of these countries with the European Union. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the, standard 12-month cycle.

The primary objective is to illustrate the implications for the public debt and the external current account balance of alternative fiscal policy stances. The "environmental" assumptions are in line with the results of the latest WE0 exercise. Specifically, the growth in Austria's export markets (as measured by the weighted average rate of increase in the volume of imports in Austria's main trading partner countries) is assumed to average 5 l/2 percent per year over 1995-98. while long-term interest rates are assumed to fall slightly (by comparison with their level in 1994), in line with projected developments in Germany. Additionally, it is postulated that the private saving ratio will decline somewhat over the scenario period, while the private investment ratio will edge up. u Potential output growth is projected to accelerate somewhat, in response to EU membership, from 2 l/4 percent per year in the recent past to close to 2 l/2 percent by 1998. In the main scenario, the budgetary projections incorporate the effects of the 1995 consolidation package (which are estimated to rise from 1 per- cent of GDP in 1995 to 1 l/2 percent of GDP thereafter). In line with the EU membership treaty, they also allow for the gradual phasing out of compensatory payments to farmers and the food industry. Part of the beneficial affects of these developments on the general government deficit, however, is offset by the (full-year) costs of the 1994 tax reform, the underlying high rate of growth of (non-interest) public spending, and a slight increase in debt interest payments. On balance, the structural budget deficit in this scenario declines by only l/2 percent of GDP between 1995 and 1998. The results of the above assumptions and projections are summarized in the top half of Table 111-l. The rate of growth of real GDP decelerates somewhat during 1996-98, on account of a slower growth in domestic demand. Nevertheless, it remains above potential. Thus, by 1998 the output gap is virtually eliminated and the unemployment rate falls to below 4 percent. The rate of inflation also continues to decelerate, partly on account of the increased competitive pressures associated with EU membership, and by 1998 it approaches that in Germany (2 percent). However, despite the decline in the budget deficit, the (gross) public debt ratio rises to a level well above the 60 percent reference value in the Maastricht Treaty and stabilizes only toward the end of the decade. While the current account deficit declines somewhat relative to 1994-95, it remains on the high side by comparison with Austria's recent historical experience. u The principal reasons for these assumptions are outlined in section III.1 of this report. In addition, it is worth noting that the household savings rate is likely to fall from its unusually high level in 1994 as consumer spending adjusts more fully to the increase in disposable income resulting from that year's tax reductions.

Specifically, it is assumed that expenditure cuts, equivalent to l/2 percent of GDP, will be introduced in each of these years. These would allow general government borrowing to fall to about 2 percent of GDP by 1998 and, while they would not quite suffice to lower the debt ratio to the Maastricht reference value. they would probably ensure that this ratio would be on a clear downward trend before the beginning of the final stage of EMU. Moreover, the postulated fiscal adjustment would contribute to a substantial strengthening of the external position. The final scenario is intended to illustrate the risks of failure to sustain the consolidation efforts initiated in 1995, although it may also be interpreted as indicating the vulnerability of the fiscal position to an unexpected worsening of the external environment (and hence of output). In this scenario, the general government deficit remains above the level required to stabilize the debt ratio and the external position shows no improvement between 1995 and 1998. If such a scenario were to materialize, it could undermine confidence and lead to a widening of interest rate differentials relative to Germany.
