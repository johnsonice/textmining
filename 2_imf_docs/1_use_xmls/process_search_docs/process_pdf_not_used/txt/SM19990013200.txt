The economy has performed relatively well in recent years due in large part to pragmatic macroeconomic management and broader private sector participation. However, recent developments in the world oil market are a reminder of Oman’s external vulnerability and of the heightened challenges for policy. The fall in oil prices produced a loss of export earnings in 1998 of US$2 billion (14 percent of GDP) and the fiscal and external accounts have shifted into deficit. And despite the recent strengtpening of oil prices and fiscal and monetary tightening, the outlook is for continuing imbalances over the medium term implying a depletion of official foreign assets or recourse to additional foreign borrowing. This underlines the need for prompt and comprehensive adjustment measures. The authorities accept the need for further adjustment measures as a basis for achieving the government’s medium-term objectives viz: to maintain macroeconomic stability and build up the Reserve Fund for future generations; further diversify the economy through strengthened private sector participation; and expand employment opportunities for nationals. To these ends, the government is reviewing policy options and the balance to strike between adjustment and external borrowing. The thrust of policy reform is expected to comprise fiscal restructuring (primarily on the expenditure side) and strengthened monetary poticy in combinatian with measures to enhance the role of the private sector and attract Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4. I. INTRODUCTION 1. The consultation discussions were held in Muscat during the period April 17-30, 1999. The Omani representatives included the Ministers of Finance; Oil; Industry; Health, and top officials of the central bank and other government entities. The mission also met with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers’ Association. The staff team comprised Messrs. Handy (head), Duran, Hamam, Jahjah, and Thiam (all MED). 2. ln concluding the last consultation (EBlW98/62; June 10, 1998) Executive Directors commended the authorities for achieving strong economic growth and price stability. For the medium term, they underscored the need for further strengthening the fiscal position while pursuing financial sector reform and diversification. 3. Oman accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 19,1974.i II. BACKGROUND AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 4. Helped by pragmatic macroeconomic management and broader private sector participation, the economy of Oman has performed relatively well in recent years. In a climate of price stability, real GDP growth averaged 5% percent annually over the past decade with much of the impetus coming from the non-oil sectors (Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Nonetheless, the economy remains heavily dependent on oil production and exports, with the oil sector accounting for about a third of GDP, some 90 percent of export earnings, and two thirds of budget revenue. 5. Oman-a nonmember of OPEC-bas increased its oil production capacity in recent years to its current level of about one million barrels per day. Proven reserves have edged upward over the past decade and are currently estimated at about five billion barrels, allowing for a production horizon of some 16 years. Efforts are being made to enlarge reserves and recovery through continued exploration and the application of new technologies, as well as to bring down production costs (currently about US$3.7O/bbl).* 6. As part of its drive toward diversification, Oman is about to begin exploiting its substantial gas potential, with a major LNG (liquefied natural gas) project scheduled to ’ Further information on relations with the Fund can be found in Appendix I and on relations with the Bank in Appendix II. 2 This compares to an average of about US$2ibbl for the GCC Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- Box 1. The LNG Project The project will draw upon local resources of gas feedstock for the manufacture of 6.6 million tons per year (mty) of liquefied natural gas (LNG). It is expected to become fully operational in May 2000, and has a lifespan of 25 years. Upstream operations include the drilling and preparation of the gas wells, gathering and processing facilities, and a 360~kilometer pipeline to the liquefaction plant near SW. The government retains full ownership of this phase of the project which will be operated by Petroleum Development Oman. The investment is being financed by Shell, Total, and Pattex, and the loans (about US%l.3 billion) will be serviced through 2006 using export revenue from condensates produced in association with the natma\ gas. Downstream investments of US$l.8 billion are being undertaken by Oman LNG, with equity conhibutcd by the Government of Oman (51 percent) and shell, Total, Korean and Japanese corporations (49 percent). Financing comprises an equity contribution of LEO500 million by the partners; syndicated loans of up to US$I .70 billion; and a sovereign bond issue of US$SOO million. Long-term contmcts for LNG deliveries beginning in 2000 have been signed with Korea Gas (4.1 mty), Osaka Gas (0.7 mty), and Dabhol Power of India (1.6 mty).

Lang-term contracts have been concluded with companies in Korea, Japan, and India, for the export of 6% million tons of LNG per year. Moreover, the prospect exists of surplus gas resources (i.e., those not utilized for the LNG project) being piped to coastal areas to feed a number of potential gas-based industries-petrochemicals, fertilizer, steel, aluminum, etc,. Feasibility studies for these projects are ongoing. -7. The exceptional weakness of the world oil market over much of the past 12-18 months has imposed a heavy burden on Oman. In 1998, the export price of Omani oil averaged just under US$12 per barrel-a drop of US%7 per barrel or almost 40 percent compared to 1997-entailing a decline in budgetary revenue of about 10 percentage points of GDP and a loss of US$2 billion in export earnings (Tables 2 and 3). The drop in oil revenues largely accounted for the escalation of the external current account deficit (to 21 percent of GDP) and the shift in the overall external position to a deficit of US.SO.8 billion (from a surplus of almost US$l billion in the preceding year). 8. The increased pressures on the external position and the related deterioration in the fiscal position prompted the authorities to implement a number of fiscal measures in March 1998. These included: a range of revenue measures (increases in customs duties on cigarettes, in the airport tax, and in the income tax on foreign workers, as well as an increase in fees for certain public services and transfers of profits from public entities); and expenditure retrenchment (covering military and civil outlays and postponement of new development projects). 9. Together, these measures constituted an adjustment of the order of 3 percentage ‘. points of GDP (m roughly equal proportions) vis-a-vis the original 1998 budget. Nonetheless, the overall fiscal position in 1998 shifted into a deficit of about 6% percentage points of GDP (from a surplus of about 3% percent in the preceding year). The deterioration in the budgetary position mirrored the drop in oil revenues. The deficit was financed by recourse to bank credit (mainly the central bank), as well as a substantial drawdown of the assets of the State General Reserve Fund (Reserve Fund) (Box 2). 10. Government borrowing from the banking system in 1998, though small, represented a marked shift compared to 1997 and contributed to a significant increase in net domestic asset growth last year. The primary source of NDA growth in 1998, however, came from the expansion of credit to the private sector-despite a slowdown compared to the previous year (Table 4). Relative to the opening stock of broad money, net domestic assets expanded by 22 percent in 1998 (compared ta I6 percent in the previous year). The expansionary impact of the fiscal position was in large part offset by a number of actions taken by the central bank to rein in the growth of bank lending to the private sector-particularly consumer credit. In July 1998, the limit on banks’ lending-to-deposits ratio (85 percent) was redefined so as to close a loophole whereby banks could expand their domestic lending base by creating deposits abroad through external borrowing: as a transitional step, the lending-to-deposit ratio is being capped at 87.5 percent through June 1999. In January 1999, the central bank issued a directive requiring commercial banks Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7. Box 2. State General Reserve Fund The Reserve Fund was established in 1980 to provide a stream of income for future generations, to replace oil revenue, and to serve as a stabilization fund. Accordingly, part of oil revenue and other resources were to be transferred to the fund every year. Initially set at 15 percent of total oil receipts, the share of oil receipts allocated to the Reserve Fund has been changed from time to time, reflecting the budgetary position and the level of oil prices. With the exception of income earned on investments, the use of Reserve Fund resources to finance the budget needs the approval of the Council of Ministers. The Reserve Fund has been drawn down in most years during the 1990s to provide budgetary support.

Over the past 18 months, commercial banks have drawn down their net foreign assets to finance domestic advances (primarily in the form of personal loans and credit to the manufacturing and services sectors). In the process, the ratio of banks’ foreign assets to foreign liabilities fell from about 130 percent at end-1997 to 70 percent in March 1999. This prompted the central bank (in April 1999) to require commercial banks to seek prior approval from the central bank for all external borrowings and to enhance its monitoring of domestic foreign currency lending by banks. Also, the central bank has established internal guidelines for banks’ external borrowing relative to their net worth. 12. Latest indications are that new bank lending to the private sector came to a virtual standstill in the first quarter of 1999, though there was a sizable increase in bank claims on the government as portfolios were adjusted to the new regulations. Overall, the pace of net domestic asset growth, though declining, remains on the high side (18 percent of the opening stock of M2 in the 12 months ended March 1999). The bulk of NDA growth during 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 was reflected in a decline in net foreign assets of the banking system (principally the commercial banks) with the result that growth in domestic liquidity has been modest (1% percent in the 12 months ended March 1999). 13. Oman has made progress in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework of the banking system in recent years. By end-1997, all domestic banks had met the mandated capital adequacy ratio of 12 percent of risk-weighted assets (Box 3). Also, the share of nonperforming loans has been on a declining trend and banks are generally in compliance with other prudential requirements and regulations. A recent survey by the central bank estimated the exposure of commercial banks to the securities market, (both indirectly through personal loans used to invest in securities and directly through the banks’ own investment in the market), to be about 8 percent ofbanks’ assets. The deficit between total exposure and the market value of the shares is reckoned to be below the threshold under the International Accounting Standard that would require provisioning. 14. With a view to improving the transparency of stock market transactions, a new capital market law was introduced in February 1999. This provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory and supervisory authority. In addition, a depository and transfer company was set up for record keeping and registration of securities, and prudential regulations were tightened through more stringent disclosure and reporting requirements. 15. Oman’s exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, and there are no exchange restrictions on capital movements. The rial Omani (RO) is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The decline in domestic prices over the past few years has offset a modest appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate-reflecting movements of the dollar against other major currencies; as a result, the real Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- Box 3: Banking System Indicators’ Capital adequacy Banks are required lo meet a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 12 percent of risk-weighted assets. All banks currently meet or exceed this minimwn. The average capital-assets ratio for Omani banks is currently about 16 percent. Nonperforming loans Nonperfonning loans relative to banks’ total portfolios have been on a declining trend. In 1997, nonpcrfonning loans represented about 8 percent of total loans. In 1998, this ratio had fallen to 6.4 percent. The provisioning requirement for such loans was increased to 25 percent in October 1998 from 20 percent previously, and banks are fully compliant with this requirement. Loan concentration Lending to a single client is subject to a ceiling of 15 percent of a bank’s net worth. For management and memlxrs of the board, the ceiling is 10 percent. All banks are in compliance with these ceilings. Net open foreign currency position The total foreign exchange exposure of a bank is limited to 40 percent of its capital and reserves within Oman. All banks are reported to be in compliance with this ratio. Bank profitability Commercial banks’ total net profits after provisions and taxation increased by 4 percent ih 1998. Profits are expected to decline in 1999, inter alia, following the introduction of a quantitative ceiling of 30 percent on personal loans as a proportion of total private sector credit.

The trade system is relatively open, but includes tariffs of up to 200 percent on items considered socially undesirable, and quotas and bans on selected items. The basic import duty of 5 percent is applicable to most goods. In 1998, revenue horn customs amounted to 3 percent of recorded imports. Oman is in the process of negotiating membership in the WTO. A number of issues have yet to be resolved including the level of tariffs on some imported goods and transitional arrangements, as well as Oman’s openness to foreign investment in certain sectors and regulations governing employment of nationals. 17. Foreign reserves of the central bank and the Reserve Fund declined from USS4.6 billion at end 1997 and to USS4.1 billion at end 1998, when the central bank’s international reserves stood at US$2 billion, equivalent to about 5% months of imports. External debt has risen sharply over the past two years, predominantly reflecting borrowing associated with the LNG project: as of end-1998, public external debt amounted to some US$5 billion, representing a little more than a third of GDP. Debt service payments represented 20 percent of current account receipts. III. DISCWSIONSOFPROSPECTSAND POLICV ISSUES 18. In the discussions, the authorities reiterated the Government’s economic and social objectives for the medium term.3 Key priorities are: . maintenance of price stability and a viable external position including a gradual rebuilding of the foreign assets of the Reserve Fund to serve as a stabilizer against external shocks and a resource for the benefit of future generations. . the further development and diversification of the economy based upon efficient exploitation of the country’s hydrocarbon resources and increased private sector (including foreign) participation and investment in the economy. . the expansion of employment opportunities for nationals. 19. These broad objectives were fully endorsed by the staff team and served as a frame of reference for the policy discussions which focused on: 3 These policies have also been articulated in official publications including the Fifth Five- Year Plan (1996) and Vision 2020, prepared in collaboration with the World Bank staff.

A. Prospects for 1999 20. The original budget for 1999, based on a projected oil price of US$9/bbl, envisaged a further loss of oil revenue equivalent to 7 percent of GDP compared with last year’s outturn. To limit the increase in the deficit, expenditures were cut by 6% percent relative to the 1998 budget, comprising cuts in both current outlays and development spending. In addition, certain revenue measures were taken, though their impact in 1999 was expected to be negligible.4 Overall, the deficit was expected to rise sharply (to almost 11 percent of GDP). 21. In the event, oil prices strengthened markedly following the March OPEC agreement on production restraint, to which Oman is a party. Based on the agreement, the authorities expect to reduce oil production to about 860,000 b/d in the second half of 1999 (from about 900,000 b/d in the first) and to maintain production at that level for the foreseeable future. On this basis, and taking account of the staffs latest (April 1999) oil price projections (which imply an average export price for Gmani oil of US$l2.7Oibbl in 1999), oil revenues in 1999 would be higher than budgeted by the equivalent of 6 percent of GDP and the deficit would amount to about 4 percent of GDP. Given that no further adjustment measures are expected before the end of the year and taking account of recent official external bornowing (in the form of a US$350 million syndicated loan) the financing of the budget deficit will entail substantial additional resources which are expected to come primarily from the Reserve Fund. 22. Turning to the external outlook for 1999, the staff and the authorities are in agreement that while the cutrent account deficit is likely to narrow somewhat (reflecting a modest increase in oil earnings together with lower imports associated with fiscal restraint, credit tightening and the completion of the LNG project), this would be largely offset by a smaller surplus on the capital account (reflecting the winding down of disbursements in respect of the LNG project). As a result, the overall deficit (US$O.6 billion) would be only marginally below last year. On the financing side, the scope for further drawing down the external reserves of the central bank is limited given that their current level Cjust over five months of import cover) is regarded by the authorities as being close to a minimum prudent 4 The measures comprised increases in customs duties on luxury items (from 5 to 15 percent), cars (from 5 percent to lo-15 percent), cigars (l?om 75 to 100 percent), and alcoholic beverages (from 100 to 200 percent); and an increase in the corporate profit tax for Omani- owned companies (from 5 and 7.5 percent, to 12 percent).

Hence, the bulk of the external deficit would be financed through the Reserve Fund, bringing its balance to about US$l.6 billion by year end-its lowest level in recent years. B. Medium-Term Outlook and Adjustment Challenges 23. The staff and the authorities were in agreement that, in the absence of corrective policies, the fiscal and external imbalances would persist over the medium term. For purposes of the discussions, and in order to gauge the broad magnitude of the adjustment required, the staff team presented contrasting medium-term scenarios including: . a hypothetical baseline scenario incorporating the assumption that there is no change in policy, and . an adjustment scenario, incorporating a comprehensive range of policy reforms both on the fiscal/monetary side as well as in the structural domam. 24. Based on unchanged policies, the budget deficit would remain in the vicinity of 3% percentage points of GDP over the medium term. While the external current account deficit would narrow, from about 15 percent of GDP in 1999 to approximate balance in 5 years (mainly reflecting the positive impact on both exports and imports of the coming on- stream of the LNG project), the capital account would shift from a substantial surplus into deficits over the same period (as borrowing for the LNG project through 1999 gives way to amortization thereafter). Accordingly, the overall balance of payments would remain in deficit over the medium term, albeit on a declining trend. The implications of such a scenario would be to exhaust the remaining assets of the Reserve Fund over the next two years or so and thereby to necessitate recourse to further external borrowing. As a result, the burden of external debt would remain relatively high (near 40 percent of GDP) and the debt service ratio would increase (to about 30 percent of current receipts) over the medium term. 25. Although the consequences for the non-oil sector are difficult to quantify, the authorities agree that they would be adverse. In the first place, the low and declining levels of government saving (associated with the weak fiscal position) would undermine both government and private sector investment (through crowding oui). Second, the decline in official foreign assets could unsettle confidence, while recourse to further external borrowing might also be viewed with skcpticism, particularly if such borrowing were large and sustained. Further, the scenario leaves no room for downside risks: in particular, the assumption that the recent strengthening of oil prices will be sustained could prove optimistic. 26. The authorities fully concurred with the staffs concerns regarding the implications of the baseline scenario and rejected it on the ground that it would be inconsistent with their desire to build up the Reserve Fund and to sustain the process of diversification through increased reliance on the private sector. Accordingly, the discussions centered on the elements of a broad-based adjustment strategy (Table 5), which Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-13- envisages gross fixed capital formation in the range of 15-17 percent of GDP over the medium term (notwithstanding the completion of the LNG project) and a substantial increase in the savings ratio coming mainly from fiscal adjustment, The latter assumes that, action is taken across a broad front (see below) to augment non-oil revenues by 1 percentage point of GDP per year. On the expenditure side, capital outlays would be maintained at about 6.5 percent of GDP while current expenditure would decline in real terms over the period reflecting, inter alia, civil service reform and further cuts in defense spending. The effect would be to turn the fiscal position around from a deficit presently to surpluses from 2002. The “surpluses” notionally comprise some element of a contingency against the possibility of a weaker oil market than currently assumed, while also affording room to rebuild the Reserve Fund. 27. The budgetary position in the adjustment scenario would be consistent with a stronger external position comprising, in particular, lower government imports and higher private capital inflows than under the baseline. The overall external deficits through 2002 could be financed through the Reserve Fundalthough its foreign exchange assets would be likely to fall somewhat below US$O.5 billion-before recovering in the outer years. (In addition, provision is made for the commercial banks to reconstitute their net foreign asset position at the outset). Inevitably, the budgetary retrenchment depicted in this scenario would be felt by the non-oil sector. However, the overall effect of the adjustment scenario should in time be positive, given that more resources would be released for private sector investment; confidence in the credibility and sustainability of govemment policies would encourage private sector saving and investment; and the economy would have some cushion against further external shocks. 28. The authorities recognised the need for further adjustment measures and indicated that the Government was currently reviewing the policy options as well as the balance to strike between the pace and extent of adjustment on the one hand and reliance on external borrowing on the other. The staff team agreed that the adjustment policy scenario was not an all-or-nothing package, and accepted that Oman had the capacity to undertake further foreign borrowing. However, they urged the authorities to continue to exercise prudence on borrowing and stressed that the current exigencies and the uncertain outlook required that reliance be placed principally upon a comprehensive and integrated program of policy reforms. Accordingly, the discussions ranged over the policy requirements, both in the macroeconomic and structural areas, for meeting the current challenges and achieving the necessary adjustment. C. Policy Requirements Macroeconomic policies 29. The authorities agreed with the staff that fiscal policy has a pivotal role in the macro management of the Omani economy. They also accept that, in general terms, objectives over the medium term should be to broaden the base of non-oil revenues so as to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- reduce the dependency of the government on volatile oil receipts, while continuing efforts to rationalize and trim government spending, 30. On revenue options, the staff team laid out a number of proposals based on earlier technical assistance from FAD. These included: introducing or raising charges for publicly-provided goods and services; enhancing customs administration and reducing duty exemptions; extending excise duties to telecommunications and other services; introducing a sales tax at the import and producer levels; reforming the corporate income tax by adopting a flat and uniform rate on all companies; introducing a broad-based property tax; and adopting a personal income tax (limited initially to employment income). The various measures-even if implemented gradually and narrowly applied-could mobilize revenues on the scale envisaged in the adjustment scenario (viz. 1 percent of GDP annually). At the same time, on the expenditure side, the staff team saw some scope for further cuts in current outlays across the board (especially through downsizing the civil service, reducing the role of the government in providing services, outsourcing, and tinther streamlining the defense budget). 31. While the authorities accept that there is room for expenditure retrenchment, particularly through streamlining the bureaucracy, they are approaching the matter of tax reform with caution. Revenue options are being considered in conjunction with an assessment of the potential for generating resources through privatization (as a means of augmenting the Reserve Fund and reducing government debt) and foreign borrowing. 32. At the same time, the authorities see a potentially greater role for monetary policy even though they recognize the limits given both by the predominance of fiscal policy on the one hand and the openness of the external sector combined with the fixed exchange rate regime on the other. In this regard, steps are being taken to strengthen the capacity of the central bank to implement monetary policy. A repo system is now in operation and studies toward establishing reverse repos, are at an advanced stage. Such a step, together with recent improvements in the auction system for treasury bills and steps to enhance the secondary market would enable the central bank to manage liquidity through open-market operations rather than through monetary and credit controls. 33. On external policies, the authorities expressed their broad satisfaction with the level of the current peg to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate regime. While the recent external pressures raised questions about sustainability, the authorities were of the view that the economy remained externally competitive and that the current exchange regime served as a useful anchor for macroeconomic policy. They believed that further development and diversification of the non-oil sector could best be pursued through increased emphasis on structural reform-particularly privatization. At the same time, they recognized the crucial importance of fiscal consolidation and maintenance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals as underpinnings for sustainability of the current exchange rate over the medium term. On external borrowing, the authorities affirmed that they would maintain a prudent and conservative approach.

The non-oil sector has generally performed well in recent years and has shown a measure of resilience to the vagaries of the world oil market and related shifts in government expenditures ’ (Figure 4). However, the prospect of further fiscal retrenchment at a time of increasing competition in the world economy will make it that much harder to sustain the momentum of growth on the non-oil sector. From this perspective, the staff underlined the importance of undertaking a comprehensive structural reform effort aimed at further strengthening efficiency and productivity. 35. The motivation for maintaining non-oil sector growth in Oman is heightened by the need to create new jobs on the large scale required to absorb the country’s underemployed and rapidly growing labor force. High unemployment rates (10 percent or more) combined with a low participation rate by Omanis (who constitute less than a third of total employment and only 16 percent of private sector employment) and the large number of Omani entrants to the labor market (about IO percent annnaI\y of the number of Ornanis presently employed) sets a major challenge for the government, particularly at a time when employment in the public sector is being reduced (Box 4 and Figure 5). 36. On the policies required to promote growth and diversification-in addition to the fiscal and monetary policies outlined above geared to fostering private sector saving and investment-emphasis is being placed upon: . enhancing the role of the private sector: the staff team welcomed the intention of the government to accelerate the privatization process (in collaboration with outside consultants) particularly in the areas of telecommunication, power generation, ports/airport, and tourism. They noted that the authorities’ success to date in virtually eliminating current subsidies for utilities greatly enhanced the feasibility of embarking on the privatization of those entities in the near future. Aside from the considerable potential for expanding the role of private initiative and the enterprise sector in the economy, privatization promises to attract foreign investors, and with it, external resources and expertise. . attracting foreign investment: the recently established Omani Center for Investment Promotion and Export Development, which offers a one-stop service to prospective investors, has been working well. The authorities are presently considering further 5 Regression analysis suggests a close relationship between real government expenditures and non-oil GDP growth. However, the relationship appears to be weakening implying greater resilience of non-oil sector. (In the period 1984-91, the coefficient is close to l- indicating that a 1 percent change in real government spending is accompanied by a commensurate change in non-oil GDP-whereas in the period 198998, the coefficient falls to 0.3.)

To this end, the staff team welcomed the increased emphasis on training and efforts to increase the competitiveness of the local labor force. Also, they urged that the costs and benefits of the quota system-defining a minimum share for Omani employment in key sectors-be carefully monitored and weighed lest its rigorous enforcement should increase costs, weaken productivity, and undermine diversification. D. Other Issues-Data and Technology 37. Oman’s data base is generally good and adequate for surveillance purposes (Appendix III). Significant progress has been made in increasing transparency in recent years through the introduction of a comprehensive economic website and publication of official statistical bulletins on a monthly basis. Oman is making the necessary preparation to participate in the Fund’s GDDS and hopes to do so in the near future. 38. Based on the discussions, Oman appears to be fully cognizant of risks associated with the so-called Y2K problem, and is well advanced in ensuring that its computers and information technology systems are compliant. The authorities are, however, conscious of the risks posed by external linkages, particularly those related to shipping. The staff team advised the authorities to seek further information and assistance, if necessary, from the World Bank. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 39. Oman has made impressive progress in recent years by harnessing its energy resources as a basis for modemizing its economy and diversifying its productive base. Following large and sustained investment in social and physical infrastructure and a good track record of macroeconomic management, the country has achieved relatively strong, if uneven, economic growth in conditions of financial stability. 40. Recent developments in the world oil market are a reminder of Oman’s external vulnerability and of the heightened challeuges for policies. The staff welcomes the actions taken by the authorities over the past 12 months to compress budgetary expenditures and to tighten private sector credit in order to contain the pressures on the external position and limit recourse to foreign borrowing. Nevertheless, further drawdowns of the foreign assets of the Reserve Fund have brought it to a low level thereby jeopardizing its primary purpose-namely-to serve as a resource for future generations. Given Oman’s heavy Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- Box 4. Labor Market Structure of Employment Oman has traditionally relied heavily on expatriate labor and expatriate workers have accounted for some two thirds of total employment in recent years (Figure 5). The share of expatriates on the total work force has shown some increase during the 1990s (currently it stands at about two-thirds), despite ongoing efforts to expand employment of nationals. While Omanis account for some 80 percent of employment in the public sector, their presence in the private sector remains small (about 16 percent). Dynamics There is a relatively large pool of unemployed labor (estimated at l&l 5 percent of the work force or 3O,OOCr50,000). On top of that the labor force is growing rapidly reflecting the high rate of population growth (near 4 percent) and the age structure (60 percent below the age of 20). Efforts to downsize the civil service have resulted in the virtual stagnation of total public sector employment in recent years; the continuation of this process, combined with privatisation, is likely to lead to a contraction of public sector employment in the years ahead. Policies Efforts to expand employment of nationals focus on improving education, especially vocational training (financed by taxes and fees on expatriate employees) as well as quantitative targets for the share of Omanis in total employment of specific sectors (e.g., manufacturing, 35 percent; financial services and real estate, 45 percent; transport/communications, 60 percent), and bans on tbe hiring of expatriates for low or nonskilled functions. A minimum wage (RO 150 per month) applies to employed nationals.

Notwithstanding the strengthening of oil prices following the OPEC agreement in March-which Oman is supporting through production restraint of its own-the outlook is for continuing budget deficits over the medium term entailing a depletion of offtciai foreign assets or recourse to additional foreign borrowing. The authorities are fully aware that such a scenario is at odds with the government’s goals of fostering growth and employment opportunities based on the development of the private sector and of building a financial reserve for future generations, Accordingly, they are considering a policy strategy that would be conducive to the attainment of these goals in circumstances of protracted weakness and uncertainty in the world oil market. The staff welcomes this reassessment, and urges the authorities to move expeditiously toward implementing an appropriate adjustment and reform strategy. 42. On the macroecouomic side, the authorities recognize the central role of fiscal adjustment and are reviewing the policy options. However, indications are that they are likely to proceed cautiously in the key area of revenue mobilization and to lean instead on continued expenditure restructuring and retrenchment supplemented by further foreign borrowing. By contrast, the staff is of the view that, after successive years of expenditure compression and recent efforts to expand revenues within the existing narrow and inelastic base, the fiscal adjustment over the medium term will necessitate action not only on the expenditure side but also to broaden the revenue base. Accordingly, the staff recommends that the authorities adopt a balanced fiscal package incorporating some revenue measures along the lines proposed in recent technical assistance from FAD, and to keep recourse to foreign borrowing within prudent limits as in the past. 43. Meanwhile, the authorities are seeking to enhance the role of monetary policy and to phase out direct credit controls through the possible introduction of reverse repos and by fostering development of the secondary market for government securities. The staff welcomes these steps and encourages the authorities to adopt a more systematic approach for programming monetary and credit growth in the context of specific external targets; this is particularly advisable in current circumstances where competing demand for credit by the government and the private sector appear to be aggravating external pressures. While all the indications are that the banking system continues to be in a sound financial position, the staff encourages the authorities to continue to exercise vigilance on bank supervision and regulation. 44. Strengthened macroeconomic management will need to be supported by a broad-based structural reform effort in order to sustain the process of diversification and job creation. The imminent startup of the LNG project and the prospect of developing further gas-based industries at a later stage open new horizons for the productive base of the economy, but their positive impact on the balance of payments will not be felt for a number of years and their potential for employment generation is somewhat limited. In any event, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19. staff encourages the authorities to ensure that tinther investment in this area continues to be based on sound economic criteria and manageable external financing. 45. Essential to efficient diversification will be increased private sector participation in the economy combined with a larger role for foreign investment, avoidance of labor market rigidities, and maintenance of liberal and open external policies. To these ends, the staff welcomes the intention of the authorities to step up the pace of privatization, and encourages them to draw up and publicize a specific program of divestiture comprising the entities to be offered for sale, the timing envisaged, and the modalities to be used. While foreign investors will be encouraged to participate fully in the privatization process, the staff recommends that the authorities consider further steps to enhance the climate for foreign investment, including removal of the remaining bias in the tax code. 46. On the labor market, while efforts to increase the currently low participation rate by Omanis are understandable, the staff urges the authorities to undertake a careful evaluation of the impact of the quota system in light of recent experience. Enforcement of such a system could prove counterproductive if it were to raise business costs or act as a disincentive to new investment. On the other hand, the government should step up its already commendable efforts to expand education and training to increase the competitiveness of domestic labor, while seeking to ensure adequate incentives for private sector employment vis-a-vis the public sector (viz. by setting appropriate wages scales in the public sector and facilitating a system of unemployment insurance and pension funds in the private sector). 4-f. In the external sector, Oman has a good track record in maintaining liberal and open trading policies, and its impending accession to the WTO augurs well. Oman’s exchange rate policy, featuring a fixed peg to the U.S. dollar, has served the economy well both in terms of stabilization and development. Continued viability of the current peg will depend primarily upon the implementation of a comprehensive and integrated program of policy reforms (as outlined above). With this condition, and notwithstanding the recent sharp deterioration in the external terms of trade and the pressure on the external position, the staff shares the view of the authorities that no change in the exchange rate or the pegging policy would be warranted at this time. This follows from the dominance of the oil sector and the likelihood that structural impediments rather than a loss of competitiveness remain the primary obstacles to the development of the non-oil sector. 48. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - Table 1.

The coverage, quality, frequency, and timeliness of Oman’s economic data are generally good and meet the basic requirements for the Article IV consultation process and for economic analysis and policy formulation by the authorities. The Ministry of National Economy has designed a web page that provides a set of core indicators. As indicated below, in a few areas remedial measures would be beneficial. The authorities publish all data provided to the staff except information relating to the SGRF which is confidential. National accounts 2. National accounts data are prepared by the Directorate General of Economic Statistics of the Ministry of National Economy on the basis of information received from government departments and agencies. Progress is being made in improving national accounting data, and new national accounts series were published in September 19%. Revised data for GDP by activity at current and constant 1988 prices were received in 1997. In addition, the Central Bank of Oman is regularly reporting GDP by expenditure at current prices. Prices, employment, and wages 3. Until end-1996, the Muscat Consumer Price Index was compiled quarterly on the basis of prices collected monthly in the national capita1 area using weights from a 1990-91 household expenditure survey. Beginning in 1997, the geographical coverage of the consumer price index was broadened to the entire country, and new monthly indices were introduced based on weights from a 1995 household expenditure survey. 4. Data on civil service and public sector enterprise employment are available and appear to be accurate, including the breakdown between nationals and expatriates. No data on defense employment are available. Private sector employment data are derived from surveys, and the information on the breakdown between the national and expatriate labor force is obtained from labor work permits. Information is available on wages for non-Omani workers in the private sector by major occupational groups. Government finance statistics 5. In 1998 the authorities provided monthly data on public finance with a 3-month lag as part of the set of core indicators. They also provide a comprehensive and analytical presentation of the budget for the consultation process. The accounts of municipalities and the regional administrations are included in the budget. However, the official budget presentation excludes data on Reserve Fund transactions (as well as those of the Contingency and Oil Funds). Due to this practice, there are difficulties regarding the coverage of the official budget and reconciling its financing with the monetary statistics. Broad use within the Ministry of National Economy of a comprehensive budget compilation as used for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - APPENDIX III consultations, including Reserve Fund operations and the budget’s financing, would assist in ensuring that an internally consistent, transparent, and analytical presentation of general government operations is available to policy makers. Monetary statistics 6. Consistent monthly monetary data on the Central Bank and the deposit money banks are published in the Bulletin of the Central Bank, usually with a short lag. Monthly monetary and financial data are reported to STA on a regular basis. The May 1999 issue of IFS included data through January 1999 for both the monetary authorities and the deposit money banks. The Muscat stock market index is provided in the Ministry of National Economy’s web site on a monthly basis. Balance of payments statistics 7. Data for most balance of payments entries are reliable. Since there have been long- standing problems with the noncancellation of redundant permits for expatriate labor, the Central Bank has surveyed the commercial banks and moneychangers in the major cities to improve estimates of workers’ remittances. Since 1995, the Ministry of Oil and Gas has provided detailed data on PDO partners’ fees and earnings and gross direct investment flows, but so far has been unable to provide direct information on profit remittances and direct investment by other foreign oil companies. In 1997, the Ministry of Oil and Gas provided detailed data to the Central Bank on the upstream and downstream estimated expenditure, revenue, and financing arrangements for the LNG project for 1997 and the medium term, and actual data with a (4-month lag) on expenditure and imports of goods and services. For the famre, the Central Bank is planning to implement a survey to provide improved estimates for tourism. However, resources should also be directed to obtaining data on gross flows for the other services items, which comprise mainly government payments for civilian and defense services. 8. The public sector external debt data are comprehensive and reliable. No data are available on private sector foreign debt, or on private non-oil and nonbank capital account transactions. The authorities provide comprehensive information on foreign investments held by the Reserve Fund and related transactions for use in consultation reports; these data are confidential and not available for publication. Military transactions 9. The fiscal, balance of payments, and external debt data fully incorporate military transactions.
