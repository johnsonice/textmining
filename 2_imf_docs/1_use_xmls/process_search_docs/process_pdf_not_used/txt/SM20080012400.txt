Private investment growth was negative in H1. In comparison, real GDP growth accelerated during 2007H2. With election prospects firming up, confidence indices turned around. Substantial contributions from domestic consumption and investment added to continued strength in export growth. On a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, real GDP growth rose from 4¾ percent in 2007Q1 to over 7¼ percent in 2007Q4, with the growth slowdown that began in early 2005 troughing in 2006Q4. Overall, real GDP growth slowed from 5 percent in 2006 to 4¾ percent in 2007 (Figure 1). 4.      Macroeconomic policies supported the recovery.  • The BOT cut its policy interest rate by a cumulative 175 basis points between January and July, based on declining inflation and the BOT’s core inflation forecast pointing to a downward trajectory. The cuts stimulated domestic demand while easing upward pressure on the baht. • Fiscal policy also eased in 2006/07 (FY2007), although the stimulus fell short of the budgetary target (Table 3).1 The central government cash budget posted a deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP—less than the budgeted deficit of 1¾ percent of GDP—due mainly to underspending. The general government surplus fell to ¼ percent of GDP (from about 1 percent of GDP in FY2006), and the overall public sector was close to balance (a surplus of ½ percent in FY2006). 5.      Inflationary pressures rose over the course of the year, reflecting global developments. Headline inflation was on a downward path since peaking in mid-2006, but picked up in 2007Q4 on the back of escalating energy prices, reaching 5¼ percent in March 2008 (12-month basis). Core inflation followed a similar trajectory, falling substantially for the year as a whole, picking up to 1¾ percent in March 2008, but remained within the BOT’s 0–3½ percent target band. For 2007 as a whole, inflation moderated                                                  1 The fiscal year runs from October through September.

With strong exports and limited import growth, the current account surplus was the main contributor to an increase in international reserves in 2007. With tourism also performing well, favorable current account movements dominated the reversal of capital flows (portfolio investment turned mildly negative, possibly reflecting capital controls). The rise in global commodity prices offset oil price increases, leaving the terms of trade virtually flat over 2006. The current account registered a surplus of over 6 percent of GDP, and reserves increased by over US$20½ billion to US$87½ billion by end-2007 (6½ months of imports of goods and services). During the first two months of 2008, the balance of payments registered a surplus of US$10 billion, of which US$2 billion was on the current account, and capital inflows rose substantially in anticipation of the removal of capital controls. 7.      Exporters and importers also made more extensive use of hedging instruments to manage the exchange rate appreciation and volatility. The baht appreciated, in line with other regional currencies, along with the dollar’s slide, and volatility rose. Following a sharp rise against the U.S. dollar in 2006, the baht rose by a more moderate 6½ percent in 2007. More generally, the baht has been among the faster appreciating currencies in Asia in the recent past, appreciating by about 13 percent since the beginning of 2006. Correspondingly, both nominal and real effective exchange rates have appreciated by 6½ percent. The higher volatility in mature markets toward late 2007 did initially echo in baht movements, but then subsided. However, greater use of foreign exchange hedges, including during the period of uncertainty in the run-up to the removal of capital controls, helped smooth import payments and export earnings. 8.      Effective March 3, 2008, the BOT removed the capital controls that were imposed in December 2006, and further liberalized outflows. The main element of the capital controls was a 30 percent unremunerated reserve requirement (URR) on most capital flows.

Confidence slipped and the stock market dropped sharply the next day. In quick response, equity, FDI, and government loan inflows were exempted from the URR. Over the course of 2007, other flows were incrementally exempted from the URR (with or without a hedging requirement on the foreign exchange risk associated with the flows).2 The controls were administratively burdensome, with investors obliged to maintain up to four different and nontransferable accounts with commercial banks. Reflecting these costs, a thin and illiquid offshore market arose, with the baht trading at a premium to the official rate (Figure 2). All in all, a broad consensus was building up for the removal of the controls, recognizing their adverse impact on investor sentiment. When the URR requirement was finally eliminated in March 2008, among other factors, the BOT cited the erosion of effectiveness of the URR given “widespread expectations of the lifting of the URR measure and market participants (adjusting) their behaviors in line with these expectations.” The removal of capital controls was a welcome boost to confidence, and likely factored into private demand even earlier. In addition, the BOT liberalized certain provisions for capital outflows.3 9.      The stock market moved largely in line with other regional markets. Following the broad-scale pull back by investors in early August, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fully recovered its losses, gaining 26 percent in value during 2007. In 2008, foreign investors have pulled out of the SET as part of a general loss of risk appetite emanating from concerns about an impending U.S. recession and overall repositioning of exposure by major global banks. So far this year, the SET has lost about 3¾ percent in value, less than regional exchanges, as confidence domestically has rebounded. SET volatility rose, as in other regional stock markets, reflecting the deterioration in investor sentiment in mature markets.                                                  2 In January 2007, exemptions were extended to fully hedged foreign currency, packing credits, depository receipts, and the purchase of NPLs. In March 2007, an important exemption was granted for fully hedged investments in debt securities (bonds, treasury bills, debentures, bills of exchange, and promissory notes) and unit trusts. This exemption applied only if the foreign currency risk of the investment was fully hedged for at least one year. In December 2007, the limit on foreign borrowings by Thai corporations was raised, and nonresident investments in property funds were exempted from both the URR and hedging requirement. 3 The measures taken in 2008 included raising limits on portfolio investment abroad through securities companies and mutual funds, elimination of limits on investment abroad by companies listed on the Thai stock exchange in their subsidiaries or affiliates, and raising limits on individuals and company foreign exchange deposits in domestic banks if they can show offshore liabilities. In 2007, the BOT eliminated the limit on overseas investments by Thai-listed companies and exempted foreign currency loans if they were fully hedged.

The banking system—which account for about two-thirds of the financial system assets—remained generally resilient to the turmoil in global financial markets. Several factors contributed to this resilience including the banks’ stronger balance sheets, limited exposure to subprime-related and structured products, ample domestic liquidity, reliance predominantly on domestic deposits for funding and limited dependence on international financial markets, and lending as the main business operation.4 • Commercial banking system soundness indicators improved in 2007, reflecting ongoing progress in the financial sector since the 1997 crisis. As deposit rates fell in tandem with policy rates, while lending rates edged down slowly, banks utilized the higher spreads to steady their operating profits. Net profits fell on account of higher provisioning levels as the BOT took measures to strengthen loan-loss provisioning requirements by implementing IAS39 guidelines. Banks’ balance sheets were strengthened through successful initiatives by several banks to raise new capital. However, performance across banks remained uneven, as NPLs of state-owned banks increased.  • Performance of government deposit-taking specialized financial institutions (SFIs)—which account for about 15 percent of total financial sector assets—deteriorated. Gross NPLs rose significantly from 8½ percent of total loans in December 2006 to 14¼ percent in September 2007.  • Corporate profitability remained strong on the back of robust exports, and corporations deleveraged relying on internal earnings for financing (Figure 3). II.   OUTLOOK AND RISKS 11.      GDP growth is projected to increase to 5¼ percent in 2008 driven by a strong recovery in private consumption and investment, and a supportive fiscal policy. The drivers of growth are projected to shift significantly to domestic sources. The contribution of net exports to growth is projected to fall from 3 percent in 2007 to zero in 2008. Staff estimates suggest a slowdown in Thai real GDP growth of 0.14–0.9 percentage points, for                                                  4 Supervisory information from the BOT suggests that Thai banks have little direct exposure to structured products (less than 2 percent of total banks’ assets).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS The policy discussions addressed three principal issues to maintain macroeconomic stability and raise growth in 2008 and beyond. These included policies to stimulate domestic demand and maintain internal and external stability; external competitiveness and the exchange rate; and steps to enhance financial sector depth and efficiency.  A. Macroeconomic Policies to Sustain Growth 14.      Sustaining the improvements in investor and consumer confidence was seen as key in the near term. There is a broad consensus, including among market participants that the removal of capital controls has helped in this regard. Relatedly, given the adverse reaction to draft amendments to the Foreign Business Act, staff recommended a reconsideration of the merits of the proposed changes, a proposal to which the authorities were agreeable.5 Over the medium term, it was agreed that effective policy measures can create a durable environment for higher potential growth. These include infrastructure and social sector spending to increase physical and human capital, and raise total factor productivity; and steps to enhance financial sector depth and efficiency. 15.      For 2008, fiscal stimulus was considered appropriate to contribute to higher growth and help rebalance demand toward domestic sources, while preserving external stability. The 2007/08 budget envisages a deficit of about 1¾ percent of GDP for the central government cash balance. However, with historical disbursement rates, staff estimated that the deficit would fall short of the target by about ½ percent of GDP. With this, staff suggested that additional expenditure measures of about ½ percent of GDP which would ensure a deficit of 1¾ percent of GDP would be appropriate from a cyclical perspective. Given Thailand’s low and falling debt levels, this would be consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability. While agreeing with the thrust of the staff recommendations, the authorities indicated that the likelihood of additional spending allocation through a supplementary budget in 2007/08 was limited, but a fiscal stimulus would be provided by: • The March package of revenue measures—with a headline tag of B 42 billion (½ percent of GDP)—aimed at middle- to high-income earners, would stimulate private demand. A second stimulus package, approved in April, consists of measures targeted at the rural population.6                                                  5 The amendments are aimed at establishing a de facto ceiling of 49 percent on foreign ownership in number of listed service sectors. A de jure ceiling of 49 percent already exists under the FBA, but in practice, foreign companies often establish majority control through the issuance of preferred shares and “nominee” shareholders. Since the amendments cover not only new investments but also existing businesses, their passage would cause significant disruptions to businesses and damage investor sentiment. 6 The elements of the first package included: increases in the income tax and annual life insurance tax exemption limits; an increase in the retirement mutual fund deduction; an extension of a reduced corporate tax (continued…) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 12 Corrected: 5/20/08  • Fuller disbursement and implementation of the budget by reallocating to faster disbursing categories which would have an effect similar to additional spending allocation. They also indicated that further plans for a supportive fiscal stance could be embedded in the 2008/09 budget, preparations for which are under way. • Expediting implementation of the megaprojects, given the widely recognized need to upgrade infrastructure and relieve transportation bottlenecks.7 This investment would also help to crowd in private investment and foreign participation through, for example, public-private partnerships (PPPs) with due attention to the potential fiscal risks associated with PPPs. Staff concurred with these plans, and urged an early start on implementation of the megaprojects. 16.      The authorities agreed that the BOT policy rate should remain unchanged for now. The substantial easing of monetary policy in 2007 is now exercising an impact on demand conditions. With the fiscal stimulus, monetary policy should remain on hold for now, with a change in policy rates contingent on the developments in oil prices, their second-round effects, and on evolving demand conditions. The authorities also recognized that policy rates in Thailand would also need to remain mindful of the stance of central banks in mature markets and global liquidity conditions. B. External Competitiveness and the Exchange Rate 17.      The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment that the value of the baht is currently in line with medium-term fundamentals. Staff suggested that, notwithstanding the appreciation over 2006 and 2007, Thailand’s REER is in line with regional peers; CGER estimates also broadly point to the baht’s real effective value being consistent with fundamentals. Exports have continued to grow robustly through the period of appreciation, thanks to the adaptiveness of Thai exporters and rapid growth in non-U.S. trading partner countries. Cross-country surveys of competitiveness—such as the World Bank’s “Doing Business” survey—have consistently ranked Thailand highly in recent years. The authorities                                                                                                                                                        (for newly listed companies) and VAT rates; and reinstatement of the 2004–06 property stimulus package. On April 1, the cabinet approved a second package comprising: a top-up of the existing village funding program (VFP), and its extension to 1,600 additional villages; a two-year farm debt suspension program; additional funding for microcredit by the Government Savings Bank, new subsidized loans for low-income homebuyers, and an aggressive loan growth target for Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives. 7 Projects over B 1 billion are considered “megaprojects” Current plans for megaprojects spending stand at B 1½ trillion (17½ percent of GDP) over the next five years.

Substantial progress was made in 2007 in upgrading regulatory and supervisory systems. 2007 saw the passage of key amendments to existing acts and passage of new legislation—the BOT Act, the Financial Institutions Business Act (FIBA), the Insurance Business Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission Act, and the Deposit Protection Agency (DPA) Act—all of which strengthen the legal framework for financial sector activity. Specifically, the BOT Act provides for greater operational independence, new procedures for appointment of the governor and governance structures for the central bank. The FIBA provides for consolidated supervision and a prompt corrective action framework. The DPA Act provides for limited deposit insurance to be phased in over a five year period. The DPA will begin its operations in August 2008. In addition, Basel II is to be implemented by end-2008. 21.      The authorities outlined their plans for further reforms to be embedded in the Financial Sector Masterplan II (FSMPII) to improve financial sector efficiency, competitiveness, and resilience based on three pillars. These pillars are: shifting regulation to a more principle- and risk-based approach; increasing competition through further deregulation and liberalization; and strengthening market infrastructure, including putting in place missing pieces by benchmarking against advanced financial systems, further improving the legal framework, and dissemination of market information to help financial institutions better price and manage risk. As regards the timeframe, the BOT has already circulated a concept paper and framework of the plan. Following input from key stakeholders, it expected that the Master Plan would be completed by end-2008. In addition, ongoing efforts include the Capital Market Development Master Plan focused on the bond market, securitization, derivatives, and equity markets. Moreover, the SET is working in coordination with other regional exchanges to initiate a single gateway into ASEAN bourses.  22.      Looking forward, staff urged implementation of FSAP recommendations to further enhance financial sector soundness and efficiency. First, close supervision of the few weak financial institutions—primarily commercial banks with government ownership and SFIs—is needed, with stress tests conducted under the FSSA suggesting that Thai banks remain vulnerable to a significant slowdown in economic growth and credit risk, with liquidity risk a problem for only a few banks. Second, final resolution of problem loans left over from the Asian crisis would enhance financial system efficiency and resilience. Third, over time, a strategy for an orderly sale of the government’s equity participation in commercial banks needs to be developed along with a vision of how the SFIs fit into the goal of a strong and competitive financial system that can meet the varied needs of the Thai economy. The authorities assured staff that several of these recommendations could be integrated into the FSMPII.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 16   IV.   STAFF APPRAISAL 23.      The resilience of the Thai economy amidst domestic political uncertainties and the growing turmoil in global financial markets is commendable. This resilience, together with sound macroeconomic management, financial sector reforms, and the removal of capital controls has paved the way for the strong recovery currently under way. Support from the programmed fiscal stimulus and early start on the implementation of the megaprojects would help put Thailand on the way to achieving its growth potential over the medium term. Risks to the near term outlook, nevertheless, remain and come from the residual political uncertainties, a potentially sharper slowdown in external demand and the continuing turmoil in global financial markets. 24.      Sustaining the recovery in market confidence will remain key in the near term. Staff welcomes the removal of capital controls which has provided a clear signal of the authorities’ intent to pursue market-friendly policies. A thorough reconsideration of the merits of the proposed amendments to the Foreign Business Act is strongly recommended. 25.      For 2008, a fiscal stimulus will contribute to higher growth, help rebalance demand toward domestic sources, and preserve external stability. Real GDP growth is projected to pick up with a strong contribution from domestic sources, supplanting exports as the main engine of growth as in 2006 and 2007. This rebalancing to domestic sources comes at an appropriate time as demand in some partner countries weakens. At the same time, continued diversification in export destinations should further enhance the resilience of the Thai economy. 26.      The fiscal stimulus measures put in train by the authorities are welcome, and staff looks forward to early implementation of the megaprojects. The revenue package would help provide the needed support to private demand. The megaprojects remain a key element of the fiscal support that the economy needs at the current conjuncture. They are also vital for sustaining higher medium-term growth rates not only from a demand perspective but also from the salutary effect they would have on relieving infrastructure bottlenecks, and raising total factor productivity. Thailand’s fiscal position has ample space to accommodate spending plans for these projects, and their accelerated implementation should be a priority. 27.      The BOT can keep its policy rate on hold for now, and adjust it in response to evolving conditions and prospects. The lagged effects of the rate cuts over 2007, improvements in the consumer and investor sentiment, and the supportive stance of fiscal policy should provide an adequate boost to activity for now. The BOT can revisit the stance of monetary policy on an ongoing basis in response to developments in global oil prices, their expected impact on domestic inflation, as well as evolving domestic demand conditions, while placing the inflation targeting framework on a primary footing to maintain its hard-earned credibility.
