EXECUTIVESUMMARY 1. Maldives has taken great economic strides over the last two decades, including an impressive improvement in social indicators. Tourism and associated sectors, such as construction and transport, have been the main engines of growth. Over this period, Maldives has at times suffered from both external shocks and domestic policy imbalances. 2. In concluding the 1997 Article IV consultation Executive Directors commended prudent macroeconomic policies that had substantially lowered inflation while sustaining growth. Directors, however, underscored the need for further fiscal consolidation in light of the projected decline in concessional external assistance and continued vulnerability to external shocks. They emphasized the need for careful monitoring of indicators of external balance and competitiveness. Directors also urged the authorities to implement structural reform aimed at strengthening private sector activity. 3. Macroeconomic developments since the last consultation have been generally favorable. The impact of the Asian crisis has been minimal, with annual growth continuing in the 6-7 percent range and inflation remaining subdued. Official reserves have risen to about 5 months of import coverage. 4. However, there are indications of emerging macroeconomic imbalances. In particular, the fiscal deficit has widened, leading to a sharp increase in domestic credit. There are also signs of tension in the foreign exchange market. 5. The authorities agree that reversing the recent fiscal deterioration is key in restoring macroeconomic stability. Action needs to be taken to contain the overall deficit in 1999 to no more than the available foreign financing (4 percent of GDP) to avoid monetization. 6. Beyond the immediate imbalances, there is a need to strengthen the revenue system and gradually move towards indirect monetary controls. The authorities agree with these priorities but are concerned about their limited administrative capacity to implement these reforms. Reducing public sector debt through further fiscal consolidation would also be necessary over the medium-term, especially in light of the expected decline in concessional financing. 7. There has been some progress in the structural reform area but further efforts are needed. The initiatives to improve the performance of state enterprises, upgrade the legal framework, and strengthen banking supervision are welcome. Further efforts are needed to eliminate the monopolistic activities of the state enterprises, and increase their private ownership. The legal framework also needs to be strengthened by introducing a bankruptcy law and legislation to allow private ownership and the sale of land.

Rapid economic development took off in the Maldives in the second half of the 1970s with the advent of tourism and the commercialization of fisheries. During the 198Os, annual GDP growth averaged around 10 percent. Growth has continued in the 6- 7 percent range in the 199Os, ____ helped by the continued I cwmnraicRoin0ysmaal~ 155ase expansion of tourism, as well as @llIillbdlW~ i by flexible macroeconomic j ml policies that contained fiscal and I :z external imbalances (Box 1, ’ Em Charts l-3 and Table 1). The steady increase in tourist arrivals i ‘z ;m has broadened the growth ;4cn momentum to include ancillary im 1 o construction, transportation, and ; distribution activities. Although / WXIiXYeS the fisheries sector has not kept pace with tourism, it continues to be of vital importance to the economy, employing over one quarter of the labor force. Recently, the prospects for the fisheries sector have been boosted by the employment of larger and more powerful vessels, as well as by the relaxation of state export monopolies. Box 1. Maldives-s and Adjustment in the Early 1990s . In the early 199Os, both external and domestic factors contributed to the emergence of major macroeconomic imbalances. Key external factors were falling international tuna prices, the Gulf War, and the recession in Europe (whose nationals account for about two-thirds of tourist arrivals in the Maldives). On the domestic front, the overall fiscal deficit (including grants) widened to over 17 percent of GDP in 1993. . This deficit was largely financed through domestic borrowing, principally from the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), which led to an expansion of domestic credit by more than 50 percent and an acceleration of consumer price inflation to 20 percent. The current account deficit rose to almost 25 percent of GDP in 1993 and gross official reserves fell to less than 2 months of import cover. . Beginning in 1994, the authorities responded to these imbalances with a fiscal adjustment program, a fixed exchange rate policy, and some monetary tightening. Against a background of robust tourism, these policies led to a swift narrowing of the overall fiscal deficit to 2 percent of GDP, a sharp deceleration in inflation and an increase in the import cover of the official reserves to nearly 4 months. The government was also able to make some repayments on the debt accumulated with the MMA. . This success enabled the authorities to ease restrictive monetary controls, including through the liberalization of interest rates on U.S. dollar deposits and loans and the partial liberalization of interest rates on rufivaa denosits and loans.

The strong macroeconomic performance of the past quarter century has facilitated an impressive improvement in social indicators (Annex IV). Per capita GDP has increased four-fold since 1980; almost the entire population is now literate; improved healthcare has halved infant , mortality and raised life expectancy Gwpz~ida(l~-Ial) by 20 years; and the birth rate, though still high, has declined steadily. uo~_--__-~-_____----------~-- _ --_---i 10. Despite these achievements, significant challenges remain. The population ;ff ~~~ : - - growth rate (almost 3 percent per I year) remains high, putting pressure 1 g g f g g $j E f 3 C g F$ $j E f $ $j f E , Ynr , ._ on scarce island resources, such as freshwater and land, and contributing to rising pollution.’ Education and health facilities need to be upgraded, particularly in the outer atolls. A number of rigidities also need to be addressed for sustainable growth to be maintained. There is fiscal weakness associated with a narrow revenue base and rising current expenditure. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) dominate most commercial activities. The banking sector consists of state-owned banks operating in a rigid monetary environment (with bank specific credit ceilings, a 35 percent reserve requirement, and interest rate controls).* The virtual absence of private land ownership and restrictions on leases, have prevented the development of a market for land, Maldives’ most scarce resource. In addition, the legal environment needs to be enhanced to be more supportive of private sector activity. B. Recent Developments 11. The Maldivian economy has not been appreciably affected by the Asian crisis. Provisional estimates point to GDP growth of about 7 percent in both 1998 and 1999. Tourist arrivals continued to grow strongly (8 percent in 1998 and 12 percent during January-August 1999), and the fish catch increased substantially (10 percent in 1998 and 20 percent during the first eight months of 1999). Construction activity was also strong in 1998, but the pace of growth is expected to have moderated in 1999. Consumer prices fell by some 1 ‘/z percent in 1998 due to the lagged effect of the substantial appreciation of the real effective exchange rate during 1997 (Chart 4). The latter largely reflected the depreciation of the currencies of Asian trading partners against the U.S. dollar. However, with the effects of the 1997 real appreciation diminishing, consumer prices have again begun to inch upwards. In June 1999, I Global warming and the associated rise in the sea level also present significant, and potentially devastating, risks. Almost all land in Maldives is less than 3 meters above sea level, and, under certain scenarios, could be flooded by the middle of the next century. 2 One is Maldivian (75 percent owned by the public sector); the other three are state-owned banks from India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.

On average, consumer prices are expected to rise by about 3 percent between 1998 and 1999. 12. Despite these favorable developments, there are indications of emerging macroeconomic imbalances. The current account has seen a sharp deterioration from a surplus of 1% percent of GDP in 1996 to deficits of 10% percent in 1997, and 8 percent in 1998 (Table 2). Imports surged in 1997 and 1998, no doubt helped by the strength of the rufiyaa, and by rising investment in the tourism and fisheries sectors. The increase in receipts from tourism, although substantial, was insufficient to offset the increase in imports (Box 2). With both imports and tourism investment remaining buoyant during the first half of 1999, the current account is not expected to narrow in 1999. The deterioration in the current account since 1997 has been more than offset by additional capital inflows. By mid-1999 official reserves covered 5 months of imports and substantially above short-term liabilities. Box 2. Maldives: Goods Deficit, Services Surplus The Maldivian economy is very open, with the sum of merchandise exports and imports well over 100 percent of GDP. Another interesting feature of the Maldivian external accounts is their structure, in which the balance of trade in goods is in large deficit while the nonfactor services balance shows a commensurate surplus, leading to a current account deficit that has been manageable. It is, of course, the tourism sector that accounts for this phenomenon. External Balances 1994 1995 1996 1997 (percent of GDP) 1998 Trade balance, goods -49.6 -55.7 -61.2 -62.7 -58.4 Nonfactor services balance 55.9 57.6 66.3 63.1 63.0 Current balance -4.6 -6.7 -2.5 -11.5 -6.9 On the goods side, the import dependence of the economy is reflected both in the level of imports (of the same order of magnitude as GDP) and their variety, evenly divided between consumer products (including food stuffs) and investment goods; supplies for the tourism sector are included in both categories. On the other hand, exports (mainly of marine products) amount to only one third of imports. On the nonfactor services side, gross receipts from the tourism sector to a significant extent match the level of goods imports, far exceeding gross outlays on nonfactor services, thus giving the large surplus on trade in nonfactor services. In fact (as the tabulation shows) the surplus in nonfactor services is more than sufficient to offset the deficit in trade in goods; were it not for substantial interest payments and profit remittances abroad, the current account balance would be in surplus rather than deficit. The tourism industry operates at the high-quality end of the international market and is not very price sensitive. Data collected by Maldivian tourist operators suggest that the cost of tour packages to Maldives is on par with Mauritius but substantially higher than to destinations such as Thailand, Goa, Sri Lanka ,and Mexico; yet tourist arrivals have continued to grow strongly. One implication of the structure of the external accounts is that a number of frequently used indicators of competitiveness, including measures of the real exchange rate, that use trade-weights from goods trade or cost developments in goods sectors, may have limited relevance when gauging changes in the cost competitiveness of the Maldivian economy.

While the 1998 budget targeted an overall deficit (including grants) of 2 percent of GDP, unchanged from 1997, the outturn was much larger at 5% percent of GDP. Particularly worrisome were overruns in current expenditures which accounted for about one-half of the excess deficit (Table 3).3 The deficit, however, was almost fully foreign financed.4 The 1999 Budget aims to narrow the deficit by about 1 percentage point to 4% percent of GDP. However, achieving this target will be a major challenge. First, credit to the government in the first half of the year had already increased sharply (5 percent of GDP).’ Second, subsequent to the Parliamentary passage of the 1999 Budget, the authorities decided to increase public sector wages by a sizable amount (35 percent on average) effective August 1 in order to reduce the private-public sector wage differential. In the absence of corrective measures, this increase will add about 1 percent of GDP to the deficit in 1999, bringing the deficit target for 1999 to 5% percent of GDP.6 14. Credit developments also confirm demand pressures. The annual growth rate of domestic credit has risen steadily from under 10 percent at end-1997 to some 26 percent by June 1999 (Table 4). For most of 1998, the rate of increase in overah domestic credit was held in check by a decline in net credit to government, as foreign financing was more than sufficient to cover the budget deficit. This allowed room for an increase in private credit. However, since the last quarter of 1998, credit to government has been increasing sharply, leading to the high rate of increase in domestic credit despite a slowdown in the rate of credit to the private sector. 15. With the rapid expansion of domestic credit, tensions also appear to be emerging in the foreign exchange market. Market participants complain of delays in obtaining foreign exchange, although these difficulties do not yet appear to impede current international payments. Despite the favorable increasing reserves, the MMA intervention was limited to sales through post office counters, with no transactions with banks. The banks in turn ran down their foreign assets to meet the increase in foreign currency demand. 16. Efforts have been made to improve the financial performance and operational efficiency of a number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These include recruitment of professional managers who are given autonomy in running the companies, as well as enhanced MOF monitoring through a specialized unit. The main exception to this improving 3 Revenues were about % percent of GDP less than budgeted; grants also fell short by ‘/z percent of GDP; and capital expenditures exceeded the budgeted amount by some % percent of GDP. 4 The original intention had been to over-financed the deficit from external resources and repay some of the outstanding liabilities of the government to the MMA. 5 This may be partly seasonal because SOE profits are transferred to the budget in the second half of the year. 6 The full-year cost of the wage increase is estimated at about 2 percent of GDP.

The maintenance of the floor price on the purchase of fish by MIFCO-despite the sharp drop in world fish prices-as well as the inefficient management of its export monopoly activities (freezing and canning operations), is leading to large losses. III. F&PORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS The discussions focused on three areas: (i), the design of a policy package to address emerging macroeconomic imbalances; (ii) a strategy for structural and institutional reform aimed at unleashing the potential of the private sector and maintaining the momentum of growth; and (iii) development of a medium-term j?amework offiscal consolidation. A. Fiscal Policy 17. The team expressed concern about the deterioration of the fiscal position in 1998. While sharing this concern, the authorities pointed to a number of special factors including the enhancement of social services. Current expenditures had been higher than budgeted because teachers and nursing staff had been hired and relocated to upgrade education and health services in outer atolls. The authorities noted that expenditure on health and education had risen by some 2% percent of GDP over the last two years, helping to alleviate poverty. The overrun in capital expenditure in 1998 had been due to the purchase of coast guard boats to protect fishing zones. The staff welcomed the emphasis on enhancing social services but expressed concern that current expenditures had risen from 26 percent of GDP in 1993 to 31 percent in 1998. There was clearly a need to prioritize expenditures. 18. The team urged the authorities to avoid monetization of the deficit in 1999. The authorities agreed that it would be highly desirable to limit the overall deficit in 1999 to no more than the available foreign financing of 4 percent of GDP-as envisaged in the Budget7 However, even in the absence of any expenditure overruns, this required additional measures amounting to 1 percent of GDP to offset the impact of the wage increase. The authorities thought that they could postpone a number of construction projects in Male that were not urgent, freeze operational and maintenance expenditure, and cut administrative expenditure to achieve the original deficit target. They were also confident that the profit transfer from SOEs was likely to be larger than budgeted, reversing the increase in credit to government in the first half of the year, The staff cautioned against any build up in arrears and urged the authorities to adopt a more systematic reduction in current expenditures within a medium- term fmrnework. The authorities agreed to consider the staffs suggestion to pay the wage increase into a provident fund to limit the deterioration in the saving-investment balance. 19. In view of the expected decline in grants, the team emphasized the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation.’ The team suggested that the overall deficit be 7 There is no legislative framework for the issuance of treasury bonds. * Grants amounted to 3% percent of GDP in 1998, down from 4% percent in 1997 and 6 percent in earlier years. The UN’s Committee on Development Policy has recommended that Maldives be graduated from the group of least developed countries by 2000. Thereafter, (continued. . .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - gradually eliminated by the year 2002-m a multi-year budgetary framework-to prepare for lower grants and facilitate a decline in the public debt ratio over time.’ This objective was less ambitious that the authorities’ 1997 Development Plan but was realistic given recent trends. The team suggested that current spending, especially on general administration, public order, and internal security (which had increased sharply to the same level as spending on social services), bear the brunt of the adjustment. The team’s medium-term scenario (see below) indicated that such a program would require cutting expenditures by about 5 percent of GDP over the next three years, The authorities agreed with the target of overall balance by 2002, but questioned whether it would be feasible solely through cuts in current expenditure. 20. In this context, the team underlined the importance of strengthening the government’s revenue base. Currently non-tax revenue (including grants, resort island rental fees, and SOE profits) comprises the bulk of revenue, while most tax revenue is collected through import duties and a flat tourism tax. Fund technical assistance missions have argued that a revenue system consisting of more broadly-based taxes (e.g., a general goods and services tax and a corporate income tax) would be more resilient than the current system in the face of domestic and external shocks. The implementation of a corporate income tax would also represent a necessary step towards the eventual privatization of the SOEs. The authorities agreed with thrust of these arguments but they expressed reservations about introducing a sales tax or an ad valorem tourism tax because they required a more sophisticated tax administration regime. However, they agreed to seek technical assistance regarding the implementation of these ideas. B. Monetary Policy 21. The team expressed concern about the rapid expansion of domestic credit, and the associated strong demand for foreign exchange. Indeed, the bank-specific credit ceilings that had been observed for the first half of 1999, had been set assuming no expansion of net credit to the government, Given the fiscal outcome during the first six months of the year, total credit targets were being exceeded. The authorities agreed that within the framework of a fixed exchange rate and direct monetary control, the best policy alternative was fiscal tightening. Pending this, the authorities thought that the existing six-monthly credit ceilings may have to be tightened, and monitored more frequently. 22. Looking beyond the immediate problems, the team encouraged the authorities to move gradually towards market-based monetary arrangements, in line with recommendations of earlier Fund technical assistance. The authorities emphasized that the MMA had already taken some steps towards this, notably by the increased use of certificates Maldives would no longer qualify for most concessional aid. The authorities have argued that Maldives be treated as a “special case” and have found a sympathetic audience; the World Bank, for example, has extended Maldives ’ “small island economy extension” under IDA 11, thus assuring continued access to concessional assistance from this source. 9 The domestic and external debt of the public sector stands at about 80 percent of GDP, with three-quarters of this amount being external debt, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- of deposit in liquidity management. The team urged the authorities to take additional steps to develop a domestic money market by liberalizing rufiyaa interest rates, and substituting market operations in certificates of deposit (and possibly some type of treasury bill) for high reserve requirements and credit ceilings. As a preliminary step, the team proposed the removal of the 7 percent maximum spread between the rufiyaa deposit and lending rates. The authorities concurred with the desirability of indirect monetary controls but, given Maldives’ limited administrative capacity, expressed skepticism about the feasibility of the proposed reforms without substantial technical assistance. AsDB and World Bank staff expressed willingness to consider financing technical assistance in this area. C. Exchange Rate Policy and Tariff Regime 23. The team expressed concern that fiscal expansion was likely to put the current exchange rate level under strain.” The staff and the authorities agreed that the current level of the exchange rate did not appear to impede competitiveness. However, private and public enterprise complaints regarding delays in obtaining foreign exchange were worrisome.’ ’ The staff recalled earlier episodes when such delays had led to serious distortions in the operation of the foreign exchange market and undermined policy credibility.‘* The authorities agreed that it was essential for the market to clear at the fixed exchange rate. To achieve this, and given their ample resources, they intended to ensure that the net position of the commercial banks was cleared every day. They acknowledged that, as in the past, market tensions reinforced the need for tightening financial policies, especially in view of the high degree of dollarization (Box 3)13. The authorities agreed to consider accepting the obligations of Article VIII as a confirmation of their intention to ensure that all international payments are promptly satisfied. I I Tari*Anid%pnrtbKl599 24. The team and the authorities agreed that a fundamental reform of the exchange rate system was not warranted. A move towards a more flexible system would be hampered by the absence of money and foreign exchange markets.

I3 Dollarization ratio during the first half of 1999 declined but this was mainly due to an acceleration of monetary growth rather than decline in dollar deposits. This ratio also does not take into account foreign currency notes in circulation.

With tourism and fisheries subject to potentially large shocks, giving up the possibility of an exchange rate adjustment could be costly in the long run. The team discussed the choice of the exchange rate peg. Given the reliance of Maldives on European tourists, the Euro may be a more appropriate peg than the U.S. dollar. The authorities felt that it was too early to consider such a change but that this issue could be reconsidered in the future. Box 3. Dollarization-Causes and Consequences Dollarization has remained high in the Maldives despite recent macroeconomic stability. Maldives has seen an increasing share of its financial assets held in foreign currency &posit (FCD) over the last few years. This practice, also known as dollarization, has been on the rise even in the face of modest inflation and a fixed exchange rate. 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Share of FCD in broad money (percent) ’ 19 27 30 34 39 44 46 A number of factors account for the upward trend in dollarization, including: . Two episodes of fiscal and monetary instability in 1987 and 1993. While the first eventually led to a devaluation, the second caused heightened pressure on the exchange rate. Given that the administered yield on the dollar and rufiyaa deposits was the same, the devaluation pressures made the holding of dollars more attractive. The jump in dollarization during these episodes was not reversed, suggesting some inertia or hysteresis.2 . A distorted interest rate regime: Since 1995, when interest rates on dollar denominated deposits were liberalized, their yields have been higher than those on rutiyaa deposits, encouraging savers to substitute their assets into FCD holdings. l Specific institutional settings: Maldivians can freely purchase dollars for either current or capital transactions. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the holding of foreign currency deposits. These institutional factors, together with restricted investment opportunities, have encouraged the holding of interest bearing dollar deposits. . Booming tourist activity: Despite rufiyaa being the only legal tender for domestic transactions, transfers and possession of foreign currency is permissible. Tourism resorts outside Male quote prices and accept payments in US dollars. Furthermore, the government itself requires that resort taxes and transfers from public enterprises that receive their earnings in foreign exchange, be paid in US dollars. Thus in practice, the U.S. dollar is used as a medium of exchange for many domestic transactions, thereby contributing to dollarization. The extensive dollarization of the Maidivian economy would likely lessen the impact of a devaluation aimed at restructuring external balance after a period of potential disequilibrium for two reasons. First, the impact on imports would be smaller because the wealth effect from the devaluation would be more limited. Second, the boost to external competitiveness would also be smaller because most costs (including for expatriate labor) of the tourism sector are denominated in foreign currency. ‘This measure of dollarization captures the use of foreign currency both as a means of exchange (currency substitution) and as a store of value (asset substitution). ’ Sahay, R. and Carlos A. Vegh (1995), “Dollarization in Transition Economies: Evidence and Policy Implications,” IMF WP/95/96. Hysteresis is often explained by substantial costs associated with the process of currency substitution. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- 25. The tariff regime in Maldives is aimed primarily at raising revenue, rather than protection of trade (Box 4). The establishment of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) would necessitate a radical change in the trade regime. However, the authorities indicated that they did not expect to see SAFTA emerge until 2005-2010 at the earliest, giving them ample time to reform the tariff regime. D. Medium-Term Prospects 26. The staff’s medium-term scenario suggests that Maldives can maintain a growth rate of about 6 percent. Full details are provided in Table 6; however, the scenario is based on three crucial assumptions. First, it is assumed that with the opening of new resorts, tourists arrivals will continue to Box 4. Tariff Regime Since 1994, tariff rates range from zero for staple food items (rice, flour and sugar) to 100-200 percent for cars and motor-cycles; most other goods are taxed at rates between 10 and 50 percent. The staff estimates the simple tariff average to be in the 20-25 percent range. Exemptions from duties granted by presidential degree are extensive, especially for investment goods used by the tourism and fishery sectors. Exemptions are estimated to have reduced tariff revenue by about 30 percent in 1998. The ratio of tariff revenue over the customs value of imports has been in the range of 13- 14 percent since 1994. Maldives applies moderate nontariff barriers. State-trading organizations enjoy a virtual monopoly import of rice, sugar and flour, although a limited number of import licenses are awarded to private importers. The dried tuna export monopoly of the Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company (MIFCO) was abolished in 1990 and since 1996 the private sector has also been allowed to export fresh tuna. Taking account of both tariff and nontariff barriers, Maldives’ ranking on the Fund’s ten point index of overall trade restrictiveness is 7. grow at rates close to those seen in the last few years. Second, the scenario is based on an increase in the fish catch of about one-third, as bigger and better boats are brought into service. Third, it is based on the implementation of a comprehensive package of structural reforms (see below) to release the full potential of the private sector and enable broad-based economic development. In the projection, the current account deficit narrows gradually in relation to GDP, to 4% percent in 2004, and CPI inflation is expected to stabilize at around 3 percent per annum. The authorities indicated that, in the absence of any external shocks, this scenario represented, in their view, a broadly realistic picture of economic prospects for Maldives over the medium term. E. Structural Policies 27. The team noted that although the financial control and management of many SOEs had improved, there was need for further reform. First, there was urgent need to devise a strategy to improve the performance of MIPCO. Second, in view of the increasing maturitv of the mivate sector. it was time to graduallv dismantle the exnort and import Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public17- . monopolies of MIFCO and the State Trading Organization (STO). Third, ST0 and the Maldives Transport and Construction Company (MTCC) were active in areas that could be left to the private sector. At the very least, it was essential to remove the implicit subsidy enjoyed by SOEs through their rent free use of state property. Finally, the team urged the authorities to intensify efforts to privatize SOEs, which could help facilitate the development of an over-the-counter share market. The authorities agreed with many of these objectives but thought that privatization should be considered as a medium-term objective and take place concurrently with fiscal reform, given the budget’s reliance on SOE profit transfers. A number of these issues were to be addressed in the context of forthcoming World Bank loans. 28. The staff expressed concern that the lack of private property rights had prevented the development of a market for the most scarce resource in Maldives. The authorities indicated that a draft Land Act had been prepared to introduce private property rights, allow the sale of land, and facilitate the use of land and real estate as collateral. The team also welcomed the recent passage of a new Companies Act, a new Shipping Act, and a new Tourism Act as steps towards enhancing the legal framework and eliminating legal uncertainties. The authorities agreed that a further upgrade of the legal system was, however, needed; the Foreign Investment Law had to be revised in order to clearly define incentives and safeguards provided to investors, and bankruptcy and foreclosure laws were needed to strengthen the business environment. * 4 29. The staff commended MMA’s efforts to strengthen bank supervision. Capital adequacy requirements, the definition of nonperforming loans, and income recognition rules were in line with international standards (Box 5). However, the team noted that classification and provisioning rules were still somewhat more relaxed than the international norm and urged the authorities to reinforce them. F. Statistical and Y2K Issues 30. The authorities recognize the rudimentary nature of the national accounts statistics. A project is underway (with assistance from AsDB) to greatly improve the preparation of national accounts (Annex V). The ultimate goal of this project is the phased adoption of the UN’s revised 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). The first results from this project are expected in late 2000. The lag in the publication of the CPI has recently been,shortened considerably. However, the lack of sufficiently detailed and timely budget data hampers a proper analysis of the fiscal situation. Moreover, the interpretation of balance of payments statistics is complicated by the poor quality of the data on merchandise imports and private investment flows. I4 The new Tourism Act increased the length of resort leases from 21 to 25 years. This is still-- widely viewed as inadequate within the industry.

Upgrading Banking Supervision Over the last two years, the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), with technical assistance from the AsDB, has taken a number of key steps in upgrading banking supervision: . Capital adequacy requirement: All commercial banks have to maintain at all times, a capital adequacy ratio of at least 8 percent of risk-weighted assets, as defmed by the Basle Accord of 1987. . Definition of nonperforming loans: All accounts on which interest or principal due have not been received for three months or more from the due date are recorded as nonperforming. Despite this strict definition, the level of nonperforming loans is very low. The average for the banking system is 6 percent of total assets and the highest ratio among banks is 11 percent. . Income recognition: Banks are prohibited from accruing interest on any loan that is classified as nonperforming. In addition, banks cannot accrue interest on an account that is not yet nonperforming but for which uncertainties have arisen about the borrower’s ability to meet repayment obligations. Once a credit has been classified as nonaccruing, all accrued but uncollected interest has to be reversed. . MMA loan classification and provisioning rules: The MMA rules require that al1 loans and advances be classified into five categories (see table below). The classification is done using both qualitative criteria, such as the financial strength of the borrower, and information on the length of time that a loan has been overdue. No allowance is made for the value of the collateral, and specific provisioning for loans classified as special mention or worse cannot be considered as a capital account reserve. The level of provisioning is shown in the following table. CLASSIFICATION Pass Special mention Substandard Doubtful Loss LEVEL OF PROVISION At least 1% At least 5% IO-20% 35-50% 100% or write-off MONTHS PAST DUE -- 3-6 months 6- 12 months 12-24 months over 24 months . Tax deductibility of provisioning: Provisioning up to 5 percent of total assets is tax deductible. 31. On the whole, it does not appear that Maldives is likely to experience extensive disruptions as a result of the Y2K problem. One potential problem is customs administration which operates on somewhat dated computer technology. Therefore, delays may occur in customs processing and clearance, though the authorities were trying to minimize any problems.

The improvement in key economic and social indicators over the last two decades, and particularly since the crisis of the early 199Os, is testimony to the authorities’ successful conduct of macroeconomic policy. Since the last Article IV consultation, growth has continued to be strong, and inflation has remained subdued. The current account deficit has also been more than offset by capital inflows, enabling a build up in official reserves. However, sustaining this impressive record would require effective handling of the emerging imbalances. The sharp deterioration in the fiscal position lies at the heart of the current difficulties. The situation is exacerbated by the authorities’ recent decision to increase public sector wages substantially. The monetization of the deficit and the rapid expansion of domestic credit, have contributed to tensions in the foreign exchange market. 33. Reversing the recent fiscal deterioration is key to restoring macroeconomic stability. Since the crisis of the early 199Os, fiscal consolidation has been critical in achieving macroeconomic adjustment and reduced external vulnerability. Action needs to be taken to contain the overall deficit in 1999 to no more than the available foreign financing of 4 percent of GDP to avoid monetization. To limit the adverse impact of the wage increase, the government should pay at least part of the increase into a provident fund. In the absence of fiscal consolidation, the authorities would have to resort to the undesirable alternative of curtailing the growth of credit to the private sector, thereby adversely affecting growth prospects. 34. The fiscal adjustment needs to be put in a multi-year budgetary framework, particularly in view of the expected decline in concessional assistance. The staff believes that it would be appropriate to aim to eliminate the overall fiscal deficit by 2002 principally by cuts in current spending while safeguarding spending on education and healthcare. This would allow the large public sector debt to decline. Strengthening the revenue system, through the introduction of broad-based taxes, such as sales tax or corporate income tax, in lieu of custom duties and the tourism tax, would also reduce the vulnerability of the budget to domestic and external shocks, and facilitate tariff reform. However, the authorities may need technical assistance to implement these reforms. 35. The fixed exchange rate regime has served Maldives well but the emerging pressures could test the exchange rate level. Importers’ complaints about delays in obtaining foreign exchange indicate an inadequate handling of the fixed exchange rate regime by the authorities. The MMA must ensure that all bona fide requests for foreign exchange are fulfilled. However, intervention to maintain the current exchange rate is unlikely to succeed without a tightening of financial policies. Acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII would also send a very positive message, and underline the authorities commitment to ensuring the proper functioning of the foreign exchange market. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - 36. Even within the fixed exchange rate regime, there is considerable scope to improve monetary management. Direct monetary controls have generated serious distortions. The excessive reserve requirement pushes up the banks’ interest rate margins and acts as a de facto tax on investment. Credit ceilings, and limits on interest rate margins, have led to rigid interest rates and the inefficient allocation of credit. It would be desirable to move gradually towards market-based monetary arrangements along the lines suggested by earlier Fund technical assistance missions. Initial steps could include the expansion of the MMA certificates of deposit to eliminate excess liquidity and generate competition for rufiyaa deposits. Concurrently, interest rate controls could be removed to pave the way for the gradual elimination of credit ceilings. 37. The broader structural reform agenda for the Maldives remains extensive. Export and import monopolies have to be eliminated to enhance competition and private sector activity. SOEs must also start paying rent, and efforts to increase private ownership of SOEs have to be intensified. Recent initiatives to strengthen the legal framework are welcome but need to go further. The priorities are the enactment of bankruptcy and foreclosure legislation, and amendments to the foreign investment law to clarify the rights of investors. A new land law that facilitates private ownership and the development of a market in land is also essential. The efforts to strengthen banking supervision are commendable; however, loan classification and provisioning rules can be strengthened tirther. 38. Progress has been made to upgrade the provision of macroeconomic data, but further efforts in this area are needed to facilitate effective surveillance. The priorities are completing the national accounts project, collecting high frequency fiscal data for budgetary control, and improving the balance of payments statistics. 39. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard IZmonth cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - Table 1.

Exchange Arrangements From March 1,1982 to June 30,1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa was pegged to the U.S. dollar. Beginning in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a trade- weighted basket of currencies, but the exchange rate vis-&vis the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable until February 1987. On March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was devalued by 29 percent vis-&is the U.S. dollar. From 1987 to 1994, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was adjusted periodically in line with market forces. However, since October 1994, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa has remained unchanged at Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar. Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of Article XIV, but no longer maintains restrictions under Article XIV. VI.

Three fisheries projects were fully disbursed and completed. The first education and training project closed in December 1995. Building on this experience, a second education and training project was approved in April 1995. This project focuses on strengthening primary teacher training programs, establishing an in-country junior secondary teacher training program, and increasing secondary school access in the remote islands. An airport upgrading project that rehabilitated Male’s airport facilities and provided training to its staff was completed in December 1994. Between 1994-97, Maldives also received a $243,000 IDF grant to strengthen the Public Enterprise Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and to design a public enterprise restructuring program. The current country assistance strategy (CAS) calls for preparation or cofinancing of one project every three to four years. Under this strategy, a third education and training program is under preparation. A country economic memorandum (CEM) was issued on April 19, 1999, on which a new CAS will be based. The new CAS is likely to be more comprehensive than the current one. A public expenditure review might be initiated in the first half of 2000. ‘Prepared by World Bank staff.

However, problems with the compilation and reporting of basic economic data remain, especially with respect to national accounts. Improvement in national accounts and balance of payments statistics will be aided by the enactment of statistical legislation. The main official statistical publication is the Statistical Year Book of Maldives for which the latest version is 1998. APD also receives, albeit with a lag, the Quarterly Economic Bulletin and the Annual Report of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Quarterly FiscaE Report from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. National Accounts Only rudimentary production-side national accounts are currently available. The Asian Development Bank is assisting the authorities in setting up a ii-amework for compiling more comprehensive national accounts. Results from this work should begin to be seen in 2000 or 2001. CPI The publication of a CPI was discontinued by the authorities in 1994 because of outdated weights, data inconsistencies and compilation difficulties. In response, a STA expert visited Male in May 1995 to help construct a new CPI series based on a 1993 income and expenditure survey, and to develop new price collection procedures. A new CPI hasbeen compiled since June 1995, which incorporates more stringent data collection procedures. A STA consumer price statistics mission of August 1996 recommended that the authorities develop additional price indices for a more comprehensive analysis of inflation. Government finance The authorities resumed regular reporting of data for publication in the GFS Yearbook in 1996 and the latest published data are for 1997. The latest summary data provided by the Maldives Monetary Authority for publication in IFS pertain to 1998. Balance of payments Following the STA mission of February 1994, a number of measures were taken to improve data coverage and quality for the balance of payments. However, problems of coverage and timing remain with regard to imports of ships and aircraft. Travel receipts are still estimated on the basis of a small-sample inquiry of resorts/hotels made in February 1994 to determine daily average expenditure by tourists. Estimates of profit remittances and reinvested earnings in the tourism sector are still unsatisfactory.

Monetary data are reported to STA irregularly in bunches covering several months.
