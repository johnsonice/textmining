Reserves are comfortable, the current account deficit is small, exports are growing rapidly, and the exchange rate is competitive. l However, inflation has been in double digits for much of the past year, reflecting strong domestic demand and easier monetary conditions associated with heavy capital inflows. Only recently has inflation come down as monetary conditions have been tightened. Interest rates have risen significantly, although levels are not high in real terms by international comparisons. l Insufficient progress toward fiscal adjustment has contributed to these strains. Although there has been some adjustment at the central government level, the states' finances have deteriorated and the consolidated public sector deficit remains at 10 l/2 percent of GDP, close to its 1990/91 level. .

Introduction India has made substantial progress in the past four years toward reforming its economy, and the benefits are being seen in the form of a robust economic expansion and a strong external position. Nonetheless, the public sector deficit remains too high and the reform program has not pro- gressed far enough to provide the basis for sustained rapid growth. More- over, inflationary pressures have re-emerged. The immediate scope for major policy initiatives is, however, limited by the difficult political situation and the prospect of general elections by June 1996. Against this background, the consultation discussions concentrated on the policies required in the period leading up to general elections to maintain macroeconomic stability and confidence in the reform program. u The central policy concern for the government is to ensure a durable turn- around in inflation without choking off growth, and the report focusses on this issue. The report also considers the policy response to potentially volatile capital movements, which has emerged as an issue with the increas- ing openness of the Indian economy, and the steps that could be taken in the year ahead to maintain the momentum of structural reforms. A final section deals with Fund-related issues, in particular India's commitments under Article VIII. The staff report for the 1994 Article IV consultation was discussed by the Executive Board on April 1, 1994 (EBS/94/16, plus Supplement). At that time Executive Directors underscored the need for continued fiscal consolida- tion and structural reform. While the scope for immediate action is limited, medium-term fiscal consolidation and the completion of the struc- tural reform process remain the two fundamental issues of Indian economic policy--they are critical to securing a lasting reduction in inflation while providing the basis for sustained rapid growth. This report briefly revisits the issue of medium-term fiscal consolidation. w Since the conclusion of the recent stand-by arrangement, the Indian authorities have continued to report an extensive set of core data to the u The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions took place in Bombay and Delhi during March 30-April 7, 1995. The mission met with the Reserve Bank Governor, the Finance Secretary, the Chief Economic Advisor, and other senior officials. The mission team consisted of H. Neiss (head), C. Collyns, A. Chopra, M. Ishihara, W. Chu, K. Parker, 0. Fratzscher (all CTA), and 0. Goodger (CTA--AA). The mission was assisted by R. Hemming and U. Pate1 (Resident Representatives). Mr. Geethakrishnan, Executive Director for India, participated in the discussions. u The medium-term fiscal outlook and the unfinished agenda for struc- tural reform are discussed in detail in the background paper. The back- ground paper also provides a discussion of the medium-term balance of pay- ments outlook, a comprehensive set of statistical tables, and the usual annexes to the staff report.

Much of this information is also made publicly available on a timely basis, with fiscal data again being an important exception. Statistical information is generally of good quality, but there are weaknesses in a number of areas, including the information on economic activity, the public sector outside the central.government, and the balance of payments. lJ II. Current Settinrg 0 Difficult political situation. The ruling Congress Party has been weakened by defeats in recent state elections and by internal dissension. General elections are due by mid-1996. Although most rival parties are perceived as pro-reform, prospects for obtaining consensus on major policy initiatives is limited in the pre-elecrion period. a Recovery firmly established. Real GDP increased by around 5 l/2 percent in 1994/95, 2J driven by a recovery of private investment and continued buoyant export growth (Table 1). The pickup in economic activity owed in part to the demand stimulus arising from a widening of the fiscal deficit in 1993/94 and a surge Iof private portfolio inflows starting in the latter part of that year. The strength of the expansion has also reflected a gathering supply response to the elimination of industrial licensing requirements, import liberalization, and other reform measures. Agricultural production benefitted fro.m a fifth consecutive good monsoon, and food stocks have risen to record levels. External position strong. Gross international reserves rose $6 billion in 1994/95 to almost $21 billion (eight months of imports) at end-March 1995, largely due to heavy foreign exchange purchases by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the first half of 1994/95 to prevent an appreciation of the rupee in the face of continued capital inflows. Since October 1994, however, such inflows have diminished, owing to steps by the Government to moderate the inflows as well as less favorable international conditions (Box 1). The (current account deficit widened modestly in 1994/95, but remained small at around l/2 percent of GDP. Rapid growth of non-oil imports related t'o the buoyancy of domestic demand was largely offset by strong export growth and an increase in private transfers. The exchange rate has continued to be broadly competitive, despite the 1;/ The annex on statistical issues in the background paper contains further details. 2J The fiscal year runs April l-March 3'1.

Responding to a Surge in Capital Mows Starting in November 1993, India experienced a surge in private portfolio investment, both through purchases by approved institutional investors on local exchanges and through issues of Global Depository Receipts (or GDRs, an equity-based instrument backed by shares held in trust) on international markets. Total flows over the year through October 1994 amounted to over $7 billion. While the magnitude in relation to GDP was not as large as in some other coimtries, the flows added considerably to the task of controlling monetary growth and inflation. Unwilling to allow an appreciation of the exchange rate out of concern for competitiveness, the authorities took a number of steps in response to the inflows: . Open market operations and higher reserve requirements were used to offset the monetary impact. . Inflows were regulated by limits on the uses to which GDRs could be put and a requirement that funds raised through GDR issues be held offshore until utilixed. . Conditions affecting non-resident deposits were tightened, including elimination of official exchange rate guarantees and imposition of cash reserve requirements on these deposits. 0 The trade and exchange system was further liberal&d (see Box 2). Portfolio inflows have dropped sharply since Gctober 1994, reflecting both the impact of the GDR regulations and less favorable market conditions (rising international interest rates, declining local market prices, and investor caution in the wake of the Mexican crisis). India’s recent experience with capital inflows is discussed more extensively in the background Paper. 0 Inflationary pressures persist. After declining to 7 percent in 1992/93, the 12-month increase in the tiholesale price index was in double digits for much of 1994/95, although more recently the rate has come down under 10 percent (Chart 2). Inflationary pressures have mainly been a pro- duct of strong domestic demand and a loosening of monetary conditions reflec- ting in part heavy capital inflows. The prices of some commodities have risen sharply because of supply constraints, prompting the authorities to undertake selective import liberalization (sugar, cotton, and edible oils). l/ The exchange value of the rupee has remained broadly stable vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar since exchange rate unification in March 1993. The author- ities have effectively set a ceiling on the rupee's value by offering to purchase foreign exchange on an open window basis at a rate of Rs 31.37 per dollar. The authorities have not intervened in the market when the rupee's value has weakened.

In response, the authorities have taken a series of measures since the summer of 1994 to rein in monetary growth. The cash reserve requirement (CRR) was raised from 14 to 15 per- cent, government recourse to financing from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was restrained, and, as mentioned above, actions were taken to stem capital inflows. As a result, 12-month broad money growth came down from 22 percent in October to around 17 l/2 percent by mid-March 1995 (Table 2). Over this period, private demand for bank credit increased sharply, reflecting in part curtailed access to foreign financing and the decline of the domestic stock market. Against this background, interest rates have risen significantly, but are still not high in real terms by international comparison. Table 2.

Limited fiscal adjustment. The central government deficit was reduced by 1 percentage point to 6.7 percent of GDP in 1994/95 (Table 3).

A factor relaxing the budget constraint on the states was a sharp rise in deposits in small saving schemes toward the end of the year, a large proportion of which is automatically channeled to the states. IJ The overall public sector deficit is estimated to have decli- ned only marginally in 1994/95 to an estimated 10 l/2 percent of GDP, a level broadly similar to thtat in 1990/91.. Table 3.

While significant steps were taken over the past year in a number of areas (Box 2), the process of building up new markets and institutions has taken time, and further efforts are needed before the full benefits are realized for the economy. In the meantime, bottlenecks are being increasingly felt in areas such as power and transportation, while financial markets remain thin, segmented, and subject to risk. Moreover, in a number of politically sensitive areas--including public enterprise reform, agricultural policy, and exit policy--reforms have lagged well behind. lJ The rise in such deposits was mainly related to special inducements offered by states to financial institutions to place their funds into deposits qualifying under the small savings scheme. 2/ The consolidated public sector comprises the operations of the central government, the state governments, and t:he central public enterprise. 3J The figures for the states' defici.t for 1994/95 and 1995/96 budget are staff estimates.

Following the announcement of a new telecommunications policy in May 1994, licenses are being allocated for private provision of telecommunications services. Eight private sector power projects have been cleared to receive central government counter-guarantees of payments by state electricity boards. Electricity rates are to be set by the electricity boards on a cost-plus basis sufficient to yield a guaranteed rate of return on equity of about 16 percent. . Tax policy. The 1994/95 and the 1995/96 budgets contained a streamlining of customs and excise taxes, including a reduced number of bands, lower rates, a shift from specific to ad valorem application, fewer end-use exemptions, and an extension of MODVAT to capital goods. Administration of direct tax has been strengthened by increased deduction at source and progressive computerisation. . Banking reform. The minimum lending rate was eliminated for large bank loans in October 1994. Criteria for loans qualifying as priority sector credits were broadened. Following legislative changes, two public sector banks raised equity in domestic share offerings, while ten new private banks were licensed. . Capital market reform. The National Stock Exchange opened in July 1994, providing for screen-based trading of both debt and equities. The RBI announced guidelines to set up a primary dealer system for government securities in March 1995, along the lines recommended by an MAE technical assistance mission. . Trade reform. The maximum tariff has been lowered from 400 percent in 1990/91, to 65 percent in 1994195, to 50 percent in 1995/96. The average tariff rate has now been reduced to 27 percent, compared with 87 percent in 1990191. A number of consumer goods have been added to the OGL, and the range of consumer goods importable under the special import license scheme has been increased. . Exchange liberahation. Existing limits on invisibles transactions were declared to be indicative only, while official exchange rate guarantees for non-resident deposits were phased out. See background paper for additional information. III. Policy Discussions 1. ControllinF inflation The re-emergence of inflationary pressures has contributed to increased uncertainty and threatens to undermine confidence in the reform program. The immediate challenge for macroeconomic policy is therefore to achieve a durable turnaround in inflation while allowing the expansion of private sector activity to continue. The authorities’ strategy for 1995/96 is based on a further moderate fiscal adjustment at the central level allied Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - with a tight monetary policy and a cautious stance toward capital inflows. They believe that the internal supply situation is now broadly favorable, and that high food stocks and international reserves have reduced the economy's vulnerability to a poor monsolon. The staff stressed that the present policy mix is not ideal and that strong and credible measures to lower the public sector deficit are neelded over the medium term if inflation is to be reduced on a lasting basis. l Fiscal policy The central government budget for 1995/96 aims at a moderate deficit reduction to 5.5 percent of GDP (Box 3), which would be consistent with lowering the overall public sector deficit to about 10 percent of GDP. Even if achieved, these deficits would be substantially above the medium-term objectives indicated in the Government's 1993 discussion paper, which envisaged reducing the central government deficit to 3 percent of GDP and the overall deficit to 5 percent by 1996/97. The staff emphasized that, at a minimum, it was essential to achieve the targeted deficit reduction to relieve short-term demand pressures and maintain progress toward f:Lscal consolidation. Careful management would be required to avoid a recurrence of the expenditure overruns that occurred in the past two years. Spending could *well be higher in a number of areas: interest payments would be greater if domestic interest rates continued to rise; subsidies would be h:Lgher if buffer stocks remained larger than assumed; the budgetary costs of anti-poverty initiatives would depend on details of these schemes which have yet to be fully worked out; and wage costs could be significantly higher depending on the content and timing of the Pay Commission report on the government wage structure. lJ While the tax revenue estimates looked attainable, proceeds from divestment could fall short of the target (0.7 percent of GDP) if the Indian stock market remained weak, particularly if sales of particular enterprises continued to be constrained by a minimum government share of 51 percent. 2J In view of these risks, the authorities would need to be ready to take measures later in the year as necessary to meet the deficit objective. The states' budget deficit has increased significantly since 1990/91, while interest costs have absorbed a rising share of state spending. The central government budget aims at reducing overall resource transfers (tax I/ The Pay Commission is a constitutionally mandated body set up to make recommendations every five years on the Government's wage scales, which are otherwise adjusted only for cost of living changes.

The mission expressed concern that the states would continue to apply pressure for additional resources in 1995/96, and emphasized the need to reimpose a hard budget constraint to foster the restructuring of state finances. The authorities indicated that the central government had limited direct influence on state budgetary operations. There were, however, encouraging indications that some states were now beginning to tackle deep-seated problems, including tax reform and the restructuring of state electricity boards. JJ Box 3. Central Government Budget for 1995196 l Overall deficit down. The budget aims at reducing the overall deficit from 6.7 percent of GDP in 1994195to 5.5 percent in 1995196. . Reduced “ad hoc” financing from RBI. The limit on the Government’s automatic access to RBI financing through the issue of “ad hoc Treasury bills” was reduced from Rs 60 billion in 1994/95 to Rs 50 billion (about 9 percent of the total deficit) in 1995/96. Under an agreement reached in August 1994, such financing (which is at 4.6 percent interest) is to be phased out by 1997/98. Moreover, the RI31 is author&d to auction additional Treasury bills if use of ad hots exceeds a within- year ceiling of Rs 90 billion for ten working days or more. l Revenues broadly unchanged relative to GDP. Some further progress is made toward lowering and simplifying tariffs and excise tax rates. The maximum import tariff is reduced from 65 percent to 50 percent. Additional savings incentives have been introduced under the personal income tax. Continued improvements in tax administration and compliance are projected to offset any adverse impact of rate cuts on collections. l Divestment program to be stepped up. Receipts are budgeted at 0.7 percent of GDP. This level is almost twice last year’s receipts, excluding proceeds from 1993/94 that were booked in 1994195. l Total expenditure lowered relative to GDP. Total spending on defense, subsidies, public investment, and grants and loans to states are to be reduced by nearly 1 percent of GDP. Loans to states would decline as the mobilixation of small savings is reduced from last year’s exceptional level. l Credit programs for social purposes to be expanded. The.se would be funded mainly through directed credits from commercial banks. A social assistance program is to be introduced for the very poorest. Details on costs, funding, and administration have yet to be worked out. lJ The background paper reviews recent initiatives to reform state tax systems.

The authorities noted that monetary conditions had already tightened considerably and pointed to the recent deceleration of inflation as evidence that present policies were working. They were concerned that a significant further tightening of monetary policy could raise interest rates to levels that would choke off investment and growth. The staff argued that priority should be given to reducing inflation now that the momentum of the expansion was well established, and suggested that the authorities aim at further reduction in money growth during 1995/96 while taking steps to send clear signals of their anti-inflation resolve. Such steps could include (i) an announcement that the Government would forego financing from the RBI through the use of ad hoc Treasury bills (see Box 3); (ii) the establishment of a mechanism to convert the RBI's stock of "special" securities into marketable instruments in order to bolster the RBI's capacity to conduct open market operations; 1;/ and (iii) a further increase in the ceiling on deposit rates. The staff recognized that the impact of interest rates on investment and growth was difficult to gauge in the Indian context, where there was little experience with market-related interest rates. However, the large increase in corporate profitability over the past year suggested that growth of business investment could be sustained through internal resource genera- tion even with a slowing in growth of bank credit to the private sector. Moreover, real lending rates in India were still not particularly high by international standards and did not seem likely to stifle the response to the opportunities created by reforms. 2/ Thus, it seemed probable that further interest rate increases could be absorbed by Indian industry without excessively curtailing the economic expansion. Since the mission's departure, the RBI has announced a target of 15 l/2 percent for broad money growth during 1995/96, and has raised the maximum deposit rate for the second time this year from 11 percent to 12 percent. The RBI indicated that the money growth target was consistent with continued tight monetary conditions and bringing inflation down to around 8 percent by the end of the fiscal year. The continued moderation of capital inflows and the limit on expansion of RBI credit to the Government lJ After substantial sales of government securities over the past two years, over 90 percent of securities held by the RBI are at a below-market interest rate. Use of such securities for open market operations has been limited by the RBI's concern that sales of these instruments would require substantial loss recognition on its balance sheet. 2/ The base lending rate is now around 15 l/2 percent, implying a real rate of around 6 percent.

In assessing this policy, it should be noted that the end-March 1995 base for broad money was boosted by around 3 percent because of temporary factors. lJ Thus, on an adjusted basis, the 1995/96 target would actually provide for a 19 percent increase in broad money, implying an acceleration in money growth. Already, net RBI credit to the government has increased sharply in 1995/96, with government recourse to ad hoc Treasury bills exceeding both the annual limit of Rs 50 billion set in the budget and the within-year ceiling of Rs 90 billion. The rise in RBI credit to government may indicate concerns that greater reliance on market borrowing would raise interest rates too sharply. However, in the staff's view, this increased monetization of the deficit undermines the credibility of the RBI's commitment to controlling inflation and should be reversed quickly. 2. Medium-term fiscal consolidation 2J Recent developments have underscored the difficulty of reconciling the authorities' twin objectives of low inflation and rapid growth in the absence of fiscal consolidation. Therefore, the key policy challenge facing India in the post election period is to reduce its extremely high public sector deficit, and hence the stock of public debt which has reached 90 per- cent of GDP. Continued high deficits would have a number of adverse consequences: 0 The task of preserving macroeconomic stability would become increasingly difficult as an excessive burden would be put on monetary policy. a There is a risk that public debt and the debt service burden would become unsustainable. a National savings would remain depressed, thus reducing the scope for domestic investment without heavy reliance on foreign savings. . The process of structural reform would be jeopardized, particu- larly trade liberalization and financial sector reform. I-J Specifically, the last reporting Friday of the year (on which the monetary accounts are based) was also the last day of the fiscal year, when banks normally experience a surge in deposits associated with government payments. See background paper for details. 2J The background paper contains a more detailed discussion of the need for fiscal adjustment, alternative medium-term scenarios, and the policies to achieve fiscal consolidation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- l:! - The authorities recognize that fiscal consolidation must be a key component of their medium-term growth strategy. However, they emphasized that this task would be difficult and suggested that gradual adjustment, if not ideal, could still provide the basis for a satisfactory growth outcome. The mission discussed with the authorities two scenarios that illustrate the implications for growth, inflation, and the balance of payments of alterna- tive fiscal paths (Chart 3). Under a gradual adjustment scenario, the primary deficit of the public sector would be reduced by 2 percent of GDP over the next five years. However, this would yield only a modest reduction in the overall deficit because of rising interest costs. The budget would be increasingly vulnerable to changes in interest rates and, more impor- tantly, in a context of high interest rates and continued inflationary pressures, growth would remain well below that achieved in the successful East Asian economies. An alternative scenario of faster adjustment (the primary deficit is reduced by 3 percent of GDP over the next five years, with more rapid adjustment in the early years) would yl:eld a significant reduction in the overall deficit. Feedback effects of public debt on interest rates, together with lower inflation, would result in a sharp decline in the public sector's interest burden. Moreover, a stronger fiscal position and further progress in structural reform would foster higher domestic saving and longer term private capital inflows, boosting investment and growth. Sustainable fiscal consolidation along the lines of the faster adjust- ment scenario is feasible but will require significant efforts by all levels of the public sector--the center, states, and public enterprises. The bulk of the correction would need to be on the revenue side. In the context of a strong economic expansion, government revenues could be raised by 2 percent of GDP through more vigorous efforts at broadening the base of direct and indirect taxes, together with reforms of the state tax system. Non-interest government expenditure could be lowered by l/2 percent of GDP by stream- lining central administration and improving, cost recovery at the state level, while still leaving room for increased spending on capital projects and social programs. Finally, public enterprise restructuring could contri- bute l/2 percent of GDP through increased profitability and reduced budget- ary support to unviable units. 3. Coning with capital flows India's external position is now quite strong, with a high level of reserves, impressive export growth, a moderate current account deficit, reduced reliance on short-term financing, and a competitive exchange rate. Although amortization payments will rise markedly in 1996/97, the balance of payments should remain viable in the medium term provided that India main- tains a path of fiscal consolidation and structural reform. The authorities are, nevertheless, concerned--and the staff agreed--that allowing too rapid a buildup in potentially volatile capital inflows could undermine the exter- nal position. While recognizing the benefits of foreign saving as a means to raise investment and growth, they have been determined to limit the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12a - CHART 3 INDIA MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS, 1990/91-2000/01 l/ (In percent of GDP) 13 ,2 Overall Public Sector Deficit 13 12 a- 7- 6. 5- 4-4 go/91 92/93 94/95 96/97 9a/99 OO/Ol “.. . . . . -a . . . . ‘... -7 Faster adjustment “.“..\ . . . . -6 ‘.. . . . . ‘l., 5 95 95 Public Debt a5- fm- x.

With the recent decline in international equity financing, there has been a pickup in interest in external commercial borrowing (ECB) which remains substantially cheaper than domestic funding. The authorities have sought to constrain the buildup in ECB by setting an annual indicative limit for approvals, with priority given to longer term borrowing to meet infrastructural needs. In practice, they have been flexible in approving additional borrowing on a case-by-case basis so as not to hold back high priority investments. The staff supported the authorities' cautious approach in the present circumstances where confidence could be easily undermined, but suggested that greater recourse to foreign savings could be contemplated over the medium term. While a cautious attitude is appropriate toward potentially volatile and short-term inflows, other longer term flows and, in particular, foreign direct investment, could yield substantial benefits for the Indian economy. To encourage direct investment it will be important to make further progress in removing institutional impediments, including administrative discretion in screening of investments, inflexible labor policies, and delays in establishing regulatory and policy frameworks for key sectors. While a resurgence of capital inflows seems unlikely in the present context, the staff inquired how the authorities would respond to such an event. They replied that, as last year, they would consider a variety of measures, including sterilization, further liberalization of the trade and exchange system, and a tightening of prudential regulations affecting capital inflows. The authorities continued to believe that it would not be appropriate to allow a significant exchange rate appreciation to absorb pressure from strong capital inflows in view of the need to maintain export competitiveness. The staff responded that the option of allowing the rate to appreciate should be retained in case a resurgence in inflation was otherwise unavoidable. While noting that India had not experienced significant outflows following the Mexican crisis, the staff also asked how the authorities would react to an episode of capital outflows. The authorities said that, if such an event did occur, they would initially use international reserves to limit the immediate transmission of external disturbances to the domestic economy. However, if outflows persisted, they would let the rupee depreciate and at the same time tighten financial policies. The staff observed that, with a convertible current account and with greater openness to international capital movements, it would be desirable to provide more scope for exchange rate flexibility to respond to balance of payments developments. The authorities said that they were studying steps to encourage greater depth and liquidity in the foreign exchange market. They commented that the recent MAE technical assistance mission had provided Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicuseful suggestions, many of which were likely to be included in the recom- mendations of a report now being prepared by a committee in the RBI. l/ 4. Maintaining the reform momentum Given the present political constraints, the discussions focussed on priorities in areas where there is realistic scope for short-term progress. l Private investment in infrastructure. Reforms to foster private investment in infrastructure are being given high priority, as serious bottlenecks could develop if large invlestments do not proceed on a fast- track. The authorities recognized that progress over the past year had been mixed, but emphasized that it took time to develop commercial and legal frameworks for private participation appropriate for the Indian context. The present round of bidding for telecommunications contracts was an impor- tant first step that should pave the way for rapid development in this sector. In the power sector, the Ministry of Finance had provided counter- guarantees for eight projects to give a "kick-start" to private investment (see Box 1). However, further private investment in this sector would depend on strengthening the policies at the state level to ensure commercial returns, as was already occurring in some states. 0 Continuing with capital marke!t reform. The authorities said that significant progress should also continue with capital market reforms. The government securities marlket would gain depth and liquidity as the primary dealer system is established, and this should facilitate the government borrowing program. In the equities market,, the Government intends to intro- duce legislation that would provide the basis for a central depository system, a critical step toward improving market transparency and efficiency, thus reducing the risks of financial disruption that could retard market development or trigger an outflow of portfolio capital. u A regulatory body for the insurance industry will be established as a first step toward allowing private participation in that sector. . Risks to banking sector reform. The staff expressed concern that fiscal pressures could delay progress in banking sector reform. Relying on commercial banks to provide financing for poverty alleviation schemes--as envisaged in the 1995/96 budget- -was inconsistent with the goal of phasing out priority sector lending requirements. Moreover, the process of reducing I/ The principal recommendations of the MAE report were: (i) liberali- zation of existing restrictions on dealers' overnight foreign exchange positions, while improving prudential controls; (ii) abolishing fixed commissions for transactions; (iii) no longer requiring the RBI to set a benchmark rate; and (iv) elimination of cash reserve requirements on inter- bank deposits to encourage parallel development of domestic money markets. 2J In such a system, security certificates are recorded in a central depository so that ownership can be transferred electronically through book entries, thus reducing settlement time and costs.

With the removal of the floor rate for large bank loans and steps to strengthen bank supervision, the staff suggested that elimination of the ceiling on deposit rates could now be considered. a Prospects for trade reform. Despite substantial progress in recent years, India's trade regime remains one of the most protectionist in Asia. The authorities said that trade liberalization measures announced in March could generate additional consumer good imports of up to US$l billion in 1995/96. 2/ Depending on the response to these moves, further steps would be considered later in the year, particularly if needed to relieve supply shortages. Looking further ahead, the authorities said that, within about two years, it should be possible to lower the maximum tariff from 50 percent to around 35 percent and iron out remaining anomalies in the tariff struc- ture, although this would depend on revenue considerations. They reiterated their intention to move all consumer goods to the OGL (with appropriate tariffs) within a similar time span. IV. Staff ARDraiSd India's economic performance over the past year has been encouraging. The robust recovery of private investment and continued rapid export growth are evidence of a dynamic response to the reforms initiated in 1991. The external position has strengthened further, while the authorities responded skillfully to a surge of capital inflows with a variety of measures that prevented inflation from getting out of hand or a significant erosion of competitiveness. Further progress has also been made on the structural reform front. Notwithstanding these successes, the limited progress in fiscal conso- lidation has placed a heavy burden on monetary policy in macroeconomic management. The strains inherent in this unbalanced mix of financial poli- cies are becoming increasingly evident. While the inflation rate has recently been brought down to single digits-- after being in double digits for much of the past year--interest rates have risen significantly, and the authorities are increasingly concerned about the impact on investment and l/ The recent credit policy statement announced no further reduction in the SLR for the first time since 1992. 2/ Imports of foodstuffs, textiles, garments, and electronic equipment could all rise significantly.

This concern has already led to a sharp rise in government borrowing from the RBI in recent weeks, rather than borrowing in the market. The staff endorses the authorities' objective of reducing inflation to around 8 percent by the end of 1995/96. However, given the sharp monetary expansion at the end of l994/95, achieving this objective would require holding money growth significantly below the authorities' 15 l/2 percent target. Increased monetLzation of the fiscal deficit in recent weeks has hightened the risk of a :resurgence of inflation, which would add to uncer- tainty and undermine confidence in the reforms. Although a further tighten- ing of monetary policy m,ay entail some rise in interest rates, the reforms have given an impetus to investment that should withstand the dampening effects of tighter credit. Moreover, the impact on output would be lessened to the extent that the money and inflation targets are perceived as credible. Further steps are needed to bolster the RBI's operational auto- nomy and send a clear signal of the authoxities' anti-inflation commitment. In this respect, it will be essential to adhere to the limits on automatic government access to RBI credit in 1995/96, and to phase out such borrowing within the agreed timeframe. In the absence of a major fiscal consolidation, there are limits to what can be achieved through tight monetary policy alone without dampening the economic expansion. At a minimum, any further fiscal slippage must be avoided. While the budgeted revenues in 1995/96 should be achievable, it will be essential to maintain tight discipline over expenditures. Where over-runs are unavoidable (e.g., on i.nterest payments), offsetting measures would need to be taken elsewhere. Particularly important will be to limit budgetary transfers to the states. Reimposition of a hard budget constraint on the states would encourage them to move forward with long overdue reforms of their own revenue and spending policies. The prospects are for India's external position to remain sound, provided that the authorities achieve at least gradual fiscal consolidation and reform. The authorities' cautious approach to potentially volatile capital inflows is appropriate, but stable inflows, especially direct investment, should be encouraged as they can make an important contribution to India's economic development. The option of greater flexibility in exchange rate policy should be kept open to provide increased room for maneuver in responding to events such as surges in capital inflows or turbu- lence in international currency markets. To maintain confidence--domestic and international--the Government should persevere with its reform strategy in the coming year despite a more difficult political environment. Reforms in the areas of private participa- tion in infrastructure, trade and tax policies, and capital markets should all be pushed through. It will be particularly important to ensure that difficulties in financing the public sector deficit do not impede further progress toward financial sector liberalization. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - Looking beyond the immediate policy situation, the objectives of rapid growth and price stability will be difficult to reconcile in the absence of sustained fiscal adjustment and a bold second wave of reforms. These will be the major economic policy challenges in the post-election period. For the reform program, it will be particularly important to make progress in neglected areas such as restructuring and privatization of public enterpri- ses, reform of labor market and exit policies, liberalization of consumer goods imports, and agricultural reform. V. Fund Related Issues l Article IV consultation. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held with India on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. In line with current practice, the staff intends to make a mid-year visit after the 1995 annual meetings to maintain continuity of the surveil- lance process. 0 Article VIII. Effective August 20, 1994, India accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. While welcoming this decision, the mission urged the authorities to expedite the removal of remaining exchange restrictions (Box 4). The authorities said that it would take time to deal with these restrictions. With respect to the Indo-Russian debt agreement, the amounts involved were large and a quick resolution could not be expected. The unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with a number of other countries were far smaller, but it would be difficult to deal with these until the Russia issue was settled. The restriction on dividend remittances in the consumer goods industry would be difficult to remove until the import barriers protecting this sector had been liberalized. Finally, the transitional arrangements covering the remittance of investment income by non-residents had been deliberately designed to provide some protection to the balance of payments until the full magnitude of such outflows could be gauged. While India's acceptance of Article VIII obligations was welcome, the remaining exchange restrictions need to be addressed. The staff recommends temporary approval for the retention of the multiple currency practice related to existing exchange rate guarantees on non-resident deposits accepted under a scheme that was abolished in 1994, which will be phased out as these deposits mature. The staff does not recommend approval for the retention of the other remaining restrictions, namely (i) the limitation on dividend remittances by foreign investors in the consumer goods sector, (ii) the non-transferability of balances under the debt agreement with Russia, (iii) the restriction related to the remaining balances under inoperative transferability of current and past investment income by non-resident Indians.

R&.rictions Subject to Approval Under Article VIII On August 20, 1994 India accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The following outstanding restrictions are subject to approval by the Fund. 1. Nonresident deposits. While new depos.its are no longer accepted under the Foreign Currency Non-Resident Account (A) scheme, exchange rate guarantees of principal and interest on outstanding deposits under the scheme have been grandfathered and remain in effect until these deposits mature (over the next three years). These remainin g guarantees continue to give rise to a multiple currency practice. 2. Income transfers by nonresident Indiaus. Restrictions on the transfer abroad of income (net of taxes) earned on investments by nonresident Indian nationals and overseas corporate bodies predomi- nantly owned by nonresident Indian nationals will be eliminated in a phased manner. For income earned during the financial year 1994195, US$l,OOO plus one third of the amount in excess of US$l,OOO will be allowed to be transferred; for income earned during the financial year 1995196, USSl,OOO plus two thirds of the amount in excess of US$l,OOO will be allowed to be transferred; and beginning for the financial year 1996197, the full amount of income earned during the year will be allowed to be transferred. However, the transferability of past investment income that had not been freely invested in the country would continue to be restricted. 3. Indo-Russian debt agreement. This agreement, reached in January 1993, covers about RS’ 30 billion in accumulated claims on India arising from the earlier bilateral payments agreement. Debt service on the agreement can only he used for the purchase of Indian exports, thus constituting a restriction on the transferability of balances. 4. Bilateral payments agreements. Small unsettled balances remain under inoperative bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, the former German Democratic Republic, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, and the farmer Yugoslavia. 5. Dividend balancing requirement. Under the Statement on Industrial Policy announced in July 1991, transfers abroad of dividends by nonresident investors in consumer goods industries must be balanced by export earnings, for a period of seven years from the date of commencement of commerciai production.

The Fund takes this decision relating to India's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with India conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63) adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice described in SM/95/145 are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3. The Fund notes the authorities' intention to eliminate the multiple currency practice arising from remaining exchange guarantees under the former Foreign Currency Nonresident Account scheme by August 1997 and grants approval for its retention until the conclusion of the next Article IV con- sultation with India. The Fund urges India to eliminate all other remaining restrictions as soon as possible.
