While supporting pro-growth and pro-poor outlays, the proposed rule-based fiscal framework should seek the achievement of significant fiscal savings over the long term, necessary to build up buffers and sustain reasonable levels of expenditures in the post-oil era. In this context, Congo should continue adhering to a prudent borrowing policy to preserve long-term debt sustainability after HIPC/MDRI debt relief. 32.      Congo’s external stability assessment points to additional improvements in the last year, but competitiveness ought to be further strengthened. The real effective exchange rate is in line with macroeconomic fundamentals, but external competitiveness is being stifled by deeply-rooted structural impediments to private sector development. Staff encourages the authorities to promptly implement the reform measures agreed to with the IFC to improve the business environment, including by making the recently established Investment Promotion Agency fully operational and streamlining the administrative requirements for engaging in business activities. 33.      Improving The poor governance and business conditions must be addressed is needed to support strong private sector-led growth and poverty reduction. The authorities have reached compliant status under the EITI; they now have to expedite adoption of the fiscal transparency law that is currently under review in Parliament. To diversify the economy and promote employment, the Government is developing SEZs; strengthening technical and vocational education; and introducing special employment-supporting programs. In parallel, innovative social safety net arrangements are being set up to protect the most vulnerable groups. The timely availability of budgeted funds will be needed to ensure that these programs are well implemented. As regards the SEZs program, the government should avoid granting special fiscal incentives that create distortions and often give rise to abusive practices, focusing instead on revamping infrastructure and advancing administrative facilitation. 34.      While the medium-term prospects are generally favorable, the authorities should be vigilant to risks related to downward pressures on world oil prices. Despite anticipated fluctuations in oil production over the next years, real GDP growth should remain robust and inflation would be contained around the CEMAC target of 3 percent. However, uncertainties in the Euro area and a weakening of investment in the emerging markets, resulting in lower than-currently projected world oil prices, would cloud Congo’s otherwise favorable outlook. 35.      Congo should fully comply with its CEMAC obligations. The authorities are supporting and closely monitoring the ongoing review of the regional central bank (BEAC)’s reserves management framework. Pending completion of the review, staff urges full observance of relevant CEMAC commitments to insure the continued smooth operation of the BEAC and the pegged exchange rate arrangement. Staff also encourages the authorities to step up the efforts to ensure the timely provision of information to the Fund on the standard macroeconomic data that is required for effective surveillance.   36.      Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.
