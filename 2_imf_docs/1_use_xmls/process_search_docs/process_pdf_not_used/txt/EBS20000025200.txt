Economic policy implementation has improved over the course of 2000. Macroeconomic policies have been generally sound while a number of structural problems have begun to be tackled. The authorities’ overall economic strategy based on a sound budget, prudent monetary policy, and supportive structural reforms will, if pursued persistently, create a durable basis for economic growth and a stable external position. 0 The economic situation in 2000 has been encouraging. Following the gradual stabilization of the economy in 1999 in the aftermath of the Russia crisis, real GDP growth in 2000 turned positive for the first time since independence, and is expected to reach some 4 percent for the year as a whole. The exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2000, and gross international reserves have remained mostly above 3 weeks of imports. However, the annual inflation rate was higher than envisaged, rising to 27 percent, partly reflecting the unsterilized intervention by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), and increases in administered prices. The macroeconomic framework for 2001 envisages a continuation of the economic recovery. The program projects real GDP growth of 4 percent, and targets a reduction of inflation to 13 percent. Gross international reserves are expected to rise to about 4 weeks of imports. Following the sharp turnaround in the trade balance during 1999-2000, the external current account surplus is projected to narrow from almost 5 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 2 percent in 200 1. l Following a mixed record in 1999, the fiscal position improved markedly through September 2000. The overall cash deficit of the general government is projected at 1.5 percent of GDP in 2000, against an outcome of 2.4 percent in 1999, as revenues performed better than foreseen and expenditures were kept in check. Except for some limited netting operations in the first quarter of 2oo0, the government has significantly reduced noncash offsets compared to 1999. The approved budget for 2001 targets an overall deficit of 3 percent of GDP, financed predominantly by expected privatization receipts. . The growth of monetary aggregates during the first nine months of 2000 was dominated by unsterilized foreign exchange intervention by the NBU, whereas monetary policy in 1999 was marked by the government’s heavy reliance on NBU financing. For 2001, consistent with the target on net international reserves, the authorities are committed to keeping the growth of monetary aggregates in line with the inflation target. The health of most large banks improved somewhat in 1999 and 2000, but nonetheless remains worrisome, with Bank Ukraina in particular continuing to incur substantial losses. 0 Some progress has been made in the structural area. A new privatization law was passed in early 2000, although no single large enterprise has yet been sold through open and transparent bidding procedures. In the energy sector, progressively higher cash collection ratios for gas and electricity through September were achieved, and communal tariffs were eventually raised in most areas of the country. The law establishing the 30 percent export tax on oil seeds was vetoed, but subsequently approved at a lower rate of 23 percent. The authorities intend to reduce this rate to 10 percent by end-2000.

The need to maintain tight fiscal policies, and ensure that the expenditure plan for 2001 takes into account the expected timing of privatization receipts. It will be essential to use privatization receipts in excess of the programmed amount solely for debt reduction, Cuts in tax rates should not be implemented unless accompanied by offsetting measures to broaden the tax base. The need to ensure a prudent monetary policy. The NBU should be prepared to accept significantly greater exchange rate flexibility, particular if strong capital inflows or outflows materialize. The importance of addressing the weaknesses in the financial system. It is essential to proceed expeditiously to resolve the uncertainties and minimize the fiscal costs. The importance of accelerating the pace of structural reform in order to reduce the role of the state in the Ukrainian economy. Continued efforts are needed to boost the environment for private business, and improve transparency and governance.

Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation and the fourth review of Ukraine’s economic program supported by a three-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) were held in Kyiv during the period June 14-28,200O and continued during September 11-22 and November 8-14.’ The staff representatives met with President Kuchma. Prime Minister Youshchenko. senior officials of the government and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), and representatives of parliament and of trade unions. 2. The EFF arrangement was approved on September 4,1998, and the third review under the arrangement was completed on September 7,1999. The seven purchases made thus far amount to SDR 7 12.15 million. An eighth purchase could not be made due to the non-observance of one structura.J performance criterion at mid-September 1999 and of five quantitative performance criteria at end-December 1999. In the attached letter, dated December 5,200O (Annex I), the authorities request waivers for the non-observance of the mid-September 1999 structural performance criterion on communal tariffs and the end-December 1999 performance criteria on the deficit of the consolidated budget, the nonearmarked state cash revenue, the stock of budgetary arrears on wages, pensions and benefits, the net domestic assets of the NBU, and the continuous performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears (Appendix II). They also request an extension of the arrangement and a rephasing of the remaining purchases. 3. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on March 26,1999, Executive Directors welcomed the progress made in several areas, notably the reduction of the number of budgetary employees and the liberalization of the exchange system following the Russian financial crisis in 1998. However, Directors expressed regret that reforms in the agricultural and energy sectors had been inadequate and urged the authorities to step up implementation of other reforms agreed under the program. In the fiscal area, Directors stressed the need to reduce tax exemptions and structural rigidities, improve the composition of expenditures, and strengthen expenditure management. Directors also urged the authorities to reinforce the banking system, and accorded high priority to the acceleration of deregulation and privatization, reforms in the coal sector, and the need to improve governance and fight corruption. ’ The staff participating in these discussions were Messrs. Berengaut (.Head), De Vrijer, Justice, Lewis, Lissovolik, and Rug@ero, Ms. Elborgh-Woytek, and Ms. Nikdjou, Assistant (all EU2). Ms. Fouad and Mr. Petri (FAD), Messrs. Kanaan and Mulder (.PDR), and Mr. Keuppens (TRE). Mr. Odling-Smee (Director, EU2) visited Kyiv during November 3-5.2000. Messrs. Ghesquiere and Orsmond of the Resident Representative Office in Ukraine assisted in the discussions. Mr. Yakusha, the Alternate Executive Director for Ukraine, also attended some of the meetings. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 4. On September 6,200O Executive Directors discussed the issue of misreporting of information on the international reserves of the NBU (EBS/00/177, 8/23/00 with Supplement 1. 8/29/00 and Supplement 2,9/5/00). Directors found that Ukraine had breached its obligation under Article VIII, Section 5 to report accurate information to the Fund. They noted the acknowledgement by the Ukrainian authorities of the findings of the staff, and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue improved reserves management practices and ensure accurate reporting in the future, including through continuing quarterly audits of the NBU’s reserve position. Directors also welcomed the voluntary repurchase of two purchases totaling SDR 72.5 million that Ukraine would not have been entitled to make had the level of international reserves been accurately reported to the Fund, and the authorities’ intention to keep the proceeds of any future purchases that would be made under the Extended Arrangement in Ukraine’s SDR account held with the IMF.’ 5. The quality of Ukraine’s economic and financial database has improved since the last Article IV consultation, but there remain substantial weaknesses, particularly in the areas of the national accounts and public finances. Core data are provided to the Fund on a timely basis. and the authorities regularly publish a broad range of statistics. The authorities hope to be able to subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) by end- 2001. The Fund continues to provide advice to enhance coverage and methodology in statistics, and also delivers considerable technical assistance in public finance. and central banking and reserves management. In this context. a Technical Assistance Consultation was undertaken to solicit the authorities’ view on recent technical assistance and future needs (Box 1). Overall, the authorities recognize the usefulness of the technical assistance provided by the Fund, although in many areas implementation of recommendations has proceeded slowly. The Fund’s recent technical assistance to Ukraine is summarized in Appendix I. and statistical issues are further discussed in Appendix V. ’ As was noted in EBS/00/177, the staff is also reviewing the reporting of fiscal data with respect to credit to nongovernment units guaranteed by the government or the NBU. The authorities are currently assembling the data on actual disbursements provided in the context of such guarantees and expect this work to be finished by end-December, 2000 or early January. 2001. The results of the staff investigation, once completed, will be brought promptly to the attention of the Executive Board.

Technical Assistance Consultation A technical assistance consultation was undertaken with the government agencies where the Fund has had active technical assistance programs. National Bank of Ukraine The NBU recognized the usefulness of Fund technical assistance in the areas of monetary and exchange operations and instruments, bank supervision and restructuring, central bank accounting, and foreign reserves management. Cooperation between Fund and other technical assistance providers in these areas has been good, and, overall, significant progress has been made. While the absence of a well-functioning treasury bill market has hampered development of open market operations, the NBU has introduced a central bank certificate of deposit for liquidity management. Bank supervision has been strengthened, and bank restructuring has progressed, despite a lack of experienced staff. Technical assistance of the Fund in central bank accounting has enabled the NBU to produce financial statements in conformity with international accounting standards. Foreign reserves management has received an increased focus since early 2000, and efforts will be needed to strengthen the risk management framework. The NBU noted that further Fund technical assistance in the area of monetary and banking statistics would be particularly useful. Ministry of Finance Fund technical assistance to the Minjstry of Finance has been provided in a range of areas, including tax administration, expenditure management, treasury management, and macro-fiscal policy. The authorities recognize the positive contribution of Fund technical assistance and they have generally been receptive to the staff’s advice. Although there has been some progress, in many cases implementation of recommendations has been slow, due in part to the lack of administrative capacity. The Ministry indicated that further Fund technical assistance would be particularly useful in the area of public finance statistics, as the authorities intend to adopt international accounting standards. State Statistical Committee The State Statistical Committee (SSC) has received a large amount of technical assistance which has proved useful, although implementation in many areas is proceeding slowly. Quarterly national accounts has been one of the key areas targeted for improvement, and implementation of a new system for the production of these data is proceeding systematically but slowly, largely because of insufficient human resources. Regarding price statistics, commodity weights for the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index are revised annually. Additional foreseen improvements include streamlining the CPI sample size and operations, reviewing the construction price index methodology, and implementing an external trade price index, the absence of which is a major impediment to the production of quality national accounts statistics. However, implementation of these plans is slow, partly because of the decentralization of the statistical system.

Ukraine has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. II. RFXENTDEVELOPMENTS 7. A positive achievement in 1999 was the gradual stabilization of the financial and economic situation following the Russian financial crisis in 1998. The decline in real GDP slowed to % of 1 percent in 1999 and inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was contained at 19 percent, in part because of delays in implementing communal tariff increases (Table 2). Ukraine’s external position improved significantly in 1999, primarily because of a sharp turnaround of the current account balance reflecting the impact of a strong depreciation of the real effective exchange rate of some 20 percent during the year (Figure 1). At the same time, most performance criteria, quantitative structural benchmarks and indicative benchmarks set for end-December 1999 were missed, in large part because of a relaxation of fiscal and monetary policies ahead of the November presidential elections. 8. The economic situation in 2000 has been encouraging. Real GDP growth turned positive for the first time since independence and is expected to reach some 4 percent for the year as a whole. In addition to the impact of the expanding cash economy on registered GDP,3 the improved growth performance stemmed primarily from: (i) the positive response to the real effective exchange rate depreciation of the hryvnia in 1999, which contributed to double-digit growth in some export-oriented and import-substituting industrial sectors (metals, food-processing, and light industry); (ii) better-than-expected growth in Russia, as well as a recovery in other export markets notably of metals; and (iii) increased gas imports from Russia in the 1999/2000 winter season, despite continued non-payment problems, which enabled a strong industrial rebound after the recession that occurred in the aftermath of the 1998 financial crisis in Russia. Reflecting the strong export growth in volume terms of about 19 percent, including incidental exports of air-planes and nuclear fuel for reprocessing, and a modest rebound in non-energy imports, the external current account surplus is expected to increase further to almost 5 percent of GDP in 2000. This allowed a significant repayment of external debt (mainly to the Fund), and a slowdown in the build-up of external payments aTTeaTS. 9. The nominal exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2000. The NBU purchased significant amounts of foreign exchange in the interbank market, which kept gross international reserves mostly above a level equivalent to 3 weeks of imports. However, the annual inflation rate rose to 27 percent in 2000, reflecting the unsterilized intervention by the NBU in the foreign exchange market and increases in administered prices, notably communal tariffs, and in prices for energy imports and certain staples. As a result, the competitiveness 3 Reflecting, inter alia. expanding cash transactions in the energy sector and the government having less recourse to netting operations.

The record of fiscal policy was mixed in 1999. The overall cash deficit of the general government was reduced from 2.8 percent of GDP in 1998 to 2.4 percent of GDP in 1999, but exceeded the more ambitious program target of 1.5 percent of GDP set at the time of the second review under the EFF arrangement (Tables 1 and 3). On a commitment basis, the deficit was reduced from 3 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1999, with a reduction in social payments arrears by 1 percent of GDP. The weaker-than-expected fiscal performance reflected a reduction in excise taxes and import duties on petroleum products in the second half of the year, the impact of a number of tax exemptions and deferrals, and an increase in the minimum pension benefit.

The fiscal position improved markedly through September 2000, as revenues performed better than foreseen and expenditures were kept in check, partly on account of shortfalls in foreign financing and privatization receipts. The consolidated balance of the general government recorded a slight cash surplus through September, compared to a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP over the same period in 1999. Taking account of expected external disbursements and privatization receipts during the last quarter, a cash deficit of about 1% percent of GDP is projected for the year as a whole.

At the same time. the authorities lowered the taxation on imports of petroleum products. and eliminated the road turnover tax and the stamp duty. Nontax revenue increased significantly because of the inclusion in the budget of a number of special funds and service fees. Social arrears were reduced by 1.1 percent of GDP, with pension fund arrears eliminated by end-September 2000. However, payments arrears were accumulated in the energy and utility sectors, where some netting against tax arrears has taken place.” H0weve.r. the government has significantly reduced noncash offsets compared to 1999 and has kept expenditures under control through better cash management. 12. The 2000 budget also contained several structural improvements. These included (i) a strengthening of revenue-sharing arrangements concerning profit tax. personal income tax, and excises between the central and local governments; (ii) a reduction in earmarking of taxes; (iii) the streamlining of the tax system; and (iv) the removal of most discretionary tax exemptions. On the expenditure side. the budget allowed for expenditures on restructuring operations, in particular in the energy and banking sectors. Expenditure controls have been tightened through a reduction in the number of key budgetary spending units from 239 in 1999 to 76 in 2000. and budgetary coverage was extended to a number of extrabudgetary funds. Furthermore, progress is being made in strengthening the fiscal reporting and cash management capabilities of the treasury with the phased introduction of the single treasury account and an electronic ledger system. A medium-term strategy has been agreed to, in cooperation with the World Bank and the Fund, for the development of a full-fledged treasury, including reporting arrangements. cash planning, and debt management. 13. Monetary policy in 1999 was dotinated by the government’s heavy reliance on NBU financing, driven partly by a significant shortfall in official foreign assistance. Broad money growth increased to 40 percent for 1999 as a whole, with a build-up in liquidity in the banking system toward the end of the year (Figure 2 and Tables 4 and 5). Pressures on the hryvnia exchange rate increased in the second half of 1999. and the exchange rate depreciated by 34 percent in U.S. dollar terms over the year as a whole. Gross reserves of $ I. 1 billion at end-December 1999 slightly exceeded the revised target set at the time of the second review, despite the shortfall in external financing (Figure 3). 14. Base and broad money increased by 24 percent and 31 percent, respectively, over the first nine months of 2000. The monetary expansion during this period was dominated by unsterilized foreign exchange intervention by the NBU. The NBU bought more than $1 billion in the foreign exchange market-mostly from February through August. ’ The actual treasury system does not yet allow provision of comprehensive information on nonsocial budgetary arrears.

The authorities’ decision not to sterilize the foreign exchange purchases reflected their judgment that, owing to real growth of the economy and the increasing weight of cash transactions, the monetary expansion accommodated an increase in the demand for money. For similar reasons, the NBU reduced reserve requirement ratios early in the year from 17 to 15 percent. However, given the inflation developments through September, the NBU has adopted a more cautious monetary policy for the last quarter of the year, and is aiming to keep base and broad money stable during October-December. 15. The health of most large banks improved somewhat in 1999 and 2000, but remains worrisome. Over the first nine months of 2000, overdue loans declined by 2% percentage points to 10% percent of total bank credits. In the context of rehabilitation plans agreed with the NEW for each bank, a number of prudential and regulatory requirements were strengthened, although several banks are meeting these only in a phased manner. Bank Ukraina has continued to incur substantial losses, and its capital deficiency deteriorated to about 3/4 of 1 percent of GDP. 16. Progress on structural reforms in 1999 was disappointing, but in the course of 2000 a number of important actions were taken (Box 2). In the area of public enterprise reform, a privatization law fostering transparent procedures was passed in early 2000 and a law was recently adopted permitting the sale of a minority share in the telecommunications company Ukrtelecom. Over the first three quarters of 2000, privatization receipts, including from the sale of a large alumina plant, amounted to the equivalent of 3/4 of 1 percent of GDP, exceeding the amounts realized in previous years (average for 1997-99 of less than Y2 of 1 percent of GDP per year). However, no single large enterprise has yet been sold through open and transparent bidding procedures, and privatization receipts for 2000 as a whole will likely fall short of the target (1% percent of GDP) as delays have stalled a number of operations. In the energy sector, payments discipline was strengthened in 2000, and cash collection targets for gas and electricity through September were achieved, although commitments regarding gas auctions have not been met. Cash collection ratios for gas and electricity were increased from some 15 percent at end-1999 to 31 percent and 49 percent, respectively, in September 2000. The increase of communal tariffs to cost-recovery levels announced in 1999 was legally challenged and these were only raised in 2000 in most areas of the country.5 In the agricultural sector, a significant land reform was initiated in late 1999, and the government subsequently reduced its role in the provisioning of farm inputs. The president vetoed the law establishing a 30 percent export tax on oil seeds, but the tax was subsequently approved at a lower rate of 23 percent. Moreover, some 10 new Free Economic Zones (FEZs) were established and various tax exemptions were granted. In the course of 2000, most of the FEZs became operational, with their combined annual fiscal cost estimated ’ Communal tariffs represent user fees for heating, water supply, sewage, rent, gas, and electricity.

Finally, significant progress was made in 1999 and early 2000 in the area of public administration reform, with a reduction in the number of ministries and government agencies, and a centralization of decision-making authority; however, reforms have slowed more recently.

Since late 1999, the Fund staff has been discussing with the authorities a package of fiscal and monetary policies. as well as key structural reforms that could be supported under the Extended Arrangement. In light of the difficult economic and financial outlook, with heavy debt service payments falling due in 2000-01, the discussions focused on measures to put the public finance situation on a firm footing with a substantial strengthening of the overall fiscal position and a comprehensive restructuring of external debt obligations. In addition to progress in stabilization, a major emphasis was given to decisive measures to deepen the privatization program, reform the banking sector, streamline the role of government. and restructure the energy sector, which are central to the resolution of the nonpayment problems and other difficulties besetting the economy. 18. The macroeconomic framework for 2001 envisages a continuation of the economic recovery, with a projected real GDP growth of 4 percent, and targets a substantial reduction of inflation. Exports are expected to continue to expand, but at a more moderate pace than in 2000, in view of the sustained growth foreseen for Ukraine’s main trading partners coupled with some deterioration in the competitiveness of the economy following the real effective exchange rate appreciation in 2000. Domestic demand is also projected to increase. as a consequence of additional reductions in social arrears and a pick-up in investment. The further expansion of the cash economy would contribute to the officially registered GDP growth. Economic growth will also be supported by a further strengthening of the institutional and business environment, including the ongoing market-oriented reforms in the agricultural and energy sectors. Enhanced transparency of privatization procedures would provide incentives for foreign direct investment and repatriation of Ukrainian capital. With prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and adjustments in administered prices for staples and communal services expected to be smaller than in 2000, the annual inflation rate is targeted to decline to about 13 percent. 19. The medium-term outlook for the Ukrainian economy has been revised on the basis of the most recent available information and the latest projections of the World Economic Outlook. The main macroeconomic projections and objectives for 2001-05 are to: (i) maintain real GDP growth at some 4-5 percent per year; (ii) reduce annual inflation from 27 percent in 2000 to below 10 percent by 2004; and (iii) gradually strengthen the gross offrcial reserves position of the NBU to above 8 weeks of import cover. Achieving these objectives would require an appropriately tight fiscal and monetary policy stance, in particular by reducing the consolidated budget deficit from 3 percent of GDP in 2001 to some 1% percent by 2005. This would allow government savings to increase and bring about a needed reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. The objective for economic growth is based on implementation of wide-ranging structural reforms to promote private sector activity, in order to increase gross nongovernment investment from an estimated 18% percent of GDP in 2000 to at least 21 percent by 2003. The external current account surplus is projected to narrow from almost 5 percent of GDP in 2000 to slightly above 1 percent by 2005.

The draft 2001 budget submitted to parliament for the first reading envisaged a consolidated deficit of about 4.8 percent of GDP. It was recognized. however, that the financing assumptions underlying this budget were unrealistic and that a deficit of that size would clearly lead to an unsustainable fiscal path. The budget for 2001 approved in the second reading targets an overall deficit of the general government of 3 percent of GDP, financed predominantly by privatization receipts. The widening of the overall deficit compared with the expected outcome in 2000 reflects several factors, including : (i) the tax- to-GDP ratio is expected to decline, largely owing to further rationalization of the tax system through the abolition of some nuisance taxes such as the innovation fund tax and the tax on depreciation allowance: (ii) the expenditure restraint, including a restrictive wage policy, which was observed in 2000 on account of shortfalls in privatization receipts and in foreign financing, could only be maintained on a temporary basis; and (iii) expenditure commitments in 200 1 provide fully for the energy needs of all budgetary organizations.6 21. The increase in the budget deficit in 2001 to 3 percent of GDP is consistent with a sustainable fiscal path, provided fiscal policies over the medium term aim at a gradual strengthening of the primary balance (Box 3). In this context, the staff cautioned the authorities against entering into commitments to cut tax rates unless these are preceded by measures to broaden the tax base. 22. The budget deficit would be financed by privatization receipts, with a limited recourse to domestic financing needed to offset negative net external financing. Given the uncertainty related to the timing and size of the privatization receipts, the government is committed to align the monthly expenditure pattern with that of available resources. This implies that spending policy would need to be sufficiently flexible and kept under strict control to reduce outlays in the event that privatization receipts fall short of the projected amount, while avoiding the accumulation of payments arrears. In the event that the privatization receipts turn out to be higher than programmed, the government is committed to use any excess amounts to reduce the net public indebtedness. 23. The uncertainties related to the timing and size of privatization proceeds make imperative the close monitoring of developments under the program. The envisaged quarterly reviews will pay special attention to the sustainability of the expenditure path, developments with respect to payments arrears. and the need for contingency measures. The reviews which will take place in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 will also concentrate on the 2002 budget. Over the course of 2001. the program does not envisage any domestic bank financing for the budget. 6A supplement to the staff report with a detailed description of the 2001 budget approved in the second reading in early December 2000 will be issued once full information becomes available.

Ukraine: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis, 1999-2010 A fiscal sustainability analysis was carried out of Ukraine’s domestic and external debt over the period 1999-2010. Given the present high debt service obligations, reaching a sustainable fiscal position would require a declining debt- to-GDP ratio. Under the baseline (program) scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from 50 percent in 2001 to below 30 percent by 2010.’ Several different scenarios were considered to examine possible vulnerability factors: . External vulnerability through a depreciated exchange rate and higher interest rates on external debt; . A more uncertain domestic environment, with higher real domestic interest rates; l Other factors, including the impact of lower economic growth and a deteriorated fiscal balance. As shown in the table below, Ukraine’s current debt position and fiscal stance are highly vulnerable to shifts in the external and domestic environment. A more adverse external environment would lead to a slightly increasing debt- to-GDP ratio in the outer years, and if combined with any other vulnerability factor, would lead to a fiscal position that rapidly becomes unsustainable. This result underlines the importance of maintaining primary surpluses in the range of 2 percent envisaged under the baseline scenario, corresponding to overall budget deficits of 1 L/z percent of GDP in the medium term.

The primary balance that would stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio can be calculated on the basis of the formula PB/GDP=Ci-g)* (Debt/GDP). where PB is the primary balance and i and p are the nominal interest and GDP growth rates, respectively. Under the baseline scenario. stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio. while taking account of projected privatization receipts and external interest payments. implies a primary balance of close to zero horn 2005.

Building on last year’s provisions. it also bans offsets, as well as government loan guarantees other than for loans from multilateral organizations. However, the extension of the coverage of extrabudgetary funds implemented in 2000 was reversed with the exclusion of the Employment, Social Insurance, Accident Insurance, and Leasing Funds, whose budgets amount to about 2 percent of GDP’. The authorities cited the tri-partite nature of these institutions as the reason for this reversal, but the staff believes that for governance reasons these extrabudgetary funds should be part of the budget. Furthermore, the key reform that would introduce a more rational, formula-based system of transfers from the central government to municipalities, for which the World Bank and bilateral donors had provided extensive technical assistance, has not been incorporated into the budget law.* The authorities agreed with the staff to take all necessary legislative preparations, in order to implement a full formula-based transfer system with the 2002 budget. 25. A draft tax code has been adopted by parliament in the first reading. It calls for reductions in the VAT rate from 20 percent to 17 percent, the enterprise profit tax (EPT) rate from 30 percent to 25 percent, and the maximum rate for the personal income tax (PIT) from 40 to 25 percent. In addition, the untaxed minimum under the PlT would be increased significantly. The draft tax code also considers measures to broaden the tax base. The authorities expect that the proposed tax rate reductions would be offset by the base- broadening measures, improved tax administration and compliance. and increased economic activity. The government and parliament have jointly decided to postpone discussions for the second reading to next year, so as to permit a more adequate preparation of the tax code for its implementation in 2002. The mission stressed that any cuts in tax rates should be accompanied by measures to ensure revenue neutrality. In this regard, the mission suggested that priority be given to broadening the tax base, maintaining the VAT rate at 20 percent, and lowering the EPT and maximum PJT rates gradually over a period of five years. 26. The authorities gave priority in the discussions to social concerns, following a strengthening of the targeted household assistance scheme and a significant reduction in social payments arrears in the course of 2000. To improve the effectiveness of the social safety net, all social programs are to be consolidated into a single targeted social assistance program by end-2001 under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. In addition, draft laws have been submitted to parliament to improve the compulsory state pension insurance ’ The program, however, will continue to monitor the deficit inclusive of extrabudgetary funds. * According to the current system, the distribution of transfers to oblasts is determined in an ad hoc manner, and oblasts have discretionary powers over their distribution to municipalities. The 2001 budget would move towards a hybrid system whereby oblasts will receive the amounts calculated by the formula. but retain the discretion over their distribution.

B. Monetary and Exchange Bate Policies 27. The authorities are committed to strengthening the official external reserves position in 2001, while keeping monetary aggregates under control with a view to lowering the annual inflation rate to about 13 percent. The monetary program provides for a moderate increase in broad money, in line with the projected growth of nominal GDP, through a tight control of reserve money growth. The net domestic assets of the NBU are programmed to remain virtually stable during 2001, thereby enabling a further improvement in the net foreign assets position. The quarterly phasing of the monetary program reflects mainly the expected timing of foreign exchange inflows related to the privatization program. In fact, close to three-fourths of the total amount of budgeted privatization receipts (some 2.2 percent of GDP) are expected to be collected only in the fourth quarter of 200 1. Accordingly, the NBU intends to keep monetary aggregates largely stable through September 2001. The money multiplier is programmed to increase from 1.9 to above 2, reflecting the authorities’ intention to continue reducing gradually reserve requirements during 2001, in order to lower the cost of banking activities and, in particular, to reduce the large spread between deposit and lending rates of commercial banks (Figure 4). These reductions would be effected as inflation begins to abate. Velocity would continue its downward path, as a result of the sustained economic stabilization. the prolonged stability of the hryvnia, and the monetization of the economy. With the budget deficit being financed by privatization receipts, net bank credit to the government would decrease marginally during 200 1, thus making room for a further real growth of credit to the private sector. 28. The authorities expressed their satisfaction with the functioning of the foreign exchange market. While they recognized the contribution of the stable hryvnia to economic stabilization, they stressed their willingness to manage the exchange rate flexibly. The staff concurred with this stance, as the substantial foreign exchange inflows in 2000 that were attributable to the external current account surplus, the capital inflows associated with the privatization program, and the increasing role of cash transactions in the economy, are likely to continue. The authorities are aware that sustained capital inflows would present the NBU with complex policy challenges. In this context, they noted that the ongoing shift to cash transactions in the economy was also expected to apply to payments for energy imports which would help equilibrate the foreign exchange market. At the same time, they stressed the upward potential for the remonetization of the economy if growth and financial stability were sustained. They noted that they were prepared to accelerate debt reduction operations in the presence of strong capital inflows. The authorities’ assessment of the vulnerability of the financial system to changes in interest rates and the exchange rate was that the level of risk was manageable given the limited open external position of the banking system, the relative absence of derivative commitments, and a balanced maturity mix of the banks’ assets and liabilities (both of which are largely short-term).

The authorities are committed to putting in place the structural reforms necessary to support financial stability and increased private sector investment and output. A key area in this regard will be privatization. The Cabinet of Ministers recently approved a privatization list for 2001 that was discussed with the World Bank and targets privatization receipts in an amount equivalent to 3 percent of GDP. To help ensure the success of the planned privatizations and encourage transparency, financial advisors and open bidding procedures will be used for tenders of all large enterprises. Major components of the privatization program for 2001 include the sale of all government-held shares in six electricity distribution companies (oblenergos), and of a substantial minority stake in the telecommunications company (Ukrtelecom). Tenders will be issued shortly for financial advisors to assist in the privatization of 13 remaining oblenergos in which the State holds a majority share. The privatization of Ukrtelecom and of the second group of oblenergos, comprising the bulk of expected privatization receipts in 200 1, is foreseen to take place in the last quarter of the year. Legislation to amend the negative list of enterprises excluded from privatization, which would free some 200 additional enterprises for privatization, is currently being discussed in parliament. In consultation with the World Bank, the government will undertake annual ex- post reviews of privatizations. Such reviews would be useful to assure potential investors that transparent privatization procedures were followed, and would provide guidance on how the procedures can be improved. The authorities will provide by end-March 2001 a full account of the privatizations undertaken in 2000 to parliament and the public. 30. Enhanced payments discipline in the energy sector will be essential to reduce the fiscal burden of nonpayments, strengthen transparency, and improve efficiency in energy utilization. The privatization of the energy distribution companies will be a major step in this direction, and transparency will be further enhanced by monthly audits of the central gas transit account and the regional settlement accounts for oblenergos. In addition, the authorities are committed to increasing the cash collection ratios for gas and electricity to 65 percent by end-2001, and to pursuing a firm policy of cutting off nonpaying consumers (Annex I, Table 1). An audit of Naftogaz is currently under way, which should provide the basis for steps to increase the contribution of the gas sector to the budget. In the coal sector, the authorities intend to continue their policy of shutting down unprofitable mines; already in 2000,20 mines have been transferred to the agency responsible for mine closure, with another 25 to be transferred next year.’ 31. The discussions on the banking sector focused on the need to strengthen banking legislation and accelerate the restructuring of major problem banks. The staff also expressed its concern that the large spreads between bank deposit and lending rates are an indication that the banking system remains vulnerable. In the legislative area, the authorities expect to 9 A total of 280 mines were inherited from the Soviet era, of which about 80 have been closed.

In September 2000, an NBU resolution was issued to limit the operations of Bank Ukraina and a provisional administrator has been appointed. The problems of Bank Ukraina are being addressed on three fronts: (i) the provisional administrator of Bank Ukraina has initiated action to recover bad loans, including from former insiders, and to cut the operating costs of the bank by closing unprofitable branches and reducing excess staffing; (ii) the NBU, in cooperation with the government, has decided to remove household deposits from Bank Ukraina; and (iii) the NBU and the government have entered into discussions with the World Bank on the restructuring of Bank Ukraina. The authorities want to proceed cautiously in this area given the need to guard against financial instability as well as the need to protect the access of the rural population to banking services. The staff stressed the benefits of resolving uncertainties at an early stage, as well as the need to be mindful of the fiscal cost of the various options which might be considered. 32. In early 2000. some progress had been achieved in implementing the recovery plan for the Savings Bank that was agreed upon with the NBU. In line with the reform program supported by the World Bank’s Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL), the Savings Bank was to become a vehicle for support of small and medium-sized firms. More recently, however, the bank has increased its loan portfolio substantially by lending to the electricity sector. In view of the substantial risks involved. the NBU has placed a ceiling on the Saving Bank’s exposure to the energy sector which will remain in place until the energy loans are repaid. The authorities stressed that the Savings Bank’s loans to the energy sector were being serviced in a timely manner and that the improved ability of the energy companies to service their financial obligations would be sustained in line with their rising cash collections. The authorities also noted that their ability to exercise effective oversight over the financial system would be strengthened significantly once the Law on Banks and Banking Activity has been passed. 33. The authorities also intend to ensure that communal tariffs remain at cost-recovery levels; these tariffs will be adjusted semi-annually in line with changes in the costs of the related services. Regarding the export tax on sunflower seeds, the authorities have indicated that they intend to replace the current rate of 23 percent with one of 10 percent by end-2000 (Annex I, Table 2). A review of the Free Economic Zones and Special Investment Regimes is expected to be completed by end-April 2001, with a view to substantially reducing privileges and tax exemptions, including through contingency measures to safeguard fiscal sustainability. The authorities are undertaking a number of measures to strengthen the environment for private business. Current efforts to revise legislation on certification and standardization would, if implemented, put Ukrainian guidelines in these areas in conformity with European Union norms. In agriculture, efforts are ongoing to liberalize the sector through revisions of the land code, title registration and mortgage laws. The government is continuing to reduce its involvement in the provision of agriculture inputs and will not interfere in the marketing of outputs.

Following the sharp turnaround in the trade balance during 1999-2000, the external current account surplus is projected to narrow from almost 5 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 2 percent of GDP in 2001 (Table 6). This reflects a return of export growth to a more modest pace and the full-year impact of higher energy import prices. Over the medium term, the external current account surplus is projected to stabilize at some 1 percent of GDP as the growth of nonenergy imports picks up in line with GDP growth. 35. Large debt-service payments fell due in 2000, but debt-service obligations are expected to moderate over the medium term. External official debt service payments in 2000, before rescheduling and excluding arrears, amounted to about $3.2 billion (of which $1 billion to the Fund). Exceptional program financing was relatively modest, totaling $70 million from the World Bank, while privatization receipts are projected at about $200 million. The restructuring of official debt to private creditors in April 2000 yielded important savings in debt service payments of about $0.9 billion.” The proposed purchase of SDR 191 million from the Fund would bridge the remaining financing needs in 2000. 36. Payments arrears of Naftogaz to its suppliers increased by about $300 million during the first 10 months of 2000-bringing the stock of such arrears, including contract penalties, to about $1.8 billion. The Naftogaz arrears are considered non-official, despite the status of Naftogaz as the dominant and fully government-owned gas supplier; negotiations on the status and resolution of these arrears are taking place. The options that are being considered include the possibility of granting a concession to an international consortium of the gas transportation network. 37. In view of continuing large debt service obligations, the external cash flow situation for 2001 remains tight, despite the private debt rescheduling and the external current account surplus (Table 7). Moreover. significant uncertainties remain concerning the gas arrears. the ongoing renegotiation of the gas transit contract with Gazprom. capital flows. and the rebound in imports. The program identifies a financing gap of about $2.4 billion over the period 2000-02. The financing need is large in relation to official reserves. and is expected to be covered by drawings from the Fund under the current lo Bondholders received new amortizing bonds with seven years maturity including a one- year grace period, and a 10 percent coupon in Euros or 11 percent in US dollars. On the completion of the exchange, bondholders received cash payment of accrued interest, but no payment of principal.

The authorities’ medium-term debt strategy aims at gradually reducing the exposure of the budget to private debt in order to reduce interest costs and uncertainties resulting from debt roll-over needs. This strategy calls for reliance on multilateral and bilateral debt, and privatization receipts to finance the budget deficit. and for net repayments of external private debt. As a step toward reducing external vulnerability, the NBU targets an increase in gross usable international reserves to $1.6 billion or the equivalent of about 4% weeks of imports by end-December 2001. 39. Significant progress was made in the liberalization of the trade system. The 2 percent import surcharge was eliminated at end-1999; at about the same time, the maximum tariff rate was reduced from 30 to 25 percent. Some quantitative restrictions remain in place, notably on used cars and scrap metal. All remaining exchange restrictions have been eliminated. V. TRANSPARENCY AND GOVERNANCE 40. The authorities have also stressed their determination to improve transparency, strengthen governance, and roll back corruption, including by: (a) enhancing accountability through improved accounting standards, regular audits. and reporting; and (b) strengthening of the legal system. Audits are to be used to increase accountability of public enterprises and institutions, including Naftogaz, the State Material Reserves Company, and the electricity market. Ln September 1999, the authorities completed the fiscal transparency questionnaire prepared by Fund staff, in the context of an experimental Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) for Ukraine (EBS/99/158; 9/3/99). The authorities’ and the staffs assessment highlighted the progress made, but also identified critical issues that needed to be addressed to improve transparency and effectiveness of the fiscal management system. Additional measures that need to be implemented in the area of accounting include improving the public finance statistics and reporting in line with the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) system; incorporating all extrabudgetary funds and accounts in the budget; and issuing regular reporting to parliament on tax arrears. At the NBU, regular quarterly audits of the reported international reserves are being carried out and its reserve management practices have been strengthened. All the documentation required under the Fund’s safeguard assessment has been provided. ” An official Ukrainian team has been established to liaise with the Paris Club secretariat, and with official bilateral creditors. For program financing purposes, a rescheduling of arrears and principal payments falling due in 2001 on standard nonconcessional terms is assumed. No public debt payments on gas arrears debt have been assumed. A supplement with additional information on external financing will be issued to the Executive Board in due course, after the Paris Club meeting in early December.

New legislation on joint-stock companies is expected to be adopted in early 2001 to enhance protection of minority-shareholders’ rights, and a new law on public procurement in line with European Union directives is being implemented. The government is considering associating with the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials and the OECD-based Financial Action Task Force. In addition, lists of the 50 largest delinquent tax-payers and energy users will be published and management of deficient public enterprises removed. VI. STAFFAPPRAISAL 42. Since late 1999 the economic situation has improved, mainly on account of gains in external competitiveness stemming from the sharp real depreciation in 1999. Over the course of 2000, the basic framework for economic policy implementation has also improved gradually. Macroeconomic policies have been generally sound while a number of structural problems. which had been identified as key obstacles to growth during the 199Os, a decade of continued output decline, have begun to be tackled. Judging by the standards of what has been achived by successful transition economies, the challenges that still need to be faced by Ukraine are quite substantial. The task ahead will thus have to be to both deepen and broaden the reform efforts. Against this backdrop, the adoption of a 2001 budget in line with the requirements of macroeconomic stability and growth provides an indication of the authorities’ continued commitment to economic reforms. In the staffs assessment, the program set out in the attached letter and described in this report is appropriately strong and deserves Fund support. 43. The authorities’ overall economic strategy based on a sound budget, tight monetary policies, and supportive structural reforms will, if pursued persistently, create a durable basis for economic growth, thereby allowing improved standards of living and reduced incidence of poverty. The broad-based economic expansion in 2000 is quite impressive but continued efforts to foster conducive conditions for private sector investment will be indispensable to maintain the rate of growth in the period ahead. The targeted reduction in inflation in 2001 is appropriate given the need to ensure that the inflationary momentum, to which a number of special factors contributed in 2000, does not become embedded in the economy and threaten the authorities’ growth objectives. 44. In order to ensure that the budget deficit will be limited to 3 percent of GDP, it is essential that the expenditure plan for 2001 take into account the expected timing of privatization receipts and the risk that there might be shortfalls relative to the envisaged amounts. At the same time, if privatization receipts were to exceed the programmed amount, it would be essential to use the excess amounts solely for debt reduction operations. 45. The structural improvements included in the budget are welcome, notably the reduction of payments arrears and netting operations, and the steps taken to prepare the introduction of formula-based intergovernmental transfers. However, the staff regrets the removal of extrabudgetary funds from the 2001 budget and calls for their reintegration.

A stable hryvnia and a strengthened external position were the main achievements of monetary policy in 2000. The staff concurs with the authorities that under current circumstances the level of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate. However, the NBU’s future intervention in the foreign exchange market should not target any particular level of the exchange rate; in fact, the NBU should be prepared to accept significantly greater exchange rate flexibility, particularly if strong capital inflows or outflows were to materialize. 47. The situation in the financial system, especially with regard to Bank Ukraina, is a cause for concern. The staff supports the authorities’ emphasis on protecting Bank Ukraina’s household deposits, reducing its operating losses, and deciding on a credible solution to the bad loans problem. It would be essential to proceed expeditiously to resolve the uncertainties and minimize the fiscal costs of a medium-term strategy for Bank Ukraina. In addition, the soundness of the Savings Bank will need to be monitored closely. Enactment by parliament of the Law on Banks and Banking Activity is critical to provide a firm foundation for NBU’s oversight activities and its ability to deal with problem banks. The staff welcomes the envisaged close involvement of the World Bank in the financial sector reform efforts. including for Bank Ukraina and the Savings Bank. 48. Given the need to reduce the role of the state in the Ukrainian economy, the importance of accelerating the privatization of public enterprises, especially in the energy and telecommunication sectors. is beyond question. In this context, the fairness of the privatization process will be crucial if public support for market reforms is to be maintained. Given that not one large enterprise thus far has been sold through transparent bidding procedures, the authorities will need to redouble their efforts in this area. Accordingly, the staff welcomes the adoption by parliament of a transparent privatization law for 2000-02. as well as its emphasis on sales of majority shares to strategic investors, while minimizing investment conditions and using financial advisors and open tenders. The ex-post reviews of privatization operations, to be implemented in cooperation with the World Bank, will be important in ensuring that appropriate procedures be maintained. 49. The problem of nonpayments in the energy sector has been a long-standing obstacle to macroeconomic stability. The authorities are to be commended for substantially reducing nonpayments in this sector over the course of 2000. The target of a cash collection ratio of 65 percent established for end-2001 is ambitious; thus, the authorities should intensify their efforts-through short term measures such as cutting off nonpayers and longer term measures as privatization and introducing competition-in order to attain these targets and improve on them. indeed, as long as the collection ratios are not brought much closer to 100 percent, the continuing need to finance the underlying subsidy presents a potential threat to macroeconomic stability.

Other elements of the authorities’ reform agenda-efforts to reduce the cost of doing business, agriculture reforms, and the streamlining of public administration-have been addressed with some vigor over the course of 2000 and will thus contribute to improving the growth potential of the economy. The staff endorses the authorities’ plans to strengthen their efforts to improve transparency and governance, notably by expanding reliance on independent audits, and encourages them to implement these reforms resolutely. 51. The staff commends the government for its implementation of a comprehensive strategy to reschedule sovereign debt to private and official creditors. Given the disruptive potential of large commercial arrears, especially to energy exporters in Russia, the authorities’ efforts to encourage Naftogaz to regularize its relations with suppliers are welcomed. The authorities’ objective of greater integration with the world economy will be served well by accelerating the effort to join the WTO and reducing trade distortions, most notably the export taxes. 52. While there has been substantial progress in statistics, weaknesses in key areas persist; thus, the authorities are urged to continue their efforts to strengthen statistical systems. Although the weaknesses in Ukraine’s statistics hamper somewhat the analysis of economic developments, they do not prevent a meaningful assessment of the economic and financial situation. In the area of technical assistance, the consultation procedures recently undertaken proved helpful in evaluating the outcome of previous technical assistance and identifying priorities for the future. 53. It is proposed that access under the arrangement be maintained, but its phasing be adjusted to take account of the changed period of the arrangement (Table 9). Access is warranted in view of the low level of external reserves, the catalytic effect of Fund lending, and additional debt restructuring from the Paris Club and other bilateral official creditors. Given the length of time over which the program was inoperative, the authorities’ request to rephase the schedule of purchases under the arrangement and to extend its duration deserves support. 54. The main downside risks of the program include shortfalls and timing uncertainties in privatization receipts, vulnerabilities in the financial system. a worsening of the external environment for current and capital transactions, and difficulties in maintaining domestic political support in favor of reforms. It is also possible that large scale capital inflows would confront the NBU with complex policy choices. Nevertheless, the improvement in the authorities’ record of policy implementation gives some grounds for optimism that policies would be strengthened if these risks materialized. In this context, quarterly reviews of the program will provide a framework for continued policy dialog with the authorities. Repayment obligations to the Fund, while relatively high over the next two years, would still be low in terms of exports (less than 3 percent; Table 8), while the risk of nonpayment is low. Accordingly, the staff recommends that the Fund approve the extension of the EFF arrangement, the completion of the fourth review thereunder, and the request for waivers for the breach of the performance criteria at mid-September and end-December 1999.

The rate was initially informally pegged to the dollar. In September 1997, the peg was replaced by a formal band of Hrv 1.7~Hrv 1.9 per U.S. dollar. The limits of the band were moved on several occasions, most recently on February 9, 1999 to Hvr 3.ti.6 per U.S. dollar. Since March 19, 1999 the exchange rate for the hryvnia has Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-44- APPENDIX I been allowed to be determined by the interbank market for foreign exchange. On February 22, 2000, the NBU officially confirmed its intention of allowing the free float of the hryvnia. On October 27. 2000 the hryvnia stood at Hrv 5.44 per U.S. dollar. On September 23. 1996, Ukraine accepted the obligations of Article VIII. Sections 2.3. and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and two remaining restrictions were eliminated in May 1997. A number of new restrictions were introduced in September 1998. The restrictions on current international transactions introduced in September 1998 were removed in March 1999. VIII.

As of October 14, 2000. the World Bank commitments to Ukraine totaled $2,840.1 million and net disbursements amounted to $2.098 9 million. Country Assistance Strategy The World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ukraine on September 12,200O. Its main objective is to assist the Government and civil society in obtaining sustained growth and poverty reduction in Ukraine. To do so, the strategy addresses the institution-building challenges faced by Ukraine both from the demand side (civil society) and supply side (government). It proposes a $1.8 billion Base Case lending program to support structural reforms and a $461 million Low Case lending program for investment support in environment, private sector development, health, education, agriculture title distribution and social mitigation of coal sector restructuring. A distinct feature of the new Ukraine CAS is its intensified focus on social issues as well as areas that address globally important issues (tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS. environment). The strategy also relies on a stronger civil society as a key component for progress in institutional reform and poverty reduction. The CAS presents a two-legged strategy: a the first (under the Low Case) aims to support civil society in its demand for better governance, and address globally sensitive areas; and a the second (which would be added under the Base Case) aims to support opportunities to strengthen institutions that foster sustainable development. when these opportunities present themselves. Ukraine is at present in the Low Case assistance mode. Moving to the Base Case scenario would require, in addition to a sustainable macroeconomic framework (e.g., full resumption and timely subsequent implementation of the lMF’ s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program), achievement of agreed-upon Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) benchmarks in the five cross-sectoral issues mentioned below. These, in addition to being triggers for the Base Case, will also be the conditions for the first, one-tranche PAL to be presented to the Executive Board for approval.

Approximately ten other operations are in the pipeline. The public sector reform program includes the Treasury System Project ($16.4 million) currently under implementation, which is designed to help the government in creating an efficient budget management system. Additional projects are under preparation: a series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALS), which are conceived as a sequence of three separate operations, totaling up to $750 million, with disbursements depending entirely on performance. The PAL will cover five cross-sectoral issues: (,i) financial accountability, (ii) regulatory framework, (iii) property rights, (iv) public sector accountability and (v) social sustainability. The second operation is a Tax Administration Modemization Project ($100 million). Two new projects are planned for the fiscal years 2002 and 2003-Public Administration Incentives Reform ($60 million) and Statistics Modemization ($30 million). The agriculture sector program includes a Rural Land Titling Project ($100 million). which will support the distribution of land titles to new land owners and a Title Registration Project that would support the development of a modem title registration system. A Rural Finance Project ($100 million) is envisaged in fiscal year 2003.

The EBRD pursues a strategy of supporting Ukraine’s transformation toward a market economy, promoting the business environment and improving the investment climate for all investors. The EBRD’s first country strategy for Ukraine was approved in October 1992 and was revised in November 1993. These two documents underlined the need for financing private sector projects, developing the financial sector and rehabilitating existing infrastructure. A revised strategy was proposed in March 1995 to respond to the needs of transition and this guided the EBRD’s activities during 1995 and 1996. In June 1997, the Board of Directors approved a new strategy for the Bank’s activities in Ukraine which included the development of the private sector, restructuring the energy sector. strengthening of the financial sector. reform of key infrastructure sectors and continued efforts to improve nuclear safety in the context of the Bank’s Energy Operations Policy. This period saw a considerable expansion of the Bank’s activities in Ukraine. However, it was apparent that the investment climate remained difficult, which deterred foreign direct investment and led to part of the growing private sector operating in the informal economy. In proposing its latest strategy for Ukraine, which was discussed by the Board in July 2000 and formally approved a month later, the EBRD proposed a more coordinated approach. There would be greater emphasis on policy dialogue with the Ukraine authorities, other IFIs and donor agencies to advance the countries immediate transition objectives and support the Bank’s operational strategy. The latter will focus on four key areas of the economy, namely: 1. Strengthening of the financial sector and supporting the needs of SMEs; 7 -. Promoting the commercialization and structural reform of public utilities. services and improving energy efficiency; 3. Improving nuclear safety through the Nuclear Safety Account and the Chemoybl Shelter Fund initiatives. and considering the K2R4 project for the completion of two nuclear power plants; and 4. Supporting the transition of the enterprise sector, especially in agribusiness, consumer products and intermediate goods. The EBRD’s ability to implement the strategy and explore new business opportunities in the private sector will be enhanced by the decision, put into effect earlier in the year, to strengthen the EBRD’s local office in Ukraine. including the appointment of the Director for Banking Operation’s in Ukraine, based in Kyiv. The Bank’s portfolio in Ukraine has increased from 5 projects in 1994 to 39 by the end of October 2000. These amount to a net business volume of EUR 1,121 million. Of this amount EUR 953 million represented the Portfolio (defined as Operating Assets, which are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- APPENDIX IV comparable to disbursements. and undrawn commitments); Operating Assets amounted to EUR337 million at the end of October 2000. Twenty nine projects are with private borrowers and investors with a corresponding commitment of EUR 455 million. There are a further 10 projects with the state sector to which EUR 497 million of funds are committed. The Bank’s portfolio ratio was estimated at 48 percent to the private sector and 52 percent to the state sector at the end of October 2000. The outstanding commitments to Ukraine represent almost 8 percent of the total of the Bank’s commitments to all its countries of operation. There are in addition Technical Cooperation activities in Ukraine and these currently include over 140 projects for some EUR 30 million and are mainly related to project preparation and implementation. Projects in the financial sector account for slightly over 19 percent of the Bank’s commitment to Ukraine, with much of this represented by the loans provided under sovereign guarantee to support the development of small and medium size companies in Ukraine through lending via participating banks. The first of these loans (for EUR 143 million) was signed at the end of 1994, and is now almost fully disbursed. A second credit line (for EUR 52 million) was signed at the time of the Bank’s Annual Meeting in Kyiv in May 1998, although was only approved by the Rada in early 2000. The energy sector accounts for a further 38 percent of all commitments. The largest single project in this category is in the power sector; other projects include the development of oil and gas resources, gas transit and energy efftciency. Projects in manufacturing, including agribusiness, account for 23 percent, transport 10 percent, telecommunications 8 percent, with extractive industries accounting for most of the remaining 2 percent of all commitments.

The country’s IFS page has been published since July 1996, and the Ukrainian authorities are working towards subscribing to the special data dissemination standard (SDDS) by end-2001. A new Statistics law was approved by Parliament in July 2000. Despite progress, however, there remain substantial shortcomings in Ukraine’s economic statistics, particularly in national accounts, government finance statistics, and balance of payments data. A multi-sector statistical advisor sponsored by the Fund has been in place since March 1994. Key statistical data are generally provided in a timely manner, as summarized below. 1. Real Sector The national accounts suffer from many weaknesses, including: (i) a large informal economy and inadequate coverage of source data for these activities; (ii) unduly heavy reliance on complete censuses of enterprises as opposed to sample surveys; (iii) insuffrcient elimination of holding gains, which leads to an overstatement of the value of recorded production; (iv) the use of “comparable price” deflation methodology which is liable to conceptual errors for quarterly data; and (v) collection of many source data on a cumulative, as opposed to discrete, basis and the ensuing adherence to an inappropriate revision policy. Major initiatives currently underway are to improve the quality of the quarterly national accounts (QNA), and update the methodology of the monthly industrial production index. Missions of the Statistics Department (STA) visited Ukraine in October 1998 and May 1999 and provided recommendations on improvements in these areas. Ukrainian consumer price statistics have benefited from a series of Fund missions. The development of a 26&y monthly CPI has resulted in the availability of a broad-based measure of price change that meets international standards for price collection and index calculation. However, a times series presentation has not yet been adopted. A revised PPI is to be introduced during 200 1. A new construction price index using a “model pricing” methodology was to have been implemented early this year, but the work has been delayed. External trade data suffer from undercoverage, among other things, related, in particular, to shuttle trade, smuggling, and valuation issues. Development of exports and imports volume and unit value indices have started but implementation is being delayed. Progress on real sector issues is broadly hampered by lack of funds to support further automation of the calculation of the quarterly national accounts estimates and price indices. The authorities have expressed some interest recently in designing a smaller and more efficient consumer price index sample, as recommended by a 1998 STA mission, which could release some resources for these and other needs.

Government Finance The Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the State Treasury of Ukraine (STU) have made considerable progress in the compilation of fiscal data. Monthly data on the operations of the central and regional government are now available within 25 days of the end of the reference period. Although the monthly fiscal data currently disseminated by the State Statistics Committee (SSC) do not correspond with international presentation formats, the MoF intends to create an inter-agency working group in the near future to address these issues. No government finance data are published in IFS, partly as a result of differences between the MoF and the STU about which bears the responsibility for compilation and reporting and the need to adapt reporting formats to international standards. For the 1998 budget, government finances were for the first time presented in a functional classification which complied broadly with GFS standards for both the federal and the local governments. In addition, federal budget expenditure was broken down by economic categories and the authorities are currently working on an economic presentation of local governments’ expenditures. The Treasury reports monthly data (on expenditure in a functional classification) to the European II Department (EU2). These data are subsequently adjusted by EU2, which requests additional data to cover the operations of the Pension Fund and to make the data more comparable to IMF-GFS standards. The Treasury started providing monthly expenditure data by economic classifications in November 1998. 3. Money and Banking Statistics Ukraine has received extensive technical assistance in money and banking statistics, and substantial improvements have already been made. The last two technical assistance missions in the area of monetary statistics took place in March-April 1999 and in February- March 2000. The missions reviewed compilation procedures used on the basis of the charts of accounts introduced in 1998 for the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and commercial banks. and resolved many important outstanding methodological issues relating to the compilation of monetary data. The monetary data are now compiled in accordance with international statistical standards and are generally of good quality. Unified reporting to EU2 and STA has been established, and data are reported regularly to the Fund with a lag of l-2 months. However, a problem that has emerged recently has been the departure of experienced staff, which could result in a deterioration in the compilation and dissemination of data. 4. Balance of Payments Statistics Ukraine reports balance of payments statistics to STA on a regular and timely basis. The principal data sources are a closed ITRS, administrative data sources, and balance of payments surveys of enterprises. Balance of payments data are methodologically sound, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - APPENDIX V based on BPMS concepts and definitions. Implementation of international accounting standards broadly suitable for compilation. as well as computerized balance of payments data management and processing, have provided a solid basis for data quality improvement. Major data weaknesses exist in the measurement of short-term private sector debt (coverage and composition). interenterprise arrears (receivables, payables), and trade in goods, particularly shuttle trade and smuggling. In addition, survey data are subject to bias resulting from large non-response rate and the use of an outdated business register. Over 1992-98. there were six balance of payments statistics missions to Ukraine. A delegation from the NBU visited STA during May 24-29. 1998, to discuss issues of current interest concerning ITRS developments and ways of addressing deficiencies in external trade statistics, including using partner country sources in adjusting offkial trade statistics.

Following the gradual stabilization of the economy in 1999 in the aftermath of the Russia crisis, real GDP growth in 2000 turned positive for the first time since independence, and is expected to reach some 4 percent for the year as a whole. The improved growth performance stemmed in large part from the positive response to the real effective exchange rate depreciation of the hryvnia in 1999; better-than- expected growth in Russia, as well as a recovery in other export markets, notably of metals; and increased gas imports from Russia in the 199912000 winter season, despite continued non-payment problems, which enabled a strong industrial rebound. Ukraine’s external position improved significantly in 1999, and the external current account surplus is expected to increase further to almost 5 percent of GDP in 2000. reflecting the strong export growth in volume terms and a modest increase in non-energy imports. Large debt-service payments fell due in 2000. but debt service pressures were moderated by the rescheduling in April 2000 of official debt to private creditors. The nominal exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2000, after having depreciated by 34 percent in U.S. dollar terms in 1999. The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) purchased significant amounts of foreign exchange in the interbank market in 2000, which allowed gross international reserves to remain mostly above a level equivalent to 3 weeks of imports, while significant payments were made to the Fund. However, annual inflation rose to 27 percent in 2000. up from 19 percent in 1999, partly reflecting the unsterilized intervention by the NBU and increases in administered prices. As a result, the competitiveness gains achieved in 1999 were eroded somewhat as the real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 7% percent during the first nine months of 2000. ’ Under Article IV of the IMFs Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director. as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Boards discussion are described. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - APPENDIX VI Following a mixed record in 1999, the fiscal position improved markedly through September 2000. The overall cash deficit of the general government is projected at about 1% percent of GDP in 2000. against an outcome of almost 2% percent in 1999, as revenues performed better than foreseen and expenditures were kept in check. Except for some limited netting operations in the first quarter of 2000, the government has refrained from accepting noncash payments. Arrears in the social sectors were reduced by 1 .l percent of GDP, with pension fund arrears eliminated by end-September. Some payments arrears, however, were accumulated in the energy and utility sectors. Monetary policy in 1999 was marked by the government’s heavy reliance on NBU financing, while during the first nine months of 2000. the growth of monetary aggregates was dominated by the unsterilized foreign exchange intervention by the NBU. Broad money grew by 40 percent for 1999 as a whole, with a build-up in liquidity in the banking system toward the end of the year. During the first nine months of 2000, base and broad money increased by 24 percent and 3 1 percent, respectively. The NBU bought more than $1 billion in the foreign exchange market, mostly from February through August, reflecting the strengthened balance of payments situation. These large purchases matched significant private sector inflows in 2000 to finance purchases of state enterprises and the monetization of the economy. Some progress has been made on structura1 reforms. In the area of public enterprise reform. a new privatization law was passed in early 2000 and a law was recently adopted permitting the sale of a minority share in the telecommunications company Ukrtelecom. However, no single large enterprise has yet been sold through open and transparent bidding procedures. In the energy sector, payments discipline was strengthened in 2000, and progressively higher cash collection ratios for gas and electricity through September were achieved. Communal tariffs for public utilities were eventually raised in most areas of the country. The law establishing the 30 percent export tax on oil seeds was vetoed. but subsequently approved at a lower rate of 23 percent. During the course of 1999 and early 2000. significant progress was made in the area of public administration reform. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-58- ANNEX1 December 5,200O Mr. Horst Kiihler The Managing Director International Monetary Fund Washington, DC. 2043 1 Dear Mr. K6hler: 1. Since the completion of the third review under the Extended Arrangement in September 1999, the financial and economic situation in Ukraine has improved markedly. In particular, a recovery of economic activity in late 1999 has turned into a broadly based economic expansion in 2000; external debt to the private sector has been successfully rescheduled; the exchange rate has remained stable; and the international reserves position was strengthened. On the structural front, a number of important measures were taken, including the improvement of payments discipline in the energy sector; major reforms in the agricultural sector; the elimination of non- cash revenue offsets and significant reduction of discretionary tax exemptions; the lowering of the maximum import tariff rate from 30 percent to 25 percent; the drastic reduction of payments arrears on government wages and social benefits, and the virtual elimination of pension arrears; the increase of communal tariffs to cost-recovery levels practically all over Ukraine; a streamlining of the public administration; and the passage of a privatization law fostering transparent procedures. 2. Notwithstanding the improvements outlined above, further progress is required to consolidate Ukraine’s financial position and create a solid base for sustainable economic growth. The annual inflation rate exceeded our target and rose from 19 percent in 1999 to an expected 27 percent in 2000, reflecting increases in administered prices, notably communal tariffs, higher prices for energy imports and some staples, and the impact of purchases of foreign exchange by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). The consolidated budget deficit (cash basis) for 2000 is expected to be lower than foreseen owing to strong revenue performance coupled with shortfalls in foreign financing and privatization receipts. However, arrears on energy and other non-social payments remain a serious problem. Looking ahead we see the greatest need for further action with regard to reforming the banking sector, especially with regard to Bank Ukraina; ensuring the transparency of privatization operations; further improving payments discipline in the energy sector; rationalizing financial relations between the central and local governments; and further reducing distortions in the tax and foreign trade systems. 3. We are determined to consolidate the progress made by tightening fiscal and monetary policies, and by accelerating key structural reforms necessary to ensure sustained growth. In this regard, the following measures have already been implemented: (a) the 2001 government budget was approved by parliament in the second reading with a deficit of 3 percent of GDP; and (b) a privatization list for 2001 consistent with the budget has been submitted to parliament. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59 - ANNEX I 4. On the basis of these actions and our policy intentions set forth below, we request completion of the fourth review under the Extended Arrangement and, in order to permit the resumption of purchases, the granting of waivers for nonobservance of performance criteria. In view of the length of the period during which the arrangement was inoperative, we also request an extension of the arrangement and a rephasing of the remaining purchases under the arrangement. VII. THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 5. The main macroeconomic objectives under our medium-term strategy are to: (i) maintain real GDP growth at a rate of not less than 4-5 percent in 2001-05; (ii) reduce annual inflation from an expected 27 percent in 2000 to less than 10 percent by 2004; and (iii) gradually strengthen the gross official reserves position of the NBU. Fiscal policy will aim at strictly limiting the consolidated budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2001 and reducing it to a more sustainable level from 2002 onwards, in order to increase government savings and bring about a much-needed reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Achieving this objective will allow monetary policy to focus on keeping inflation under control. and thus help ensure a stable exchange rate. Our growth strategy is based on promoting private sector activity and investment by accelerating privatization, eliminating excessive regulations and controls, reducing government intervention in economic activity, improving the equity of the tax structure, curbing corruption, and developing a judicial framework necessary for a market economy. VIII. THE PROGRAM FOR 2001 6. Within the medium-term framework outlined above, we have elaborated a program for the period October 1,2000-December 3 1,200l. as detailed in the attached policy matrix (Table 3). The proposed quarterly quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and quantitative structural benchmarks for December 3 1.2000 and March 3 1.2001 are set out in Table 1. Prior actions and structural benchmarks are listed in Table 2. With a view to strengthening the role of cash transactions and market forces in our economy, we propose to include a new performance criterion related to netting operations on consolidated government obligations and two structuraI benchmarks on cash collection ratios for gas and electricity. We will review the program targets with the Fund in the context of the fifth EFF review, which is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2001. A program review will be conducted in each subsequent quarter through the second quarter of 2002. We understand that, in each case. completion of the review will be a condition for the release of the corresponding purchase. A. Fiscal Policy 7. The government has adopted an ambitious fiscal program that aims to further consolidate government finances, improve the tax structure and widen the tax base, better target public expenditures in line with priorities for structural reform, and improve the transparency of government operations. Building on good progress in 2000, the 2001 budget law prohibits netting and non-cash operations, and government loan guarantees (other than for loans from multilateral organizations). In addition, the coverage of the budget has been widened to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - ANNEX I encompass all privatization receipts (including those that are earmarked), all external project loans that are on-lent, and the State Property Fund (SPF), while the presentation and coverage of the special funds has been improved. At the same time, however, the Social Insurance, Employment. and Leasing Funds have been placed off-budget. Finally, transfers to municipalities will be in line with the principles of the formula-based reform that is underway. 8. The 2001 budget adopted by parliament in the second reading targets a fiscal deficit of not more than 3 percent of GDP. The budget also fully provides for the energy consumption of the government sector. Finally. any amount of privatization receipts in excess of Hrv 5.9 billion will be used for public debt reduction. Since the bulk of the privatization receipts-the main source of budgetary financing in 2001~are expected to materialize towards year-end, the monthly expenditure ceilings have been matched to the expected pattern of financing. In light of the inherent uncertainties, the government will retain until the end of 2001 sufficient flexibility in its expenditure allocations to avoid accumulating payments arrears in the event that privatization receipts turn out to be significantly less than currently envisaged. 9. The government will continue to take steps to rationalize the revenue structure and improve intergovernmental financial relations. A review of the existing Free Economic Zones and Special Investment Regimes will be completed by end-April 200 1; the terms of reference for this review stress the need for a rationalization of tax exemptions, including through additional measures in the event that the total amount of net budgetary losses would jeopardize fiscal sustainability. To simplify and rationalize the tax system. a new tax code is being considered by parliament. for implementation in 2002. Furthermore, we have severely reduced the possibilities for tax deferrals or restructuring of tax arrears that arose after January 1,2000, and we will resist any initiatives to widen tax exemptions or introduce tax amnesties. Financial relations between the central and local governments will be rationalized through the introduction of formula-based transfers. The remaining legislative steps will be adopted in time to introduce a full formula- based system with the 2002 budget. 10. In the area of tax administration, the State Tax Administration (STA) has begun to establish regional large taxpayer offices. In order to further improve collection enforcement from large taxpayers, the STA will extend the &IF-supported pilot project on collection enforcement to the large taxpayers offices in the entire country. Legislation to replace the Kartoteka II system with modem collection procedures has been submitted to parliament, and the government will initiate proceedings by June 2001 against 5 of the 50 largest tax debtors according to the Law on Recovery of the Debtor’s Solvency or Announcing Bankruptcy. Also, the government will continue to reduce the stock of VAT refund requests outstanding for more than three months. 11. The government will continue to give high priority to rationalizing government expenditures, and to ensuring that no new payments arrears on wages, pensions, and benefits emerge. To improve transparency and accountability, and reduce opportunities for corruption, the fiscal program aims to promote cash operations, and to scale back government activities outside the budget and quasi-fiscal operations. To strengthen expenditure controls, the number of key budgetary units has been reduced substantially and budgetary coverage has been extended to most extrabudgetary funds. In the 2001 budget, all social programs have been consolidated into a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6l- ANNEX I single. targeted social assistance program under the authority of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. In addition, we intend to strengthen the compulsory state pension insurance system by encouraging retirement at a later age. improving the link between contributions and benefits, and eliminating privileges. Finally, the fiscal reporting and cash management capabilities of the treasury are to be enhanced through the introduction of the single treasury account and electronic ledger system by end-2001, with technical assistance from the Fund. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies and Banking Sector Reform 12. For the remainder of 2000 and during 2001) monetary policy will remain cautious and be guided primarily by the net domestic assets (NDA) target for the NBU and the inflation objectives of the program. The NBU will continue to manage the exchange rate flexibly. Intervention in the foreign exchange market will be guided by the need to counteract exchange rate volatility and to safeguard the external reserves objectives of the program. The targets for base money and broad money growth are consistent with the inflation target, and allow for an increase of credit to the economy in real terms. With a view to improving the efficiency of the banking system and its contribution to economic growth, we intend to reduce reserve requirements for time deposits. The monetary program mentioned above takes these reductions into account. The government will refrain from influencing or directing credits extended by the banking system, including through reserve requirements which would be differentiated based on sectoral lending. 13. The financial relationship between the NBU and the Ministry of Finance was placed on a sound basis with the conclusion in September 2000 of an agreement to restructure the stock of Treasury bills held by the NBU and to ensure positive real interest rates thereon. The Ministry of Finance will continue to make all the payments to the NBU as envisaged under this agreement. Furthermore, the NBU profit transfers to the Ministry of Finance will be based only upon its audited financial statements of the previous year. and take place after approval of the NBU Council. 14. Reforms being undertaken in the financial sector aim at strengthening banking legislation and accelerating the restructuring of major problem banks. We will move this process forward on the basis of the new Law on Banks and Banking Activity that is expected to be approved by parliament by mid-December and allows the NBU to deal more effectively with problem banks. Concerning Bank Ukraina, a NBU resolution has been issued limiting the bank’s operations and preventing it from taking new deposits, and a provisional administration was installed in September. An outline of a joint medium-term strategy will be worked out with the World Bank by December 15, 2000, which will not require recourse to government financing. The provisional administration has begun implementing an action plan to cut operating losses, and, with a view to reducing systemic risks, to protect household deposits currently held at Bank Ukraina. The provisional administrator of Bank Ukraina will present, in consultation with the World Bank, by 15 December, 2000 a plan to eliminate the operating losses of the bank within a reasonable time frame. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ANNEX I 15. The Savings Bank will renew its efforts to implement the recovery plan agreed with the NBU in 1999, with the objective of enhancing the quality of its portfolio and improving its capital adequacy. In this context, the NBU has stipulated strict limits on loans to the energy sector by the Savings Bank. The NBU will monitor closely the lending of Savings Bank to the energy sector. with a view to safeguarding the soundness of the bank, and reducing over time its exposure to the energy sector. C. Privatization and Sectoral Reforms 16. To accelerate the privatization process, a transparent privatization law covering the period 2000-02 was approved by parliament. The law provides for the cash sale of majority shareholdings in a substantial number of strategic enterprises, and the use of financial advisors to assist the State Property Fund (SPF) in ensuring transparency of all aspects of privatization processes. 17. For 200 1, the Cabinet of Ministers has submitted to parliament a list of strategic enterprises whose privatization will mark a further step in disengaging the state from commercial and industrial activities. In this context, all government-held shares in the capital of six energy distribution companies (oblenergos) have been put up for sale; these operations will be conducted with the assistance of financial advisors and are expected to be concluded in the first quarter of 2001. Tenders will be issued shortly for financial advisors to assist in the privatization of the remaining oblenergos in which the state holds a majority share. Some of these sales should also be concluded during 2001. In addition, a law was recently passed permitting the sale of a substantial minority stake in the telecommunications company Ukrtelecom. This operation is under preparation and is to be completed during the course of 2001. In order to meet the privatization objectives for 2001 and beyond, the government has submitted to parliament draft legislation that would revise the negative list. thereby permitting the sale of some 200 additional enterprises. 18. The government is committed to strengthening privatization procedures and increasing the transparency of privatization operations. This is being achieved in part through reducing the number and scope of investment conditions, publishing tenders in international mass media, and streamlining the prequalification process. Tenders for large enterprises will be conducted using open bidding procedures and, as a rule, financial advisors. Comprehensive information on privatizations in 2000 will be provided by the SPF to parliament by end-March 2001, and will be placed on the SPF web-site. In addition, the government, in consultation with the World Bank, will initiate the undertaking of ex-post reviews of privatization operations from 2000 onwards. 19. Communal tariffs in the city of Kyiv and almost all other regions in Ukraine have been increased in line with earlier understandings. We will take further steps to ensure that communal tariffs are at cost-recovery levels. 20. As part of our strategy to reduce the cost of doing business in Ukraine. we are taking a number of steps to improve the environment for investment and small businesses, reduce bureaucracy, and simplify further regulations and laws on business registration, licensing, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - ANNEX I inspections. The Law on Licensing, which provides for a reduction in activities subject to licensing and a streamlining of procedures, has been approved by parliament. Separate draft laws on certification. standardization. and accreditation are expected to be approved by parliament during the first half of 2001, and will render Ukraine’s regulations on certification and standardization consistent with European Union norms. Finally, to simplify reporting requirements for small businesses, we have raised the VAT turnover-threshold to Hrv 61,200. and we intend to consolidate registration procedures for new businesses. 21. In the energy sector. the non-payment problem has adversely affected macroeconomic stability and growth. Payments discipline will be safeguarded by the following short-term measures: (i) raising cash collection ratios for gas and electricity. based on a schedule set out in Table 1; (ii) cutting off consumers that fall substantially short of these targets; and (iii) increasing transparency by completing the audit of the natural gas company Naftogaz by September 2001, and auditing on a monthly basis the transit account for the wholesale electricity market (WEM) and regional oblenergo settlement accounts. Our medium-term strategy for the energy sector relies on reducing the role of the state and introducing more competition into the sector. We are exploring ways to promote a market structure in the natural gas sector that provides for more transparent and reliable imports and transit. 3? --. We regard the development of a market-oriented agricultural sector as key to restoring output growth and balance of payments viability in Ukraine. Accordingly, we have undertaken a wide-ranging land reform. largely privatized the grain elevators, and substantially scaled back state involvement in input supply services. The government is working closely with parliament to pass the land code, title registration and mortgage laws, as well as the removal of the parliamentary ban on bankruptcy procedures for agricultural enterprises. In line with our reform strategy. the government will not play a direct role in the provision of inputs, and it will ensure that there is no interference by central and local administrations in the marketing of outputs. 23. We continue to attach high importance to further streamlining the public administration and have already taken a number of important actions. including the reduction in the number of ministries from 18 to 15. In addition. we have cut 40,000 budgetary positions in 2000 and plan further reductions in the number of budgetary positions in 2001, in line with the ongoing civil service reform efforts. D. Balance of Payments and External Financing 24. A viable external position is one of the key elements of our medium-term strategy. We have pursued a comprehensive strategy of restructuring all sovereign debt to private and official bilateral creditors falling due in 2000 and 2001. All four outstanding Eurobonds/notes and the Gazprom bonds were restructured on April 14,2000, with an acceptance rate of over 98 percent. In addition, letters have been sent to all bilateral official creditors, including Paris Club creditors, explaining Ukraine’s balance of payments difficulties and requesting a rescheduling on comparable terms. We have instructed Naftogaz to present a plan for regularizing its relations with its suppliers, and have recommended publication of monthly data on its operations and arrears.

As a first step toward eliminating the tax on exports of sunflower seeds, we have submitted legislation to parliament that calls for reducing the tax rate from 23 percent to 10 percent. Legislative action is expected by end-2000. We are also currently reviewing the advisability of maintaining the export restrictions on livestock, skins and hides. We expect to eliminate these distortionary measures during the course of 200 1. Finally, the government will refrain from introducing any new export restrictions during the period of the arrangement. 26. We have set quarterly ceilings on the amount of nonconcessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the government and the NBU, which are detailed in Table 1. During the period of the program, neither the government nor the NBU will accumulate arrears on any external payment obligations (a continuous performance criterion under the program). E. Statistical Issues 27. We will continue to strengthen our statistical database and compilation methods. Earher this year, the new Law on State Statistics was passed, thereby clarifying the responsibilities and strengthening the autonomy of government statistical agencies. The State Statistics Committee will improve the quarterly national accounts. The Ministry of Finance will shortly issue an order to compile and disseminate government finance statistics in accordance with the IMF Government Finance Statistics manual. In addition, an inter-agency working group will be created to allocate responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance, the State Treasury of Ukraine, and the State Statistics Committee for the compilation and dissemination of government finance statistics. Regarding data on international reserves. the NBU will start compiling statements in line with the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) data template on reserves, which will be reported to the IMF. F. Transparency and Governance 28. A major focus of our program is on improving transparency and governance, and reducing opportunities for rent seeking and corruption. We recognize that progress in this area is essential to encourage private activity and ensure an efficient use of public resources. 29. Audits are to be used to increase accountability of public enterprises and institutions in other areas, including Naftogaz, the State Material Reserves Company (SMR), the transit account of the wholesale electricity market, and the regional settlement accounts set-up by oblenergos for electricity payments collection. All budgetary operations will be audited by the National Board of Auditors. Additional measures include improving the system of budgetary accounting and reporting; incorporating all extrabudgetary funds and accounts in the budget; and the regular reporting to parliament on tax arrears. The NBU will include externally audited financial statements with the audit letter and all notes to these statements in the annual report submitted to parliament. These financial statements will be compiled in accordance with international accounting standards, including disclosures of fair value of assets and appropriate allowances for impairment of assets. Finally, we are in the process of compiling comprehensive data on credit extended to the private sector that was guaranteed by the government or the NBU Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-65 - ANNEX1 during the period 1997-99. and will, once this exercise is completed, provide the Fund with the results. 30. Measures are also being taken to improve international reserve management practices at the NBU based on the audits and the recommendations of a technical assistance mission from the IMF’s Monetary and Exchange Affairs department. These include: (i) development of a revised statement of objectives for reserve management to be adopted by the Board of the NBU; (ii) creation of a risk management unit separated from the foreign exchange department to, among other things, develop the risk management framework for the foreign reserves function, and develop and begin operation of a monitoring system; and (iii) develop a risk-based internal audit function with an initial priority on foreign exchange activities of the head office. The NBU also intends to keep the proceeds of any future purchases that would be made under the Extended Arrangement in Ukraine’s SDR account held with the IMF. 31. As part of our plans to strengthen and enforce the judicial system and the legal environment for private investment, the new law on public procurement consistent with European Union directives is being implemented, and we will shortly present a law on joint- stock companies to parliament which will better protect minority-shareholders’ rights. In order to bring current practices against money laundering in line with international practices, the government intends to approach the OECD-based Financial Action Task Force. 32. We believe that the policies detailed above are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but we remain prepared to take any additional measures that may be necessary for this purpose.
