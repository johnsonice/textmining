Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Grenada were held in St. George's during February 8-21, 1995. The representatives of Grenada in the discussions included the Prime Minister (who is also Minister of Agri- culture), the Ministers of Finance and Health, and other senior officials. The staff representatives were Messrs. Gronlie (Head), Aziz (EP), Bindley- Taylor, Tokarick (all WHD), Hussein (INS), and Ms. Lanio (Assistant-WHD). Mr. Murphy, Alternate Executive Director for Grenada, participated in the concluding policy meetings. The consultation discussions took place against the background of changes in the political leadership following the retirement of Prime Minister Brathwaite at the end of January 1995. Parliamentary elections are due to be held before mid-year. Grenada maintains no restrictions on external payments and transfers subject to Fund approval, and has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. Grenada's rela- tions with the Fund are set out in Appendix I. The last Article IV consultation with Grenada was concluded by the Executive Board on February 4, 1994 (EBM/94/8). On that occasion Directors emphasized that a durable strengthening of the public finances was needed to raise domestic savings and investment and create the conditions for sus- tained economic growth. To that end, they encouraged the authorities to persevere with plans to broaden the tax base and contain personnel expend- iture, and expressed support for the efforts to privatize public assets and deal with the outstanding arrears. II. Backnround and Recent DeveloDments The pursuit of expansionary fiscal policies in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to external current account deficits of the order of 10 percent of GDP or more. The deficits could not be fully financed, and the Government fell behind on its external payments obligations. In these circumstances, external donors and creditors withdrew most of their support, leading to a decline in public investment from 10 percent of GDP in 1991 to 4 percent of GDP in 1992. By 1993, the rapid economic growth of the late 1980s had come to a near halt (Table 1 and Chart 1). In an effort to deal with the deteriorating economic circumstances and the loss of external support, the authorities elaborated a Structural Adjustment Plan (SAP) for 1992-94 that called for fiscal consolidation, structural reform, debt restructuring, and divestment of public assets. Action under the plan (which included a wage freeze and a public service retrenchment program) helped raise public savings by 2 percentage points of GDP from 1991 to 1993 and turn the overall balance of the public sector (after grants) from a deficit of 3 percent of GDP to a surplus of nearly 2.5 percent of GDP (Table 2). The external payments arrears were reduced from a peak of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2 - 10 percent of GDP (US$22 million) at the end of 1990 to around 4.5 percent of GDP at end-1993 because of debt cancellations and restructuring, as well as some payments in cash. In early 1994, the authorities elaborated a "Medium-Term Economic Strategy" (MTES) for 1994-96 that would dovetail with the SAP. Under this strategy they would seek to raise real GDP growth to 3 percent a year and increase annual spending under the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) to 12 percent of GDP. The higher investment levels would be financed with renewed external support, the sale of additional state assets, and an increase in government savings to 3 percent of GDP from half that level in 1993 and negative levels in prior years. The Government's plans also called for elimination of the external payments arrears. The objectives of the strategy would be achieved through tight fiscal management (focused on wage restraint, further public service retrenchment, and improvements in tax administration) and a deepening of structural reforms (focused on tax reform, divestment, contracting out of public services, and an easing of regulatory and restrictive practices). Real GDP growth recovered to 2.5 percent in 1994 led by the construc- tion and tourist industries. The decline in agriculture was halted, but it continued in the manufacturing sector, which is small and had contracted in the previous two years as some operations moved to Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Inflation remained low in 1994, helped by the reduction of some indirect taxes. The unemployment rate is estimated in the 13-15 percent range, largely unchanged from the early 199Os, and recent private sector wage contracts typically have awarded increases in the 5-6 percent range. The public finances deteriorated in 1994 as current expenditure remained about unchanged i.n terms of GDP from 1993 while revenue fell to 27 percent of GDP from about 28.5 percent of GDP. The revenue performance reflected mostly the lowering of some tax rates under the Government's tax reform program; in addition, there were slippages in the administration of the business levy and the 2.5 percent tax on foreign exchange sales was abolished. Reflecting these developments, public savings declined by about 1 percentage point of GDP Ln 1994 to less than 4 percent of GDP. As capital spending rose for the second consecutive year, the overall balance (after grants) shifted back from a surplus of 2.4 percent of GDP in 1993 to a deficit of about 0.4 percent of GDP in 1994. Meanwhile, external financing increased and the public sector reduced its domestic debt for the third consecutive year. External payments arrears were reduced by USS3.5 million to USS8.8 million (about 3 percent of GDP), mainly through debt restructuring. Grenada shares the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) with seven other countries in the region, and important policy decisions in the areas of monetary and exchange rate policies are taken on a regional basis. The ECCB is guided mainly by the objectives of containing inflation and main- taining adequate foreign exchange cover for its liabilities. It imposes a 6 percent reserve requirement on commercial banks in the region (unchanged Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2a - CHART I GRENADA V SELECTED ECONOMIC INDICATORS, 1990-95 GROWTH AND INFLATION GROWTH AND INFLATION (Perrent change, previous year) (Perrent change, previous year) 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 J 1995 PUBLIC SECTOR OPERATIONS PUBLIC SECTOR OPERATIONS (In (In percent of GDP) percent of GDP) 10 0 Overall Balance I I BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 65 (In permnf of COP) SAVINGS AND INVE5MENT (In percent 01 GDP) 1ZMONTH CHANCES IN MONETARY AGGREGATES on i---d I 1990 1991 199? 1993 1994 9 25 20 15 10 5 0 -5 1995 PUBLIC DEBT RATIOS i0 39 !8 17 5 -5 Sources: Central Bank of Grenada; and Fund staff estimates. l/ Data for 1994 ore estimates.

The ECCB helps the banks manage their liquid- ity by providing facilities for the placement and transfer of short-term funds, but it does not provide them temporary overdraft facilities. Money and quasi-money grew broadly in line with income in the early '1990s before accelerating in 1994 as the economic recovery got under way. The public sector reduced its bank debt in 1994, and at the same time the growth of credit to the private sector declined. Reflecting these develop- ments, the consolidated banking system's net foreign assets increased by US$15 million in 1994 (of which the commercial banks accounted for US$lO million, a large part of which was in the form of placements with head offices abroad) (Table 3). Grenada's balance of payments recorded a sharp improvement in 1994, led by strong growth in travel receipts that helped reduce the current account deficit to 6.5 percent of GDP from 9.5 percent of GDP in 1993 (Table 4). Net capital inflows, which peaked at over US$30 million in the early 199Os, fell to US$20 million in 1994 as direct investment flows declined upon the completion of major hotel projects, and there was a marked increase in capital outflow through the commercial banks, as noted above. Following a sharp,increase in 1993, public capital inflow (including grants for public investment) continued to recover. As a result, the overall balance of payments shifted from a small deficit in 1993 to a surplus equivalent to 2 percent of GDP in 1994, and Grenada's imputed net reserves at the East Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) increased to the equivalent of 2.4 months of imports. III. Near-Term Outlook and Policy Discussions The Grenadian economy is expected to continue to grow in 1995, buoyed by further expansion in construction and tourism, although the latter is forecast to grow at a slower pace than in 1994, when significant new hotel capacity was added. Modest growth is expected in agriculture on the basis of increased sales to the tourist industry and higher prices for traditional exports. Following many years of declining production (in part due to plant disease), the authorities are supporting increased cultivation of bananas, for which Grenada retains a preferential access quota to the U.K. market until the year 2002. In addition, Grenada's fishing industry, which has developed gradually over a number of years, is expected to be boosted by the construction of a new processing facility in 1995. Overall, real GDP is expected to expand by about 3 percent in 1995, the target established by the authorities for 1994-96 under the MTES. Inflation is projected to remain low. 1. Fiscal policies Public sector revenue, which had fallen to just over 27 percent of GDP in 1994, is projected to fall also in 1995, albeit marginally, reflecting the effect of a further drop in government revenue offset in part by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. . 4 _ improvements in the operations of the rest of the public sector (the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) and the public enterprises). The decline in government revenue (in terms of GDP) is partly the result of action to lower some tax rates, but more fundamentally, it reflects a narrow tax base that allows a broad range of activities to escape taxation, even when income rises. As regards tax rates, the second round of rate reductions (by 5 per- centage points) under the CARICOM common external tariff (CET) will be introduced in 1995 and selected ather indirect tax rates also will be reduced (including on automobiles). The income tax, which had been abolished in 1986, will be reintroduced and commercial and recreational yachting activities will be subject tlo taxation. IJ The biggest fiscal challenge facing the authorities is the need to broaden the tax base by reducing substantially the import tax exemptions and tax holidays granted to a broad range of economic activities, most notably to the fast-growing tourist industry. The manufacturing, fishing, and hotel industries are granted concessions under specific incentives legislation, but tax concessions also are given to public utilities, agriculture, and others, sometimes on an ad hoc basis. u As regards expenditure, the current outlays of the public sector would decline somewhat in 1995, reflecting not only further public service retrenchments and the wage freeze (which will remain in effect for part of the year), but also the maintenance of strict controls on other current outlays, including transfers. The findings of a job evaluation exercise will be put in place in the public service in 1995. The authorities expect that the jobs exercise and the current negotiations of a wage settlement will serve to limit the wage bill to the amount already incorporated in the budget for 1995 (11 percent of GDP). a/ In view of the above, the savings of the public sector and of the Government would remain about unchanged in 1995, at 4 percent of GDP and near zero, respectively. The latter would represent a decline of 1.5 percentage points of GDP over the two years since 1993 and would be well below the 3 percent of GDP target established for government savings under the MTES. Despite the lack of improvement envisaged in the savings performance, the authorities are planning a further increase in public investment in 1995 (albeit at half the rate of the two preceding years), to nearly 12 percent IJ The new income taxes (individual <and corporate) will replace the debt- service levy (individuals) and the business levy that were introduced in 1987 and 1991, respectively. u For a summary of the incentives system and practices, see the companion RED report, Appendix II. 3J Grenada has no military spending.

This level of public investment is near the target established under the economic strategy for 1994-96. The investment plan for 1995, which has been reviewed by the staff of the Caribbean Development Bank, focusses on infrastructure projects, particularly in the areas of roads and water supply. On this basis, and taking into account a projected increase in external grants to support investment spending, the overall public sector deficit (after grants) would remain about unchanged at 0.5 percent of GDP from 1994 to 1995. Given the external loan financing, the plans for reducing the external payments arrears, and the constraint on domestic financing, the projected deficit would give rise to a financing gap of 1.6 percent of GDP in 1995. The discussions with the authorities on fiscal issues focused on the inadequate level of savings and on measures that would help make the tax system more buoyant. The mission urged that public savings be raised on a durable basis to help sustain the level of investment targeted by the authorities; more specifically, action should be taken to raise government savings to the level targeted under the medium-term economic strategy and presented to donors and creditors in 1994. In response, the authorities stated that they were committed to strengthening the public finances. They explained that they would not be able to attain the savings target in 1995, but they recognized that a financing gap might open up and wanted to explore with the mission steps that would help close the gap. The mission urged that the authorities avoid undue cuts in public investment in order to close the gap, suggesting instead that they consider the measures already identified (but not yet implemented) in their Medium- Term Economic Strategy Paper (1994-96). These would include new or higher charges for health and other services and the termination of membership in certain international and regional organizations. In addition, the mission recommended that steps be taken to incorporate more of the tourist indus- try's operations into the tax base. This could be achieved by reducing import tax exemptions and tax holidays (as contractual concessions expire), raising the sales tax on hotels and restaurants, imposing charges for garbage collection, and increasing the levy on cruiseship passengers (lowest in the region). The estimated annual yield from these measures would be sufficient to close the projected gap. However, since action was unlikely to be taken before the elections, the mission explored with the authorities additional measures, even some that would have a temporary or one-time effect. These included, among others, steps to reduce certain nonwage current outlays (including transfers) during the last six months of the year and accelerate some land sales. The authorities welcomed the mission's suggestions and indicated that they would take the measures necessary should a financing gap open up. They agreed with the need to reduce the widespread tax concessions, which they Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicconsidered to be obstacles to broadening the tax base and making the tax system more buoyant. With regard to the divestment o.f public assets, the authorities informed the mission that consideration was being given to selling a major- ity share in the Government's sugar factory. This would bring to four the number of public enterprises divested in the last four years. Such privati- zations have served to finance additional public investment in the past, but it is unlikely that the sugar factory would be sold in time to provide investment financing in 1995. The authorities expect to eliminate all but US$5 million of the govern- ment's external payments arrears in 1995. To achieve this, they would pay USSO. million in cash and would resume discussions with Algeria on the rescheduling of some USS1.3 million. In addition, they have requested discussions with the United Kingdom to convert USS1.6 million to a grant as that country shifts its assistance fr'om loans to grants. As regards the operations of the rest of the public sector, the outlook for the finances of the NIS and the public enterprises is favorable, with an overall surplus of the order of nearly 2 percent of GDP projected for the former. The benefits paid by the NIS are projected to remain low for a number of years to come (given that it was established only in 1983) and it can be expected to continue to generate financial surpluses. However, the mission expressed concern that a high proportion, nearly 80 percent, of NIS' investments are in government debt and urged that its portfolio be diver- sified. The authorities explained that the NIS' mortgage lending program was being expanded and that some of its government debt would be swapped for land suitable for development. As a group, the consolidated public enterprises are projected to generate savings of nearly 2 percent of GDP in 1995, and despite large investment projects by the National Water and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) and the Port Authority (the former with substantial external financing), the enterprises would be expected to reduce their domestic debt by some 0.3 per- cent of GDP. The Port Authority is expected to begin expansion and upgrad- ing of port facilities in St. George's in 1995, while NAWASA will undertake major water supply projects to help relieve the sometimes critical water shortage in many parts of the island. 2. Monetary and external policies The growth of money and quasi-money is projected to moderate to 8 percent in 1995 from 11 percent in 1994. With modest recourse to bank financing by the public sector, this would provide room for a significant increase in the flow of bank credit to the private sector. In the discussions, the mission noted that the 4 percent floor on savings deposit rates tended to exert upward pressure on the interest rate structure since time deposit rates had fallen below 4 percent and depositors were shifting funds to savings deposits. The mission recommended that this Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - regulation be abolished, but the authorities explained that it had been imposed by the ECCB and that regional action would be required to achieve this. The mission also suggested that the 16 percent upper limit on lending rates, set by the Government, be removed given that market rates are well below that level, but the authorities did not regard this as a pressing issue in the present market circumstances. The current account deficit of the balance of payments (excluding grants in support of public investment) would widen to 7.5 percent of GDP in 1995 from about 6.5 percent of GDP in 1994. The growth in travel receipts is projected to increase by about 11 percent (in U.S. dollar terms), about half the rate of increase recorded in 1994, and last year's modest growth in exports is not expected to be sustained. Imports would continue to increase, albeit at a slower pace than in 1994, reflecting a slowdown in the growth of tourism and private hotel construction. On the capital account, public sector borrowing is expected to fall sharply in 1995, but this will be mostly offset by an equivalent increase in grants which are supporting public investment. Direct investment also is projected to fall, and on this basis, the overall balance of payments would register a surplus equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP (USS1.8 million), which would provide for a small increase in Grenada's reserves at the ECCB. The mission discussed with the authorities the remaining exchange controls and the import licensing system. The import licensing regime covers a limited number of products and is geared to favoring imports from Grenada's CARICOM partners, especially from the countries in the Organiza- tion of East Caribbean States (OECS). One exchange control remains, con- sisting of an indicative limit on foreign exchange for private travel on a per person per calendar year basis. The staff has been informed that bonafide requests above this limit are routinely approved without delay and that the public is aware of the opportunity to obtain this approval. The authorities noted that restrictions on trade will be removed in line with CARICOM arrangements. Grenada is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) whose currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC dollar), has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of ECS2.70 per U.S. dollar since 1976. The United States is Grenada's main partner for trade and tourism, and the real effect- ive exchange rate of the EC dollar (as calculated for Grenada) has moved largely in parallel with that of the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the EC dol- lar appreciated sharply in real effective terms through the mid-1980s, and during the five years through 1994 it remained 10 percent more appreciated than at the beginning of the 1980s (Chart 2). While Grenada's exports have declined steadily since the last half of the 198Os, the authorities noted that some of the decline was related to plant disease (bananas), that tour- ism has grown sharply during this period, and that new industries, such as fishing, have come on stream, testifying to Grenada's competitiveness. At the same time, they were concerned about the high costs in certain indus- tries, such as manufacturing, and underscored the need for vigilance in this area. The authorities emphasized that the exchange rate arrangements of the ECCU remain appropriate for Grenada. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicIV. Other Issues 1. The medium-term outlook The medium-term outlook for Grenada's balance of payments is to a large extent dependent on the response of the domestic private sector and foreign donors and investors to the policies and achievements under the authorities' medium-term strategy. As an illustration, the staff has elabo- rated a medium-term scenario based on real GDP growth of 3.0 percent a year and low inflation. It is assumed that travel receipts would grow at a yearly rate of 10 percent over the period 1997-99 as hotel capacity expands. Export earnings would increase moderately, reflecting, inter alia, growth in the fishing industry and higher banana exports. It is further assumed that external support for public investment will remain around 4 percent of GDP (compared with 5.5 percent of GDP on average in 1994 and 1995) and that the authorities will seek to maintain public investment outlays at around 12 percent of GDP, as discussed in 1994 at the meeting of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Devlelopment (CGCED) with the external donors and creditors, including the World Bank. To sustain investment at this level after 1996, when proceeds from the divestment of public assets can be expected to fall sharply, public savings would need to increase to around 8.5 percent of GDP, i.e., by 3 percentage points of GDP in addition to the adjustment required to close the projected financing gap in 1995. This increase in savings would require that the efforts to broaden the tax base and strengthen tax administration be sustained. The authorities also would need to make further progress on expenditure control, including through wage restraint and further reductions in the public service. On this basis, the external current account deficit (excluding grants in support of public investment) would widen somewhat to about 8 percent of GDP in 1996, and then decline gradual1.y to around 6.5 percent of GDP by 1999 (Table 5). With external support for high levels of public investment and a rise in tourist sector investment after 1995, the overall balance of pay- ments would remain in surplus throughout the period, peaking in 1997 at 2.5 percent of GDP. Net international reserves would rise to the equivalent of about 3.5 months of imports by 1999. With the planned reduction of external payments arrears and a shift to a larger grant component in the external financing of public investment, the outstanding public debt would be maintained at below US$90 million over the medium term (Table 6). In terms of GDP, public debt as a percentage of GDP would decline steadily from about 33 percent at the end of 1994 to 22 per- cent by 1999. External debt service payments would remain low (averaging 4.5 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services). Nevertheless, Grenada's balance of payments and, indeed, its economic growth performance, remains vulnerable .to external shocks affecting the tourist industry and the level of external support for public investment. If, for example, travel receipts were to be 5 percent lower than projected, the direct effect (i.e., taking into acc:ount the first-round impact on Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- - 8a - c---- ---------- __.--- --; Y ,_-- ---__* \ c Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicDownload Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - imports) would be to increase the external current account deficit by about 1.2 percentage points of GDP a year from the baseline scenario, to an annual average of nearly 8.5 percent of GDP. Under this scenario, there would be a small overall deficit in 1995, equilibrium in 1996 and surpluses of around 1 percent of GDP during 1997-99, compared with surpluses of nearly 2.3 per- cent of GDP in 1997-99 in the baseline scenario. A fall in external support for public investment (nearly all of which comes from official sources) would have a direct adverse effect on economic activity in the short term (as seen in the early 199Os), but it would also impact negatively on eco- nomic activity in the longer term by reducing the provision of infrastruc- ture and other public investments that support economic growth. 2. The environment Grenada is faced with several environmental problems characteristic of a small island developing state. The major concern is misuse of natural resources in the key sectors of agriculture and tourism. In an effort to tackle the environmental problems, the Government is currently implementing a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), which is discussed in the Recent Economic Developments report. I/ 3. Statistical issues Grenada's statistical data base remains weak and reporting to STA needs to be improved. u At the same time, progress is being made, particularly in the national accounts which recently have been revised back to 1984. The revision represents a major improvement in the quality of the data and was undertaken as part of a regional effort with technical assistance from the Organization of East Caribbean States (OECS). v. Staff Annraisal Grenada has made progress since the early 1990s when external donors and creditors withdrew most of their support in a move to encourage the authorities to deal with the economic imbalances and the problem of arrears. The elaboration of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in 1992 and its successor, the Medium-Term Economic Strategy (MTES) in 1994 proved to be useful, not only by setting guideposts for the strengthening of policies, but also by providing signals to the donor community and foreign investors that Grenada would deal with its problems in a comprehensive manner. To strengthen the public finances, the authorities have focused much of their attention on public service retrenchment, tax reform, administrative reform, and expenditure control. Public savings rose quickly at first, but the savings performance has deteriorated since 1993 when external support on a large scale was resumed. The staff would encourage the authorities to 1/ See the companion RED report, Appendix III. u See Appendix III for a summary of the statistical issues. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - reinforce the adjustment effort to achieve a permanent strengthening of the public finances. It is of particular importance that the adjustment not be delayed by the temporary fiscal relief provided by the wage freeze and the availability of divestment proceeds, as well as by the resumption of external support. The authorities should move quickly to raise government savings to 3 percent of GDP, as already announced to the external donors. Further increases in savings would be required to sustain the targeted level of 12 percent of GDP for public investment over the medium term. To raise savings as required, the authorities will need to take forceful action to broaden the tax base, strengthen tax administration and control spending. Keeping the wage settlement in the public service in 1995 at a moderate level would help in this regard. The staff welcomes the authorities' stated commitment to strengthening fiscal policies, and while the near-term target for government savings would not be attained in 1995, the authorities have indicated that they are pre- pared to take such action as would be required to close a projected financing gap. The staff generally supports the authorities' tax reform strategy as appropriate for Grenada. However, generous tax concessions granted to a broad range of economic activities have prevented a timely broadening of the tax base, and efforts to introduce buoyancy to the tax system will not be successful until the concessions are substantially reduced. To achieve this, not only must more of the tourist industry's operations be brought under the tax net, but a phase-out of the most generous concessions must be extended to other sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and public entities, etc. The staff supports the strategy adopted by the authorities to lay the basis for a smaller, less costly and more efficient public sector. The sale of public assets is a key element in this strategy. Three public enter- prises have been sold in recent years, and further sales are in progress or under consideration. The staff views the divestment strategy as appropriate and will encourage the authorities to proceed with further action in this area, including the sale of land for development. The debt-for-land swaps with the NIS would help diversify its investment portfolio and at the same time lower the Government's debt-service payments. The recent contraction of the manufacturing sector and the secular decline in traditional agriculture raise a question about the competitive- ness of some of Grenada's basic industries. At the same time, the rapidly growing tourist industry is attracting resources from other sectors of the economy. These circumstances call for vigilance on the part of the authori- ties in pursuing cost containment polic:Les, thus helping to promote indus- trial diversity and a wide base for employment. The monetary and exchange rate arrangements of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union have served Grenada well by helping to control inflation and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - foster financial stability. The Central Bank's restrictive policies on credit to member governments play an important role in this regard. The staff shares the views of the authorities that these exchange rate arrange- ments and policies remain appropriate for Grenada.'
