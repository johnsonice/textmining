INTRODUCTION 1. Over the past eight years, Australia has enjoyed an extended period of economic expansion, strong productivity growth, and low inflation. Growth averaged 4% percent (compared to a 30-year average of 3% percent), underpinned by a sizable pickup in labor productivity and total factor productivity (Box 1). Inflation has been held to 2 percent on average, compared to 9 percent over the previous two decades. The recovery’s durability and strength reflect improvements in the policy framework, including fiscal policy’s medium- term orientation, inflation targeting, and labor and product market reforms. 2. The pickup of noninflationary growth in the past two years is surprising given Australia’s strong linkages with Asia. Previous analysis (W/98/219) argued that the Asian crisis and Japan’s recession would have exerted stronger adverse effects on Australia than on other industrial countries given the extent of Australia’s Asian trade linkages, and that the depreciation of the Australian dollar during 1997-98 would have led to a pickup in inflation. The economy’s resilience in the face of the external demand shock reflects both a redirection of exports away from Asia and stronger domestic demand than was envisaged a year ago, the latter underpinned by appropriately easy monetary conditions and increases in asset prices. The absence of inflationary pressures reflects both strong productivity growth, and the impact of the recession in Asia which led to significant price discounting by Asian suppliers. 3. The stronger growth performance nevertheless raises three issues: first, the appropriate near-term macroeconomic policy settings, given that the economy may be approaching its full potential; second, external vulnerability, since the strength of domestic demand has widened the current account deficit; and third, the sustainability of productivity growth over the medium term. The policy discussions focused on these three issues. 4. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation (October 28,1998), Directors commended the authorities for implementing sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, which had built the foundation for Australia’s impressive record of strong growth and low inflation. Given Australia’s sizable current account deficit and high level of external liabilities, Directors emphasized the importance of continuing with fiscal consolidation efforts and structural reforms aimed at removing potential disincentives to private saving. Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere with structural reforms aimed at sustaining productivity growth and reducing unemployment. II. RE~ENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDNEAR-TERMOUTLOOK 5. Economic growth picked up to about 4% percent annually in the two years to September 1999 (Table 1, Figure 1). Domestic demand has been the engine of growth, given the unfavorable external environment-roughly two-fifths of Australia’s exports are destined for crisis-hit Asia and Japan. Household consumption was robust, reflecting strong income Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- Box 1. Australia: Recent Productivity Performance Productivity growth in Australia has increased substantially over the past decade, with an even sharper pickup during 199s98. During the 1990s annual labor productivity growth in the market sector averaged 3 percent, compared to 2 percent in the 1970s and 198Os, while annual total factor productivity (TFP) growth reached 2 percent, compared to an average of 1% percent in the previous two decades. Annual capital productivity growth increased by 0.1 percent in the 199Os, compared to an average decline of 1% percent in the earlier period. During 1995-98, productivity growth has been even stronger than during the 1990s as a whole, with TPP growth averaging 3 percent. The productivity surge since 1995 is, moreover, only partly attributable to cyclical factors. It is difficult, however, to quantify the size of the structural improvement precisely, partly because the current cycle is not yet complete. Staff estimates for trend or structural TFP growth in the market sector range from 1.8 percent to 2.4 percent, although these estimates may be biased upward because of end-period problems. Structural reforms appear to have played a role in explaining the trend improvement in productivity performance. The results from a staff study of 20 OECD countries for the period 1965-98 suggest that structural reforms, particularly trade and product market reforms, are important in explaining improvements in trend productivity growth, even though these reforms may have a negative impact on productivity in the short run (see Ranil Salgado, “Australia’s Productivity Performance” in the forthcoming 5’electedlsme.v paper). The negative short-run effects are generally reversed within two years, and may be due to adjustment costs and the need for firms to learn how to operate in a less regulated, more competitive, environment. The cross-county empirical analysis suggests that structural reforms in Australia have contributed to a OS-O.9 percentage point increase in the market-sector TJW growth rate compared to the 1980s. Under some reasonable assumptions (including employment growth of 1.8 percent per annum), this increase in TFP growth would imply that potential output growth in Australia over the next four to five years could be in the range of 3%-4L/4 percent. The midpoint of this range is significantly higher than earlier staff estimates that were in the range of 3-3 ‘/2 percent Australian Productivity lndioators: Market S&or ’ (Annual growth, geomctrio averages batween business-oyolc peaks) June Yeats 1965-77 1977-82 1982-90 1990-98 1965-98 Labor pmduotivity 2.9 1.9 1.3 2.9 2.3 Capital produotivity -1.7 -1.8 -0.7 0.1 -1.0 TIP2 1.6 0.9 0.8 2.0 1.4 Memorandum items: ciross pmduot 4.0 2.5 3.2 3.0 3.3 Labor input 1.1 0.6 1.9 0.1 1.0 Capital input 5.8 4.4 4.0 2.9 4.4 Capital-labor ratio 4.7 3.7 2.1 2.8 3.4 Soumas: Australian Bureau of Statistios (APS); and Fund staff estimatas. ’ The ABS estimates productivity growth for the market se&r, whioh exohzdes five industry seotors-government adminstration and defense, property and business services, education, he&h and conununity services, and personal and other services. ’ TFP {or multi-faotor produotivity) is estimated by the ABS using a Thomqvist-Theii divisia index with TFP growth as the weighted avaragc of labor and oapital produotivity growth, where the weights are, respectively, labor and oapital inoome shams averaged over suoocssive years.

Fixed investment also posted strong growth in the post-crisis period- underpinned by low interest rates, strong corporate profits, and Olympics-related construction-but there was some scaling back of capital spending in the mining sector due to weak commodity prices. Net exports made a negative contribution to growth in 1998 and the first three quarters of 1999, due to the weakness of external demand and strong domestic demand that boosted imports. 6. Reflecting strong growth and greater labor market flexibility, the unemployment rate has been trending down since the early 199Os, and reached about 6)/4 percent in November 1999 (Figure 2). The long expansion has boosted employment, while the decline in unemployment has been assisted by structural measures, especially the passage in 1996 of the Workplace Relations Act (WRA), which reduced the role of third parties (unions and the Industrial Relations Commission-IRC) and the award system (which regulates employment conditions) in wage determination. The jobless rate, nonetheless, remains almost 1 percentage point higher than the level reached at the end of the 1980s expansion, and about VL3/4 percentage point above the Treasury’s central estimate of the NAIRU of 6-6X percent. As result of strong growth, the staff estimates that the output gap has been reduced to very law levels, although such estimates are necessarily uncertain given ongoing structural changes in the economy. 7. The current account deficit widened from nearly 5 percent of GDP in 1998 to about 6 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1999. Strong domestic demand boosted imports, while a contraction in partner-country import demand and weaker commodity prices depressed exports (Table 2, Figure 3). The terms of trade fell by about 6 percent over the two years to September 1999, as long-term contracts for resource exports to Asia were renewed at lower prices. The current account deficit would have been even larger, however, had the Australian dollar not depreciated significantly during 1997-98, and had lower interest rates not helped to offset the impact on the income balance of rising external liabilities-in net terms, Australia’s external liabilities to GDP ratio is one of the highest among industrial countries (Figure 4). The deficit has been financed mainly by equity inflows in the past two years. 8. Financial market sentiment toward Australia has remained favorable despite the worsening external imbalance. The so-called “Australia premium”-defined as the spread between Australian and U.S. government bond yields-has fallen from 200-300 basis points at mid-decade to about 50-60 basis points in recent months (Figure 5); the real interest rate differential has declined by a similar amount over this period. Moreover, S&P in May 1999 upgraded Australia’s foreign currency sovereign rating from AA to AA+ (the same as Canada’s rating, far example), citing in particular the government’s fiscal restraint and success in reducing public debt. However, the rating agency noted that the high current account deficit and sizable net external liabilities were a constraint on awarding S&P’s highest rating of ALLI.

Australia: Household Saving Australia’s net household saving rate declined from 7 percent of disposable income in 1989/90 to 2 percent in 1998199 (the gross household saving rate, which includes consumption of fixed capital, declined from 16 percent to 10 percent).’ While Australia’s household saving rate was near the OECD average in the late 198Os, its decline in the 1990s was faster than in most industrial countries, leaving Australia with one of the lowest household saving rates in the industrialized world. An earlier staff study (SM/97/40) identified several important determinants of household saving rates, using a panel dataset of 21 OECD countries, including Australia. The study found that higher public saving, higher social welfare transfers, and greater reliance on direct taxes in tax revenues, reduced the household saving rate. Applying the estimated coefficients to Australia, however, the study was able to account for only about half the decline in the household saving rate during the 1990s. In an attempt to improve the account of the fall in Australia’s household saving rate, the staff undertook a time-series analysis of Australian quarterly data for the period 1980-1998 (see “Australia: Household Saving” by Jaewoo Lee, Chapter II of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper). The results suggest that the key factor behind the decline in the household saving rate in the 1990s was rising household wealth, which alone accounts for the bulk of the decline in the saving rate. Increases in unemployment were also found to lower household saving, possibly through a greater incidence of liquidity constraints. Although not modelled in this study, there is evidence3 that compulsory superannuation contributions also had an influence on household saving, by requiring lower-income households to increase their overall saving. ’ Based on these estimates, Australia’s household saving rate would be expected to increase by about 1% percentage points over the medium term, assuming no further rise in household wealth relative to disposable income, The rise in the saving rate is due to the expected decline in the unemployment rate, the scheduled rise in the superannuation contribution rate, and a shift in the tax mix towards indirect taxes associated with recent tax reform. ‘The data on gross and net saving rates are adjusted for the trend toward incorporation by small businesses--unincorporated businesses are defined to be part of the household sector. ’ Public saving was not found to have significantly affected the household saving rate in Australia, consistent with the results from other time-series studies: See Blundell-Wignall, A. and G. Stevens (1992) “Fiscal Policy in Australia: Recent Developments and Current Issues,” in Current Issues in Fiscal Policy and Their Implications for the Conduct ofMonetary Policy (BIS); and Edey, M. and M.

Inflation, which was running below the RBA’s 2-3 percent medium-term objective over the two years to June 1999, picked up slightly in the September quarter to about 2 percent.’ A number of factors help to explain the performance up to June 1999, which took place against the backdrop of an expansionary monetary policy stance-the RBA lowered the cash rate by 275 basis points, to 4% percent, between mid-1996 and end-1998, in light of the benign inflation outlook. First, rapid output growth has been associated with a sizable pickup in labor productivity, which contained annual average unit labor cost increases to 1 percent since mid- 1997; the greater prevalence of enterprise-as opposed to national- wage agreements has also helped to link wage increases to productivity improvements in the workplace, and so contain unit labor costs. Second, inflationary pressures from foreign sources have been reduced by discounting by Asian suppliers, which has lessened the impact of the depreciation of the Australian dollar since mid-1997.’ The slight pickup in inflation in the September quarter reflects mainly the impact of world petroleum price increases-as wage and unit labor cost increases remained moderate-but an end to the contractionary external environment facing Australia nevertheless led the RBA to increase the cash rate by 25 basis points on November 3, 1999 (see below). 10. Fiscal policy has been on a consolidation path since the mid-1990s, reducing public debt and the long-term interest rate differential vis-a-vis the United States. The Commonwealth’s underlying cash balance (i.e., excluding asset sales) improved from deficits of 34 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to a surplus of % percent of GDP in 1998/99 (July/June) (Table 3, Figure 6). The newly-adopted accrual measure and the structural balance show a surplus of similar magnitude. Fiscal consolidation has involved structural expenditure cuts, while cyclical factors and tax-bracket creep have boosted revenues. Reflecting also the impact of asset sales, Commonwealth net debt has declined to 12 percent of GDP from a peak of 19 percent in 1996, facilitating a fall in Australian interest rates toward international levels. 11. Fiscal policy has also sought to improve economic efficiency through a landmark tax reform package and more recent business tax reform proposals. The tax reform package known as ANTS-A New Tax System-is centered on the introduction of a broad- based goods and services tax (GST), modeled on the VAT, at a rate of 10 percent, which will come into effect on July 1,200O. The new tax system (Box 3) will: (i) broaden the tax base by replacing the multiple-rate wholesale sales tax (WST) with a single-rate GST that covers the growing service sector- the WST covered goods only; (ii) improve the direct/indirect tax mix, given the cuts in personal income taxes offered as part of the compensation for the GST; ’ The year-on-year September quarter increase was 1.7 percent; adjusting for the one-off impact of the Government’s private health care rebate, however, the increase was 2.2 percent. 2 Price discounts on car imports have reduced the CPI by %I percent over the past two years.

Australia: Tax Reform Parliament recently legislated a tax reform package known as ANTS-A New Tax System-which is centered on the introduction of a 10 percent goods and services tax (GST), effective July 1,ZOOO. The GST is broad-based, covering most goods and services, except basic food, education, health, and childcare. The GST replaces a nlltnber of selective taxes on goods such as the Wholesale Sales Tax (with rates up to 45 percent). ANTS is expected to raise the CPI by about 2 percent over the medium term, given that the coverage of the GST is broader than that of the Wholesale Sales Tax. Compensation for the cost of living increase stemming from the GST is included in the tax reform package. Personal tax rates will be cut and social welfare benefits raised, so that most middle-income families will receive increases in real disposable income ranging from 2 percent to 10 percent (after adjusting for the GST). The budgetary cost of the reform is about 1 percent of GDP per annum from 2000/O 1 onwards. As a result of the compensation package, effective marginal income tax rates are being lowered, resulting in a shift in the tax-revenue mix toward indirect taxation. Tax cuts will mean that about 80 percent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of 30 percent or less. The income threshold for the top marginal tax rate will be raised from A$50,000 to A$60,000 per annti, but the rate will remain unchanged at 47 percent. For many families, effective marginal tax rates will be cut from 85% percent to about 61% percent, due to the income tax cuts and a reduction in the family benefits withdrawal rate for extra income earned. Vertical fiscal imbalances will be reduced, as State governments will receive all the GST revenue. This revenue will fully compensate the states for the loss of income from the removal of some indirect taxes and the abolition of general-purpose grants from the Commonwealth, giving the states a more reIiable and buoyant sonrce of revenue. Reform of business taxation is also underway to reduce excessive complexity. The first stage of these reforms includes: reducing the company income tax rate from 36 percent to 34 percent for the 2OOO/Ol income year and to 30 percent for the 2001/02 income year; removing most accelerated depreciation allowances; and simplifying the system of capital gains taxation by doing away with indexation and subjecting only one-half of realized long-term nominal capital gains to taxation. Moreover, company tax payments are to be simplified by moving to a unified “pay-as-you go” system for all tax obligations based on single quarterly tax payments during the income year, which would replace five different payment and reporting systems that involved payments after the end of the income year. The first stage of reform, however, would be revenue negative, with budgetary costs of about % percent of GDP in aggregate over five years. A proposed second stage of business tax reform, which would take effect from July 2001, includes measures to simplify the tax code and improve the integrity of the tax system. A weakness of the current system is that individuals can significantly reduce their income tax liabilities by channeling income to trusts and splitting the income among beneficiaries of the trust (typically family members) that face lower marginal income tax rates. Similarly, individuals can take advantage of the differential between the top marginal income tax rate and the company tax rate by channeling income through companies. In order to protect the income tax base and improve the equity of the tax system, reforms have been proposed that would restrict the use of trusts and companies as vehicles for reducing tax liabilities. The second stage of the reforms would be revenue positive, with the expected result that the business tax reforms would be broadly revenue neutral overall.

The government also recently announced a two-staged business tax reform proposal, which would progressively cut the corporate tax rate from 36 percent to 30 percent, scrap accelerated depreciation allowances, and halve capital gains tax for long-term investors. 12. Tax reform initiatives will nevertheless carry a budgetary cost. ANTS will lower the Commonwealth’s surplus by almost 1 percent of GDP per year on average, reflecting income tax cuts and social welfare benefit increases offered as compensation for the reduction in real incomes due to the price level increase associated with the introduction of the GST (see below). The first stage of the recent business tax reform proposal is also slightly revenue negative, but a second stage of reforms-including restricting the use of trusts to avoid individual income taxation-is expected to bring about broad revenue-neutrality. 13. The staffs near-term outlook-which is broadly in line with private and ofkial forecasts-is for a moderate slowing in growth, some pickup in inflation, and a gradual narrowing of the current account deficit. Recent retail sales data suggest ongoing strength of private consumption, which should be sustained by high levels of consumer confidence, continued employment growth, and real income gains from the tax-reform compensation package. Recent approvals data suggest that housing investment will also underpin growth, although this partly reflects some bringing forward of spending ahead of the GST.3 In contrast, some slowing of business investment from recent high levels-particularly in the mining sector-is suggested by recent surveys of investment intentions. With the external environment continuing to improve, net exports are projected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth in 2000 for the first time since 1997, assisted also by the boost to invisibles earnings from the Olympics. Inflation-excluding the first round impact of the GST-is expected by the staff to rise toward the upper end of the authorities’ 2-3 percent target range over the next l-2 years, reflecting a pickup in unit labor costs (as productivity growth eases and the labor market tightens), an end of price discounting by Asian suppliers, and higher world oil prices. Overlaid on this will be the impact of the GST, which could add 3X-4 percent to the CPI in the third quarter of next year, about double the estimated medium-term impact4 3 Some housing expenditure is expected to be brought forward since housing construction costs will be taxed under the GST. Conversely, some expenditure, including on cars and computers, is expected to be deferred since the WST (amounting to 22 percent on such items) will be removed from these items and they will qualify for input tax credits under the GST. Overall, changes in the timing of expenditure are likely to lower GDP by about ?4 percent in the year to June 2000, with an offsetting increase in the following year. 4 The initial impact of ANTS on the CPI will be somewhat larger than the long-run impact, because consumer prices are expected to take longer to adjust to the removal of the WST than to the introduction of the GST. Moreover, the removal of some other indirect taxes (the (continued. ) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- 14. The staff sees three main risks to its forecast. First, notwithstanding the more favorable external environment, global growth could still be adversely affected by an abrupt asset price correction in the United States. This could slow Australia’s exports and delay external adjustment, possibly causing market confidence to waver and giving rise to higher risk premia and downward pressure on the exchange rate. Second, consumption could be stronger if recent housing and equity price increases were sustained, which would also delay external adjustment and add to inflationary pressures. Third, there could be a wage response to the GST, despite the compensation package, if the initial price impact is larger than expected, prompting a monetary policy response to safeguard the inflation target. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Monetary Policy 15. RBA offkials considered that the supportive monetary policy stance since the onset of the Asian crisis had been appropriate in light of the benign inflation outlook. The relatively easy stance was apparent from the low level of interest rates, relatively strong private credit growth and associated run-up in household debt, and the depreciation of the Australian dollar during 1997-98. While the appreciation of the currency since late 1998 had tightened monetary conditions somewhat, the Australian dollar remained some 10 percent more depreciated in nominal effective terms than in the year before the Asian crisis. 16. The appropriateness of an expansionary stance had become questionable, RBA offtcials considered, with the recent and prospective further improvement in the global economic environment. The RBA expected only a moderate near-term slowing in growth, and noted that maintaining an expansionary stance ran the risk of pushing core inflation above the midpoint of the target zone over the next l-2 years. While recognizing that the target zone did not have hard edges under Australia’s relatively flexible inflation-targeting f?amework,5 the authorities and mission agreed that setting policy so that forecast core inflation is at the midpoint of the target zone stood the best chance of meeting the inflation objective over time, and that acting in a pre-emptive manner was likely to reduce the size of required actions. On this basis, and given the staffs assessment that the economy was operating close to potential, the mission recommended a modest tightening of monetary policy. In addition, the mission concurred with the RF3A’s policy of looking through the first round impact of the GST on prices. 17. The RBA increased the cash rate on November 3,1999, by 25 basis points, to 5 percent, but a further modest tightening is likely to be needed to move policy to an financial institutions duty and stamp duties on marketable securities, both levied by the States) is scheduled to take place a year after the introduction of the GST. ’ For a discussion of the modalities of Australia’s inflation targeting framework, see Australia: Benejitingfrom Economic Reform (IMF, 1999) Chapter 5.

That policy remains on the easy side of neutral is apparent from the fact that virtually all borrowers face nominal and real interest rates well below the levels prevailing during the previous trough in interest rates in 1993/94.6 While it is difficult to determine the neutral stance precisely, the stti considers that a further tightening of about 50 basis points (broadly in line with financial market expectations) in coming months would be appropriate. RBA officials considered that the required cash rate increase would be much less now than in 1994 (the increase then was 275 basis points), given the Bank’s enhanced policy credibility and the greater degree of household indebtedness at present, while Treasury officials emphasized the ability of the economy to sustain noninflationary growth without a tightening of policy. 18. Following the achievement of a neutral stance, the need for any further policy action would depend on a continuing assessment of the balance of risks. While there are some downside risks to the inflation outlook-including, as emphasized by Treasury offtcials, spillovers from a possible abrupt stock price correction in the U.S.-a number of upside risks are also present. In addition to continued strong asset price increases and a possible wage response to the GST discussed earlier, the upside risks include: uncertainties about the level of the NAIRU and associated speed limit effects as unemployment declines further; and greater-than-expected increases in import prices, particularly as demand for cars is expected to pickup in the second half of 2000 due to the replacement of the WST by the GST. B. Fiscal Policy 19. The authorities explained that the principal objective of fiscal policy was to achieve fiscal balance, on average, over the economic cycle. This objective was consistent with running surpluses in periods of strong growth, and having the flexibility for deficits during downturns. In a growing economy, average balance over the cycle would also allow the government net debt ratio to be reduced over time. Finally, with the government’s investment needs being met out of its own saving, the current account position would essentially reflect private sector decisions, and the government could be said to be making an adequate contribution to national saving, as required by the Charter of Budget Honesty. 20. The authorities considered that the near-term fiscal position was appropriate. Modest surpluses are expected to be maintained in the near-term, despite the costs of both the ANTS package and operations in East Timor. As a result of these costs, however, a small 6 Nominal and real housing and personal lending rates are 2-3 percentage points below their 1993/94 trough, and business lending rates are l-2 percentage points below the 1993/94 level. (The real interest rate measures used here are based on actual inflation; using forecast inflation would serve to magnify these differences.) The present level of lending rates reflects in part increased competition in financial markets, as the cash rate actually stood 25 basis points above its 1993/94 trough, following the November 3 tightening.

The authorities explained that the stimulus in 2000/01 was an inevitable cost of achieving the Australia: Selected Commonwealth Budget Indicators (-In percent of GDP) 199w99 1999/2000 2000101 2001102 2002103 Fiscal (accrual) balance 0.6 0.8 0.7 Structural balance l! 0.9 0.5 0.1 Underlying cash balance 0.7 0.6 0.1 Memorandum items: E&t on the fiscal balance of: ANTS package . -0.2 -1 .o First stage, business tax reform 0.0 0.0 Second stage, business tax reform . . 0.0 0.1 Operations in East Timor 21 -0.2 0.0 Total . -0.4 -0.9 l/ Staff estimate; adjusted to exclude the above-normal dividend &om the REM in 1999/2000. 2/ Net of expected payments finm the UN and the levy on high income taxpayers. 0.4 1.3 0.7 1.5 0.7 1.5 -0.7 -1.1 -0.2 -0.1 0.1 0.1 -0.1 -0.1 -0.9 -1.1 long-term benefits of tax reform.’ The mission broadly concurred with this assessment, noting also that the estimated stimulus in 2000/01 would be smaller than the budgetary cost of ANTS due to ongoing structural expenditure cuts, including for the public sector wage bill and interest costs. 21. The authorities and mission agreed on the importance of not allowing the surplus to be eroded in the period ahead. The main risk related to defense costs associated with peacekeeping operations in East Timor and, to a lesser degree, business tax reform. The Treasurer had publicly committed not to allow the increase in defense costs (estimated at some 0.15 percent of GDP per annum over the next four years) to erode the surplus. The mission stressed the importance of this commitment to offsetting measures, particularly given 7 The 0.5 percent of GDP drop in the underlying cash surplus in 2000/01 is partly a reflection of the above-normal dividend from the RBA in the 1999/2000 budget. The fiscal balance on an accrual basis, however, is higher than the corresponding cash surplus in 2000/01. This reflects the move to the new pay-as-you-go system for company tax, which brings forward tax liabilities, thereby raising accrual revenue, combined with a transitional agreement, in which corporates may defer the first year impact of these liabilities for 2’65 years, thereby lowering the cash revenue measure (see Box 3). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- that a small fiscal stimulus was already in prospect for 2000/01. In late November 1999, a temporary levy on high-income taxpayers was announced, which would help defray expected outlays associated with peacekeeping operations in East Timor in 2000/01. With regard to business tax, while the first stage of reform was expected to be mildly revenue-negative, a political agreement on the second stage was reached in November 1999 that should ensure broad revenue-neutrality for the overall package (stages 1 and 2 combined). The authorities acknowledged that the two major tax reform initiatives constituted a challenge for tax administration, but considered that the resources of the tax office had been increased sufficiently to make the revenue projections achievable. 22. Beyond the current and next fiscal years, the authorities projected that the budget surplus would climb to 1% percent of GDP by 2002/03. Although they noted that the specific magnitude of the surplus within the l-l ‘/2 percent of GDP range was not of much significance, they were committed to maintaining surpluses as long as economic conditions remained sound. The mission accepted that the appropriate level of surplus within this range was a matter of judgment, but nevertheless stressed the importance of achieving the path of rising surpluses in order to underpin external adjustment and market confidence, while enhancing fiscal credibility. 23. The authorities explained that, with Commonwealth net debt declining to very low levels and possibly eliminated altogether if the remaining public share in Telstra (the major telecommunications company) were sold, the issue arose of how to continue to maintain a liquid government bond market. While the further decline in net public debt- already low by international standards-was a welcome prospect, there was agreement on the need to avoid any associated disruption to the capital markets. To maintain bond market liquidity, the authorities intended to purchase fixed income assets (mostly foreign government bonds, which would be swapped into Australian dollars) to offset gross debt liabilities.* They noted that the benefits of maintaining such a market included: avoiding the loss of key benchmarks used by the capital markets; easier implementation of monetary policy; and lower costs of raising government funds in the future, given the existing market infrastructure. 24. On long-term fiscal issues, Australia, like most other industrial countries, will likely experience budgetary pressures from population aging and technology-driven increases in real per capita health care costs, beginning in about 2010. Demographic projections suggest that the old-age dependency ratio will more than double in the next fifty years, to almost 40 percent. On this basis, staff projections-which are broadly in line with those undertaken by the Treasury’s Retirement Income Modeling (RIM) Unit but are nevertheless subject to considerable uncertainty-suggest that combined public and private health expenditure could rise by 6-7 percent of GDP to about 15 percent of GDP by 2050, * The authorities considered that gross debt liabilities of A$%-60 billion (about 8-9 percent of GDP) would be sufficient to maintain a liquid government bond market. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - partly due to aging but mainly due to technology-driven increases.’ The compulsory private sector superannuation scheme (which requires employers to contribute at a rate of 7 percent of earnings at present, rising to 9 percent by 2002/03), together with means testing of public pensions, should limit the rise in public pension costs tol%2 percent of GDP through 2050. Nevertheless, on present policies, staff projections would suggest a deterioration in the fiscal balance from a surplus of 1% percent of GDP in 2002/03 to a deficit of some 4-5 percent of GDP in 2050. 25. The authorities considered that Australia was well placed to deal with possible long-term budgetary pressures, given its low level of public debt, younger population than other industrial countries, compulsory superannuation scheme, and recent measures to arrest the decline in participation in private health insurance schemes.” They noted further that real per capita increases in public health costs had been contained so far, and that continued attention to the supply side-e.g., limiting coverage of certain medical procedures and pharmaceuticals- could lessen the long-term budgetary burden, 26. The mission agreed that Australia was ahead of many other countries in coping with this problem, but nevertheless suggested early consideration of possible solutions. At issue were both the level of services to be provided by the public sector-including the use of rationing or user charges to limit demand, as well as direct measures to boost private provision- and the method of funding. Pending a consensus on the extent of the Commonwealth’s future obligations, the mission suggested that a prudent course would be to continue to run modest fiscal surpluses, on average, over the medium-term, rather than targeting balance, on average, over the economic cycle. Such a course would reduce the need for possibly costly future policy changes should the burden on the public sector of rising health care costs become sizable. A further rationale was provided by the Commonwealth’s unfunded pension liabilities, which amounted to some 11 percent of GDP in mid-1999. The authorities responded that the intergenerational assessment required by the Charter of Budget Honesty could be a vehicle for public debate on how best to address these issues. The mission encouraged early publication of this assessment, which was due within the next three years. ’ At present, about half of health expenditure is undertaken by the Commonwealth, one- quarter by the States, and one-quarter by the private sector. lo A tax rebate for purchase of private health insurance was introduced in early 1999.

With the envisaged improvement in the external environment, Australia’s current account deficit is expected to narrow to a sustainable level over the medium term. According to staff estimates, the widening of the current account deficit to about 6 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1999 reflected the strength of domestic demand at a time when foreign demand fell off sharply and the terms of trade were weak. With the expected recovery in foreign demand and the terms of trade, some easing in domestic demand growth, and the full impact on net exports of the 13 percent real effective depreciation of the currency since the early-l 997 level, the staff would see the current account deficit gradually narrowing to 3% percent of GDP by 2004 (Annex I); this level is in line with the saving-investment norm. On this basis, the staff does not consider the Australian dollar to be significantly out of line on a multilateral basis at present. The authorities agreed that, under the floating exchange rate regime, changes in the exchange rate over the past two years had resulted in a broadly appropriate present level, which would help to underpin future export growth and profitability in the tradeables sector. 28. Nevertheless, the net external liabilities ratio-which is high by industrial- country standards, and rising-would suggest a significant degree of external vulnerability in Australia’s case. However, the composition of such liabilities-including the significant, and rising, proportion of net equity liabilities-could serve to reduce external sector risks since firms would be able to weather financial turbulence more smoothly through reducing dividend payments, while avoiding rollover risk. In addition, for debt-related claims measured on a residual maturity basis, gross short-term external debt amounted to 28 percent of GDP in mid-1999 (on a net basis, 15 percent of GDP)-somewhat lower than in a number of other industrial countries, while gross official reserve coverage of gross short-term debt was about average for industrial countries, at 15 percent. 29. The authorities and mission agreed that several factors mitigated external vulnerability (see also Box 4): l First, banks and corporates are reportedly well hedged against exchange rate movements, and banks reportedly carry little interest rate risk on their balance sheets. This risk-averse approach reflects the extended period during which the private sector has been exposed to a floating exchange rate and market-determined interest rates, and widespread hedging is also apparent from the robustness of bank and corporate balance sheets during the exchange and interest rate cycles of the past five years. l1 Stress tests undertaken by the larger banks suggest that risks associated l1 The length of hedges varies widely across sectors, from predominantly l-year for energy exporters, to more than lo-years for gold producers.

Australia: External Exposure Net external liabilities (defined as minus the Net International Investment Position) rose to 60 percent of GDP in at end-September 1999, up from 44 percent of GDP at end-1989. One-third of net external liabilities consist of equity claims, which more than doubled as a percent of GDP over the decade, while two-thirds were debt claims. Despite the rise in net liabilities, income payments as a percentage of exports of goods and services fell from 30 percent to 25 percent over the past decade, reflecting lower interest rams. The bulk of external debt is owed by the private sector, with all of the increase in external debt in the 1990s reflecting private sector borrowing. Net public sector external debt reached a peak of 15 percent of GDP in 1993, but fell to 7 percent of GDP by end-September 1999, due to ongoing fiscal consolidation. Threequarters of gross external private debt at end-June 1999 was owed by financial institutions as against less than one-half at end- 1989. Australia has virtually no publicly-guaranteed private debt, Two-fifths of gross external debt is denominated in Australian dollars. In addition, Australia’s foreign- currency denominated external assets exceed its foreign currency denominated liabilities. About one-half of gross external debt is short-term (on a residual maturity basis), a proportion that is in line with the industrial-country average. Gross official reserves at end-June 1999 were equivalent to 15 percent of gross short-term debt, broadly in line with the industrial country average. RI3A outstanding forwards contracts have tripled since mid-1998, reflecting both intervention and domestic liquidity management operations (including A$5 billion in connection with the further privatization of Tel&a in October 1999). The RBA has purchased foreign currency options as well, although its policy is not to write such options, which effectively limits the downside risk to the amount of the premium paid up front Australia: Selected Debt and Reserve Statistics (As a percent of GDP at end-year) End-See. 1989 1996 1999 Net external liabilities 43.7 56.9 59.6 Net external equity liabilities 9.8 16.7 19.9 Net external debt liabilities 33.9 40.3 39.7 Net public sector debt 8.2 13.6 7.1 11 Net private sector debt 25.7 26.7 32.7 11 Gross external debt liabilities 47.3 57.2 59.5 11 Gross public sector debt 16.7 19.5 13.7 l!

In aggregate, capital comprises 10% percent of risk- weighted assets, while impaired assets have fallen from 6-7 percent of total assets in 1992 to less than 1 percent in 1999, notwithstanding an uptick in early 1998 in connection with the onset of the Asian crisis. In part, the improvement in the impaired assets ratio relates to the cyclical position of the economy and the low level of interest rates, but it also reflects the more risk-averse approach taken following the losses experienced as a result of the 1991 recession, mainly on corporate lending. The after- tax return on equity has also been healthy, exceeding 15 percent in recent years. Finally, the authorities considered that Australia’s prudential supervision regime- including the degree of information disclosure by banks-was at the forefront of international practice, mrther underpinning market confidence in the banking system. 0 Third, while private sector debt has increased in recent years, household net worth has also risen and the corporate debt/equity ratio has fallen (Box 5). The authorities considered that the household sector was capable of servicing even a large rise in interest rates-indeed, mortgage interest rates would need to rise from about 6% percent at present to 10-l 1 percent to lift debt servicing costs to the peak experienced in the early 1990s. Even at that level, default rates on mortgages were low. Household balance sheets could also likely withstand a significant drop in asset prices-for example, an across-the-board 30 percent drop would still leave assets at more than five times liabilities. 0 Fourth, market discipline under Australia’s transparent policy framework should prevent an excessive buildup of economic imbalances, and thereby reduce the ultimate costs of any needed policy adjustments. l3 30. On balance, the mission considered that the external sector risks were manageable provided Australia continues to implement strong macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, and remains vigilant in monitoring developments in the banking sector. In this regard, the mission stressed the importance of maintaining a strong fiscal policy-as discussed above-and of removing potential distortions to private saving and investment decisions that could detract from the sustainability of the current account l2 These results are reported to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) on a quarterly basis. Although current stress tests do not take account of credit or counterparty risk, the larger banks are developing systems that seek to combine market and credit risk.

Australia: Recent Behavior of Household and Corporate Balance Sheets The strength of household consumption and corporate investment in recent years raises questions about whether household and corporate sector balance sheets a= vulnerable to an economic slowdown or a correction in asset prices, including interest rates. The data presented below suggest that while the gross debt of households and, to a lesser extent, nor&an&l corporates, has risen, assets have grown even more, and debt-service mtios have fallen to historically low levels, suggesting some resilience to any slowdown in economic activity. Nonetheless, the buildup in gross assets and liabilities makes households and corporates more exposed thau in the past to adverse movements in asset prices, and the impact of a rise in interest rates may be larger than in earlier years. Household sector l With continued strong growth in consumer spending, household debt increased to about 94 percent of disposable income in mid-1999, Corn just over 50 percent in the early 1990s (see table below). While the ratio of debt to disposable income has risen significantly in Australia, it is still lower than in a number of other advanced economies. . Lower interest rates have meaut that, despite the increase in debt levels, interest payments as a proportion of disposable income have fallen from a historical peak of 12 percent in 1990 to 7% percent in early 1999. . Even though debt increased, household net worth increased to almost six and a half times disposable income by mid-l 999, from just under five .times income in 1990, reflecting higher house and equity prices, growth in superannuation funds as a result of compulsory contributions, aud an increase in the number of shareholders (given sizable privatizations in recent years, including Telstra). Corporate sector a The nonfinancial corporate debt-to-equity ratio declined to about 75 percent in 1998, less than half the ratio in 1990. Australia’s corporate debt-to-equity ratio is comparable to that in the U.S. and Singapore, but lower than in Japan. . Over the same period, the debt-service burden has fallen to historically low levels. In 1998, the ratio of gross interest payments to gross income was 17% percent, the lowest ratio since 1971, and less than half’the level of the 1980s.

The mission supported the improvement in the mix between direct and indirect taxes and the scrapping of accelerated depreciation in the recent tax reform packages, as well as the ongoing increases in compulsory superannuation contribution rates. A forthcoming government paper on social welfare reform may also help to identify ways of reducing social welfare dependency, and thereby improve both work and saving incentives. D. Productivity Growth and Structural Reform 31. Labor and total factor productivity growth have increased during the 1990s to the highest rates seen since the “golden age” of the 196Os, helping to reverse the slide in per capita income levels relative to OECD countries. While part of this improvement reflects cyclical factors, staff analysis suggests that structural reform-including competition policy and trade liberalization-has also played a key role, adding perhaps X-1 percentage point to Australia’s sustainable TFP growth rate.14 On this basis, staff estimates of Australia’s medium-term potential growth rate are in the range of 31&41/4 percent. While this range is fairly wide-which underscores the need to continue to set policies with some uncertainty about the potential growth rate-the midpoint is nevertheless significantly higher than earlier staff estimates of 3-3X percent. 32. The authorities considered that the recent strong productivity performance demonstrated the payoff from sustained, wide-ranging, structural reforms in combination with a sound macroeconomic policy framework. Recent research by the Productivity Commission (a government think tank) further supports the link between reforms and productivity growth. It suggests that industries that have been most affected by reforms-such as utilities (where monopolies have been exposed to competition) and some manufacturers (such as whiteware producers, where tariff protection was cut)-have shown the biggest surge in productivity. On the other hand, the pickup in productivity has been muted for the passenger motor vehicle (PMV) and textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industries, which have retained a higher degree of import tariff protection. 33. The mission stressed the need to persevere with the structural reform agenda in order to sustain-and even improve upon -recent performance. The discussions focused on four key areas: competition policy; trade policy; tax reform; and labor market deregulation. Competition policy 34. The authorities stated that implementation of the National Competition Policy was on track. A guiding principle was to achieve competitive neutrality (i.e., public enterprises should enjoy no unfair advantages vis-a-vis private ones) and to allow access to l4 See Box 1 and Ranil Salgado, “Australia: Recent Productivity Performance,” Chapter I of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicessential infrastructure, such as telecommunications networks. The authorities pointed to significant gains from the reforms in terms of lower prices: for example, natural gas prices have fallen in recent years by 30-40 percent at the wholesale level. Looking ahead, the mission stressed the importance of completing by end-2000 the review of all Commonwealth and State legislation which may have an adverse impact on competition, and the importance of the Commonwealth and States adhering to competition policy principles. Trade policy 35. The authorities reaffIrmed their commitment to an open trading system. They noted that the maximum general tariff rate (5 percent) was low except in the PMV and TCF sectors. While tariff rate reductions in these sectors are to be suspended between 2001-05 in reflection of the significant declines to date and in order to give the industries further opportunity to upgrade technology and im been made to resume reductions in 2005.’ P rove competitiveness, a public commitment has The mission stressed the importance of legislating this commitment in a timely fashion in order to promote adjustment in these sectors. It also suggested that the benefits of international competition would be well-served by establishing a timetable for reductions in the general tariff rate in line with Australia’s APEC commitment for free trade and open investment by 2010. Tax reform 36. The authorities considered that tax reform would raise real income levels over time, including by improving competitiveness-exporters will be able to claim a rebate for tax paid on inputs under the GST-and raising investment efficiency-e.g., by scrapping accelerated depreciation. The mission considered that other benefits would likely accrue over the medium-term, not least the gains from reducing the complexity of the current system. Going forward, the mission agreed that the focus of future reform should be to reduce effective marginal tax rates further, in order to improve work and saving incentives. Labor market deregulation 37. The authorities are pursuing a “second wave” of labor market deregulation that would build on the 1996 reforms. In particular, they have proposed legislation that would reduce further the number of employment conditions that awards can cover, as well as the arbitration powers of the Industrial Relations Commission. The authorities noted that these reforms would tend to limit the role of awards to that of providing a safety net of basic minimum wages and conditions of employment, intended to protect the low-paid. Further l5 The public commitment is to reduce tariffs on PMVs from 15 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2005, and tariffs on TCFs from 5-25 percent in 2000 to 5-17X percent in 2005. Tariffs in these sectors have already been reduced substantially (from over 50 percent in the late 1980s).

IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 38. The Australian economy has continued to perform impressively since the last Article IV consultation was concluded in late 1998. Economic growth surpassed expectations, productivity growth was sustained at a high rate, and inflation remained low. The durability of the current expansion reflects the sustained commitment to strong macroeconomic policies and ongoing structural reforms. 39. The economic outlook is also favorable. Output is expected to grow broadly in line with potential during 2000-O 1, while inflation should remain within the RBA’s target zone despite some pickup in price pressures from both foreign and domestic sources. The current account deficit, which reached some 6 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1999, is expected to narrow over the next two years, as the external environment improves further. 40. The staff endorses the recent modest tightening of monetary policy, but considers that a further small move in the same direction is likely to be needed in order to shift monetary policy to an appropriately neutral stance. Acting in a forward-looking manner is preferable to waiting until actual inflationary pressures surface, given that the magnitude of required policy actions is likely to be lower when actions are preemptive. Following achievement of a neutral stance, the need for any further action should be assessed based on carehl monitoring of the risks to inflation from continued strong credit growth and asset price increases; continued declines in the unemployment rate toward the NAIRU; price pressures from foreign sources; and possible wage pressures associated with the GST. 41. The fiscal consolidation path envisaged in the recent mid-year fiscal update should help to maintain market confidence while the current account deficit remains high, and enhance the credibility of the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives. In particular, the gradual increase in the fiscal surplus toward 1 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year and further to 1% percent by 2002/03 is consistent with official objectives to: maintain budgetary surpluses while economic prospects remain sound; and reduce government expenditure and net debt ratios. Apart from underpinning external adjustment and market confidence, achieving the path of rising fiscal surpluses will bolster fiscal credibility. In this regard, the staff supports the recently-announced levy on high-income taxpayers to offset the costs associated with peacekeeping efforts in East Timor in 2000/01. The staff recognizes that the fiscal stimulus in 2000/01 (associated with ANTS) reflects the inevitable costs of achieving the long-term benefits of tax reform, and also supports the recent political agreement to implement the business tax reform in a revenue-neutral fashion. 42. Australia, like a number of other industrial countries, will likely experience long-term budgetary pressures from a combination of population aging and technology- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - driven trend increases in real per capita health care expenditures. While Australia is in a somewhat better position than many other countries given its compulsory superannuation scheme and somewhat younger population, the budget is unlikely to remain immune from these pressures. The stafI’endorses efforts in train to prepare an intergenerational assessment of these issues, as required by the Charter of Budget Honesty. Pending a consensus on the extent of the Commonwealth’s future obligations, a prudent course would be to run modest fiscal surpluses, on average, over the medium-term, rather than balance, on average, over the economic cycle. Such a course would reduce the need for possibly costly future policy changes should the burden on the public sector of rising health care costs remain large. 43. Australia’s high ratio of net external liabilities to GDP and sizable current account deficit bring to the fore longstanding issues of external vulnerability. However, several factors-including the floating exchange rate regime and absence of significant misalignment of the Australian dollar; widespread hedging against exchange rate movements; and the soundness of the banking system-mitigate the associated risks. On balance, the staffs assessment is that external sector risks are manageable, provided Australia continues to implement strong macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, and remains vigilant in monitoring developments in the banking sector. Such a course should extend the current favorable assessment of Australia by international financial markets. 44. While the pickup in productivity growth in recent years partly reflects cyclical factors, it is also due to continued progress in implementing structural reforms. The staff considers that such reforms have raised Australia’s sustainable TFP growth rate by ‘X-1 percentage point, thereby enhancing the growth potential of the economy. To maintain, and even improve upon this performance, sustained implementation of the structural reform agenda is essential, including in the following key areas: a Continued application of the National Competition Policy and trade reform. This will involve completing the review of Commonwealth and State legislation in order to remove anti-competitive features by end-2000, and continued application of competition policy principles. On trade, commitments to reduce tariffs in the PMV and TCF sectors should be legislated as planned, and a timetable for reducing the general tariff rate in line with Australia’s APEC commitments should be established. l Tax reform. The landmark legislation due to take effect in mid-2000 is expected to remove a number of longstanding deficiencies in Australia’s tax system. The staff also supports the more recent business tax reform proposals, which are likely to boost investment efficiency and export competitiveness, with significant gains for the economy as a whole. 0 Labor market deregulation. Proposed amendments to the Workplace Relations Act should help to improve the i?mctioning of the labor market. Beyond these steps, staff would support efforts to unify Federal and State industrial relations legislation in order to eventually replace the award system altogether with a single minimum set of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-29- working conditions. This would help to reduce structural unemployment, which remains high. 45. Australia publishes an array of high-quality economic and financial statistics that are well-suited for surveillance. As regards Y2K issues, Australia would appear to have a high degree of preparedness, including in the public sector, financial sector, telecommunications, energy, and transportation. 46. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Australia take place on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

GDP growth is expected to moderate to 4% percent in 1999 and 3% percent in 2000, reflecting a gradual slowdown in household consumption growth to its trend rate, the scaling back of investment (including in the mining sector) from the recent high level, and the delaying of equipment investment during the first half of 2000 in response to the scheduled introduction of the GST package (Table I. 1). Growth would pick up slightly to 33/4 percent in 200 1 as investment recovers with the projected strengthening of commodity prices and a modest fiscal stimulus associated with the introduction of the GST in July 2000. Growth should remain in the range of 3%33/ percent over the medium term, in line with the staff’s current estimate of the potential growth rate. Inflation is expected to rise to 4% percent in 2000 with the introduction of the GST. Excluding the effect of the GST, inflation is projected to rise toward the upper end of the RBA’s 2-3 percent target zone in the next l-2 years as unit labor costs pick up, price discounts on Asian imports are reversed, and world oil price increases feed through to domestic prices. Over the medium term, inflation is assumed to decline to the midpoint of the authorities’ target zone, in line with the inflation targeting framework. On the external side, export growth is expected to strengthen substantially in 2000, as the Asian recovery improves external demand and the terms of trade, the full impact of depreciation during 1997-98 filters through to net exports, and the Olympics boost service exports in the second half of the year. As the result, the current account deficit would narrow from about 6 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3% percent of GDP by 2004, thereby stabilizing net external liabilities at about two-thirds of GDP. From a macroeconomic balance perspective, the narrowing of the current account deficit would come about largely through an increase in national saving, both public and private. In the public sector, general government saving would improve by about ‘/z percent of GDP, in line with the authorities’ medium-term projections in the Commonwealth budget. Private saving would improve by 1 percent of GDP, reflecting an increase in household saving as a result of the decline in the unemployment rate, a lower reliance on direct taxes, and an increase in the superannuation contribution rate.

Two main restrictions on foreigners require: (i) authorization for significant ownership of Australian corporations; and (ii) approval for acquisition of real estate (land and dwellings), which is normally granted. Ix. Last Article IV Consultation. Discussions for the 1998 Article IV consultation were held in Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney from June 19-30, 1998. The 1998 consultation (W/98/21 1) was completed by the Executive Board on October 28, 1998 (EBM/98/109). X. Consultation Cycle. Australia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. XI. Other. Australia intends to formally indicate to the IMF its acceptance of the proposed Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement in the near future.

Australia publishes a wide array of economic and financial data. It has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted in the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). The authorities expect to complete in the coming months the development of a National Summary Data Page, which will be linked to the DSBB. Real Sector 2. In April 1999, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published a revised set of annual national accounts that reflect the latest international standards. The improvements associated with the new data include significant revisions in the business register to reflect better data on births and deaths of businesses, and improvements in the constant price estimates for the finance and insurance industry to better reflect productivity changes. In addition, chain volume measures were introduced last year, which resulted in significant downward revisions to real investment and imports (but little change to real GDP). 3. The ABS has also completed work on the periodic review and reweighting of the CPI, which was introduced in the September quarter of 1998, with the aim of moving to a better measure of inflation for the household sector as a whole. The most significant changes are the exclusion of mortgage interest and consumer credit charges from the index and the inclusion of net expenditure on new dwellings. Accordingly, the publication of the Treasury’s “Measure of Underlying Inflation” was discontinued in the September quarter of 1999. The CPI from the September quarter of 2000 will include financial services, comprising the deposit and loan activities of households, stockbroking and life insurance and superannuation-the total weight on these activities could reach 10 percent. 4. In the national accounts, near-term projects include generating quarterly input-output tables to balance the national accounts on a quarterly--rather than annual--basis, and introducing a new survey to allow the inclusion of computer software purchases as intangible fixed assets rather than as intermediate consumption. Also, the ABS plans to release early next year an article explaining the effect of the goods and services tax (GST) on GDP deflators, to be followed by supplementary information in the September quarter, including explanations of the impact of the GST on the price level. A longer-term project is to develop satellite accounts, which would integrate social, economic and environmental data. Government Finance 5. The government will complete the transition from cash to accrual budgeting in the Commonwealth Government’s 1999-2000 budget, to provide a more comprehensive indication of the total activity of the Government and the long-term effects of current policy. Because of the resulting delay in the publication of the fiscal data, the authorities will request a temporary exemption from compliance with the timeliness requirement for the SDDS.

In September 1997, the AE3S revised the balance of payments and international investment position statistics to bring them into line with the Balance of PaymentsManual, 5th Edition. A by-product of these revisions was the loss of comparable historical data on the currency composition of the stock of external debt. 7. Data on external assets and liabilities at the sectoral level are publicly available. Data on short-term external debt (residual maturity basis) are also published, but are disaggregated only by currency. Offkial Reserves and Debt 8. Timely data are publicly available on the aggregate level of foreign reserves and debt, as well as the forward position of the RBA. Additional information on the currency composition and duration of the reserves portfolio is available in the RBA’s Annual Report. B. Y2K 9. The final ARS report on YZK issued in October 1999 (based on a survey of 8,000 businesses covering all industries and all sizes) showed that 93 percent of firms were aware of the problem, but that just under 60 percent of firms intended to or had already taken action to address it. The ABS noted that action was related to size: almost all businesses with more than 200 employees responded positively to the survey, but only about half of the small businesses (1 to 4 employees) did so. As the result, businesses producing 90 percent of total sales of goods and services intended to or had taken action regarding YZK. 10. The Council of Financial Regulators (the RE3A, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission) reported in September 1999 on the YZK preparedness of all regulated financial institutions as well as the payments system and securities markets. Remediation and testing of systems was virtually complete and contingency planning was well advanced. Industry-wide testing in the payments system had been successfully completed. The Council also reported that deposits were safe, records were not at risk, and electronic payments mechanisms, including ATMs, were YZK ready. 11. The RBA reported that YZK concerns resulted in some borrowing being brought forward into 1999 to lock in funding. Also, liquidity concerns of banks related to YZK may have influenced short-term interest rates; however, the “spike” in expectations about Australian rates was relatively small compared to those in other countries. 12. The Gartner Group rated Australia among 12 advanced economies with low infrastructure risks, while the Warburg Dillon Read YZK Misery Index also gave Australia a relatively low risk rating.

C. 20431 USA Public Information Notice (PIN) No. OO/xx FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Australia On January xx, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Australia.’ Background Over the past eight years, Australia has enjoyed an extended period of economic expansion, strong productivity growth, and low inflation. Growth averaged 4% percent (compared to a 30-year average of 3% percent), underpinned by a sizable pickup in labor productivity and total factor productivity. Inflation has been held to 2 percent on average, compared to 9 percent over the previous two decades. The recovery’s durability and strength reflect improvements in the policy framework, including fiscal policy’s medium-term orientation, inflation targeting, and labor and product market reforms. Economic growth picked up to about 4% percent in the two years to September 1999. Domestic demand has been the engine of growth, given the unfavorable external environment-roughly two- fifths of Australia’s exports are destined for crisis-hit Asia and Japan. Household consumption was robust; as a result, the household saving ratio continued its trend decline while household debt rose. Fixed investment also posted strong growth in the post-crisis period-underpinned by low interest rates, strong corporate profits, and Olympics-related construction-but there was some scaling back of capital spending in the mining sector due to weak commodity prices, Net exports made a negative contribution to growth in 1998 and the first three quarters of 1999, due to the weakness of external demand and strong domestic demand that boosted imports. Reflecting strong growth and greater ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

The current account deficit widened from nearly 5 percent of GDP in 1998 to some 6 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1999. Strong domestic demand boosted imports, while a contraction in partner-country import demand and weaker commodity prices depressed exports. Australia’s net external liabilities to GDP ratio was 60 percent in end-September, one of the highest ratios among industrial countries. Financial market sentiment toward Australia has remained favorable despite the worsening external imbalance. The spread between Australian and U.S. government bond yields has fallen from 200- 300 basis points at mid-decade to about 50-60 basis points in recent months. Moreover, S&P in May 1999 upgraded Australia’s foreign currency sovereign rating from AA to AA+, citing in particular the government’s fiscal restraint and success in reducing public debt. Inflation, which was running below the RBA’s 2-3 percent medium-term objective over the two years to June 1999, picked up slightly in the September quarter to about 2 percent. A sizable pickup in labor productivity and discounting by Asian suppliers help to explain the inflation performance up to June 1999, which took place against the backdrop of an expansionary monetary policy stance. While the pickup in inflation in the September quarter reflects mainly the impact of world petroleum price increases-wage and unit labor cost increases remained moderate-an end to the contractionary external environment facing Australia led the RBA to increase the cash rate by 25 basis points on November 3, 1999. Fiscal policy has been on a consolidation path since the mid-1990s reducing public debt and the long-term interest rate differential vis-a-vis the United States. The Commonwealth’s underlying cash balance improved from deficits of 3-4 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to a surplus of % percent of GDP in 1998199 (July/June). The newly-adopted accrual measure and the structural balance show a surplus of similar magnitude. Fiscal consolidation has involved structural expenditure cuts, while cyclical factors and tax-bracket creep have boosted revenues. Commonwealth net debt has declined to 12 percent of GDP from a peak of 19 percent in 1996, facilitating a fall in Australian interest rates toward international levels. Fiscal policy has also sought to improve economic efficiency through a landmark tax reform package and more recent business tax reform proposals, The staffs near-term outlook is for a moderate slowing in growth, some pickup in inflation, and a gradual narrowing of the current account deficit. Recant retail sales data suggest ongoing strength of private consumption, and recent approvals data suggest that housing investment will also underpin growth. In contrast, some slowing of business investment from recent high levels is suggested by surveys of investment intentions. With the external environment continuing to improve, net exports are projected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth in 2000 for the first time since 1997. Inflation-excluding the first round impact of the GST-is expected to rise toward the upper end of the authorities’ 2-3 percent target range over the next 1-2 years, reflecting a pickup in unit labor costs (as productivity growth eases and the labor market tightens), an end of price discounting by Asian suppliers, and higher world oil prices. Overlaid on this will be the impact of the GST, which could add 355-4 percent to the CPI in the third quarter of next year, about double the estimated medium-term impact, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4o- ANNEX IV Executive Board Assessment <Begin Typing Here> Public lnfomation Ivoffces (PIIVS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public.
