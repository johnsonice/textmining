Unsustainable fiscal deficits since the mid-1980s resulted in loss of access to external financing and a large buildup of arrears. Bilateral debt restructuring in 1997-98 reduced external arrears by two thirds, but fiscal imbalances continue. . Real GDP growth slowed to 3.9 percent in 1998, owing in part to the damage of Hurricane Georges in September 1998, and is projected at just over 3 percent in 1999 on the basis of modest growth in tourist arrivals. Inflation is low. . The fiscal deficit, after contracting in 1998 as a result of the drop in external interest obligations and lower investment, is poised to rise again in 1999 to nearly 7 percent of GDP, owing to a sharp rise in import tax waivers, a further increase in the central government wage bill, and a deterioration in the operating result of the public utilities. Policy Discussions . The key issues are the need to strengthen the fiscal policy stance, undertake public sector reforms to foster efficiency and better governance, and normalize relations with external creditors. . A sound fiscal program would include a curb on discretionary import tax exemptions, several measures to expand direct taxation, restraint of the government wage bill, and measures to improve the profitability of the public utilities. . Priorities on the public reform agenda include better budgetary management and greater fiscal transparency, including a reversal of the recent fragmentation of government, and a renewal of the privatization effort . The external debt reschedulings in 1997-98 need to be followed up with further steps to normalize relations with external creditors; additional contacts were initiated in the second half of 1999. . The offshore sector should not be relied upon unduly as a stable source of employment and fiscal revenue. In response to international expressions of concern over changes in the legal framework for offshore banks in late 1998, parliament is preparing to make further changes to anti-money laundering legislation.

Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation were held in St. John’s during the period July 12-26, 1999.’ Meetings were held with the Acting Prime Minister; the Ministers of Finance; Planning; Utilities and Transportation; and Tourism; senior public officials; and representatives of the private sector.’ Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.3 2. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on December 3, 1997, Directors stressed the importance of safeguarding the competitiveness of the tourism sector by boosting public savings to expand public investment in infrastructure. They emphasized the need to bolster tax revenue by increasing direct taxation, curbing discretionary tax exemptions, and strengthening tax administration. Directors welcomed the progress toward reducing external payment arrears, and they recommended several steps to foster good governance. 3. The coverage and quality of economic statistics are inadequate for analysis and surveillance, the greatest shortcomings being the absence of data on merchandise imports and serious deficiencies in fiscal data. The main problems are discussed in Appendix II. II. BACKGROIJNDANDECONOMICSITUATION 4. The development strategy pursued by Antigua and Barbuda in the 198Os, which focused on the expansion of tourism through an ambitious program of public investment, led to rapid output growth accompanied by a marked deterioration in the public tinances. Inadequate public savings led to a large external public debt burden and to an accumulation of external payment arrears that by end-1996 had reached 80 percent of GDP; the resulting halt to most new foreign credits had adverse consequences for public investment, particularly in infrastructure (Table 1). 4 ’ The staffteam comprised Messrs. Lewis (Head) and Gil-Diaz, Ms. Inchauste, Messrs. Pearson and Terrones, and Mrs. McCuskey (Assistant) (all WHD). Messrs. van Beek (WHD), Bemes, and Nelmes (both OED) participated in the final round of discussions. The mission was assisted by Mrs. K. Williams of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Mr. Murphy of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). ’ The Labour government led by Prime Minister Lester Bird was returned to office for a five- year term at the March 1999 elections. ’ Relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix I 4 The external arrears result from the government’s lack of domestic resources with which to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank, and not from a limitation on the (continued. .)

Economic activity increased by nearly 6 percent a year on average in 1996-97, as tourism recovered from two hurricanes in 1995 and post-hurricane reconstruction activity was brisk (Table 2; Figures 1 and 2). Output growth slowed to 3.9 percent in 1998, owing to a decline in tourist arrivals by air that was exacerbated by Hurricane Georges, which hit in September. Earnings from tourism also were affected adversely by the reduction in room rates following the hurricanes of 1995 and 1998 as hoteliers sought to bring the tourists back; as of 1998, foreign exchange earnings from tourism had fallen to 47 percent of GDP, compared with a peak of 64 percent of GDP in 1994 (Table 3). The external current account deficit remained high in 1998 (14% percent of GDP), reflecting also the reconstruction effort in the aftermath of Hurricane Georges. 6. Antigua and Barbuda’s membership in the Eastern Caribbean currency union has provided price and exchange rate stability. 5 Central bank financing of fiscal deficits is strictly limited, and the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar for more than two decades has led to low inflation and has tended to encourage wage discipline in the private sector. 7. Broad money growth picked up to 15 percent during 1998 from 8 percent during 1997, reflecting large capital inflows, but with the further expansion of credit to the public sector, the growth of credit to the private sector slowed to around 7 percent during 1998 (Table 4). In early 1999 bank liquidity eased somewhat as money continued to rise rapidly (though less so than in the preceding year), while bank credit to both the private and public sectors expanded little. The quality of bank loan portfolios improved during 1998 and early 1999, in part reflecting stepped-up efforts by some banks to collect on overdue loans.6 7 8. A restructuring of some ofikial bilateral external debts in 1997-98 substantially reduced Antigua’s external arrears, which were brought down to 24 percent of GDP at end-1998 (Table 5). The terms on which a Japanese loan was restructured in 1997 are not known, but information on debt-service payments suggests that there may have been little, if availability or use of foreign exchange; they therefore do not evidence the existence of exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval. ’ The institutional arrangements for the currency union and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank are described in SM/99/70. 6 The share of delinquent loans was 6.5 percent at end-March 1999, compared with 10.9 percent at end-1997 and 8.4 percent at end-1998. ’ See SM/99/70, Section III for a description of the ECCB’s prudential regulations, which are consistent with international best practices.

Fiscal imbalances giving rise to the accumulation of arrears have continued. The public sector deficit more than doubled in 1997, to 8 percent of GDP, as public investment rose sharply, including long-delayed investment for the public utilities, and in 1998 the deficit fell to just under 5 percent of GDP as a result of the drop in external interest obligations on bilateral debt and lower investment (Table 6; Figure 3). The central government wage bill rose to 11.6 percent of GDP in 1998 (10.6 percent in 1997) as a result of a 6 ercent increase in government wages (awarded with retroactive effect from January 1998) PO a 33 percent wage increase for police in the second half of 1997, and increased employment. The central government continued to accumulate arrears to the medical benefits and social security schemes; at end-1998 these arrears amounted to 16 percent of GDP. 10. Growth of output is projected at just over 3 percent in 1999, based on a 3 percent increase in tourist air arrivals and continued buoyancy in the construction sector. Although bank liquidity eased somewhat in the first half of 1999, loan-to-deposit ratios remained relatively high at several banks; with somewhat slower growth of bank deposits, the growth of credit to the private sector is expected to remain unchanged in 1999. A large volume of duty exemptions granted for imports of motor vehicles in the first half of the year added to the household sector’s demand for credit, but bank credit to the business sector grew slowly. The external current account deficit is projected to rise to 18% percent of GDP in 1999, as widespread duty exemptions on motor vehicle imports in the first half of the year boosted imports. Tourist arrivals in the first half of 1999 were 3 percent higher than a year earlier, and with a modest increase in room rates over 1998, tourism earnings are expected to rise by about one-half of 1 percentage point of GDP for the year as a whole. * There are indications that the Japanese loan (about 9 percent of GDP) may have been bought by a third party. If so, the earmarked revenues for servicing this debt are being channeled to the new creditor. ’ The Italian debt of nearly US$200 million (32 percent of GDP) was reduced by 25 percent, and the restructured 30-year loan carries an interest rate of 3.25 percent. lo Accrued backpay of about 0.3 percent of GDP as of end-1998 remains to be paid Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- III. POLI~~DISCUSSIONS 11. The discussions centered on how best to pursue a growth-oriented policy strategy, given the large fiscal imbalances and the still substantial-though sharply reduced-stock of external arrears. The authorities believe that sustained growth will require attracting direct investment, in particular to the tourism sector, and they seek diversification of the economy through an expanded role for the offshore sector (including Internet gaming activity as well as offshore banking) as a source of employment and fiscal revenue. The main issues are the need for fiscal consolidation and elimination of arrears, plans for public sector reforms that would foster greater efficiency and better governance, and better regulation of the offshore sector. A. Public Finances Fiscal policy stance 12. According to staff projections, the fiscal deficit is poised to increase in 1999 to 6.8 percent of GDP. A projected drop in the current primary surplus of nearly 3 percentage points of GDP, to 2% percent of GDP, would result mainly from a sharp rise in import tax waivers, a fin-ther increase in the central government wage bill, and a deterioration in the operating result of the public utilities (APUA). The tax waivers include a large and growing discretionary component, stemming from cabinet approvals of exemptions that do not result from legislation (for the hotel sector or new industries).” The increase in the incidence of duty waivers took place in the first half of 1999 as a result of individual exemptions granted on imports of some 3,000 motor vehicles.” The increase in the wage bill derives from the full-year effect of the 1998 wage increase as well as from new hiring. 13. The 1999 budget speech announced that no new tax measures were planned, but the authorities acknowledged the need for a better revenue performance. They explained that, despite this announcement, tax measures could be considered in the budget for 2000, if needed; also, no further government wage increases were planned. They saw merit in the mission’s suggestion to concentrate fiscal adjustments and public sector reforms early in the government’s new term. The mission’s fiscal projections indicated that the current policy path would leave public savings at a level that would be insufficient to fulfill the economic objectives of the new administration, especially in view of the large outstanding government arrears. ” The value of duty waivers rose from an average of 4.5 percent of GDP in 1992-94 to 5.9 percent in 1997 (a higher average in 1995-96, 6.9 percent of GDP, resulted from waivers to facilitate imports for post-hurricane reconstruction), and rose in 1998 to over 8 percent of GDP, affected by imports for reconstruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Georges. ” The stafTprojects import tax waivers in 1999 at the equivalent of 14 percent of GDP, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- 14. The Tax Compliance Unit (TCU) has registered advances in the collection of past due tax liabilities, and the unit is expected to be transformed shortly into a Revenue Oversight Authority in the Ministry of Finance. It will have responsibility for supervising the work carried out by the Inland Revenue Department and the Customs and Excise Department on tax collection, administration, and auditing. The plan to institutionalize the technical work carried out by the TCU is timely, but there will be a challenge in the task of defining appropriate relationships between the successor oversight authority and the two main tax collection agencies that will continue to employ most of the tax administrators and auditors. 15. The authorities are now exploring options to improve the tax structure and tax yield. As part of an effort to achieve a better balance between direct and indirect taxes (the former account for only 15 percent of tax revenue), the authorities have drafted a property tax law that would shift the base from annual rental value to market value. The tax-to-GDP ratio is the lowest in the Eastern Caribbean region, notably for direct taxes, and the mission recommended a number of initiatives to improve direct taxationI taking account of the authorities’ preference not to reintroduce personal income taxation (Box 1). 16. The staff expressed concern about the pervasiveness of duty waivers and the large drain on fiscal revenues that they represent. The procedures for granting these waivers should be revised, with the eligibility criteria explicitly and narrowly defined by law. The authorities said that a June 1999 deadline had been set for granting duty waivers for motor vehicle imports, and the cost of waivers thus would be reduced sharply starting in the third quarter of 1999. 17. The mission welcomed the authorities’ interest in considering the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT), as this would make it possible to greatly simplify the tax structure and improve administrative efficiency. It pointed to the recommendations made by a Fund technical assistance mission in late 1993, which remain generally valid and could provide a useful guide for designing a VAT.r4 18. Although overstaffing is acknowledged to exist in the government and in certain public enterprises, public sector employment has continued to rise during the last two years. The mission suggested that ways need to be found to encourage a shift in employment from the public to the private sector, and that there is scope for doing so, particularly since unemployment is believed to be low.” The mission recommended that the government adopt I3 See SM/99/69, “The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union-Recent Developments and Policy Issues,” Table 16. I4 In the absence of a VAT, there would be merit in consolidating the three main tourism taxes, with a single ad valorem rate, for more efficient tax administration. “No official data are available; the 1999 budget speech cited an unofficially estimated unemployment rate of 5 percent.

Possible Measures to Increase Direct Taxation Tbc following recommendations were made by the mission in response to the authorities’ interest in increasing direct taxation, given the lack of a consensus for reintroducing a personal income tax. l Consolidate the medical benefits levy and the education levy into a single “social services levy” with a progressive element. Its design should be compatible with the social security levy- including the same earnings base-so as to facilitate efficient tax administration. l Modify the draft property tax law being readied for submission to parliament. The staff agreed that the planned shift in base from annual rental value to market value should help extend the property tax to properties not currently registered. However, it would be preferable to eliminate from the draft law (i) the broad discretionary powers given to the minister of finance to grant exemptions from property tax (any exemptions that arc to be given should be specified in the law), and (ii) tbe proposed exemption of EC$200,000 on buildings. . lntroducc a property tax on motor vehicles (at a higher rate than for real estate), particularly in light of the extensive granting of duty exemptions for motor vebiclc imports during the first half of 1999. . Restore the license requirement for professional services. The 1997 court ruling that the business license is unconstitutional has been appealed, but at present the outcome is uncertain. It had offered the prospect of broadening the scope of direct taxation and establishing a more complete register of taxpayers, enhancing prospects for collection of tbe business tax. Priority should be given to an alternative, legally acceptable, formulation of this license requirement, since on equity grounds the providers of professional services should contribute more to the tax effort in Antigua. targets for government employment for the next few years that entail a gradual but steady decline. 19. There also is a need to revamp the system for the hiring and promotion of government workers which at present differs as between established and nonestablished workers. The nonestablished workers, who now account for more than half of government employees, are selected without the screening for technical qualifications through a competitive application process which has been set up for established workers. Public sector reforms 20. In recent years, but particularly since mid-1998, there has been a fragmentation of government institutions resulting from a proliferation of agencies with off-budget operations; their expenditures-while still relatively small-are funded by earmarked Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- revenues that previously accrued to the treasury.16 The mission recommended strongly that this fragmentation be reversed, as it tends to reduce the accountability of expenditure decisions for which parliament is responsible. Tax collection and administration are more difftcult to carry out effectively; expenditure decisions are not easily subjected to appropriate controls and principles of accountability; and the creation of new government agencies with a secure income stream gives rise to a tendency for bureaucracy to grow beyond what is needed to carry out essential functions. 21. A number of other public sector reforms are also needed to bring financial management in line with principles of good governance in the public sector’s financial operations. The authorities explained that they were planning several initiatives in this regard, namely, the computerization of treasury accounting, updating of fiscal audits, introduction of program budgeting, and reform of government pensions aimed at the establishment of a partially funded scheme; at present, these are based on a pay-as-you-go, noncontributory system. The mission noted that the planned reforms would be useful, and offered a number of recommendations to make them more effective (Box 2). B. Externnl Sector Policies 22. The debt restructuring in 1997-98, mentioned previously, brought the government closer to normalizing relations with external creditors, a long-standing Fund recommendation. The next steps would be to strengthen contacts with other external creditors and to reach understandings on actions needed to complete the normalization of relations with them. The authorities explained that this process was underway; talks are being held with at least one other large creditor. Following the 1998 hurricane, it was agreed to postpone debt service payments under the restructured Italian debt until November 1999. The mission stressed the importance of making timely plans for ensuring that the November payment, amounting to close to LJS$12 million, is made as scheduled. The limited information provided to the staff by the authorities on the terms of the Japanese debt rescheduling highlights a need for greater transparency about the terms of major loan contracts, which would be essential for an adequate assessment of the external debt situation. 23. The authorities expressed their satisfaction with the price and exchange rate stability induced by Antigua and Barbuda’s membership in the Eastern Caribbean currency union. Information on the external competitiveness of tourism presents a mixed picture. The movement of prices in Antigua relative to other Caribbean tourist destinations would suggest an improvement in competitiveness in 1998 and early 1999 compared with the pre-hurricane I6 These include the Board of Education, the National Solid Waste Management Authority, the Transport Board, the International Financial Sector Authority, and the Free Trade Zone Commission. A Tourism Marketing Fund, funded in part by the hotel guest levy, is expected to be launched later this year. The earmarked revenues currently account for 8.5 percent of total tax revenue and central government nontax current revenue (3.4 percent in 1997).

Possible Public Sector Reforms for Greater Efficiency and Good Governance tn response to the authorities’ interest in reforms that would foster a more &Sent, more. modem public sector, the mission offered the following recommendations. Those related to updated fiscal audits and the computerization of treasury accounting procedures were on the. authorities’ initial list of planned reforms. * Announce the government’s intention to honor all of its payment obligations. This commitment to greater fiscal responsibility would imply an intention to complete the normalization of relations with external creditors; clarify the extent of arrears to, and claims on, other public sector entities; reach agreement on a plan for clearing the government’s net arrears; and stay current on payment obligations in the future. l Revise and modernize the financial regulations, which have changed little since 1962, including an updating of budget management and procurement procedures. It might be feasible to draw on the experience of other countries in the region that have undertaken recent reforms in this area. l Monitor the fiscal operations of the entire nontinancial public sector. Finance ministry officials would need a clear mandate to require financial reports from statutory bodies. Restricting the monitoring to central government finances (which is done on a cash basis) is even more limiting than before, in view of the trend toward fragmentation of government agencies. l Take steps to make the budget a more realistic planning document: (i) curb the use of advance and special warrants to effect expenditures not authorized by parliament; and (ii) once the annual budget estimates are. approved by parliament, limit quarterly expenditure by spending umts. l Base public investment program on well-detined objectives and project-selection criteria, framed within a multiyear planning context, and with adequate provision for the associated recurrent costs. l To improve governance, transparency and accountability, pass all revenue, expenditure, and financing transactions through the treasury accounts, and include them in the treasury’s budgetary data l Reconcile revenue and expenditure data with financing data, not only for the central government (treasury operations), but also for the entire public sector. m Computerize accounting and bill payment systems of the treasury l Expedite the auditing of government accounts (the last completed audit is for 1988).

The authorities noted that ensuring an adequate degree of competitiveness for the Antiguan tourism industry depended also on nonprice elements of competition, which they would address through the Tourism Marketing Fund that is expected to start operations in the second half of 1999 (funded jointly by the industry and by the government through earmarked revenue from the hotel guest levy). 24. The government plans to implement the final phase of the CARICOM common external tariff (CET) as of January 2000, reducing the maximum customs tariff from 35 percent to 20 percent.” Particularly in view of past postponements, the mission called attention to the need for timely preparations for this step, including plans for adjustments to consumption duties needed to achieve a neutral net impact on tax revenue.” Other trade policy actions recommended by the mission were (i) elimination of the remaining monopoly held by a state marketing corporation for the importation of selected agricultural products;19 and (ii) the elimination of the customs service charge. C. Financial System and Offshore Sector 25. The authorities are seeking to diversify the economy by promoting the growth of the offshore sector, although at present offshore activities generate only modest amounts of employment and fiscal revenue. Amendments were introduced in 1998 to the law on offshore institutions (IBC Act) and the money-laundering prevention act, and finther changes are under consideration in response to international expressions of concern about the adequacy of legislation for combating money laundering (Appendix III). The government, as member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, participated in an evaluation in July 1999 of its anti-money laundering efforts. The authorities noted their agreement with the report’s conclusions-which relate to the need for stronger regulatory mechanisms, training, and better interagency cooperation-and said they would be taking steps to implement the recommendations (see Appendix III). 26. The offshore financial sector appears to have little direct impact on the domestic economy. 2o Indirect negative effects could be significant, however, if perceptions of ” The first phase lowered the maximum tariff from 40 percent to 35 percent in 1995; an intermediate step to phase in the CET was postponed following the 1995 hurricanes. I8 The task is complicated by the absence of import data. I9 Sugar, rice, and five vegetable products that are produced domestically 2o Employment, mainly in the Internet gaming industry, amounts to less than 2 percent of the workforce (some 420 employees); government revenue from offshore registrations and (continued.. .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - governance problems in this sector were to spill over to the domestic economy, adversely affecting the investment climate or raising concerns about the domestic banking system. Accordingly, the staff welcomed the priority that the authorities are placing on strengthening the legal framework; it noted that the effective enforcement of the anti-money laundering legislation would continue to be a challenge for the government, and cautioned against overestimating the beneficial impact of promoting the offshore sector. 27. The amended IBC Act permits offshore bank lending to the Antiguan Government, a provision that may create a conflict of interest in view of the government’s role in regulating the offshore sector, and the mission recommended that the prohibition of such lending be restored. D. Medium-Term Outlook 28. The staff prepared medium-term projections under two alternative policy scenarios for the period to 2004 (Tables 8 and 9). The baseline scenario, assuming a continuation of current policies, suggests that public savings would continue to weaken over the next several years, and that the financing constraints would result in a decline in public investment. Lacking the resources for meeting debt service obligations, the public sector would again accumulate external arrears on a large scale, and central government arrears to the rest of the public sector would continue to mount. The economy would be characterized by low growth (falling below 2 percent by the end of the projection period), declining public investment, and a worsening of the climate for private investment, especially in the tourism sector. 29. The adjustment scenario, choosing a path that brings the economy back to external and fiscal viability, aims at the eventual elimination of external arrears and enables public investment to be maintained at 6 percent of GDP. The current primary balance would rise from 2.6 percent of GDP in 1999 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2004, compared with a decline under the baseline scenario. Over the medium term, a better climate for private investment in the hotel sector and other important sectors of the economy, along with continued improvement in the economic infrastructure, would provide a sound basis for a more rapid growth of tourism and real GDP. 30. According to the mission’s calculations, more than half of the required fiscal adjustment (as indicated by changes in the current primary balance) would result from (i) the assumed reduction in exemptions of import taxes (raising revenue by more than 3 percentage points of GDP), and (ii) the reduction in the government wage bill relative to GDP that would result from freezing employment levels and limiting wage increases approximately to projected inflation. It is noteworthy that substantial fiscal adjustments can be made without requiring large-scale reductions in public sector employment. license fees in 1998 amounted to 0.3 percent of GDP, more than half of it stemming from registrations of nonfinancial companies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - 31. The adjustment scenario does not assume external debt write-offs (as were realized in the case of the Italian debts). The pace of external arrears elimination would be speeded up to the extent that the authorities succeeded in concluding further debt rescheduling agreements, or to the extent that proceeds from public sector asset sales (in particular the Royal Antiguan Hotel) were applied to such obligations in arrears, E. Other Issues 32. There has been little recent progress with privatization. The sale of a hotel in St. John’s and other nearby properties, which previously had been planned for 1996, has been put on hold. Instead, in an ongoing public investment project, two floors of a vendors mall now under construction near that hotel are to be devoted to additional hotel rooms under joint management. The mission recommended that the public sector undertake to exit from the hotel business by adopting a plan for divesting itself of this hotel property, and stepping up efforts to find a buyer for the large state-owned hotel. 33. The mission also argued for the privatization of the public utilities (ANA), starting with the telephone services. The government has not reached a decision on this step, but the authorities explained that APUA employment would be reduced by some 10 percent this year. The mission supported the plan to reduce overstaRing, and suggested that additional steps be taken to improve the operating result of APUA, including an increase in water and electricity tariffs (the latter have not been adjusted since 1988); greater bill collection efforts; and reductions in overstaffing beyond those already planned. Setting aside the proceeds from divestiture to reduce external debt would help advance the strategy for progressively eliminating the remaining external arrears. 34. The coverage and quality of economic statistics remain weak. A major obstacle to economic analysis is the absence of customs data on imports, which have not been produced since 1989, although the implementation of the computerized system (ASYCUDA) of customs import data, has been in the developmental stage at least since 1995. A recently completed household income and expenditure survey could be used for revising the aggregate expenditure estimates in the national accounts and the consumer price index; the authorities explained that they intend to improve the quality of these and other economic data produced by the Statistics Division. Important deficiencies in fiscal data impede the adequate monitoring of public sector accounts in a number of ways: complete financing data that can be reconciled with revenue and expenditure data are not available; large intrapublic sector arrears are not well quantified; and there is no systematic monitoring of the statutory bodies’ finances, which would be needed to measure overall public sector operations. A number of the recommended changes in the area of public sector management discussed above are aimed at addressing these shortcomings. There also is a lack of data pertaining to the external competitiveness of Antiguan tourism. 35. Progress has been made in raising public awareness of the problem of converting information systems to the year 2000 (YZK). The mission encouraged the authorities to continue the diagnosis and testing aimed at ensuring YZK compliance before the end of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-IS- 1999, as well as to develop contingency plans in the event that full compliance is not achieved in all areas by year’s end. 36. The authorities indicated a preference to remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle at least for the time being, while they prepare to undertake adjustment measures. Iv. STAFF .kPPRAISAL. 37. Unsustainable deficits since the mid-1980s resulted in a large buildup of external arrears and loss of access to external financing. A restructuring of Antigua’s largest bilateral debts in 1997-98, entailing a major reduction in external arrears, has presented the government with its best opportunity in many years to put the economy on a path leading back to fiscal and external viability. 38. The reduction in external arrears has not been accompanied by a correction of the underlying fiscal imbalances that require financing through arrears accumulation. Yet this is the key challenge. It is clear that the authorities need to adopt a comprehensive macroeconomic program with targets for an improvement in the public tinances over the next several years that would give the prospect of achieving the government’s objectives for sustained, higher growth. Staff projections for 1999 and beyond indicate that the current course of fiscal policy is unsustainable and will, if continued, further reduce public saving, lead to a renewed buildup of external arrears and a diminished level and quality of public investment, and worsen the prospects for growth. 39. Several measures should be taken to strengthen the fiscal position and implement a number of public sector reforms. A first major step would be a sharp curtailment of the waivers of import taxes, with the eligibility criteria explicitly and narrowly defined by law. Even in the absence of reintroducing a personal income tax, steps can be taken to achieve a better balance in the tax structure through greater reliance on direct taxation, including the implementation of a revised property tax law, extension of property taxation to motor vehicles, and consolidation of existing levies into a social services levy. It would also be desirable for the authorities to move forward in their consideration of a possible VAT, which would enhance the efficiency of tax administration through a simpler indirect tax structure. 40. The freezing of central government wages, which the authorities intend to maintain for the next two years, would clearly be an important step. But efforts to constrain the wage bill also need to address overstaffing, the significance of which is widely acknowledged. To enhance the prospects for dealing with this problem, it would be highly desirable that the authorities adopt targets for gradual reductions in government employment over the coming years. 41. In pursuing public sector reforms, the authorities should aim at better budgetary management and expenditure control, improvements to public investment programming, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- a reversal of the recent fragmentation of government institutions through the creation of off- budget agencies funded by earmarked revenues. Efficiency considerations call for the pace of privatization to be accelerated. The public sector should exit from the hotel business, and there is a strong case for the privatization of the public utilities (APUA), starting with the telephone services. Meanwhile, the plan to reduce staffring at the APUA by 10 percent this year is a step in the right direction, but additional actions are needed to improve operating results, including an adjustment of water and electricity tariffs, greater bill collection efforts, and further staff reductions. 42. To follow up on the success with the Japanese and Italian debt restructuring, the authorities should renew contacts with other external creditors and reach understandings on actions needed to complete the normalization of relations, a process that the staffunderstands is under way. The lack of transparency in recent rescheduling agreements is disappointing. 43. The authorities should avoid relying unduly on the offshore sector as a growing source of employment and fiscal revenue. Amendments to money-laundering legislation in late 1998 led to international expressions of concern about supervision of offshore banks, including the ability to prevent and prosecute instances of money laundering. The staff supports the authorities’ intention to seek those adjustments to this legislation which are consistent with international best practices, while also maintaining consistency with the Antiguan constitution. An amendment introduced in 1998 to the law on offshore institutions (IBC Act) permits offshore bank lending to the Antiguan Government, a provision that may create a conflict of interest in view of the government’s role in regulating the offshore sector The prohibition of such lending should be restored. 44. Antigua and Barbuda’s participation in the Eastern Caribbean currency union has served it well for price and exchange rate stability and has encouraged regional economic cooperation. The authorities should move expeditiously with their plans to implement the final phase of the CARICOM common external tariff in January 2000, which has been postponed from early 1998. Removal of the customs service charge would also be desirable, as would the elimination of the state monopoly on the importation of rice, sugar, and certain other agricultural products. These actions would signal a welcome reaffirmation of Antigua’s continued commitment to regional trade agreements and regional integration. 45. The deficient coverage and quality of economic statistics do not give the authorities an adequate basis to evaluate economic developments and formulate appropriate policies, and make it difficult to provide to the Fund the data needed for surveillance. The compilation of import data and the upgrading of fiscal statistics should be given high priority. 46. The challenges of good governance touch on several areas already mentioned, and the staffwould encourage the authorities to see, and act upon, many of the recommendations as part of an integrated approach to enhancing governance. They include greater transparency in external debt management, a better legal framework for the prevention of money laundering through offshore banks, reversal of the fragmentation of government that has entailed a loss of control over expenditure, other public sector reforms aimed at better budgetary procedures Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- and control, more adequate economic data for surveillance and policy formulation, a curb on the extensive granting of discretionary tax exemptions, and a commitment to honoring all of the government’s payment obligations (including to the social security and medical benefits schemes). 47. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The ministry of planning has assumed responsibility for the statistics division and has requested technical assistance from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) to improve statistical data on trade, national income accounts, and labor markets. The plan is to acquire the capability to produce quarterly statistical information. Despite these plans, little progress has been made since the last Article IV consultation, apart from the recent completion of an income and expenditure survey. Real sector Annual GDP estimates by sector are produced by the ministry of planning and reviewed by an expert from the ECCB. The ministry also prepares estimates of the expenditure components of GDP. The sector estimates-based on surveys with low response rates, audited financial statements, and other available indicators-are reported with a significant lag. No quarterly indicators of economic activity are produced. The income and expenditure survey just mentioned was completed by the ministry of planning with technical assistance from the ECCB. It is expected that data from the survey will be used to revise the consumer price index and to develop estimates of household expenditure for the national accounts. The unofficial consumer price index that has been calculated during the last few years has been volatile and unreliable. There is little coverage of labor market developments, as no official data for wages or unemployment are available. The lack of reliable wage and price data hinders the analysis of the external competitiveness of Ant&an tourism. Financial sector Monetary survey data are compiled by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) on a monthly basis. The quality of these data, which are regularly reported to the Fund, is generally adequate. The coverage of financial sector operations should be extended to encompass nonbank deposit-taking institutions, No data on offshore banking operations are available. Fiscal sector No fiscal data are reported to STA for publication by the Fund. The authorities compile quarterly data on central government revenue and expenditure, and partial annual data on the financing of the central government deficit. Consolidated public sector accounts are not compiled, and have become increasingly difficult to trace with the growing fragmentation of the public sector and the greater number of earmarked taxes that were once part of central government revenue. The public enterprises, the social security and medical benefits schemes, the Education Board, International Financial Sector Authority, and Solid Waste Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX II Management Program produce annual financial statements that are subject to long lags and are not monitored adequately by the ministry of finance. High priority needs to be given to more timely reporting of central government revenues and expenditures on both a cash and accrual basis; the reconciliation of the above and below-the line accounts of the central government; the compilation of consolidated public sector accounts; and the compilation and reconciliation of intra-public sector arrears. External sector The most serious problem is the lack of merchandise import data. External data prepared by the statistics division (SD) are compiled manually and subject to long lags (the most recent annual trade report is for 1989). The SD is planning to shift to the ASYCUDA/ EUROTRACE computerized system of import data currently used in all other Eastern Caribbean countries. Plans for compiling these data have been in a developmental stage since 1995. The SD compiles balance of payments data on an annual basis, with assistance from the ECCB. The ministry of finance uses a debt reporting system to produce data on cash external debt transactions and calculations of arrears for the country’s external debt obligations, However, finance ministry officials do not have complete access to loan documentation (for example, the terms of the 1997 debt rescheduling agreement with W-Japan are not available). The outstanding stock of debt as reported by the ministry of finance tends to differ from that reported by creditors, largely because of the incomplete loan information that officials have, including on interest penalties on arrears.

The Money-Laundering Prevention Act of 1996 (MLPA), which came into effect in May 1998, was aimed at preventing and combating money laundering through offshore financial institutions. Modeled after British Commonwealth legislation, it reflected Antigua’s international commitments, including those stemming from its membership in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF).’ 2. The two main laws governing offshore financial institutions were amended in November 1998, as Antigua and Barbuda sought to adapt its legal framework to the growing offshore banking activity. Modifications to the lBC Act, under which offshore institutions are registered in Antigua and Barbuda: l created the International Financial Sector Authority (TFSA), with responsibility for licensing offshore financial institutions; l provide for annual inspections of offshore financial institutions; l raised minimum capital requirements for offshore banks (to USS.5 million, of which US$1.5 million is to be deposited in the domestic banking system); l require all bank directors to be natural persons (making bank ownership more transparent), of whom at least one must be Antiguan; and l permit offshore banks to extend credit to the Antiguan government 3. All but the last of these amendments aim to strengthen the oversight and operation of offshore banks. Opening the possibility of offshore bank lending to the government may create a conflict of interest in view of the government’s role of regulating and supervising offshore banks. 4. Amendments to the money-laundering prevention act were approved in late 1998 that were perceived as having the effect of heightening bank secrecy, restricting supervisory activities, and narrowing the scope for sharing information with international agencies involved in efforts to counter money laundering. International expressions of concern about the MLPA amendments were reflected in bank advisories for U.S. and U.K. banks doing business in Antigua. In response to these concerns, further amendments were approved in the ’ The 1996 law complied with the 40 recommendations of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the complementary 19 recommendations of the CFATF that provide a framework for anti-money laundering efforts. See W/97/266, Appendix I, for a further description of the 1996 law.

Prior to final passage by the senate, the authorities intend to consult further with international experts as regards best practice for anti-money laundering legislation. A difftculty with the 1996 law was the presumption that offtcers of an offshore bank found guilty of a money-laundering offense would be deemed culpable unless they presented evidence of having no knowledge or involvement (termed a reversal of the burden of proof). This feature needed to be reconciled with the Antiguan constitution, which presumes innocence until guilt is proven. It is anticipated that final approval of revised anti-money laundering legislation will take place before year’s end. 6. As part of its obligations as member of the CFATF, Antigua participated in a “mutual evaluation” in July 1999 of its practices with respect to anti-money laundering efforts. The draft report presented to the Antiguan authorities in February 1999 was discussed at a CFATF meeting in July. The authorities concurred with the conclusions and recommendations, which included the following: l Stronger regulatory mechanisms are needed. This may reflect the fact that neither the ONDCP (Offtce of National Drug Control and Money Laundering Policy), which enforces the MLPA, nor the IFSA is well-equipped for the requisite regulatory functions. The IFSA registers and licenses financial institutions, and will make inspections on the basis of the required annual reports specified in the amended IBC Act; the ONDCP responds to offshore banks’ reports of suspicious activity, but does not have a preventive, supervisory role.) l Greater cooperation among the agencies concerned with money-laundering prevention is needed, including the ONDCP, the coast guard, and police. l Better training is needed for the detection and prosecution of financial crimes. The authorities may draw on technical assistance resources that are available for this purpose.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Antigua and Barbuda On [date], 1999 the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.’ Background Economic growth slowed sharply in the first half of the 1990s (from an average of 8 percent in 1984-89 to 2 percent in 1990-95) as the rapid expansion of tourism based on large public investment projects in the 1980s could not be sustained. The accumulation of large fiscal deficits since the mid-l 980s led to external payments arrears, which in turn curtailed foreign capital inflows. In 1996-97, real GDP grew by close to 6 percent on average, as tourism recovered from two hurricanes in 1995 and post-hurricane reconstruction activity was brisk. However, real GDP growth slowed to 3.9 percent in 1998, owing to a decline in tourist arrivals that was exacerbated by Hurricane Georges, and is projected to slow further to 3.2 percent in 1999. In 1998, the fiscal deficit fell to just under 5 percent of GDP (from 8 percent of GDP in 1997) as a result of a drop in external interest obligations following a rescheduling of external debt, and lower public investment. The central government wage bill rose to 11.6 percent of GDP (10.6 percent in 1997) as a result of a 6 percent increase in government wages and higher employment. The fiscal deficit has widened in 1999 and is projected to reach almost 7 percent of GDP under the impact of a sharp rise in import tax waivers, in particular on individuals’ ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Boards discussion are described.

The increase in the wage bill derives mainly from new hiring. The deficit continues to be financed by an accumulation of arrears. The external current account deficit has remained high since 1996 (exceeding 14 percent of GDP), as tourism has recovered only partially from the hurricanes of 1995 and 1998. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism fell to 47 percent of GDP in 1998, compared with a peak of 64 percent of GDP in 1994, in part because of reductions in room rates following the hurricanes, as hoteliers sought to bring the tourists back. The large current account deficits also reflected higher imports associated with the post-humcane reconstruction effort. In 1999, the deficit is projected to rise further to 18.6 percent of GDP as a result of the large increase in motor vehicle imports. The government’s bilateral approach to the external arrears problem advanced with a restructuring of the public sector’s largest external loans in 1997-98. As a result, external arrears were reduced from the equivalent of 80 percent of GDP at end-1996 to 24 percent of GDP at end-l 998. In the second half of 1999, contacts with other external creditors were renewed with a view toward further restructuring of debts. Broad money growth picked up to 15 percent during 1998, reflecting large capital inflows but, with the continued expansion of credit to the public sector, the growth of credit to the private sector slowed to around 7 percent during the year, In early 1999 bank liquidity eased somewhat as money continued to rise rapidly, while bank credit to both the private and public sectors expanded little. The quality of bank loan portfolios improved during 1998 and early 1999, in part reflecting stepped-up efforts by some banks to collect on overdue loans. Bank interest rates have been stable over the last two years. Executive Board Assessment Public hformation Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) a! the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
