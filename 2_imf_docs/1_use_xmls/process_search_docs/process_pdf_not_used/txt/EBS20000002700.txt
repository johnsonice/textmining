Russell Kincaid February 17,2OOO l The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions were conducted in Sarajevo, Banja Luka, and Pale during August 10-27 and October 5-l&1999 by a staff team consisting of Juan J. Fem&rdez- Ansola, Philippe Marciniak, Dawn Rehm, Kori UdoviZki (all EUl), Jun Ma (FAD), and Bhaswar Mukhopadhyay (PDR). Bruno de Schaetzen (resident representative) and Berina Selimovic (local advisor) assisted the mission. Meetings were held with the Council of Ministers, the Governor of the central bank, Prime Ministers, Ministers of Finance, and other key officials. The Article IV discussions were combined with discussions to complete the second and third reviews under the stand-by arrangement approved in 1998 and preliminary discussions on a program that could be supported by an arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). l In concluding the 1998 Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Directors welcomed the progress made in establishing the common ktitutions of the country, and urged the authorities to implement fully the fiscal adjustment and the structural reform agenda. Directors indicated that a track record of policy implementation, including timely external debt service payments, and a broadening of the reform effort were needed as preconditions for the approval of an ESAF supported arrangement. . The Executive Board approved Bosnia’s stand-by arrangement on May 29, 1998, in an amount equivalent to SDR 60.6 million (36 percent of new quota), and on May 28,1999 the arrangement was extended through end-April 2000 and augmented by SDR 16.9 million (10 percent of quota) in response to the Kosovo conflict (Appendix I and Table I).’ The World Bank has provided substantial f&ncial support to Bosnia, most recently through the approval on June 1,1999 of a second Public Finance Structural Adjustment Credit and an Enterprise and Bank Privatization Credit (Appendix II). ‘Kosovo is a province of neighboring Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). A NATO bombing campaign during March 24 to June 10, 1999 caused severe damage to economic ii&structure in FRY, including bridges over the Danube River. There was a large temporary exodus of refugees from Kosovo, of which 25,000 to 30,000 went to Bosnia. These refugees have largely returned to their homes in FRY.

BACKGROUND AND MAJN ‘IMEMES 1. Bosnia is making progress in rebuilding its economy following the destruction during the 1992-95 war, although performance has been undermined by inter-ethnic rivalries, weak governance, and the fallout from the recent conflict in Kosovo. Real GDP growth in 1998-99 has fallen short of expectations under the stand-by arrangement and the pace of structural reform has been disappointing in many respects. After a promising start, progress in developing Bosnia’s basic economic institutions has been slow, and, despite the . substantial contribution of the international community to the reconstruction effort (Box 1); the country’s infrastructure remains weak. Territorial divisions along ethnic lines continue to hamper integrated policy implementation, particularly economic reforms (Box 2 shows Bosnia’s governmental structure). Nevertheless, the authorities have managed to reduce macroeconomic imbalances, and the credibility of the currency board arrangement and acceptance of the Convertible Marka (KM) have increased considerably. Policy implementation has also improved in the period following the September 1998 country-wide elections and the Kosovo conflict, and economic reforms have progressed. The authorities are also taking measures to redress slippage from the stand-by arrangement supported program’s targets (Text Table 1). Box 1.

Against this background, and mindful of Executive Directors’ recommendation that the authorities should build a track record of policy implementation before discussing an ESAF arrangement, the mission noted that Bosnia’s economic situation was still fragile and that the country remained heavily dependent on external financial assistance. Accordingly, the discussions addressed the need to: 0 Avoid slippages in policy implementation that would threaten disbursements of external assistance and set back a shift to a longer term arrangement. a Make rapid progress toward fiscal sustainability. 0 Undertake structural reform needed to create the conditions conducive to the development of private sector activities. a Improve governance to underpin the economic recovery. a Improve the quality and availability of statistics (Box 3). Box 3. Quality and Availability of Statistical Information The Fund, the World Bank, and donors have provided extensive technical assistance to the authorities to improve the quality of statistics. However, while the authorities have made some progress in developing a country-wide statistical database, and are reporting data on a timely basis for program monitoring, there is an urgent need for improvements aimed at producing more accurate data. In particular, the coverage of government finance statistics has to be broadened, monetary statistics have to be compiled so as to ensure that they are comparable over time, the compilation of balance of payments statistics has to be initiated, and National Accounts data in constant prices and by expenditure component need to be developed (Appendix III). 3. II. POLICY PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 1998-99 Following progress in the immediate post-war period (199697) in establishing the essential institutions of the country and in rebuilding the basic infrastructure of the economy, the authorities embarked in May 1998 on an ambitious economic reform program, supported under the stand-by arrangement. The priorities are to create a unified economic space and a fi.mctioning banking system, privatize and restructure enterprises, reform the labor market, reshape the pension and health systems, implement a simplified customs system, and liberalize the trade regime. Reform is being backed by ongoing macroeconomic stabilization, which has already succeeded in bringing country-wide Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- inflation to single digits,’ through acceptance of the currency board arrangement supported by fiscal consolidation. With the proper implementation of such policies, the program envisaged that output growth would be 20-30 percent a year in 1998-99. Nonetheless, this would still have left real GDP per capita more than 60 percent below its pre-war level. 4. Serious governance problems have hindered economic reform, and ethnic divisions have made it difficult to achieve the political consensus required for policy implementation. Political difficulties, primarily related to the polarization of society along. ethnic lines, delayed the preparation of budgets and agreement on a macroeconomic framework for 1999. Meanwhile, the implementation of the structural reform agenda for 1998 barely got off the ground. In addition, there have been allegations of project funds being diverted by local authorities, irregular financial operations in the former central bank, and tax and duty evasion by organized criminal groups. The authorities have begun to address governance issues, but thus far limited efforts have been made to prosecute the key suspects.’ 5. The lags in fundamental reforms include the privatixation of banks and enterprises and the harmonixation of excise taxes between the two Entities. While key laws and regulations on banking and privatization were adopted, and important steps were taken to strengthen bank supervision, the liquidation of insolvent banks has yet to begin in either Entity. After a very long delay a comprehensive voucher privatization program began in both Entities in July 1999, but progress has been slow and the voucher program risks being derailed by its incomplete legislative underpinnings. Ethnic groups connected to political par-tie-hich have vested interests in large and medium-sized state enterprises-have been obstructing the privatization of enterprises located in their areas of influence. In addition, the delay has opened the way for spontaneous privatization in the Federation and consequent legal disputes3 The Entities agreed on a list of harmonized excise taxes on June 8, 1999, but it took more than eight months to fully implement the agreement. 6. Progress in some other structural reforms has been better, with the most impressive strides being made in the operationalixation of State institutions. ‘There is no country-wide price index in Bosnia yet (Table 4). Prices in the Republika Srpska have been denominated in KM since June 1998. Convergence in price levels across the two Entities is taking place. 2The efforts to strengthen governance have been led by the EU’s Customs and Fiscal Advisory Office (CAFAO) in tandem with the anti-fraud unit within the Office of the High Representative (OHR). ‘In a number of recent cases some assets or entire companies have been formally sold to a group, usually to a coalition of workers and managers, outside the privatization flamework. For instance, a bank in the RS extended loans on very favorable terms to its employees to facilitate their purchase of the bank’s shares. These loans were extended before the relevant legislation preventing such transactions was enacted. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicl l l 7. -9- By far, the most successful achievements have been the consolidation of the central bank and the introduction of the new currency. In this regard, the rapid acceptance of the KM throughout the country is a testament to the sound implementation of the currency board (Figure 1). An automatic transfer mechanism to cover the country’s debt service and the State’s administrative costs replaced the previous system of ad hoc transfers from Entities to the State. The implementation of a common, country-wide customs tariff regime in May 1999 signaled important progress in inter-Entity cooperation, In parallel, barriers to the internal movement of goods and people have also been eliminated. State authorities have initiated the process of Bosnia’s accession into the WTO. In the RS the internal payments law was amended in July, and in the Federation in September 1999; and in both Entities, a number of commercial banks were licensed recently to conduct payments transactions on behalf of their customers-all key measures for the reform of the payments system. On February 9,200O the Council of Ministers approved amendments to the State Customs Policy Law to eliminate most customs exemptions. Although macroeconomic policy implementation in 1998-99 suffered some setbacks, on balance progress has been positive (Figure 2). Revenue shortfalls and delays in external assistance exposed the fragile fiscal framework during 1998 and forced both Entities to slash their expenditures (Tables 5-8). Revenue performance in both Entities improved, more noticeably in the RS, beginning in mid-1999, and both Entities implemented revised budgets which allowed for a step-up in the pace of transfers to the State.4 In the Federation, military expenditure and transfers to war invalids were cut substantially, to keep total expenditure in line with lower-than-budgeted domestic revenue for the year as a whole. The estimated deficits (before grants) for the Federation is about 1.3 percent of GDP while the projected deficit for the RS would amount to about 3.5 percent of GDP and were financed exclusively by foreign grants and concessional loans5 The maintenance of fiscal discipline and close cooperation between the central bank and Entity authorities facilitated not only the introduction of new KM banknotes in June-July 1998, but also their sharply increased acceptance during 1999. Reflecting this acceptance, international reserves reached 4 The main financing source of the State Budget is transfers from the Entities, which are made monthly (see Box 2). During 1999, Entities transferred lower amounts than contemplated under the State Budget. ‘After grants, the deficit-to-GDP ratios in 1999 are estimated at 1.5 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.

Macroeconomic developments in 1999 were affected by KOSOVO, but, in retrospect, Bosnia appears to have weathered the Kosovo conflict quite well. The conflict has had a substantial adverse impact on economic activity, mainly through the disruption of trade and a decline in investment. Notably, the loss of previously well- established markets and business relationships has imposed significant costs on the economy. Some transportation routes will remain unusable for the period ahead. The disruption to important trade relationships also affected Entity budgets, largely through a reduction in customs revenues. This problem was exacerbated by the temporary cost of the refugee influx, Nevertheless, there have been promising signs of recovery of production and trade- especially in the Federation- and real GDP growth is estimated at 10 percent in 1999, following growth of 13 percent in 1998. Inflation, meanwhile, has continued to decline. 9. The authorities are correcting slippages from program targets. All quantitative program performance criteria were met as of end-September 1999, with the exception of those relating to the clearance of external arrears and extension of credit to the general government. The external arrears to the relevant parties were cleared in late July and late October 1999, respectively.6 Entity authorities have also implemented measures to correct the nonobservance of the performance criterion on government borrowing and to prevent similar nonobservance in the future.’ 10. Bosnia will remain reliant on generous donor assistance to finance its reform effort and complete the reconstruction of the country. Gross external financing in 1999 is estimated to have amounted to USS2.3 billion (counting inflows of private capital and rescheduling). This amount included disbursements of project support under the reconstruction program (US%737 million), as well as adjustment lending of US%65 million, official transfers of some US%180 million, and Fund purchases of some US%40 million (Table 10). Non-government arrears of some US%806 million were rolled over pending rescheduling negotiations. An extension of the consolidation period--to end-April 2OOO-of the 1998 Paris Club rescheduling agreement helped meet the financing needs of BiH. In addition, large inflows of private capital (about US$487 million) have been associated with the sharp increase in acceptance of the KM. The gross external financing needs for 2000 are 6These arrears were to the Council of Europe Social Development Fund (CESDF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), respectively. Negotiations with the CESDF, which had started earlier in 1999, were completed only in July. As regards the EIB, delays in donor disbursements hindered the authorities’ efforts to clear the arrears in a timely manner. ‘The end-September performance criterion on credit to the general government was breached by domestic borrowing of extrabudgetary funds and lower levels of government. Both Entities have introduced measures to better control the borrowing of institutions responsible for the breach.

After four years of intensive reconstruction supported by unprecedented external aid, Bosnia still faces immense challenges to achieve sustainable development: 0 Unemployment remains at about 40 percent of the labor force. The lack of - employment opportunities reflects slow private sector development, discrimination based on ethnicity, and an inappropriate legal framework for the labor market. l Structural deficiencies affect most areas of the economy. The financial system is still dominated by outmoded payments bureaus, inherited from the Yugoslav era, and Bosnia does not have a functioning banking system; tax policy lacks stability and tax evasion is massive; and Entity tax and other policies still act against the establishment of a common economic area in the country. 0 Discretionary administrative intervention in the economy encourages corrupt practices, limits the development of the private sector, and inhibits foreign direct investment. The country suffers from a plethora of laws and regulations, which are sometimes duplicated by the overlapping legal systems of several tiers of government. The various governments introduce ad hoc regulations and exemptions that preclude a level playing field, and allow “connected” state enterprises and banks to receive preferential treatment. More generally, the failure to address governance issues also risks a disruption of donor assistance that in turn threatens continuity of reform. III. REPORT ON DISCXJSSIONS AND MACROECONOMIC PROGRAM 12. Bosnia’s development needs call for an acceleration of the structural reform program and a concerted attack on poor governance. Discussions with the authorities focused on a review of the reform priorities under Bosnia’s economic program and steps to achieve sustainable economic growth. Within the context of the general priorities set out in paragraph 3, the government has identified three strategic objectives of the program for 2000: (i) to promote an even wider acceptance of the KM throughout the country, by strict implementation of currency board rules and reform of the payments and banking systems; (ii) to move toward fiscal sustainability and improve the social safety net, through tax and expenditure reform; and (iii) to foster market development, primarily by privatization of banks and enterprises and by setting in place an appropriate legal framework for the labor market. While the authorities’ priorities are appropriate, they are unlikely to lead to rapid and sustainable recovery without improved governance. A. Macroeconomic Framework 13. The program assumes that substantial donor-financed investment will generate positive effects on domestic production and employment, and will thereby permit growth of 15 percent in 2000. Exports are projected to grow by about 15 percent in real Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- terms. Available evidence suggests that while competitiveness is not a cause for immediate concern, the government will need to restrain public sector wages to contain real wage growth throughout the economy (Box 4). The authorities indicated that, although exports are low, this maybe reflects primarily administrative constraints and difficulties in developing new markets rather than excessively high wages. Nevertheless, they concurred with the staff about the need to keep public wage growth moderate. Such a policy stance, as well as proper implementation of the currency board arrangement, should facilitate a decline in the inflation rate in both Entities to about 3 percent in 2000. Box 4. Competitiveness Indicators The emergence of competitive domestic industries in Bosnia and Herzegovina is essential for sustained economic growth. Accordingly, it is important to assess recent developments in some indicators of external competitiveness and of the attractiveness of traded versus nontraded goods production. We examine the real effective exchange rate, dollar wages compared with those of other transition economies, and the behavior of the price of tradable relative to nontradable commodities. The tkts are as follows: Developments since 1996, the year after hostilities ended in Bosnia, indicate a depreciation of the cost of living based REER in the RS , and no significant appreciation in the Federation (Figure 3). In view of the likely increases in productivity growth associated with the implementation of the reconstruction program, this indicator suggests that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s competitiveness has improved. By contrast, the price of nontradable goods, which in the absence of other suitable dam is proxied by the price of services, has risen sharply in relation to that of tradables in both the Entities (Figure 3).’ The staff believes tbat this reflects mainly temporary effects associated with the catch-up of some previously controlled services prices. The bottom panel of Figure 3 shows the Republika Srpska’s and the Federation’s monthly wages in relation to wages in other Eastern European countries and the Baltics. All these countries are Bosnia’s potential competitors for foreign direct investment. RS wages are at the lower end of the sample. Federation wages are in the middle range, comparable with Estonia and Hungary. Although reporting methods in Bosnia produce an upward bias on wage rates in both Entities, the statT is concerned that dollar wages, particularly in the Federation, appear to be out of line with other low income transition economies. Real unit labor costs need to be held down by keeping real wage increases below productivity growth. Also, the authorities should avoid using Croatia and Slovenia as comparators for their wage policy, because such an approach is likely to price them out of the wider Eastern European market. ’ The increase in the index in the RS in 1999 reflects a jump in housing costs during April-June in the aftermath of the Kosovo conflict. Thereafter, housing costs declined substantially in July-September. It is possible that a further decline took place during the last few months of 1999 as families displaced by the conflict returned to their homes in FRY.

The medium-term macroeconomic framework projects that real GDP growth can be sustained at about 15 percent in 2000 and could average 8 percent over 2001-05 (Table 11). The framework assumes that substantial fiscal adjustment during the next 3-4 years will guide the country to the sustained increase of domestic savings that will be required to replace the anticipated decline in external assistance (see Chapter I of the Selected Issues paper). The authorities agreed with the staffthat sustaining this favorable macroeconomic performance will also require accelerated implementation of structural reform B. Monetary Issues 15. The authorities’ key objectives in 2000 are to continue enhancing the credibility of the currency board arrangement, promoting further the country-wide use of the KM, and strengthening the banking system. In 2000, broad demand for the KM should continue to grow steadily following an increase of about 32 percent in 1999. Reflecting the wider acceptance of the KM, gross international reserves of the central bank tripled in 1999, and are expected to rise by about 10 percent in 2000. During 2000, the authorities intend to continue the strict implementation of currency board rules and to expand the reserve coverage of the central bank’s domestic liabilities. To sustain the credibility of the currency board, however, the authorities will need to ensure a substantial strengthening of the banking system; to that end, they intend to liquidate or privatize all state-owned banks in 2000 (see paragraph 22). They will also continue to implement steadfastly the reform of the payments system in order to place banks at the core of an efficient and sound financial system. At the same time, the authorities intend to promote the modemization of this system to increase its speed and ease of use, and reduce the cost of making payments within the country. C. Fiscal Policy 16. The authorities agreed that the key objectives are to maintain strict fiscal discipline and continue with focal consolidation. For 2000, the authorities of both Entities reiterated their commitment to finance expenditures exclusively from own resources and external support in the form of identified grants and concessional loans. The State administrative budget will target a boost of 17 percent from the 1999 State budget. Overall deficit (before grants)-to-GDP ratios in the Federation and the RS are projected at 1.6 percent and 3.3 percent in 2000, respectively, in line with available concessional external financing.’ This implies a slight decline in the ratios compared with the estimates for 1999.’ These ratios *After grants deficit-to-GDP ratios in 2000 are projected at 1.1 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. ‘The underlying magnitude of fiscal adjustment in 2000 would be larger than suggested by a simple comparison of the deficit-to-GDP ratios, as off-budget foreign grants and associated expenditures will decline substantially. In addition, while the immediate fiscal costs of military retrenchment (in the form of severance packages) are large, a reduction in the size of the military in 2000 would create conditions for less costly adjustment in the future.

At present the negligible capital budget excludes virtually all the reconstruction activity that is recorded off-budget and is. financed primarily through external donor assistance (see Box 1). 17. Tax collection efforts, in conjunction with expenditure discipline, are important to ensure that there are suffkient resources for priority sectors. On the expenditure side, both Entities’ military expenditure will be cut substantially, making room for increased allocation to other priority sectors, such as education and transportation. The rise in the wage bill should not exceed 11 percent in 2000, taking into account the overall expenditure ceiling and the low projected inflation rate. Entity authorities have included in the 2000 budget presentation both revenues and expenditures that are currently recorded off-budget. In the area of tax administration, the RS authorities recently brought the Financial Police and Customs Administration under the authority of the Ministry of Finance. The mission advised the authorities to bring the tax-related functions of the Financial Police in the Federation within the Tax Administration, and to restructure the latter to enhance effkiency and professionalism. The authorities also plan to enhance customs administration through further recruitment and training of anti-smuggling officers and the establishment of a national border police force. 18. At the same time, reforms of budget procedures will be needed to ensure better expenditure planning. The Federation Ministry of Finance has issued regulations on fiscal reporting by budgetary organizations and is preparing to establish a treasury department within the Ministry. In the meanwhile the RS government has submitted to parliament the draft organic budget law, which includes provisions for a treasury department. At the State level, progress has been made toward the initiation of budget reporting necessary for the implementation of the treasury. The mission urged the authorities to move ahead with the establishment of treasury systems at the State and Entity levels. Debt management has improved considerably at the State level and in both Entities with the establishment of dedicated debt management units. All new loans to BiH are now negotiated at the State level by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MFTER), and the corresponding debt-service obligation recorded by the debt management unit located there. Debt management units at the Entity level also maintain the same information and cooperate closely with their counterparts at the State level. The State and Entities have made considerable progress toward compiling a comprehensive database of external debt. 19. The authorities remain fully committed to the reform of pension and war invalid benefits in close cooperation with the World Bank, and intend to design, with assistance from donors, a well-targeted social safety net. In the Federation, the government aims to complete the unification of the two existing pension systems by early 2000. In both Entities, legislation is under preparation to align entitlements with resources of social funds and benefit programs for war invalids, 20. The fiscal consolidation envisaged for 2000 is the tint step of the substantial fiscal adjustment that is needed over the next three to four years in order to stabilize the government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2005. The staff has conducted a fiscal sustainability analysis as an important input to its recommendation for the 2000 budgets (see the Selected Issues Paper, and Box 5). This study shows that the current policies are unsustainable over Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- the medium term. In particular, the high military expenditure in Bosnia poses the single most important risk to fiscal sustainability. Fiscal adjustment over the next few years should include efforts to reduce military outlays and contain the fiscal cost of social benefits. To lay the foundation for the country’s long-term economic growth driven mainly by private sector development, the authorities should also take steps to reduce the overall tax burden of the economy and minim& distortions. Box 5. Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability Staff estimates made under conservative growth assumptions’ and taking into account the financing need associated with off-budget expenditure items indicate the following: l The size of BiEI’s fiscal operations is unsustainable in the medium term, particularly as grant financing is expected to decline. Under current policies, the public debt-to- GDP ratio would rise from 70 percent in 1999 to about 200 percent in 2014. 0 In order to reduce fiscal deficits and to pave the way toward fiscal sustainability, the authorities intend to implement major reforms in expenditure and tax policies over the next 3-4 years. Specifically, public expenditure needs to be reduced relative to GDP, in particular through military retrenchment and reform of the social benefits system. Tax reform is also needed, focused on: (i) replacing the array of sales taxes on goods and services (including extended gross margin taxes) by a unified single-stage, single- rate sales tax as a preparatory step toward the introduction of a VAT in the medium term; (ii) reforming the corporate and personal income tax systems aimed to improve its revenue-raising capacity; and (iii) raising the contribution rates for military personnel and miners to the standard rates. l These policies target a fiscal adjustment of 3-4 percentage points of GDP over the next several years that would contribute to stabilizing the government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2005 at about 50 percent of GDP. ‘See the Selected Issues paper, Chapters IV-VI. The conservative growth scenario assumed that GDP growth declines gradually from 10 percent in 1999 to 5 percent in 2004 and to 4 percent in 2014. 21. As to the issue of longer term fiscal consolidation, the authorities’ efforts will emphasize the elimination of tax exemptions, and the rationalization of the tax structure. The authorities intend to review major tax laws to remove most existing exemptions and to eliminate the discretionary power of government to grant exemptions. In addition, Entity governments intend to propose amendments to their tax laws to rationalize the sales tax systems by establishing a single-stage, single-rate sales tax., and to reform the corporate and personal income taxes.

The priorities for structural reform in 2000 remain as in 1998-99, and concentrate on bank and enterprise privatization, the payments system, labor, and trade reform. The authorities also intend to improve governance. As regards payments system reform, the authorities intend to build on the progress to date, to carry this reform to conclusion in 2000. lo 23. The authorities are working closely with the World Bank, USAID, the OffIce of the High Representative and other donors to advance the agenda of bank and enterprise privatization. They are committed to adhering to agreements and understandings with the World Bank in this area, especially as set out in the context of the enterprise and bank privatization credit. To support the privatization program, the govemment took steps to ensure that virtually all state banks provided by end-November 1999 the balance sheets required for preparing state banks’ solvency tests prior to their privatization.” All state banks will be liquidated or privatized in 2000. Regarding the largest state-owned bank, Privredna Banka Sarajevo, the authorities reiterated that the Federation government will abstain from assuming or guaranteeing any obligations of banks or enterprises that were not specified in the initial contracts as obligations of government. The Federation government intends to finalize the privatization plan for the Federation Investment Bank by end-June 2000, as agreed with the World Bank and donors. Banking supervision reforms will emphasize strengthening the legal and regulatory frameworks in the areas of collateral, guarantees, insurance, and bankruptcy. The authorities are cooperating with the World Bank to establish self-financing deposit insurance mechanisms. 24. Following the removal of foreign currencies from the internal payments system in the Federation in September 1999, the government will take further steps to promote an efficient interbank system of payments. I2 To this end, the authorities will take a number of steps to enhance the transparency of operation and efficiency of all payments bureaus, including a financial verification of accounts by an internationally reputed auditing firm. Thereafter, by end-2000 the payments bureaus will be liquidated. As an intermediate step in this direction, the RS government intends to separate shortly the Development Bank Corn the payments bureau operation. “The government’s program for payments system reform is shown in the attachment to EBS/99/95 (6/14/99). Although there have been some minor slippages, the St&expects the reform to be completed in 2000. “The preparation of balance sheets is governed by the Opening Balance Sheet Law. State banks that are insolvent will be liquidated by end-2000. 12These steps include allowing banks to provide payments services, including wire transfers and clearing of checks.

High unemployment in the aftermath of a very destructive war is one of the most serious social issues facing the Bosnian authorities. They recognize that this needs to be addressed in a concerted fashion, primarily by setting in place an appropriate legal framework for the labor market that would support increased private sector activities. However, the Federation Parliament in October 1999 passed a labor law that is inconsistent with this objective. l3 The authorities are now committed to amending this law to avoid legalizing overly generous benefits and in order to promote labor market flexibility. Toward this end, they have asked a working group comprised of government officials and labor legislation experts in other countries to prepare amendments to the law by early 2000. l4 These amendments, which will be submitted to parliament by mid-2000, will aim at fostering an environment conducive to private sector activities and balancing better the protection of workers’ rights with the need to create employment. The Republika Srpska Government also appears committed to introducing a labor market framework with similar objectives. 26. The authorities reiterated their commitment to trade liberalization. While Bosnia maintains a simple and transparent tariff schedule with four tariff bands, 0,5, 10 and 15 percent, and a simple average tariff of 6.2 percent, it also imposes commodity-specific import tariff surcharges, mainly on agricultural and food products. These surcharges constitute significant protection of the domestic agricultural sector. Over the next several months, the authorities intend to work with the staff to reach understandings on a timetable for equalizing these surcharges across all commodities and then gradually eliminating them. In the meanwhile, the Bosnian authorities initiated their accession procedures into the WTO, and were granted observer status in July 1999. 27. The authorities agreed that improving governance is key to the sustainability of reform. They continue to cooperate with the EU’s Customs and Fiscal Assistance Ofice (CAFAO) and the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to eradicate corruption at all government levels. This cooperation has been successful in dismantling a number of smuggling operations. However, the pervasiveness of corruption in Bosnia is rooted in an institutional setup that lacks transparency. Therefore, within the confines of the program’s focus on macroeconomic policy, governance issues will be addressed by improving fiscal transparency. The authorities are committed to including all fiscal operations in the budgets. r3The law as it stands provides benefits that in some respects are among the most generous in European Union countries, without due consideration of the cost implications for employers and for the economy as a whole. As an example, the law provides for maternity leave of at least six months that is mandatory even for small firms. In addition, it contains provisions that will burden state enterprises with unduly onerous obligations-thereby jeopardizing their privatization. The obligations relate to employees on “waiting lists” that have been declared redundant by their employers. Under the law, employers will be liable for severance payments equivalent to at least nine months’ salary for each of the 70,000 workers on waiting lists. 14The working group includes representatives from the World Bank and OHR. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicIn particular, in 2000, they will include: (i) all external loans for reconstruction, and (ii) all revenues and expenditures of the customs and tax administrations and other government agencies in the presentation of budget documents to parliament. In addition, the authorities are willing to consider including military expenditure financed by off-budget external assistance in future budget documentation. Social funds’ financial plans, which are currently ad hoc, will need to be approved by respective parliaments as part of the annual budgetary process starting in 2000. Moreover, treasury systems will be established during 2000 at all levels of government, and most discretionary powers of governments to grant tax exemptions will be eliminated. The authorities also agreed to accelerate implementation of other measures to improve fiscal transparency as stipulated under the program.15 To address tax and duty evasion, CAFAO and the Fund will continue to provide technical advice to further strengthen the capacity of customs and tax administrations. The mission advised the authorities to broaden their efforts to eliminate corruption, take decisive action to prosecute individuals guilty of corruption, and continue cooperating with CAPAO and OHR to investigate corruption cases. IV. EXTERNAL FJNAIWING NEEDS AND CAPACITY TO RJ@AY THE FUND 28. In the period immediately ahead, Bosnia and Henegovina will be dependent on external donor support, given the narrow export base as well as the import demands associated with the implementation of the priority Reconstruction Program. As reform progresses, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to narrow slightly, from about US%950 million in 1999 to US$900 million by 2000. This narrowing would be driven by strong growth in merchandise exports, some increase in service exports, and somewhat slower growth in goods imports. In addition to the eventual decline in external financing for the reconstruction program, an easing of import growth (relative to GDP growth) will be linked to improvements in domestic productive capacity. With steadfast implementation of the authorities’ program of macroeconomic and structural reform and the rebuilding of infrastructure throughout the country, the gross external financing requirements, which are estimated at nearly US$2 billion in 1999, are projected to decline to about US$500 million by 2005. Over time, a recovery of domestic savings reflecting, inter alia, an improved fiscal position, would allow for sustained levels of domestic investment and a gradual strengthening of the current account. It is anticipated that donor support to Bosnia and Herzegovina will be provided on highly concessional terms, and accordingly, the country’s external debt-to-GDP ratio will decline from 66 percent in 1999 to 48 percent in 2005, .and the debt-service ratio, from 8 percent of exports of goods and services in 1999 to 5 percent in 2005 (Tables 9 and 14). 29. The authorities have completed their agreements with nearly all bilateral Paris Club creditors. Since such negotiations were to have been completed by end-September 1999, they have asked the Paris Club for an extension of the deadline to complete the remaining agreements. The authorities are committed to completing such agreements swiftly. “These measures include publication of all government lending and borrowing operations and the barring of nonconcessional and “in kind” external borrowing. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - In rescheduling agreements with non-Paris Club creditors they intend to seek terms comparable to those offered by the Paris Club. 30. To help meet the external financing requirements of Bosnia and Henegovina in 1999, the Fund, on June 28,1999, approved an augmentation of SDR 16.9 million and granted an extension of the stand-by arrangement through end-April 2000. In view of the delay in completing the second and third reviews, and to allow the authorities time to meet the program’s objectives, they have requested an extension of the arrangement to end- March 2001 and a fiuther augmentation of SDR16.9 million (10 percent of quota). The proposed rephasing of the purchase schedule is shown in Table 1. Ifall Fund purchases are made as scheduled, use of Fund resources at end-February 2001 would stand at SDR 94.4 million (55.8 percent of quota). 31. The medium-term strategy envisages that the authorities will be able to meet all debt-service obtigations, including those to the Fund, in a timely manner (Table 14). Although the medium-term scenario is based on realistic assumptions regarding the pace of macroeconomic and structural adjustment, there remain considerable risks in the period ahead. In particular, despite an earlier-than-anticipated cessation of the conflict in the FRY, the investor community’s confidence in the region is yet to return. In addition, key measures of structural reform that underlie the fiscal adjustment program will challenge deeply rooted vested interests, and hence require considerable commitment on the part of the authorities to implement policies in a timely manner. Accordingly, the capacity of Bosnia and Herzegovina to repay the Fund will need to be kept under close review. In this regard, the authorities will continue to hold a portion of the proceeds under the stand-by arrangement in the SDR account to facilitate timely discharge of obligations to the Fund. Obligations to the Fund would average around 1 percent of exports of goods and services through the repayment period. 32. The staff’s decision on whether to recommend completion of the second and third reviews depends on the implementation of a number of key outstanding prior actions (see Box 6). The staffwill issue a supplement to update the Executive Board regarding the status of these actions. The program for 2000 will be based on quarterly performance criteria and reviews. The quantitative.performance criteria will relate to variables similar to those under the 1999 program: (i) ceilings on domestic borrowing by the consolidated general government, by the State and Entities, local governments, and extrabudgetary funds; (ii) a floor on the “free” international reserves of the central bank; and (iii) ceilings on nonconcessional external borrowing. The maintenance of at least 100 percent foreign exchange cover for the domestic liabilities of the central bank will be a continuous performance criterion, as will the avoidance of any new external payments arrears, except for amounts subject to rescheduling. Program reviews would be associated with each purchase under the arrangement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - Box 6.

ARTKLEVIUSTATUS 33. The authorities have indicated their intention to amend laws and regulations as needed and to accept the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. The review of the foreign exchange system and Entity laws and implementing regulations on foreign exchange has not revealed any apparent existing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current account transactions. Some issue-elated to overlapping jurisdictions of relevant State and Entity laws, and nonresidents’ foreign currency deposits--need to be resolved (Box 7). Box 7. Status of Compliance with the Obligations of Article VIII, Section 2(a), of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF Following the expressed intention of the BiH authorities to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement of tbe IMF, the staff examined the laws and practice governing current account payments and transfers with a view to identifying any existing restrictions in this area. The staff was unable to find evidence of any such restrictions in the relevant laws at the State level. As regards the Entities, current account payments and transfers are similarly unrestricted in the Federation of BiH. In the Republika Srpska, although the Law on Foreign Exchange Business contains elements that allow the establishment of a multiple currency practice by controlling the exchange rate for the Yugoslav dinar, the institution responsible for implementing this regulation, the National Bat& of the Republic Srpska, no longer exists. Furthermore, the dominant currency in the Republika Srpska is now the convertible marka, whose issue and exchange rate is determined by the rules of the currency board operated by the CBBH. The foreign exchange law in the Republika Srpska explicitly forbids any other restriction on current account payments and transfers. The staRwas also unable to find evidence of any bilateral payments agreements that might violate the requirements of Article VIII. Accordingly, BiH is in a position to accept the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4. Prior to this, the authorities and the staff are reviewing some jurisdictional issues related to the overlapping authority of relevant State and Entity laws, and nonresidents’ foreign currency deposits, which are presently frozen. VI. STAFF &'PRAISAL 34. The policies implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina have resulted in the achievement of macroeconomic stability under the stand-by arrangement. Inflation has continued to decline and external official reserves are being rebuilt. From a low base that reflected the devastation, real GDP has continued to experience high rates of growth. A crucial ingredient of this performance was the strict adherence to currency board rules supported by prudent fiscal policies. 35. However, the record of policy implementation under the stand-by arrangement has been very slow. A number of measures were put in place only after considerable delays, and in several cases required the intervention of the High Representative. Tangible results in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - the area of structural reforms have been limited. As a result, Bosnia remains without a functioning banking sector, the privatization program is delayed, and there is a lack of institutional harmony between the Entities. A number of policy commitments necessary to move forward with the program were eventually implemented, and-of critical importance under the circumstances-inter-Entity cooperation to implement these policies improved significantly. In the process, despite the obstruction of reform by certain groups, the government began to show the determination and, more importantly, the ability to initiate difficult policy changes. The governments and the international community recognize that the effort has not been enough. In this regard, two paramount tasks in the area of structural reform remain: (i) creating conditions conducive to the development of private activity, and (ii) establishing the basis to move toward fiscal sustainability. 36. The program of the government addresses these objectives by concentrating on an enduring reduction in inflation and putting in place meaningful fiscal and structural reforms. Sustainable fiscal reform will require a substantial reduction in the burden of military expenditures on the budgets and finther reforms of the tax system, including the elimination of tax exemptions that undermine efforts to establish a level playing field for all economic agents. Labor reform -key to the development of private activity-will have to balance the objective of protecting workers’ rights with that of achieving sufficient labor market flexibility. This will challenge deeply held views about appropriate labor entitlements inherited from the socialist period. Privatization should be accelerated. For Bosnia and Herzegovina, a successful privatization program will need to address governance issues that have kept foreign investors away. 37. The effort to reconstruct and transform Bosnia and Henegovina appears daunting, but it is feasible. Some comfort in this regard is afforded by the authorities’ willingness to front-load policy measures for the completion of the second and third reviews and their ability to deliver at critical moments- albeit somewhat erratically. This said, the task of the authorities is difficult, and the program is faced with significant risks. First is the political risk: the authorities may not be able to reach on a consistent basis the consensus required to implement policies. Second is the implementation risk: the inconsistent record in policy reform is the result of bureaucratic resistance, opposition from vested interests, and the far-reaching nature of policy changes that test the technical limits of the authorities. Third is the social risk: the uneasy social equilibrium in Bosnia and Herzegovina-which reflects primarily continued high levels of unemployment and the very uneven distribution of the benefits of reform-could be altered by the consequences of some policies, which cannot be predicted with certainty. Any or all of these risks, should they surface, are likely to test the leadership and managerial skills of the authorities. 38. The existence of such risks argues not for a different approach but for safeguards. For the Fund, there is a need to monitor developments unusually closely and to maintain a continuing policy-input presence in the country, and hence the need for frequent reviews and to coordinate the advice provided by the international community to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Fund can help minimize implementation risks by contributing to the continued provision of technical assistance on a major scale. Such assistance has been provided, particularly in the setting up and implementation of the currency board and establishing the central bank, reforming the payments and tax systems, and improving Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - statistics. For the future, technical assistance should focus on developing treasury systems, improving tax policy and administration, and, notably, helping to enhance the transparency of government operations. The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina should move quickly and forcefully to take any additional measures needed to keep their program on track. The authorities also should continue to build their generally good track record at following through with the implementation of technical assistance recommendations, The social risk will be addressed by strengthening the social safety net program to ensure that the most vulnerable groups of the population are adequately protected. These issues would to be addressed in the preparation of a poverty reduction strategy to form the basis of a possible PRGF supported program. 39. With vigilance and continued financial and technical support from the international community, the authorities’ program should be able to consolidate the progress toward achieving macroeconomic stability. The restructuring of the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the achievement of fiscal and external sustainability will take longer than this arrangement and will require continued adjustment over the medium term. The present program, an essential step in that direction, will continue to be subject to close monitoring. As the authorities’ efforts to date deserve support, the staff recommends completion of the second and third reviews under the stand-by arrangement. The staff also supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for applicability of the end-December 1999 performance criteria, the extension of the stand-by arrangement to end-March 2001, its augmentation by SDR 16.9 million, and the rephasing of purchases. 40. Improving the quality and availability of statistical information is essential to the : effectiveness of the intensive monitoring effort. With extensive technical assistance from the Fund, the authorities have adapted monetary data compilation procedures to changes in the institutional set-up of the banking system, are preparing for forthcoming changes in the institutional responsibilities for monetary data reporting and compilation in the banking system, and have established an external debt database. However, progress in the production of a summary balance of payments, real GDP data, and adequate labor statistics has not been satisfactory, hampered in part by difficulties in the cooperation of the three statistics institutions, The work of a Fund Multisector Statistical Advisor, who assumed her post in May 1999, is expected to contribute to the acceleration of progress in these areas. 41. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina be held on the standard 1Zmonth cycle.

The DM continues to circulate in all areas of the country, the Croatian kuna continues to be used in the Croat-majority area, and the Yugoslav dinar is used in the Republika Srpska The convertible marka (KM) is the currency used for operations and transactions with the Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not maintain restrictions on payments for current international transactions or capital account transactions, with the exception of restrictions on transactions related to internationally-mandated economic sanctions. Corresponding regulations have not, however, been issued by the Entities. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina was concluded on May 29, 1998. At that time, Directors warmly welcomed the progress that had been made in establishing the common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and strongly supported the authorities’ economic strategy. They considered that the new central bank, operating under a currency board arrangement, and the new domestic currency could play a major role in political and economic reintegration and establishing an environment conducive to economic recovery. Directors also stressed the need for further development of the new fiscal institutions called for under the Dayton Treaty; stronger mechanisms for inter- regional cooperation; and the adoption of growth oriented tax reforms, restructuring of pensions systems, and a more effective and targeted social safety net. They were of the view that governance issues posed risks to the program, and called upon the authorities to intensify their efforts to promote transparency, establish a more adequate legal framework, and detect and prosecute official corruption. Directors urged the authorities to implement the structural reform agenda in a comprehensive manner and establish a track record of policy implementation, to pave the way for the adoption of a program that could be supported under the ESAF.

Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the World Bank Group on April 1,1996, after having agreed to assume its share of the loans made by the Bank to, or with the guarantee of, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY);r and having agreed with the Bank on a plan to eliminate arrears on those loans2 2. Jn parallel with efforts towards membership and resolution of arrears, the Bank initiated, in collaboration with the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the IMF and international donors, preparatory efforts for a program of post-war reconstruction and economic recovery. The external financing requirement of this program was estimated at US$5.1 billion over 3-4 years. At pledging conferences in December 1995, April 1996, July 1997, May 1998 and May 1999--co-chaired by the European Commission and the World Bank--some 60 donor countries, multilateral institutions and other donor agencies pledged over US85.1 billion of assistance on highly concessional terms to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in the implementation of the Priority Reconstruction Program. 3. As of November 1999, the World Bank Group had committed US$739 million, in support of 30 IDA credits and 9 IFC operations, and disbursed US$515 million. The IDA- financed projects have supported rehabilitation and reconstruction in a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, industry, energy, water supply, transport, education and health, and have directly supported employment creation through demobilization support, micro-credit and public works. 4. The overall Bank assistance program has the following objectives: (i) strengthening the institutions of macroeconomic management, in particular, in the area of public finance; (ii) making the transition to a market economy, with focus on enterprise privatization and banking sector reforms; and (iii) deepening the sustainability of reconstruction, with particular attention to cost recovery and appropriate sector policies. After an initial post-war strategy aimed at reconstruction, the Bank’s strategy has shifted to assisting Bosnia and Herzegovina in its move towards sustainable growth. In this context, a Second Public Finance Structural Adjustment Credit (PFSAC n), is being implemented this year, aimed to further advance inter- entity coordination, priority setting for public spending and improve budget and debt a management initiated last year through the first PFSAC. Jn order to assist the authorities in continued implementation of their reform program, an Enterprise and Bank Privatization Adjustment Credit was also approved by the Bank’s Board in June 1999. 5. The Bank and the JMF have worked in very close partnership since the beginning of the reconstruction effort. Regular exchange of information, joint missions and joint chairmanship of the macroeconomic sector task force in Sarajevo have benefited both institutions. ’ Allocation of these loans among the successor republics of the SFRY is based on project benefits located within the internationally recognized territory of each republic. An apportionment formula has been used for unallocated debt, i.e., debt related to balance of payments support where single republics could not be identified as a beneficiary. ’ The plan involved consolidation of outstanding balances plus arrears into a package of new IBRD loans (the consolidation loan package). The consolidation loan package became effective in June 1996, paving the way for regular IDA lending.

The Dayton peace treaty, which ended the civil war implicitly gave responsibility for statistical fbnctions to the two Entities (The Federation and RS). However, in response to the need to create a state agency with responsibilities for compiling country-wide statistics in accordance with internationally accepted methodologies, consolidating data produced by the Entity Statistical Institutes, and acting as primary coordinating agency for contacts with international agencies, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS) was established in August 1998. The BHAS started operating in late 1998 with limited budget resources, and EC and bilateral support. Inter-Entity cooperation has improved noticeably since then and progress toward restoring adequate statistical capabilities has been noticeable, especially in data dissemination and the compilation of monetary and balance of payments data. Under donor supervision, a comprehensive program of technical assistance in statistics is under implementation. A Fund resident statistical advisor was assigned to the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) in May 1999, to provide technical assistance in the development of a wide range of statistics on the basis of the comprehensive review of key macroeconomic statistics conducted in early 1998 by the Fund’s Multisector Statistics mission and the recommendations of Fund missions in the areas of monetary and balance of payments statistics. Preparations are under way for introducing a country page for Bosnia and Herzegovina in International Finance Statistics (IFS). A. Real Sector 2. Since the last Article IV discussions, noticeable efforts have been made in both Entities to prepare national accounts estimates based on international standards recommended under the 1993 SNA, although there are large differences in the Entities’ relative capabilities. Production and income aggregates at constant prices and compilation of GDP by final demand are still unavailable and informal sector activities are under-recorded. Both statistical offices compile prices and production indices following sound methodological procedures, although the underlying weights for the indices are seriously outdated. Labor statistics are the weakest area for both Institutes, and data on employment, unemployment, and wage rates are based on deficient methodologies. B. Balance of Payments 3. Information needed for country-wide balance of payment statements is assembled only at the time of EUl missions using ad hoc basis data from donors or relevant Entity agencies. However, efforts are under way at the CBBH, with Fund technical assistance, to compile comprehensive balance of payments statistics at the Entity and State levels. Intensive technical assistance will be required in the short- to medium- term to compile reliable balance of payments statistics in accordance with international standards. Noticeable progress was achieved in recent months regarding the compilation of trade and debt data by both the Federation and Republika Srpska. Information on flows of services and unrequited transfers remains deficient. A tirther technical assistance mission in balance of payments will take place during August 2%September 8, 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50- APPENDIXIII , C. Government Finance 4. No government finance statistics for the consolidated general government are compiled at present by either the Entity or State authorities. In the Federation, a new system of classification broadly consistent with the Government Finance Statistics (GFS’ methodology was implemented in 1998; the Republika Srpska is expected to adopt a similar classification by end- 1999. The quality and timeliness of Entity government data has improved significantly during 1998, reflecting continued assistance from U.S. Treasury experts. Government expenditure data, however, remain deficient as a result of timing of recording difficulties and the exclusion of expenditures financed from external sources. In addition, the exclusion of arrears from expenditures understates actual government payment commitments and the overall deficit. For lower levels of governments in the Federation (i.e., cantons and municipalities) that account for a major share of general government operations, the classification system is not harmonized with the Federation’s and excessive reporting lags still prevail. D. Monetary Accounts 5. Considerable efforts have been successfully devoted by the Fund during six missions in 1996-99 to establishing an integrated system of country-wide monetary statistics meeting Fund standards. In addition to supporting the CBBH in strengthening the reliability and timeliness of monetary data, the Fund provided recently technical assistance to ensure that the ongoing reform of the payments system will not disrupt the compilation of monetary data. Further improvements in the quality of monetary statistics is expected from the implementation of a new chart of accounts for commercial banks reflecting modern accounting practices. Such a chart of accounts was implemented in early 1999 in the Federation and is expected to be adopted by end-1999 in the Republika Srpska.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Bosnia and Henegovina On March 6, 2000, the IMF Executive Board concluded the 1999 Article IV consultation,’ completed the second and third reviews under the stand-by arrangement for Bosnia, approved the extension of the arrangement to end-March 2001 and its augmentation by an amount equivalent to SDR 16.9 million (about US$23.5 million). With the approval of this review, an amount equivalent to SDR 11 million (about US$15 million) were made immediately available to Bosnia and Herregovina. Background Following progress in the immediate post-war period (1996-97) in establishing the essential institutions of the country and in rebuilding the basic infrastructure of the economy, the authorities embarked in May 1998 on an ambitious economic reform program, supported under the stand-by arrangement. Under this program, the authorities have managed to reduce macroeconomic imbalances, and the credibility of the currency board arrangement and acceptance of the Convertible Marka (KM) have increased considerably. The program has succeeded in bringing country-wide inflation to single digits and economic reform has progressed. However, inter-ethnic rivalries, serious governance problems, and the fallout from the recent conflict in Kosovo have undermined performance. Real GDP growth in 1998-99 has fallen short of expectations under the standby-arrangement and the pace of structural reform has been disappointing in many respects. After a promising start, progress in developing Bosnia’s basic economic institutions has been slow, and, despite the substantial contribution of the international community to the reconstruction effort, the country’s infrastructure remains weak. Territorial divisions along ethnic lines continue to hamper integrated policy implementation, particularly economic reforms. Fundamental reforms that were delayed include the privatization of banks and enterprises and the harmonization of excise taxes across Entities. The Entities agreed on a list of harmonized excise taxes on June 8, 1999, but it took more than 6 months to fully implement the agreement. ’ Under At-tide IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director as Chairman of the Board, summartzes the views of executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

By far ’ the most successful achievements have been the consolidation of the Central Bank and the introduction of the new currency. In this regard, the rapid acceptance of the KM throughout the country is a testament to the sound implementation of the currency board. Important progress in inter-Entity cooperation was also made with an agreement on a common, country-wide customs tariff regime in mid-1998. In parallel, barriers to the internal movement of goods and people have also been eliminated. An automatic transfer mechanism to cover the country’s debt service and the State’s administrative costs replaced the previous system of ad hoc transfers from Entities to the State. In 1999, the authorities have also taken steps to eliminate most sales tax and customs exemptions and reform the payments system, and initiated the process of Bosnia’s accession to the World Trade Organization. Although macroeconomic policy implementation in 1998-99 suffered some setbacks, and macroeconomic developments in 1999 were affected by Kosovo, progress in this area has been on the whole positive. The maintenance of fiscal discipline has been key in this regard, and, in retrospect, Bosnia appears to have weathered the Kosovo conflict quite well. Since mid-1999 there have been promising signs of recovery of production and trade-especially in the Federation-and real GDP growth is estimated at 10 percent in 1999, following growth of 15 percent in 1998. Inflation, meanwhile, has continued to decline. After four years of intensive reconstruction supported by unprecedented external aid, Bosnia still faces immense challenges to achieve sustainable development. Unemployment remains at about 40 percent of the labor force. Structural deficiencies affect most areas of the economy, and discretionary administrative intervention in the economy encourages corrupt practices, limits the development of the private sector, and inhibits foreign direct investment. Executive Board Assessment <Begin Typing Here> Public hforrnation Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
