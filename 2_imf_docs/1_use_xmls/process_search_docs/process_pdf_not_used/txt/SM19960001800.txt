The parallel arrangements under the ESAF and EFF for Zimbabwe expired in September 1995, without a third-year program being put in place. h0.e there was significant progress in fhe,deregulation of the domestic economy (prices, interest rates, investment, labor market), as well as in the _ liberalization of the foreign exchange and trade regime, persistent failure of expenditure control and delays in public enterprise reforms ultimately derailed the program. Excessive domestic financing requirements of the public sector pushed up,interest rates, crowded out the private sector, and depressed investment. . Owing to these shortcomings and to the damaging effects of two droughts--most recently in 1994-95--per.capita income growth has been negative on average over the last five years. Economic growth in 1995 is estimated at -1 percent, and inflation at 23 percent. The weak economy, combined with an. improvement in the terms of trade, has led to a narrowing of the external current account deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP in 1995. Those trends are expected to be reversed in 1996, with a recovery in growth, a decline in inflation, and a widening of the current account deficit. a In the budget for fiscal year 1995/96 announced in July 1995 and, additionally, in November 1995, the Government adopted a number of revenue and expenditure measures which were thought to be sufficient to limit the domestic financing requirement of the budget to 5.4 percent of GDP, as against 8:8 percent in 1994/95. Furthermore, the process of cornmercializing the Grain .&$keting Board (GMB) was initiated--including a government takeover of past debts and an important increase in the price of maize-- enabling the.GMB to break even in 1995/96, compared with a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 1994/95. 0 The authorities incorporated these measures, along with actions and intentions pertaining to other policy areas, into a short-term stabilization program extending through mid-1996. This program has been weakened by recent information that the government wage bill may be significantly higher than budgeted and that strains in the banking system have triggered an ad hoc relaxation of mandatory reserve requirements. Accordingly, the staff urged the authorities to respond by strengthening their program through additional measures. The authorities have expressed their continued commitment to the program targets. 0 The exchange rate is market determined and considered to be competitive at its current level. Intervention policy is directed at smoothing short- term fluctuations and meeting the target for net international reserves.

Background Zimbabwe is approaching the end of its five-year economic and structural .adjustment program (ESAP), launched in 1991, and supported by the Fund since 1992 through parallel arrangements under the extended Fund facility (EFF) and the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). L/ The main objective of the program was to promote growth and employment by moving away from a highly regulated economy to one where market forces are allowed to play a more decisive role. The supply response to this move was to be enhanced by a reduction of,inflation brought about by tight monetary and fiscal policies. Despite efforts to correct imbalances as they emerged, performance under this program has suffered throughout from an unevenness of policy implementation, 'which undermined the hopedlfor supply response and ultimately derailed the program. On,the positive side, significant progress was achieved in the deregulation of the domestic economy (prices; interest rates, investment,, and labor market), as well as in the liberalization of' the foreign exchinge and:t?ade regime (unification of the foreign exchange market, current account convertibility, and reduction in import taxes); progress in these areas is documented in Boxes 1 and 2. Against this weighed the inability of the Government to bring the budget deficit and the losses of public enterprises under control; program targets in this area, although modified from year,to year, 'were frequently missed by wide margins, with problems in the government budget emanating mainly from the expenditure side (Chart 1). .' The persistently high public sector demands on domestic financial markets could be accommodated only at high real interest rates and at the cost of crowding out the private. sector from bank and nonbank financing. These policy shortcomings, together with the effect of the droughts in, ' 1991-92 (the worst on record) and in 1994-95 ,(less severe), resulted in a low annual growth rate of real GDP, which is estimated to have averaged less than 2'percent during the period 1991-95, not nearly enough to absorb the growing labor force, let,alone raise per 'capita income (Tab1.e 1). Meanwhile, inflation fell from a drought-related peak.of over 40 percent in 1992, but has remained in the range of 20-25 percent since the beginning of 1994, instead of declining to 10 percent in 1994 and 7 percent in 1995, as envisaged in the original program (Chart 2). I/ For details of the parallel arrangements under the ESAF and the EFF (both of which expired on September '10, 1995), recent Executive Board deliberations on Zimbabwe (including the 1994 Article IV consultation), and Zimbabwe's performance relative to the targets established at the last review of the program in February 1995, see Appendix I. Zimbabwe's relations with the World Bank Group are described in Appendix II.

While revenue fell short of expectations, the more serious problems arose on the 'expenditure side. largely Mechanisms for the control of nonwage current expenditures proved ineffective;' and capital and net lending 'outlays, which had been reported below budget through May 1995, the equivalent of 1.4 percent of GDP, exceeded the target for the year by afte.r the full incorporation of all foreign-financed outlays into the budget. L/ Domestic financing of the budget .exceeded the programmed amount by more.than .4 percent of GDP. The nine public enterprises monitored under the program recorded a combined operating loss of 2.5 percent of-GDP &1994/95, mostly on account of the Grain Marketing Board (GMB), which failed to implement a'market-based pricing policy for maize as had been agreed under'the program'(Table 3). This aggregate loss was financed largely from domestic nonbank sources (with government guarantees), further crowding out the private sector. u Meanwhile, the commercialization of the GMB and two.other former marketing boards was facilitated by the Government's assumption, as of end-June 1995, of debts of Z$4.0 billion (7.5 percent of GDP) related to past government intervention in the operations of the boards. Since March 1995, the steel company ZISCO has been managed by a team of consultants who recently submitted to the Government a diagnostic report and preliminary recommendations for a privatization strategy; direct budgetary support to ZISCO in 19?4/95 amounted toZ$366 million (0.7 percent of GDP). A -largely. independent and .relatively tight monetary policy--as reflected in positive real interest rates and the. observance of'the '. quantitative program targets--facilitated the implement,ation of important 1. external'sector reforms. During 1994/95, the Reserve Bank,.of Zimbabwe (RBZ) improved its instruments of indirect monetary control; primarily through more effective use of treasury bills as an instrument of open market 1/ A technical assistance mission by the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department in April 1995 clarified the nature of these transactions and advised.the authorities of the need to bring the expenditures and financing flows that had generated "debtor balances" in the accounts of the National Development Fund (NDF) and the,;Tre,asury into the budget proper. The authorities complied in June 1995 in reporting the budget outcome for 1994/95; they also undertook to adhere to the principle 0f.a unified comprehensive budget in the future. 2/ In the absence of complete and comparable public enterprise accounts (beyond the operating results recorded in Table 3), it is not possible to derive the overall borrowing requirement of the public sector. The sum of the budget deficit and.the 'operating result of the nine monitored public enterprises can be'used as a proxy, at the risk, inter alia, of not capturing the financing of investment expenditur'es, on the one hand, and omitting altogether a significant number of profitable public enterprises, ., on the other hand.

A/ A mainly seasonal increase in net 'foreign assets during the middle quarters of 1995, although largely sterilized by a contraction of net domestic assets, brought about a fall in the treasury bill'rate which has by now been fully reversed. The 12-month growth of .broad money declined from 34'percent:at end-1994 to 20 percent at mid-1995 (Chart 4 and Table 4). 2/ Bank credit to the private sector contracted in real terms, a squeeze that was only exacerbated by the rising share of financial savings that nonbank financial institutions chose to channel into high-yielding government securities. :. . ! Zimbabwe's external current account position, improved during 1994, and this trend continued in 1995. Merchandise'exports;in dollar terms- have grown robustly thanks to rebounding world price's (tobacco and.ferro-chrome), continuing rapid growth of,mining output, and a competitive exchange rate.. Import volume growth appears to have,slowed somewhat in 1995, as the lower' pace of activity.and domestic demand.outweighed drought-related imports. In the capital account, Zimbabwe continued to benefit from substantial project- related grant inflows, while delays in policy reforms slowed official .: lending. Inflows of Rortfolio capital increased as nonresidents purchased a large proportion of public assets sold; foreign financing of the Hartley platinum project accounted for an increase in direct investment. Fears of a devaluation in late 1994 caused a reversal of short-term capital inflows; but inflows resumed in the second quarter of 1995, much of it in the form of pre-financing for tobacco exports. At end-September 1995, gross reserves reached a peak of. 5%.months of merchandise imports, although they.have declined since then in a'pattern much like that of 1994. .. With the improvement in the,current account during 1994 and.1995,. and:' deterioration in the central~government balance, the private savings- ,, , investment balance, which i&ludes the balance of public enterprises, increased by roughly 4 percent of GDR.,over the two years. Interpretation'.of this improvement is hampered by lack of data, but it is estimated that a continuing recovery in private savings after the 1992 drought and.the crowding out of private investment both played an important role. '. .I . . Since July 1994, the exchange rate of the Zimbabwe dollar has been market determined, although the RBZ has intervened in the foreign exchange market to limit.short-'term fluctuations. Intervention decisions have also. been guided by an unannounced exchange rate band, with a central rate that u The proceeds of ,treasury bills issued for monetary policy purposes ("special treasury bills") are sterilized.in a government deposit account at the RBZ, reflected in Table 4 as a reduction in net credit to the Central Government. 2/ The corresponding growth in reserve money for the year ended June 1995 was only 2.5 percent. This low increase is explained by, the exemption from reserve requirements granted:by the RBZ toone commercial bank experiencing difficulties because of nonperforming loans. , ‘.I ,, ,, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public1oc 80 60 40 20 0 # I - g.- CHART 4 ZIMBABWE MONEY,,DqMESTIC CREDIT, AND INTEREST RATES, ; '.DECEMBER‘l!393-SiPTEtiBER'l995 100 BROAD MONEY AND RESERVE.

Thus, the RBZ has allowed the flows of capital noted above to be absorbed by changes in net international reserves, dampening variations in the exchange rate (Chart 5). Zimbabwe accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections' 2, 3, and 4, on February 3, 1995. As part of this move, the.Government established a three-year timetable for the liquidation of blocked profits and dividends accrued on investments made prior to May 1993; modalities for the release of these funds were announced in September 1995, and the first application was approved in November 1995.' Real.GDP is'estimated to have declined by about 1 percent in 1995, with agricultural and manufacturing production falling by 10:percent and 2 percent, respectively;, The 12-month rate of inflation increased from some 20 percent in the first half of 1995 to 26.3 percent in November., reflecting both the drought (12-month increase in food prices, 35.6 percent) and recent increases in indirect taxes. Economic and financial'analysis in Zimbabwe continues to be impeded by a number of serious statistical shortcomings relating, in particular, to the compilation of national accounts and external trade.statistics, the consistency of budgetary financing data with the external and monetary accounts; .and the .coverage and quality of public enterprise data. The data base in Zimbabwe also has certain strengths, notably the wealth of monetary data published monthly by the RBZ, the timeliness with which budgetary revenue and expenditure data are reported, and the wide range of surveys conducted by the Central Statistical Office-(CSO). A detailed report on statistical issues in"Zimbabwe is provided in Appendix III. ' II. Stabilization Policies 'The Article IV consultation discussions, held'in two rounds in June and October 1995, focused:on the consequences and policy 'implications of persistently high domestic financing requirements of the Government and the public enterprises, There was a shared perception of the detrimental effects that,repeated large deviations from the Government's targets in these areas had on the conditions facing the private sector inrecent years. A common understanding,thus existed of the need to improve conditions for the private sector if .&stainable growth in employment and per capita income was to be achieved. The staff held that decisive corrective action was needed quickly to avert the risk of financial disorder and to open the way to adequate and sustainable growth, The staff expressed the view that the restoration of financial stability,depended on a si,gnificant and immediate reduction in the Government's domestic financing requirement.

At end-July 1995, in presenting the budget for 1995/96, the M.inister of Finance acknowledged that the Government needed to take bold measures in order to address the problem of continued fiscal imbalances, which had contributed to high inflation and correspondingly high interest rates. However, the budget measures subsequently turned out to be insufficient to' ensure a reduction in the Government's domestic financing requirement to the level of Z$4 billion targeted in the announced budget. In November 1995, the authorities adopted a number,of additional revenue and expenditure measures which were thought to be sufficient to reduce the Government's domestic financing requirement for 19,95/96 to about Z$3.4 billion, a target considered by the staff to be appropriate under the circumstances. The authorities incorporated these measures, along with actions and intentions pertaining to other policy areas, into a short-term stabilization program.extending through mid-1996. However; the latest available information suggests that critical budgetary targets already : appear in jeopardy, after a review of the recent job'grading exercise concluded that the budgeted-wage bill for the year (Z$7.2:billion) might be exceeded by as much as Z$565 million (0.9 percent of GDP). The staff urged the authorities to respond by strengthening their program through additional measures, including a rolling back, at least in part, of the unexpected increase in the wage bill. The authorities expressed their continued commitment to the program targets but have n.ot yet identified the specific measures with which to achieve them: The difficult policy choices in a number of areas have been complicated by the impact of the recent drought. In August 1995, the Government declared a "state of disaster" and launched an appeal for assistance to the donor community. u The outlook for the next crop season is more promising, as seasonal rains have so far been broadly satisfactory. Assuming a rebound inagricultural production of perhaps 20 percent, real GDP is projected to grow by close to 7 percent in 1996. If food prices respond flexibly to a more abundant crop and.if the intended monetary stance is not undermined, inflation can be expected to decline significantly in 1996, perhaps to below 10 percent by the end,of the year. 1. Budnetarv volicv The declared aim of Zimbabwe's budgetary policy for the near term is a reduction in the Government's domestic financing requirement from Z$4.6 billion (8.8 percent of GDP) in 1994/95 to Z$3.4 billion (5.4 percent I/ Drought relief is discussed,below in the context of budgetary policy for 1995/96, while details of the appeal to donors are described in Chapter II of the background paper on recent economic developments.

This fiscal effort would finance-in part : a surge in interest obligations, but also permit a reduction in the overall1 budget deficit (excluding grants and privatization proceeds) from: 12.5 percent of GDP in 199.4/95 to 10.5 percent of GDP in 1995/96.1 Finally, - the authorities expected that a residual budgetary gap of about Z$l.O bil- lion could be covered by foreign financial assistance. It should be noted that the Government's budgetary framework and its t financing.assumptions are put,at risk by the:.recent.upward revision in the : government wage bill--strongly suggesting:a need for early and decisive '! : corrective action. Indeed, without a rapid'policy response, and in the : -.' absence of the gap financing expected from foreign donors, the domestic 1 financing requirement would increase by at least 2.5 percent of GDP, with ', 1 important consequences for the authdrities' inflation, growth, and balance : ;; : of payments objectives. .' : ., Revenue is expected to rise from 28.3 percent of GDP in 1994/95 to i 29.4 percent of GDP in 1995/96,.

Transfers are budgeted to contract in nominal terms, implying a sharp reduction in real terms, while drought relief outlays are projected to rise from Z$152 million in 1994/95 to Z$890 million in 1995/96. 2/ Combined capital expenditures and net lending (excluding privatization proceeds) will increase by 5 percent to Z$3.8 billion (6.0 percent of GDP) in 1995/96, with domestically financed outlays limited to ongoing projects and to the payment of called-up government loan guarantees (Z$400 million). 2/ Efforts at civil service reform and military demobilization are continuing in 1995/96, with an expected decrease in army personnel (supported by retrenchment packages and retraining) from 39,900 in June 1995 to 35,700 by March 1996. After a slowdown in mid-1995, the program of reductions in civil service posts has regained momentum, and the June 1995 target of 162,263 posts is expected to be reached by end-January 1996. The authorities have also declared a hiring freeze that prohibits the filling of all but essential posts. Several reforms in the area of expenditure management will be introduced during the course df the fiscal year. The system of cash-based controls that became operational in October 1995 has shown some initial success in restraining budgetary spending, but reportedly has also given rise to some payments delays. Thus, the Government will develop by March 1996 the principles of a system of expenditure control at the commitment level, with a view to an early implementation of such a system. The Ministry of Finance will also increase the number of officers specializing in expenditure management and control issues of key spending L/ The reasons for the expected overspending on wages are not yet fully clarified; factors that have been identified include wage awards in the context of the recent job grading exercise (administered by the Public Service Commission under the Ministry of Labor) as well as compensation for overtime worked by teachers in past years. 2/ Social assistance currently focusses on mitigating the adverse effects of the drought through a grain loan program, the targeted distribution of free food, a child supplementary feeding program, and food crop recovery programs. 3/ The budget includes among new lending operations a program financed by a loan from the African Development Bank under which the Government would lend Z$500 million (0.8 percent of GDP) to the Zimbabwe Investment Centre (ZIG). for onlending (via the banking system) to the private sector at a below-market interest rate. The operation is expected to continue with a somewhat smaller amount in 1996/97.

Public enterpris= Zn the wake of large operating losses recorded through 1994/95, the reform of public enterprises has regained some momentum in recent months with the takeover by the Government of important debts of three agricultural marketing boards, the decision of the GMB to raise the selling price for maize to a market-related level, the creation of a commercialization and privatization unit in the Government, and the first sales of government-held shares in publicly quoted companies. These steps, in particular the debt takeover and the 38 percent increase in the maize price in August 1995, promise a sharp reduction, if not complete elimination, of the combined operating deficit of the nine public enterprises specifically monitored under the Government's program. 2/ Nevertheless, further structural reforms are still required to prepare key public enterprises for full commercial viability and phased privatization. While greater price flexibility has already helped the GMB improve its financial position in the short term, the staff stressed that additional steps needed to be taken urgently to ensure the company's operational efficiency. These steps would include the following: (1) a clear definition, and regular funding from the budget, of the GMB's government- mandated social functions (Strategic Grain Reserve, buyer of last resort); (2) specific actions to reduce overhead costs (staff retrenchments, sale or leasing of underutilized assets); and (3) full commercialization of the GMB's remaining operations. The authorities explained that a separate and largely self-financing Strategic Grain Reserve Fund would be created by the end of 1995, and that the GMB was already applying the relevant accounting principles in administering the grain reserve. As grain was being purchased from the reserve account (including purchases by the Government for its drought relief programs), a cash reserve was accumulating for future re- stocking. Under a new business plan adopted in November 1995, the GMB committed itself to a reduction in its permanent staff by one-third by end- March 1996, as well as the closure of 19 (of 48) grain depots. As a result of these steps, and the higher price of maize this year, the GMB expects to at least break even in its operations for 1995/96. Starting with the next I/ These measures were recommended by a Fund technical assistance mission in April 1995. L?/ With the debt takeover, interest obligations of more than 2$0.6 billion in 1995/96 were shifted from the enterprises concerned to the government budget.

With regard to the steel company ZISCO, the team of consultants from British Steel who have been managing the company since March 1995 have recently completed their diagnostic study recommending, inter alia, against the costly rehabilitation of a large (presently inoperative) blast furnace in the near term. The staff advised the authorities to strictly limit ZISCO's access to budgetary support and government guarantees and to ensure that no large investment spending be undertaken until the critical issue of significant private sector participation in the company is resolved. In sum, the Government expects the nine public enterprises monitored under its program to show an aggregate operating loss of no more than Z$llO million (0.2 percent of GDP) in 1995/96, compared with Z$1.3 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) in 1994/95 (Table 3), implying a considerable easing of pressures from this source on domestic financial markets. At the same time, the Government will step up the collection of dividends from profitable enterprises. To realize the Government's overall public enterprise strategy --encompassing closure, partial and full privatization, and, in some cases, continued public ownership--a cabinet committee chaired by the National Planning Commissioner has developed an action plan for Cabinet consideration in the near future. The Government also intends to remove specific tax and duty exemptions for public enterprises. 3. Monetary policv In early September 1995, the RBZ began a new practice of issuing semi- annual statements on monetary policy. In the first such statement, the Governor of the RBZ emphasized that the primary objective of monetary policy was the maintenance of price stability. Specifically, for 1995/96, the RBZ was committed to a tight monetary stance with the objective of reducing the 12-month rate of inflation from 20 percent in June 1995, and an expected 25 percent by the end of the year, to some 16-18 percent by June 1996. In order to achieve this inflation objective, broad money growth during 1995/96 would be limited to 18-22 percent, and interest rates would be maintained positive in real terms through appropriate liquidity management. 1/ The policy statement identified the Government's net domestic financing requirement as a determining factor for the possible expansion of credit to the private sector. In November 1995, in close cooperation with the staff, the RBZ developed a detailed monetary program for the period through June 1996, incorporating for the Government the targeted domestic financing requirement of Z$3.4 billion for 1995/96. Under this program, the expansion of broad I/ At the request of the RBZ, a Fund technical assistance mission visited Harare in January 1996 to advise on monetary operations.

Credit to the private sector is aimed to expand by about 19 percent in the course of the year. Implementation of this monetary program, and in particular the implied room for private sector credit expansion, depend critically on the necessary strengthening of fiscal policy in the wake of the expected overshooting in the government wage bill. In discussing a possible conflict between the RBZ's money supply target and its desire to maintain a stable real effective exchange rate, the staff urged the authorities to give first priority to the reduction of inflation and, to this end, to adhere to the announced growth of broad money as a nominal anchor for inflation expectations. Until the process of fiscal consolidation is more advanced and the domestic financing requirement of the budget reduced, upward pressure on real interest rates will remain strong. The staff expressed serious concern to the authorities regarding the partial exemption from reserve requirements of two large commercial banks in June and November 1995. The Reserve Bank explained that this relief--in amounts of Z$90 million and Z$400 million, respectively--had been necessitated by an accumulation of nonperforming assets particular to these banks. The Reserve Bank expected the Government, as majority shareholders of the two banks, to find a solution to their problems, upon which the exemption from reserve requirements would be reviewed. In light of these banking problems, and the role that stronger supervisory powers for the RBZ could have played in preventing them, great urgency attaches to the enactment of the revised Reserve Bank and Banking Acts and to a strengthening of the Reserve Bank's supervision capabilities. The Fund provided technical assistance for this important legislative reform, including detailed drafts of both acts, already in mid-1994 and has repeatedly indicated its willingness to provide technical assistance for the enhancement of banking supervision. 1/ The authorities now expect the two acts to be passed by Parliament by end-March 1996. The Reserve Bank announced in September 1995 that it had introduced a guideline on the risk- asset based measurement of capital adequacy for banking institutions, and that all banks were expected to comply with a minimum capital ratio of 8 percent by June 1997. It was also announced that a guideline on provisioning for bad debts would be issued and implemented before the end of 1995. Q The staff noted with regret that the draft legislation presently being considered by the Government retains the bank licensing authority with the Minister of Finance, rather than combining it with the supervision authority in the hands of the Reserve Bank, as had been recommended by the Fund staff in line with accepted international practice.

External sector policies The Zimbabwean authorities expressed satisfaction with the market- determined exchange rate, and indicated that intervention would be directed mainly at smoothing out short-term fluctuations and meeting the target for net international reserves. Responding to underlying market pressures, the nominal value of the Zimbabwe dollar depreciated by a total of 9 percent during January-November 1995.. The RBZ has also allowed the exchange rate to partially reflect temporary fluctuations in the capital account (inflows in the second quarter, outflows in October). The authorities considered that competitiveness was broadly adequate; while direct measures of competitiveness were unavailable, the staff concurred on the basis of indirect evidence , including the relative stability of'the real effective exchange.rate, the continuing growth of,manufacturing exports, and the containment of wages. The staff noted the announcement in September 1995 of modalities for the gradual liquidation of blocked pr.ofits and dividends (with the first transactions completed in November 1995) and the unwinding of outstanding contracts under the forward cover scheme operated by the RBZ up to January 1,.1994. The staff welcomed the authorities', intention to remove clothing and textiles from the negative list for imports with effect from January 1, 1996, aft.er .which the negative.list would contain only health- and security-related items. Zimbabwe,completed in November 1995 its letter of policy for the Cross-Border Initiative (CBI),. according to which it will raise and unify tariff preferences among partic,ipating countries in eastern and southern Africa as well as harmonize the 'external tariff at a low level. The authorities expressed. some concern,about the adverse impact of subsidized, protected.competition from South Africa on the domestic manufacturing sector. They indicated that negotiations were under way with South Africa on an agreement to,restore preferential access to the South African market for, Zimbabwean clothing and textiles. The current account deficit is proje,cted to widen somewhat in 1996, to 4.3 percent of GDP, reflecting import demand associated with higher economic growth and a leveling off of export prices, (Table 5). On the capital account, an improvement is expected in 1996, mostly because the Government will not need, to repay short-term loans as it did in 1995. Reflecting the RBZ's intervention policy in response. to swings in seasonal tobacco financing flows, the program projects a decline in reserves toward the end of 1995 with a rebuilding by mid-1996 (a pattern similar to that of the previous year). Reserves would remain above the RBZ's target minimum level of four months of imports before declining to that level in the latter part of 1996. A residual financing gap. of bS$142 million remains in the balance of payments for 1996. Depending on the Government's record of policy implementation in the course of the year, it is expected that this gap could be filled with additional program-related support from multilateral and bilateral sources; the Government has begun discussions to this end, including with the World Bank regarding the second tranche of the Bank's second structural adjustment credit (SAC II). The authorities remain Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - determined to continue reducing the share of nonconcessional debt, and have set prudent ceilings on contracting such debt over the period through end- June 1996. III. Policies for Sustainable Medium-Term Growth Projections for the medium term are predicated on the assumption that there will be a continuing adjustment to public sector finances to offset a forecast decline in official financing in the latter part of the current decade and to provide a more favorable macroeconomic environment for private sector development. More specifically, a central feature of the scenario is a rise in government savings derived initially from a.substantial turnaround in the primary balance of the government budget (1995/96-1996/97). Thereafter, a significant fall in domestic interest costs, brought about by a decline in government debt (as a percentage of GDP) and lower nominal interest rates, is projected to be the major factor contributing to the rise in government saving. The objective on the revenue front will be to stabilize the revenue effort while the process of expenditure adjustment is being consolidated with the help of the public expenditure review soon to be completed. As expenditure savings become firmly entrenched, modest declines in the revenue effort can be envisaged toward the end of the projection period. The improvement in government savings as well as increased savings in the public enterprise sector are projected to lead to a significant rise in national savings, from a current level of 13-14 percent of GDP to some.. 20 percent of GDP by the end of the decade (Chart 6 and Table 6). The growth prospects of the economy rest on the ability to channel the increased savings into higher and more productive domestic investment, particularly in the private sector. Improving the investment climate will be critical in this regard. A secure macroeconomic foundation will obviously be central in this task, as well as in bringing inflation down to single digits. Policy actions in other areas--for example, tariff reform, modernization of the system of indirect taxation, improved infrastructure, and implementation of the reform agenda proposed under the Cross Border Initiative (CBI)--will also play an important role in enhancing the economy's competitiveness and hence its attractiveness to investors. With respect to tariff and indirect tax reform, on which little progress has been achieved contrary to earlier program intentions, the staff proposed that the authorities rationalize the tariff structure, reduce the number of tariff bands to four, and implement a phased reduction in the maximum tariff rate to 25 percent, in order to establish, by late 1997, a tariff structure consistent with the CBI. I/ The staff further advised the authorities to implement the process of tariff reform within the context of a broader I/ Given the expected trade liberalization effort, the exchange rate will remain market determined, and it is assumed that financial policies will be tightened in the event of unanticipated sustained pressures in the exchange market.

The projections for private sector inves.tment gr,owth are relatively conservative in the proposed adjustment scenario, because they assume only a modest contribution from foreign savings to the financing.,of'private investment --private sector investment is projected to increase from about 15 percent of GDP in 1993-94 to some 17 percent of GDP by 2000. If the authorities manage to effect a convincing improvement in the investment climate, then increased private capital inflows might eventually ease the foreign savings constraint, raising private investment and the growth potential of the economy. The current account deficit of the balance of payments is projected to decline over the medium term from 4.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1997 and further, to near balance, by 2000. Export volumes in 1997 will be boosted by the Hartley platinum project, which comes on line; thereafter, export volume growth of about 6 percent annually derives especially from rapid development of the mining sector. Import volume growth is based on a unit income elasticity assumption over the medium term, with lower imports in 1997 due in part to an expected decline in project related imports. The capital account surplus is forecast to be much lower over the projection period than during the firs,t phase of the adjustment progr-, 'reflecting both a lower level of short-term'capital inflows as well as a significant decline in net official financing. External debt service obligations are projected to decline from 25.7 percent of exports of goods. and nonfactor services in 1994 to 17.4 percent by 2000, remaining within safe limits. A significant risk to the above-mentioned medium-term scenario would be a further drought in the wake of the drought of 1994-95, which increased food imports by an estimated US$160 million, caused a loss of agricultural exports of US$80 million, and dampened domestic income sufficiently to push the manufacturing sector into.recession. The impact of a second year of drought would likely be greater, and could even approach the cost of the devastating 1992 drought, estimated at US$l billion.. Such an outcome would obviously strain the balance of payments severely, compressing non-drought . imports and reserves. Given the openness of Zimbabwe's economy and its susceptibility to drought, it will be important for the authorities to rely on both an appropriate strategy for food security and a somewhat larger cushion of 'international reserves over the medium term. Zimbabwe is also highly sensitive to trends in world agriculture and mineral prices, although less so to variations in the price for any single export. lJ 1/ At the extreme, a 25 percent change in tobacco prices would reduce exports by US$llO million, or 6 percent.

Statistical Issues The staff-held extensive discussions on statistical issues with the authorities and other interested parties in Zimbabwe. The staff encouraged the authorities to address the institutional problems at the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and to expedite in particular the production of current data on national accounts and,foreign,trade. The staff highlighted the problems caused by-the lack of reconciiiation between fiscal, monetary, and balance'of payments data on the financing.of the budget, and reiterated the recommendation made by the Fund's recent technical assistance mission on expenditure control to,address the weaknesses in the organization and presentation.of -fiscal data. The staff welcomed the computerized colle,ction of raw data on external trade' and offered technical assistance for the regular production of ‘statistics in this area. L/ The staff worked closely with the authorities to develop a unified system of reporting monetary statistics to the Fund and encouraged the authorities to develop data series on weighted average interest rates and to extend the coverage of existing financial surveys to nonbank financial sector intermediaries: . . : v. Staff Annraisal' Zimbabwe is approaching the end of its five-year economic and structural adjustment program (ESAP)., launche.d'in 1991, and supported by the Fund since 1992 through parallel'arrangements under the EFF and ESAF.: Both arrangement.s expired in September 1995, with the fiscal and public enterprise programs at the end of fiscal year 1994/95 (July/June) seriously off track. Policy slippages in these areas not only compromised financial stability in Zimbabwe but largely-deprived the.private sector of the benefits of important structural reforms carried‘out during the past few years, making the ecotiomy all the more vulnerable to'the impact of the two recent droughts. Under these circumstances, and,'mindful of the conditions under which the last review of the program was‘completed in February 1995, the authorities recognized'the need to re-establish'a track record of solid performance relative to announced policies and targets. Accordingly, the authorities, assisted by the staff, 'put together a program of short-term stabilization measures, aimed in particular at fiscal consolidation. Against this background, the staff welcomes the Government's recent and prospective measures.in the budgetary and public enterprise areas, as they suggest a renewed commitment to reducing the budget deficit and to commercializing, and eventually privatizing, important public enterprises. The fiscal measures were calibrated to reduce the Government's primary balance for 1995/96 by about 3.5 percent of GDP relative to the outturn for I/ The authorities subsequently requested this assistance, and a technical assistance mission began work in Harare at end-January 1996.

The staff views this as an important target, but considers that more will need to be done soon: the budget deficit (before grants) in 1995/96 will still exceed 10 percent of GDP, and the domestic financing requirement, at more than 5 percent of GDP, leaves room only for stabilizing private sector credit in real terms. In view of its guarded judgment as to the adequacy of the present fiscal adjustment effort, the staff is all the more concerned that even the planned deficit reduction may not materialize if available indications of an overrun in the government wage bill of up to 0.9 percent of GDP are confirmed and the corrective measures that may eventually be adopted prove inadequate. With the possibility of further delays in program-related foreign financing for the budget, the domestic financing requirement for 1995/96 would rise to levels which would likely engender a substantial departure from the authorities' inflation, growth, and balance of payments objectives. The budgetary problems of recent years underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive review of the currently high level of public expenditures (40 percent of GDP). The staff welcomes the public expenditure'review launched in June with the assistance of the World Bank, and hopes that this work will permit a clear definition of priority functions of government within the limits of available resources and thus guide the authorities in making the necessary further cutbacks. The staff attaches great importance to the implementation of,the recommendations of a recent Fund technical assistance mission regarding improvements in budgetary procedures and the control of government expenditures, and encourages the authorities to rapidly develop a system to prevent a buildup of domestic arrears. The staff welcomes the recent government takeover of selected public enterprise debts as an important step toward greater financial autonomy for these enterprises. This debt relief and the recent increase in the price of maize--unavoidable under present supply conditions--should help the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) break even in 1995/96. The staff welcomes the establishment of a largely self-financing Strategic Grain Reserve Fund with a limited and transparent financial relationship to the Government and the remainder of the GMB. The staff also welcomes the GMB's intention to downsize and rationalize its operations. The-staff urges the authorities to act without delay on thei.r commitment to conunercialize and privatize public enterprises and, in particular, to adopt a strategy for the steel company ZISCO that minimizes the need for further budgetary support. The new practice of the Reserve Bank to issue periodic monetary policy statements is a positive move toward greater transparency and accountability. The staff considers the money supply target announced for 1995/96 as appropriate. The staff encourages the authorities to establish clear priorities among the objectives for monetary policy and, in particular, to subordinate the exchange rate objective of maintaining competitiveness to the pursuit of the inflation target through careful Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - adherence to the monetary anchor. At the same time, the authorities need to remain prepared to tighten monetary policy should the inflation objective be jeopardized by an unforeseen depreciation of the exchange rate. The staff is concerned that difficulties with nonperforming assets have led the authorities to relax statutory reserve requirements for two important state-owned banks. The staff urges the authorities to analyze the causes of these difficulties and to act decisively to prevent these problems from jeopardizing not only the monetary stance, but also the fiscal position and economic activity in general. In this context, the urgency of passing the revised banking legislation and enhancing the Reserve Bank's supervision capacity is all the more evident. The Government should also reconsider its preference for retaining with the Minister of Finance the authority to grant bank licenses, and combine instead the licensing and supervision authorities in the Reserve Bank. The staff stands ready to assist the Government in finding ways of strengthening its short-term stabilization program for the remainder of 1995/96. Looking ahead, the staff urges the authorities to continue the process of fiscal consolidation in next year's budget, to act on the findings of the public expenditure review, to begin in earnest the long- delayed reform of the indirect tax and tariff system, and to persist in reducing inflation. A strong record of policy implementation, coupled with the pursuit of this agenda, will be important in preparing the basis for a comprehensive program that could be supported by a new ESAF arrangement later in 1996. The staff recognizes the important progress made in the quality of budgetary and monetary data, but regrets that the data inconsistencies across sectors as well as continued serious gaps in national accounts and foreign trade data hamper economic and financial analysis as the basis for timely advice and appropriate policy decisions. In particular, the staff would encourage the authorities to address the institutional problems at the CSO and to expedite the reconciliation of the fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments data concerning the financing of the budget deficit. The staff welcomes the Government's adherence to a liberal foreign exchange system and, given the firm timetable established for the phased release of past blocked dividends and the winding down of existing forward exchange contracts, recommends temporary approval for the retention of the respective exchange restriction and multiple currency practice. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Fund takes this decision relating to Zimbabwe's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63) adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/96/18, Zimbabwe maintains an exchange restriction, subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a), arising from the blocking of dividend and profit payments accrued on investments made before May 1993; and a multiple currency practice, subject to Article VIII, Section 3, arising from existing contracts under the forward foreign exchange scheme of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The Fund welcomes the steps taken to eliminate the above restriction over a period of three years starting on July 1, 1995. The Fund also notes the authorities' decision to ;,..t discontinue, effective January 1, 1994, offering any new contracts under the forward foreign exchange cover scheme and to terminate that scheme by end- December 2001. In the meantime, the Fund grants approval for the retention of the exchange restriction and multiple currency practice until February 28, 1997, or the completion of the next Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe, whichever is earlier.

Article IV Consultations' Zimbabwe is on the standard 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on September 14, 1994 (EBM/94/84; SM/94/201). On that occasion, the Executive Board considered that the strengthening of fiscal policy and the acceleration of public enterprise reforms were prerequisites for Zimbabwe's return to.its t,argeted adjustment path and continuation of Fund support under the EFF and ESAF programs. Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation wer.2 held in Harare during June 18-29, 1995 and in Washington during October 13-21, 1995. The Zimbabwean representatives included Mr. A. Chambati, Minister of Finance (June discussions); Mr. HY Murerwa, Acting.Minister of Finance after Mr. Chambati's death.in Se.ptember 1995 (October discussions); Mr. L. .Tsumba, Governor,' Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe; Mr. C. Kuwaza, Senior Secretary of Finance; and other senior officials of the Government and the Reserve Bank as well as representatives of public enterprises and the private sector. The staff team for the Article IV consultation consisted of J. Reitmaier (head-AFR), E. Ibrahim (AFR), A. MacArthur (PDR), B. Clements (FAD), .B. Bi,ngham .(AFR), and V. Santiprabhob (AFR); the team was assisted by Mr. Cha, Senior Resident Representative in Zimbabwe and was joined for the discussions in Washington by Mr. M. Ellyne (AFR), Mr. L. Schuknecht (FAD), and Ms. A. Fedelino (AFR). IX. Last Review of Parallel Arrangements Under the EFF and ESAF... The,parallel arrangements under the EFF and ESAF expired on September 10, 1995. : They were last reviewed by the Executive Board on February 10, 1995 (EBM/95/14; EBS/95/1Q.and Supplement l).. In the context of this review,.the Executive Board approved quantitative and structural performance criteria for June 1995, as well as. quantitative and structural benchmarks.for March/April and June 1995. The outturn with respect to these performance criteria.and benchmarks. is shown in the attached Tables 1 and 2. X. Technical Assistance During the period March-June 1994, a LEG staff member visited Harare to assist the authorities in revising the Reserve Bank Act and the Banking Act. In March/April 1995, an FAD mission assisted the Ministry of Finance in improving the system of public expenditure control. In,April/May 1995, an STA mission assisted the Reserve Bank in harmonizing the reporting system of monetary statistics to the Fund. In early 1996, an STA mission will visit Harare to assist the authorities in improving foreign trade statistics, and an MAE mission will advise the Reserve Bank on monetary operations. XI.

In June 1992, the Bank,approved,.an IDA Credit of US$lSO million for an Emergency Drought Recovery and Mitiga.tion Project. A second structural adjustment credit (SAC) wasapproved in June 1993,, and became effective in December 1993. A third SAC:is.envisaged,for FY96. Sector Investment Programs: in November 1995, there were eight ongoing sector investment:projects in Zimbabwe; ,.Two of these (Highways II and Railways II) are inthe transport sector and focus'on reconstruction and rehabilitation. One (Urban II) deals with the supply of low-cost housing and related services in the country's major urban and economic centers. Two projects (Agricultural Credit and Export Promotion Project and Forest Resource Management Projec.t)support the reorientation of.agricultural services-towards the rural areas and forestry. Power III supports the upgrading of the Hwange station and provides assistance in improving the pe.rformance of the power . utility (ZESA). Family Health II focuses on family planning and the strengthening of ur%ban and rural health facilities while the,Sexually- Transmitted Infections Project aims at arresting the spread of STDs and iI& in Zimbabwe- and providing care for those already infected with the HIV virys. * . Planned support for investment projects include: a proposed export ,, facilitation project'(FY96); future operations in telecommunications (FY97) and power (FY98); .support to small-scale enterprises (FY96); an agricultura,l support program (FY96)'; a community/district development project (FY97) to develop infrastructure. and services; and a health sector project (FY98),to i increase the efficiency of resource use in the sector.

I/ The staff recognized several strengths of the database 'in Zimbabwe, notably the quality of the monetary data, the timeliness with which certain budgetary data are reported, and the wide range of surveys.conducted by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). u Important weaknesses in the statistical database and the institutional and technical problems that underlay them were also discussed. Critical statistical shortcomings identified by the staff were in the areas of national accounts, public finance, and external trade data. Many of the weaknesses in statistics in Zimbabwe can be traced to important institutional problems at the CSO. In part, the problems at the CSO are rooted in the significant expansion of the mandate of the CSO after independence, which was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in resources. s/ Since the mid-1980s, backlog of statistical compilation. the CSO has been struggling with a large Early in 1995, the problems of the CSO were compounded when most top management personnel was dismissed amidst allegations of improprieties, leaving the CSO with little senior management; seven out of nine senior posts became vacant, including those of the Director (filled in November 1995) and two Deputy Directors. A/ Staffing problems have also been reported at lower levels in the organization, and there has been a severe shortage of experienced staff. Resolution of critical institutional problems at the CSO wiil be needed befo.re more entrenched deficiencies in the database, particularly in the field of national accounts, can be resolved. 1/ The staff presented a note on statistical.issues, which was discussed at a meeting chaired by the National Economic Planning Commission and attended by several institutional providers and users of statistics in Zimbabwe. The mission also met with representatives of the Swedish International Development.Authority (SIDA), who have been providing significant support to the Central Statistical Office (CSO). 2/ The,Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) publishes quarterly and monthly bulletins containing monetary data, as well as some government finance, balance qf payments, and real sectordata. a/ The CSO was required to provide greater statistical coverage of the informal sector of the economy, especially coverage of activity in the communal farm areas. The CSO was also required to develop a wider range of statistics (for example, intra-Zimbabwe regional statistics, and data on environment and gender issues). &/. SIDA has provided substantial support to the CSO, over an extended period of time, the CSO. to strengthen the institutional and management capacity at The recent loss of senior managers has been a severe setback to. this capacity-building initiative.

Sizable revisions to national accounts data in the past, concerns that national accounts data are not adequately capturing the rise of small-scale enterprise production, and the use of an outdated 1980 base for constant price analysis have further diminished the usefulness of available national accounts data for policy analysis. A number of factors have contributed to the current weaknesses in national accounts data. The primary constraint would appear to be an acute shortage of human and physical resources in the national accounts section of the CSO, linked in part to wider institutional problems at the CSO. A thorough review of the current system of national accounts in Zimbabwe, prepared in 1994'with assistance by SIDA, concluded that the compilation of Zimbabwe's national accounts is essentially sound but that a lack of experienced staff, high staff turnover, and a shortage of complementary resources, have hindered the compilation of national accounts statistics. Currently, only two staff members in the national accounts section reportedly have any experience in the preparation of national accounts statistics. Other factors supposedly include delays in the preparation and rebasing (to 1990 prices) of data series used as inputs into the national accounts statistics and complications arising from the introduction of the new SNA classifications. The staff, recognizing the institutional difficulties at the CSO, urged the CSO to focus more efforts on the preparation of timely current statistics, rather than revisions to historical data series, and the need to prepare preliminary estimates using available data without waiting for the finalization of all relevant input series. Public finance The Government is to be commended for its timeliness in producing budget data IJ and for the broad coverage of expenditure data on sensitive areas such as defense. However, a number of key weaknesses in the current budget data impair the monitoring of fiscal developments, contributing in some instances to delays in the development of appropriate adjustment policies. The critical shortcoming of the existing budget data is that it is not possible to reconcile the fiscal, monetary, balance of payments, and debt data which pertain to the financing of the budget deficit. These problems give rise to some uncertainty about the quality of the budget data, as evidenced by the delays in fully incorporating foreign-financed outlays into the budget for 1994/95. L/ Monthly budget data are generally available within three-to-six weeks after the end of the month.

Furthermore, the technical assistance mission encouraged the authorities to develop more analytically sound publications for government accounts, to serve as a guide to government officials and policymakers, to facilitate appropriate debate in Parliament, and to inform the general public. The reporting.of fiscal.data to the Fund for publication is defunct. The most recent annual data available in the GFS Yearbook are budget estimates for 1991. No monthly or quarterly data are reported for publication in IFS. The staff raised concerns about the lapse in the reporting of government finance data to the Fund. The development of a more appropriate presentation of fiscal data would assist the authorities in addressing the lapse in reporting. External trade The lack of timely trade statistics was also discussed during the consultations; the staff were concerned that analysis of the balance of payments was weak in the absence of timely trade data. I/ The staff were encouraged by reports of the positive impact of the new ASYCUDA system, that had been installed in the customs department. The staff were informed that the system could potentially make trade data available to the CSO within seven days after the end of each month. The CSO reported that the computerization of customs data had greatly enhanced the ability of the CSO to process trade data and that they were making significant progress toward eliminating the trade data backlog that had built up under the old manual reporting system. The objective of the CSO was to provide trade data within one month after the end of the reference period. Technical assistance from the Fund was recently requested by the authorities, and a mission in trade statigtics to assist with the actual production and further development of external trade statistics is scheduled for early 1996. In February 1995, a seminar on balance of payments statistics was held in Harare in collaboration with the RBZ. lJ Existing balance of payments estimates are based on customs department trade data up to December 1993. The CSO informed the staff that data were now available up to March.1994.

The mission underscored the staff's need to receive some infor- mation more frequently than the monthly frequency of financial data published in IFS. The mission also encouraged the authorities to develop and report to the Fund data series on weighted average interest rates on instruments representing significant amounts in the bank balance sheets. As a result of the mission's activities and the cooperation of all parties, a unified system of reporting monthly monetary data to the Fund has been in place since September 1995. I/ Previously, separate formats had been used for program monitoring and reporting of monetary data to IFS.
