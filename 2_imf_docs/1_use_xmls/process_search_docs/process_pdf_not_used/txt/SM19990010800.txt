EU membership in 1995 marked a watershed in Austrian macroeconomic policy orientation: first-round euro participation became the overarching economic policy objective and fiscal consolidation and flexible labor and product markets moved to centerstage in economic policy making. A two-year fiscal consolidation program was developed to redress an unsustainable fiscal situation and reduce the fiscal deficit to below the 3 percent of GDP Maastricht reference value by 1997 (Figures 1 and 2). At the same time, structural reform (including privatization and external trade liberalization) spurred strong productivity growth, which-combined with restrained income policies-resulted in a significant improvement in relative unit labor costs (Figures 3 and 4). Austria also benefited from its proximity to the fast growing markets in Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), which provided an increasingly important outlet for Austrian goods and management skills. Thus, as a result of the change in macroeconomic policies and strong export growth, the widening current account deficit stabilized and returned to a decreasing trend. 2. At the conclusion of last year’s consultation, Directors expressed their satisfaction with Austria’s improved economic performance and its qualification for first-round euro participation. They commended the authorities for the successful implementation of their two-year fiscal consolidation program, noting that the skil1fi.d social balance of the package and its emphasis on expenditure reduction had buttressed confidence. At the same time, however, they stressed that further fiscal consolidation, wage restraint, and structural reform should be pursued resolutely in the period ahead in order to capitalize on a promising economic environment. 3. Although the external environment worsened for Austria after the Russian default in August 1998, real GDP expanded by 3.3 percent in 1998, significantly faster than expected at the beginning of the year, as domestic demand replaced exports as the main engine of growth. The external sector’s contribution to output growth fell in the second half of 1998 as the Russian crisis slowed the expansion in Austria’s principal export markets in the EU and the CEECs. Domestic demand, however, remained buoyant: investment in machinery and equipment responded to higher profit margins, brought on by improved cost competitiveness and lower long-term interest rates (see Figure 4) and private consumption benefited from a strong recovery in real disposable income (Figure 5)-reflecting, inter alia, increased employment, faster wage growth, and a less restrictive fiscal stance. The current account deficit is estimated to have declined to 2.1 percent of GDP, mainly as a result of marked improvements in the tourism balance and the terms of trade (Figure 6). 4. The recent, externally induced slowdown is expected to be temporary and real GDP should increase by some 2 percent in 1999 as exports are likely to recover in the second half of the year. Domestic demand should be supported by robust private consumption, which has remained unaffected by the slowdown in exports. Although restrained in the first half of this year, the rate of expansion of investment in machinery and equipment, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicII5 110 105 100 95 90 85 80 - -4- Figure 1.

Under this baseline scenario, in which global risks are contained, the output gap would widen only marginally to % percent of GDP in 1999, while GDP growth would revert to its potential (some Z1% percent) in 2000. The outlook for the current account depends mainly on developments in Austria’s export markets and tourism: in the baseline scenario, the current account deficit should narrow to 1% percent of GDP in 2000.’ With GDP growth of 2.2 percent for 1999 and 2.6 percent in 2000, the authorities’ projection (completed in late March 1998) differs from the staff projection mainly by its slightly more upbeat outlook on export market growth, particularly in Germany. 5. Despite very recent indications of economic recovery in Asia and Europe, the risks to the staffs baseline scenario remain on the downside. If the recovery in Austria’s main export markets were significantly delayed and the situation in world financial markets were to worsen, the weakening of the leading indicators that began in the second half of 1998 would likely continue and recessionary forces would intensify (Figure 7). Notably, any prolongation of the current slump in major export markets could dent domestic demand through a sharp reduction of fixed investment and a deterioration in consumer confidence and labor market conditions (which, in turn, would depress private consumption). Furthermore, the expected turnaround in the CEECs could be delayed, for example, as a result of a delay in the process of EU enlargement or persistence of the Kosovo crisis. 6. Despite a continuous-but small-increase over the last decade as a result of industrial restructuring and labor shedding, Austria’s EU standardized unemployment rate, at 4% percent in 1998, remains one of the lowest in the EU. Meanwhile, unfilled vacancies and employment have started to increase since 1997. There was a sharp expansion in part-time employment, which to a large extent was triggered by an effective shortening of maternity leave, longer shopping hours, and more flexible work arrangements (Figures 8 and 9). As these jobs were mainly filled by new entrants to the labor force, the unemployment rate did not fall. Job creation was mainly concentrated in the private service sector and in construction, whereas government and manufacturing employment remained constant. The prospects are for a tirther small reduction in the standardized unemployment rate as the participation rate stabilizes by 2000. However, without major structural reforms it will be difficult for the standardized unemployment rate to fall to 3% percent by 2002, as targeted in the National Employment Action Plan. 7. As in other EU countries, headline inflation in 1998 reflected the sharp fall in energy and other commodity prices. While the direct effect from lower energy prices on the consumer price index-reflecting mainly lower oil prices-amounted only to ‘/* of ‘The deficit is projected to narrow somewhat further over the medium term, bringing it back into line with the nearly balanced position that the CGER analysis regards as the appropriate medium-term saving-investment norm for Austria.

In addition, Austria’s inflation performance appears to benefit from a delayed adjustment to EU membership: more intensive competition in both manufacturing and, increasingly, the service sector has caused the previously high retail price level to converge toward the EU average (Figure 11). With recent settlements indicating a modest acceleration of wages, the decline in unit labor costs is likely to abate in 1999-2000.* Despite the likely return of headline inflation to above 1 percent once commodity prices cease to fall or return to more recent levels, intlationary pressures should remain subdued as moderate domestic demand, further market liberalization, and eventual EU enlargement can be expected to contain the general increase in prices in the medium term. 8. After two years of sharp fiscal retrenchment-amounting to some 3% percentage points of GDP-in an all-out effort to qualify for euro participation, the general government deficit widened again in 1998, reflecting the return to a slightly expansionary fiscal stance (Figure 12). Notwithstanding faster economic growth and lower interest payments, the general government deficit increased from 1.9 percent of GDP in 1997 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 1998 (Figure 13), with a substantially larger (1% percentage points) deterioration in the primary structural balance. Theincreased deficit reflected, inter alia, the execution of local investment projects that had been postponed in 1997 and the expiration of other one-off measures under the 199697 fiscal consolidation package.’ The provisional estimate for 1998 is based on a preliminary federal government deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP and the projection of a 0.4 percent of GDP surplus for other general government sectors, down from a surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP in 1997. The public debt to GDP ratio declined to 63.2 percent as debt reduction with privatization proceeds, a primary surplus, and improved debt dynamics (higher economic growth cum lower interest rates) more than offset adverse valuation effects (mainly the appreciation of the domestic currency value of yen-denominated public debt). - 9. The authorities project the general government. deficit to improve slightly to 2.0 percent of GDP in 1999, as savings from lower interest payments are expected to outweigh a shortfall (relative to budget) in tax revenue due to slower economic growth. A package of measures- including slower growth in expenditure on civil servants and purchases of goods and services-should compensate for the budgetary burden of the government’s overly generous response to a ruling by the constitutional court on family ?For instance, the leading metal workers union obtained a 2.9 percent increase in November 1998, compared with 2.1 percent one year earlier.

The lower levels of government are expected to increase their surplus to l/z percent of GDP. Marginally positive debt dynamics and privatization proceeds should allow the public debt ratio to decrease to 62.9 percent of GDP. 10. Monetary and financial conditions have eased with the decreases of the ECB’s repo rate in December 1998 and April 1999 and the depreciation of the euro so far this year (see Figure 12). Furthermore, the yield curve has flattened and there is no evidence that economic activity is hampered by either the availability or the cost of credit. Short-term interest rates remained closely linked to German rates-unsurprisingly after two decades of de facto currency union with Germany. However, the long-term interest rate differential with Germany widened slightly in the wake of the Asian and Russian crises-reflecting capital flight to the more liquid German bond market-but subsequently it narrowed again to about 15 basis points (Figures 14-16). While domestic bank credit grew modestly, its foreign currency component rose by more than 50 percent to 12 percent of total credit as borrowers reacted to the large interest differential between loans in schillings (or euro) and Swiss francs or Japanese yen. The growth of monetary aggregates (in particular, sight deposits) picked up toward the end of the year, reflecting in part a switch out of foreign currency deposits (which are not included in monetary aggregates) as the introduction of the euro eliminated the need for holding deposits in the currencies of other euro participants. II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 11. The policy discussions took place at a time when it had become clear that the pace of economic expansion was slowing under the impact of weakening activity abroad. While there was no doubt that the contribution of external demand to output growth would be lower in 1999, the authorities remained confident that business sentiment would recover and reinforce the still buoyant consumer confidence to boost domestic demand. A strong domestic economy, with falling unemployment, was seen by the authorities as all but guaranteeing the continuation of the long-ruling coalition between the social-democratic SPG and the conservative GVP after national elections later this year, notwithstanding a strong showing of the populist FPG in regional elections in March. With elections looming,4 the authorities’ economic policy agenda was limited to reaching agreement on a tax reform package and a few structural measures to reduce unemployment, strengthen the competition law, and streamline the approval of investment projects. Nonetheless, given the likelihood that the coalition would be renewed after the election, the authorities were receptive to extending the policy horizon beyond the end of this year. 4An October 3 election date was announced jointly with the agreement on tax reform at the conclusion of the mission.

Euro participation did not change much in a country that has long lived with an exogenously set monetary policy, and therefore the substance of the policy discussions was little changed from earlier consultations. As before, the staff reviewed with the authorities the appropriateness of a-largely outside-determined monetary stance for domestic economic conditions while directing the thrust of its analysis and policy advice to the adjustments in domestically determined policy settings, especially in the fiscal and structural areas, that would help further the authorities’ macroeconomic objectives under prevailing monetary conditions. A. Monetary Conditions and the Macroeconomic Policy Mix 13. The authorities noted that monetary conditions had eased considerably since the Russian default in 1998 and that there was no evidence that economic activity was hampered by either availability or cost of credit. With consumer confidence high and tentative signs of a rebound in business sentiment, they expected domestic demand to strengthen further, offsetting much of the contractionary impact of weakening external demand. Output was therefore likely to grow in line with potential. In such conditions, the authorities saw no need for lower interest rates from a purely domestic perspective. Should, however, the ECB, in the pursuit of its euro-area wide mandate, find it appropriate to lower interest rates, the authorities concurred with the staff that such a move would present an opportunity to reassess the composition of the domestic policy mix. 14. The staff took the position that after several years of above-average growth, the . output gap in Austria was likely to have narrowed sharply (and be smaller than in its most important euro area trading partners), implying that unemployment could not be reduced significantly through demand expansion.’ This suggested, in the staffs view, that an eventual easing of the ECB’s monetary stance should be met with a concurrent tightening of fiscal and incomes policies. In this connection, the social partners should guard against an erosion of the gains in relative unit labor costs achieved in recent years. Although not fully convinced of the applicability of output gap analysis in highly integrated economies,6 both the staff and the authorities considered that the preponderance of quantitative evidence suggested that Austria was cyclically more advanced than the average of euro participants. To that extent, any further monetary easing-as indeed happened subsequently in April-would indeed make a stronger case for compensatory tightening in Austria. 15. The authorities expected both cyclical conditions and the transmission mechanism for monetary impulses in the euro area to converge over time. The progressive strengthening of economic and financial ties with Germany in recent decades had 5StafI’calculations indicate Austria’s output to be 0.7 percent below potential in 1999, compared with 2.1 percent for the EU as a whole. 6The absence of inflationary and significant wage pressures indicated that domestic producers of tradables had easy recourse to capacity elsewhere in the EU and the CEECs.

Although a disproportionately high-but recently falling-share of Austrian bank credits was at variable rates,’ the high share of self-financing and correspondingly low degree of indebtedness were thought to slow (and weaken) the effect of monetary impulses on economic activity in Austria. To strengthen monetary transmission links, the mission suggested reducing subsidized lending (especially for housing) and ensuring that bank borrowing in non-euro currencies was based on proper risk assessment. In this context, the mission noted the sharp increase in Swiss franc and yen borrowing by households and small businesses, and expressed its concern about the implied increase in credit risk for bank portfolios and the growing vulnerability of private consumption, if these low-interest currencies were to appreciate significantly against the euro. B. Fiscal Policy 16. The fiscal authorities judged that the appropriate medium-term fiscal norm for Austria was a general government deficit of a little more than 1 percent of GDP. A deficit of that size would leave enough room for the automatic stabilizers to operate fully in a downturn without breaking the 3 percent of GDP limit under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). For this reason,‘they had adopted a stability program that aimed at reducing the deficit gradually to 1.4 percent of GDP by 2002, using a comparatively conservative growth assumption of 2’% percent a year. The mission considered this objective insufficiently ambitious, recommending a faster convergence to structural balance or a small surplus instead. It saw sound economic reasons for such an objective: (i) slower growth had worsened the underlying debt dynamics so that a primary surplus of about 2 percent of GDP might not be sufficient to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio,’ and (ii) additional margin might be needed for discretionary fiscal action to reinforce the play of the automatic stabilizers in the event of adverse exogenous shocks, especially Austro-specific ones, which are unlikely to be addressed by euro-area wide monetary measures. A stronger fiscal position, characterized by fiscal balance and a low debt ratio, would also lead to lower financing costs for the entire economy and prepare the country for the fiscal burden of population aging. 17. Apart from lacking ambition, the mission felt that the authorities’ stability program was subject to a number of risks. The program’s assumption of slightly above- potential growth for the entire period had already been challenged by the current slowdown, and a future rise in-interest rates-although not apparent at this juncture-would put in 7The authorities attributed the decline in the share of variable-rate credits from 76 percent in 1995 to 69 percent in 1998 to growing expectations of borrowers that the bottom of the interest rate cycle had been reached. *Even at today’s low interest rates, interest payments still amount to almost 4 percent of GDP, absorbing every sixth euro in taxes collected at the federal level. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - question the assumed steady fall in interest payments.g In this connection, the mission noted that improved growth prospects might prompt the ECB to raise its repo rate in the fbture and that Austria’s risk premium depended significantly on the situation in the CEECs. The greatest risk, however, seemed to be the program’s reliance on a continued surplus of ‘A percent of GDP at the lower levels of government. The internal stability pact, concluded in 1998 among the three levels of government to apportion eventual penalties for a breach of the SGP’s 3 percent of GDP deficit limit, allowed the lower levels a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP without incurring the risk of penalties. The tax reform adopted at the end of the mission’s stay was estimated to have a revenue cost to the lower levels of government of 0.35 percent of GDP. Under the Maastricht accounting convention, a similar deterioration of their fiscal balance could result if more Lander decided to stimulate housing construction with outright subsidies instead of low-interest loans. The authorities agreed that there were indeed some risks, but discretionary measures at the federal level would be taken as needed to keep the fiscal adjustment on track and internal coordination among the three levels of government would be strengthened. 18. Given the still high expenditure ratio” and their favorable experience with the mainly expenditure based 1996-97 consolidation package, the authorities concurred that fiscal adjustment should primarily rely on durable expenditure cuts. For any given adjustment objective, additional cuts would be needed to create room for tax reductions on iabor, as the mere shifting of the tax burden from labor to capital or energy resources was unlikely to lead to significant employment effects. Finally, tirther cuts in current expenditure would be required to allow a modest increase in public investment. Because of the proximity of the elections, the authorities did not advance any concrete plans for cutting expenditure,” but the mission repeated past suggestions to examine expenditure areas such as social transfers, subsidies (especially for housing), transfers to enterprises, and current expenditures on goods and services, where expenditure ratios exceed the EU average by X-2 percentage points of GDP. ‘The stability program of November 1998 assumes a reduction in the average interest rate on government debt from 6.1 percent in 1999 to 5.7 percent in 2001-02. The staffs alternative scenario uses similar assumptions. “Austria’s general government expenditure in relation to GDP was the third highest (afier France and Italy) among the non-Nordic EU countries in 1998. “On the contrary, by offering higher starting salaries for untenured state employees, the planned civil service reform may initially raise the wage bill.

Potential output was assumed to grow by 0.2 percentage point faster in 1999-200 1. 19. After the 199697 consolidation effort the authorities felt that a pause in the adjustment effort was needed in 1998-99. In-their view, the deterioration of the structural balance by ‘/2 percent of GDP in 1998 had been more apparent than real because the improvement in 1997 was partly based on temporary measures which the government had been unable to replace with permanent ones in the 1998 budget. Also, there had been some need to raise spending on education and internal security, the latter mainly in connection with enforcing the EU’s Schengen agreement. It had been the authorities’ judgment that social peace should not be jeopardized by pressing ahead with further structural measures at this Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - time. Nonetheless, the 1998 deficit had turned out to be slightly lower than budgeted and budget execution so far indicated that the 1999 budget deficit would be respected, notwithstanding much increased family benefits. 20. The mission expressed its disappointment about the authorities’ inability to find permanent replacements for the temporary measures in the 1996-97 consolidation package. It also regretted the lack of response of the overall deficit to the much faster than anticipated rate of growth in 1998. For 1999, the situation would be the reverse: economic growth would be below the budget assumption (2 percent versus 2.8 percent) and there would be pressure for the deficit to widen, especially if the downside risks to the mission’s growth forecast were to materialize. In these conditions, the authorities should take compensatory measures and defend their deficit target, unless growth fell substantially below 2 percent. Even then, prudence would suggest to let the automatic stabilizers operate only partially, to preserve room for them to play if the slowdown extended beyond 1999, and to rely instead on monetary and exchange rate stimulus. The authorities were confident that a widening of the deficit could be avoided: the cyclical impact on tax collections would remain small as long as the slowdown was limited to exports and the budget contained a small amount of “reserves.” Moreover, election-motivated spending initiatives would cease with the electoral recess of parliament. 21. Notwithstanding the revenue loss associated with the 1999 tax reform package, the authorities were confident that a 2000 budget meeting the objectives of the stability program could be put together. More than one third of the tax relief (the share corresponding to the enhancements of family benefits) had already been taken account of in the stability program submitted to the EU in late 1998. With most of the additional relief from the tax reform (Box 1) likely to stimulate private consumption and output growth, there would also be positive revenue effects. The coalition partners were in agreement that there would be no tax increase and that expenditure should expand by less than nominal GDP growth; by deciding on tax relief up front, pressure had been created to identity the expenditure cuts required to comply with the deficit objective of the stability program. Notwithstanding these assurances, the mission expressed its concern about the vulnerability of the fiscal position in 2000: failure of the expected recovery to materialize might necessitate substantial procyclical action to avoid breaching the 3 percent of GDP deficit limit in 2000. Moreover, although it agreed that the tax system was generally efIicient,12 the mission regretted that the opportunity had been missed to remove distortions in the income tax by broadening its base, which would have allowed to reduce tax rates further. 12See for example, OECD Economic Survey, 1998.

The Tax Reform Package Initially conceived as an attempt to shift the burden of taxation from labor to capital and energy, the tax reform compromise adopted in March 1999 represents almost pure tax relief, except for the doubling of the tax rate on the income of noncharitable foundations (Stifhtngen) to 5 percent. To raise taxation on capital and energy, the authorities have come to prefer a harmonized approach at the EU level. The net revenue loss from the tax reform to the 2000 budget, including 0.4-0.5 percent of GDP in family benefit enhancements (half of which took effect already in 1999), is as follows: S billion In percent of GDP Family benefits (increased allowances, higher deductions) 12.0 0.43 Income tax reduction (lower tax rates, higher deductions) 17.0 0.60 Tax relief for agriculture 1.2 0.04 Lower taxation of business capital increases 0.5 0.02 Tax incentives for private pensions 0.5 0.02 Tax breaks for research and development 0.5 0.02 Increased deduction for apprentices 0.5 0.02 Other, net (higher deductions for ownership transfers of - companies, higher taxes on Stiftungen, etc.) l/ 0.3 0.01 Total (net) 32.5 1.16 As the bulk of the taxes affected are subject to revenue sharing, it is estimated that about 30 percent of the revenue loss will%e borne by the budgets of the lower levels of government. l! Also includes the net effect of eliminating the securities transfer tax (Bbrsenumsatzsteuer), raising the exemption limit for taxing capital gains on securities from one to two years, and the deduction of a notional return on equity from taxable profits. 22. Renegotiating the revenue sharing agreement and simplifying the system of intergovernmental transfers were the authorities’ fiscal priorities for 2000. The 1996-2000 revenue sharing agreement had favored the lower levels of government and a recently agreed consultation mechanism prevented the federal government from clawing back its concessions by shifting expenditure to the lower levels of government without adequate financial compensation. Intergovernmental transfers amounted to 10 percent of GDP and it was estimated that an amount equivalent to about 0.4 percent of GDP could be saved by a reform of the system. The mission supported these initiatives, suggesting that establishing a better match between tasks and own tax sources at each level of government, with limited autonomy to vary tax rates at the regional and local levels, would redress the vertical imbalance in intergovernmental finances. Thus, the municipalities could give up the payroll tax-itself an impediment to employment-in exchange for a revamped real estate tax. The opportunity of reordering the intergovernmental fiscal relations should be used to eliminate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - revenue earmarking; which had led to ever growing spending on subsidized housing and families, and to address horizontal imbalances between the (surplus) western and (deficit) eastern Lgnder. Finally, short of a comprehensive reform, economies could be obtained if the federal government ceased to reimburse the Lander for their spending on primary school teachers, road maintenance, and the administration of federal laws (so-called indirect federal administration).13 23. The authorities were aware of the need for further incremental reforms of the pension and health care systems to address the effects of population aging. For the time being, the pension and health care tinds were in balance, thanks to employment and wage growth and past reform efforts (e.g., the recent hospital reform with performance based reimbursements and ceilings on financing and the 1997 pension reform,14 which was scheduled to be phased in from 2000). A correction of the replacement rate for pensions by half of the increase in life expectancies would be implemented next year. l5 Health care costs would be kept in check by jawboning to restrain price increases for medicines and by efficiency gains from the introduction in late 2001 of an electronic chipcard for each beneficiary. The mission suggested that, in order to avoid raising labor costs, fiture reforms of both systems should aim at maintaining financial balance primarily by measures on the benefits side. With respect to pensions, reforms should aim at removing remaining incentives for early retirement, increasing the statutory retirement age, till actuarial reduction in pension payments to match increases in longevity, and inflation (rather than wage) indexation of benefits. Fiscal transparency-and with it awareness of the need for finther reform-could be enhanced by making public actuarial calculations by an independent source of the public pension system’s financial position (including the pensions of civil servants). l6 With respect to public health care, 13The mission suggested in this context that the government engage in a self-assessment of its compliance with the Fund’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency. 14The Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs estimated that the 1997 pension reform would reduce the payments of the employee and self-employment schemes by 1.5 percentage points of GDP by 2030. In addition, budget transfers to the pension fund for federal civil servants would fall by around 0.1 percentage point of GDP. In the absence of the 1997 pension reform package, pension otitlays (excluding the civil servant pension scheme) would have risen by 3.6 percentage points from IO.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 14 percent of GDP in 2030. “The measure, which was estimated to produce two thirds of the savings from the 1997 pension reform, hadbeen left in abeyance because its implementation, together with the low wage increases in 1997-98, would have led to negative pension adjustments in 1998-99. 16At 4 percent of GDP, civil servant pensions amounted to more than one quarter of all public pensions in 1998. Long-term projections of the financial position of the civil servant pension (continued.. .)

C. Labor and Product Market Policies 24. Recent gains in competitiveness, which had led to rapid export growth and record inflows of direct foreign investment,” were seen by the authorities as evidence that their tenacious pursuit of consensus-based incremental reforms was bearing fruit (Box 2). Far from inviting complacency, the positive response of the economy provided, in their view, encouragement to press ahead with further reforms. Because of the approaching elections, the present government would, however, have to limit itself to a few priority areas (see below). Box 2. Recent Labor and Product Market Reforms Recent measures to improve the functioning of markets include a tightening of eligibility criteria for early retirement and unemployment benefits; a relaxation of restrictions on working hours and shop opening hours; the introduction of incentives for the employment of older workers; more child care facilities; greater use of active Iabor market programs (e.g., to upgrade skills and encourage self- employment); the modemization of the apprenticeship system and of regulations governing the crafts and trades; the introduction of options in collective agreements allowing performance-based wage increases and their active use at the enterprise level; liberalization of the telecommunications and ’ electricity markets; partial privatization of Telekom Austria; and restructuring and privatization of banking. 25. Although low by European standards, unemployment was an important political’ issue in Austria: not only had it edged up since EU membership in 1995 (Box 3), but anxieties in the population were fanned by exceedingly large labor flows, with almost one-quarter of the dependent labor force exposed to unemployment or job change each year.18 While this number might be inflated by the high incidence of seasonal employment in Austria, ‘6(...continued) system are not available. “The ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP rose from 38.7 percent in 1995 to 43.9 percent in 1998, while inward direct foreign investment rose from 0.8 percent to 2.7 percent of GDP. Inquiries from foreign investors had surged further after the German elections in the fall of 1998. “Thus, the authorities attributed the sustained fall in sick leave more to job insecurity than to the introduction of a fee for consulting a physician. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- it certainly reflected the rapid pace of restructuring in the economy. Thus, to maintain support for globalization as well as EU integration and enlargement, policymakers in Austria had to give particular priority to labor market issues. On the positive side, more than half of the National Employment Action Plan’s objective of increasing employment by 3 percent by 2002 was likely to be achieved by the end of this year. By contrast, with the surprising elasticity of labor supply, the simultaneous reduction of the standardized unemployment rate to 3% percent would be more difficult to attain. Encouraged by success with active labor market measures in virtually eliminating youth unemployment, the authorities planned increased use of measures targeted at the disproportionate share of older workers and at the long-term unemployed. Box 3. Unemployment Dynamics Despite uninterrupted GDP growth, the unemployment rate has increased by a little more than % percentage point since 1994, mainly because of enterprise restructuring and its impact on labor shedding and productivity growth. In particular: . With EU accession, enterprise restructuring intensified in 1995-96, leading to layoffs and productivity growth (defined as changes in the ratio of real GDP to employment) in excess of GDP growth. The effect of these two factors on unemployment-l percentage point in 1995-96was only partially offset by a reduction in the labor force as early retirement schemes reduced the participation rate (see Figure 8). . More liberal working-time arrangements raised again the participation rate (especially among those seeking part-time employment), putting upward pressure on unemployment in 1997-98. The tightening of early retirement criteria and parental leave entitlements reinforced the effect on unemployment, which would have risen by 1 percentage point in 1997-98 had the reforms no1 contributed to an excess of GDP growth over productivity growth of a similar magnitude. . Productivity growth is expected to slow in 1999-2000 (due to diminishing marginal benefits from restructuring), allowing GDP growth to result in a small reduction in unemployment. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 (In percent of dependent employment) Change in the unemploymentrate 0.0 0.5 0.1 0.0 0.0 -0.1 Contribution of labor force -0.3 -0.2 0.3 0.7 0.7 0.5 Contribution of employment 0.3 0.7 -0.2 -0.7 -0.7 -0.6 Productivity growth 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.5 1.3 1.9 Real GDP growth -2.1 -1.6 -2.5 -3.2 -2.0 -2.5 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - 26. The mission suggested reducing further restrictive work practices that bloat labor costs and inhibit employment growth and encouraging genuine opening clauses in sectoral wage agreements in order to allow greater wage differentiation at the enterprise level. To promote working-time flexibility and lower labor costs, the mission also recommended easing job security provisions and restrictions on fixed-term contracts and part-time employment, increasing thresholds beyond which overtime premia have to be paid, and further relaxing occupational restrictions on working time. In the mission’s view, measures should also be taken to lower unemployment benefits to seasonal workers in the tourist industry and, more generally, to reduce the distortions arising from unemployment insurance and related taxes and benefits with the aim of stimulating job search and work effort (especially in sectors with high incidence of seasonal unemployment), and eliminating unemployment traps, particularly for older workers. 27. The authorities’ explained that, in the product markets, progress was being made on several fronts. Falling prices of telecommunications and electricity-until recently the highest in the EU-were boosting competitiveness and purchasing power. The telecommunications sector now featured several suppliers for both mobile and fixed-line phone services (including foreign-controlled ones) and the public treasury had benefited from the partial privatization of Telekom Austria and the auctioning of mobile phone licences. The electricity sector had been partially opened to EU-competition in February 1999. As the market would be opened further in line with EU regulations, solutions needed to be found for access to the distribution grid and the-at least partial-compensation for stranded costs.19 More generally, despite a recent setback, the authorities would make another effort to strengthen competition with the establishment of an independent antitrust authority with a clear mandate and powers to initiate investigations. Further privatization (e.g., of the postal savings bank or in the electricity sector) would also strengthen competition, but the authorities resisted suggestions to reduce state participation in a large spectrum of companies below 25 percent, maintaining that a significant minority stake was necessary to keep headquarters functions, research and development, and marketing in Austria. Notwithstanding some setbacks, the present government was determined to simplify administrative procedures by implementing a time- bound one-step procedure for approving investment projects and licensing new enterprises (Anlagenrecht). The government would continue to encourage entrepreneurship and research and development. By contrast, easing financial barriers to entry*’ and access to certain professions would be left to the next government. “These are as yet unamortized costs of capital investment that are unlikely to be recovered in a liberalized environment. *‘According to the OECD, the minimum capital requirements for a limited liability company are three times higher than the OECD average and administrative requirements for registering a new company are more complex than in most OECD countries.

The supervisory authorities judged that the banking system was sound. Despite large losses in emerging markets (especially Russia), the capital adequacy ratios remained high, although the dissolution of “hidden reserves” had weakened the banking system.*l The banking system reported increased profits in 1998 as higher income from securities and participations (including capital gains from the sale or revaluation of undervalued assets), fees and commissions more than compensated for lower net interest income, higher operating costs, and loan-loss write-offs.** The recent bankruptcy of two small banks had been the result of fraud and could not be taken as an indication of the soundness of other banks. Given the large size of foreign exchange borrowing by households and small companies-12 percent of all outstanding bank loans-and its rapid increase-more than 50 percent in 1998-the mission expressed concern about the increasing credit risk in bank portfolios, if the currencies concerned (Swiss franc and yen) were to appreciate sharply against the euro.= The supervisory authorities said that the banks were adequately covered against foreign exchange risk and considered that banks’ credit risk from the foreign currency exposure of households and companies did not pose a prudential problem, since most of the loans were sufficiently collateralized.24 29. By allowing the saving banks to convert into noncharitable foundations (Privutstiftungen), the new saving bank law was intended to align the ownership structure of saving banks to international practice and was expected to reduce political influence on the part of the saving banking sector that is owned and controlled by the municipalities “Moody’s recently downgraded the stand-alone rating (“financial strength”) of Bank Austria (the largest bank) and Raiffeisen Zentralbank (the third largest bank) from C+ to C on account of their exposure to Russia and Asia. **In December 1998, the aggregate capital adequacy ratio was 13 % percent, of which 73 per- cent was core capital. “Hidden reserves” were estimated to amount to some 3 percent of risk- adjusted assets. Non-performing loans amounted to 2.2 percent of total assets by end-1997, while loans considered to be at risk constituted 3.6 percent of all loans. The supervisory authorities could, however, not provide data on the total loan losses to Russia. 23The loans, which were mainly extended to households and small enterprises, typically have rollover dates every 3-12 months (at which point they can be converted into euros). 24The OeNB has since then admonished the banks to warn their clients about the currency risk. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - (Gemeinde.sparkzxsen).** In addition, no new public guarantees on saving bank borrowing would be issued for the banks converted to the new legal status. The mission noted that the new saving bank law could slow mergers and acquisitions with banks outside the saving bank sector because of a provision that gives the right of first refLsa1 to other saving banks, in particular to Erste Bank, Austria’s second largest bank. 30. The introduction of the euro had proceeded smoothly for most banks. Bank officials and the OeNB agreed that the introduction of the euro had not posed any operational problems. Moreover, the bank officials did not expect any significant increase in competition from foreign banks as a result of the introduction of the euro; instead; the banks had established cooperative networks with foreign partners. The recent consolidation in the Austrian banking sector (e.g., the acquisition of Creditanstalt by Bank Austria and the merger of Erste with Girocredit) had reduced costs to only a limited degree, but more rapid efficiency gains were expected in the coming years. 31. The experience with the closing of the two small banks had triggered an overall review of supervisory practices. In particular, the authorities saw a need to strengthen the legal instruments available to supervisors (including unannounced on-site inspections and greater personal immunity of the supervisory staff). The current system of shared bank supervision between the Ministry of Finance and the OeNB (with the latter carrying out on- site inspections) was under review, with a potential transfer of all bank supervision fimctions to an independent directorate of the OeNB.26 E. Other Issues 32. Representatives from the industrialists’ association expressed concern about smaller enterprises’ readiness for Y2K, as they had underestimated the problem and had been slow to take corrective action. Stress tests had been conducted on the electricity grid and the internal routines in the ministries. The monetary authorities had asked external auditors to report on the preparedness of the banking sector by end-April. 33. The authorities reported that disbursements of official development assistance had decreased from 0.26 percent of GNP in 1997 to 0.25 percent of GNP in 1998, compared with a 1998 average of 0..22 percent of GNP for the Development Assistance Committee countries. Within that total, the share of multilateral assistance had declined slightly fi-om 42 percent in 1997 to 4 1 ‘/z percent in 1998 while bilateral assistance, concentrated on a few focus countries, had risen correspondingly. 25Under the 1998 amendment to the saving bank law, only one third of the board of directors of the original saving bank could be members of the foundation. 26Recent information suggests that a new bill should be ready in May 1999.

Austria’s recent inflation, growth and labor market performance has been good, at least by European standards. It owes much to the successful implementation of the 1996-97 fiscal consolidation program and to numerous incremental reforms, whose cumulative and mutually reinforcing effects have raised productivity and strengthened competitiveness. The social partnership system, which has managed to arrive at broad-based consensus on often highly unpopular measures without political polarization and disruptive strikes, deserves much credit for this. However, the current slowdown exposes remaining fiscal weaknesses while posing new challenges for deeper structural reform. Further fiscal adjustment and labor and product market reform must therefore remain at the top of the authorities’ policy agenda. 35. From Austria’s perspective, euro area monetary conditions are too accommodative, requiring compensatory fiscal and wage restraint. Although economic growth is likely to remain somewhat below potential this year, the economy appears to be operating close to potential and there is no evidence that economic activity is hampered by either availability or cost of credit. On the contrary, given the high level of consumer confidence and signs of a possible rebound in business sentiment, and given the generally slow transmission of monetary impulses in the Austrian economy, the past considerable monetary easing has strengthened the case for fiscal tightening to prevent excessive growth of domestic demand if external demand strengthens as expected. In parallel, the social partners need to guard against an erosion of the gains in relative unit labor costs achieved in recent years. 36. Fiscal balance or a small surplus is the appropriate structural norm for the general government. Apart from this being an agreed objective of the SGP, there are sound economic reasons for such a norm. With a continued structural deficit, lower growth or higher interest rates risk reversing the recent progress in lowering the still high debt ratio, with the attendant loss of discretion over budget spending. Also, some margin beyond what is required to allow free play for the automatic stabilizers is required under the 3 percent of GDP limit of the SGP in order to absorb any fiscal slippage and provide room for discretionary counter- cyclical measures. Finally, an improved fiscal position would help in facing the fiscal burden of population aging. 37. Fiscal adjustment should be pursued by durable expenditure reduction rather than tax increases. Reduced government spending would improve efficiency, especially if, reductions aimed at areas likely to be a drag on productivity, such as public consumption, subsidies (especially for housing), and social transfers. If expenditure can be reduced by more than required to achieve fiscal balance or a small surplus, the opportunity should be seized to lower taxes and increase public investment. 38. Against these considerations, the authorities’ stability program for 1998-2002 is both unambitious and fraught with risks. Besides being vulnerable to slower growth and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-36 - future increases in interest rates, the authorities’ fiscal strategy runs the risk of relying unduly on continued surpluses of the lower levels of government. Indeed, the internal stability pact allows the lower levels of government to run a small deficit. If this leeway is used, the long reporting and decision lags would prevent timely countervailing action at the federal level, thus risking a breach of the SGP’s limit. Recently decided tax reductions beyond those envisaged under the stability program pose an additional risk. 39. Following the significant slippage in 1998, the authorities should prevent further fiscal deterioration by executing the 1999 budget tightly. Given the challenges ahead, it is important to leave a manageable fiscal position for the next government. Recent spending pressures should be firmly resisted and budgetary reserves should be used to meet unforeseen unavoidable expenditure. In view of the fundamental and cyclical imperatives for fiscal adjustment, the authorities should restrain the play of the automatic stabilizers, unless economic growth were to decline much more than currently envisaged. Even then, the stabilizers should be allowed to operate only partly, to leave room for their continued operation if the downside risks to the expected recovery in 2000 were to materialize. 40. The next government faces a daunting fiscal agenda. First, the 2000 budget, mortgaged as it is by the recent tax reform, requires a considerable fiscal effort to achieve the small deficit reduction envisaged under the authorities’ stability program. A greater reduction is, however, warranted. Second, the revenue sharing agreement with the lower levels of government must be renegotiated. In this context, the government should make it a priority to reorder the fiscal relationship among the three levels of government by establishing a better balance between assigned tasks and own financial sources. Finally, the pension and healthcare systems are in need of further reform to address steadily growing demographic pressures. 41. The recent gains in output and employment owe much to past structural reforms and an incomes policy that has kept wage inflation at moderate levels while also allowing some wage differentiation based on productivity. While the social partners can take much of the credit for Austria’s comparatively favorable recent performance, it is their continued responsibility to support the government in its effort to make domestic markets more flexible to adapt to the challenges of European economic integration and globalization and of the policy discipline imposed by the common currency. To this end, product market opening must be completed and the regulatory framework-including competition law-must be strengthened. As part of this process, the state should withdraw completely from ownership of enterprises producing goods and services. Rather than focusing on reducing unemployment further with potentially costly active labor market measures, the authorities should aim at job creation and greater self-employment. Higher employment in turn could lead to a virtuous cycle through higher general budget and social security fund revenue, which would allow reducing labor taxation. 42. In light of recent loan losses by major banks, the present reorganization of banking supervision should be used to tighten supervisory practices. In particular, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - supervisory authorities need to ensure that widespread lending in non-euro currencies is based on proper risk assessment. 43. Austria’s continued bilateral support to the transition economies and its aid contribution to alleviate the effects of the Kosovo crisis are greatly appreciated. The maintenance of ODA disbursements close to last year’s slightly increased level is welcome, and it is hoped that such disbursements can be raised again, despite needed budgetary stringency, to at least the level recorded at its peak in 1995. Beyond this, Austria could help establish greater coherence between trade and aid policies by supporting lower levels of EU protection, especially in connection with the forthcoming consideration of agricultural trade policy at the World Trade Organization. 44: The quality of Austrian statistics has improved significantly over the last couple of years and now conforms with the requirements of the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The timeliness of statistics should, however, be improved as the publication of most key short-term indicators lags by about one month relative to “best practice” in the EU. An improved analytical consistency of several data series would also be desirable. 45. In accordance with the authorities’ request, it is proposed to keep the Article IV consultation with Austria on the standard 1Zmonth cycle.

Difficulties in compiling the primary trade data arose from the shifting of reporting intra-EU trade from customs offices to exporter/importers and from the move to EU activity classifications (NACE revision 1). The balance of payment statistics were recently revised in line with the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual, but only data going back to 1992 are available. Austria has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and Austrian metadata are available on the Fund’s electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria has taken advantage of the flexibility options on the timeliness of the industrial production index, merchandise trade data, and the analytical accounts of the banking sector. For the purpose of surveillance, the timeliness of Austrian data could be improved by bringing them up to “best practice” in Europe with regard to industrial production, merchandise trade, and national accounts data. Compared to Germany and France, for instance, the publication of these data lags by about one month. The reclassification of public hospitals in 1997 has introduced a break in the national accounts series on public and private consumption.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Austria On June --, 1999, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Austria.1 Background Economic performance in 1998 was very strong: real growth exceeded 3% percent and inflation fell below 1 percent, putting Austria ahead of the EU average in terms of both indicators. . Although domestic demand replaced exports as the main engine of growth, the external current account deficit narrowed, assisted by strong competitiveness and an improving tourism balance. Although buoyant employment growth did not reduce the headline registered unemployment rate, the standardized unemployment rate remains low by EU standards. Despite the slowdown in several export markets, the domestic conditions for continued expansion are good. Ausfria’s cost-competitiveness vis-a-vis its trading partners has improved markedly since 1995 as a result of wage moderation and rapid productivity growth. In a ‘Under Article IV of tlie IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

The near-term prospects are for growth to resume in the second half of this year, ensuring an annual growth rate of 2 percent of GDP in 1999, slightly above the EU-average, and of around 2% percent in 2000. Despite the likely return of headline inflation to above 1 percent as a result of the recent reversal of oil price declines, inflation pressures should remain limited as the reduction of the unemployment rate is expected to be moderate and price increases will be contained by further market liberalization. After two years of reduction in the general government deficit-amounting to some 3% percentage points of GDP-the deficit widened again last year. Notwithstanding higher economic growth and lower interest rates, the general government deficit increased from 1.9 percent of GDP in 1997 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 1998. The increased deficit reflected mostly the failure to replace one-off fiscal measures introduced in the 1996-97 consolidation package and the delayed execution of local investment projects. Thanks to privatization proceeds and improved debt dynamics (higher economic growth and lower interest rates) the public debt ratio declined to 63 percent of GDP in 1998. Incremental structural reform has been pursued in both labor and product markets. In close cooperation with the social partners, labor market flexibility has been improved by tightening the eligibility for early retirement and unemployment benefits; relaxing restrictions on working hours; and introducing performance-based pay options in collective agreements. In the context of the National Employment Action Plan, increased efforts have been made in the area of active labor market policies (e.g., job conversion courses and other types of training). In product markets, increased competition has been introduced in the telecommunications and electricity sectors, resulting in a lowering of industrial input costs.
