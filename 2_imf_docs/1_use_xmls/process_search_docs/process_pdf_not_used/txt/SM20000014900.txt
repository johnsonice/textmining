I. INTRODUCTION 1. A staff team visited Bratislava during April 27-May 11, 2000 to conduct the Article IV consultation discussions.’ The mission met with the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, the Minister of Finance, the Governor and Deputy Governors of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), other senior officials at the NBS and various government agencies, the chairman of the Parliament and the head of its Budget and Monetary Committee, public enterprises, and representatives of private sector financial firms and research institutions. 2. Slovakia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 on October 1, 1995 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Relations with the Fund are discussed in Appendix I and those with the World Bank, including ongoing discussions on an Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL), are discussed in Appendix II. Slovakia meets the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) specifications for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. Data on core statistical indicators are timely and provided promptly to the Fund. In general, the data quality is sufficient for the assessment of the macroeconomic situation, although there are some areas of concern (see Appendix III on statistical issues). To help address these concerns, a multitopic technical assistance mission by the Fund’s Statistics Department is tentatively scheduled toward the end of this year. 3. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on July 21, 1999, Executive Directors stressed the need to tighten fiscal policy, reduce the external current account deficit, and deal with weak financial discipline and performance in the state banking and enterprise sectors. Thus, they welcomed the authorities’ fiscal package of May 1999, but stressed the importance of attacking structural weaknesses in the budget, including the high tax burden and the high level of government spending relative to GDP. Also in the fiscal area, they encouraged the authorities to strengthen their control over the operations of the general government outside the state budget. In addition, Directors emphasized that rapid implementation of a comprehensive bank restructuring program, including the privatization of state-owned banks, should be given high priority; and urged the authorities to accelerate and complete enterprise privatization. ’ The mission comprised Messrs. Feldman (head), Christou, Kuijs, and Pani (EP) (all EUl), and Mmes. Lukonga (PDR), Schumacher (MAE), and Craig (assistant, EUl). Messrs. Kiekens (Executive Director for the Slovak Republic), Rigasz (Assistant in the office of the Executive Director for the Slovak Republic), and Rocha (World Bank) joined part of the mission.

At the Helsinki summit in December 1999, the European Union (EU) invited Slovakia to accession talks, and western officials have frequently indicated their full support for the government’s efforts to join the EU, NATO, and the OECD.2 IL ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 5. The government that took power in late 1998 inherited an economy that was highly vulnerable to crisis. Although it had grown at high rates averaging over 6 percent during 1995-98, the economy was also character&d by large macroeconomic imbalances and structural weaknesses. Governance was weak, evidenced, for example, by low enterprise profitability, and an increasing stock of inter-enterprise arrears. Non-government investment had risen to unsustainable levels (33 percent of GDP in 1998) and, even though large parts of the enterprise sector had been privatized, was sometimes of questionable quality (reflecting distortionaty tax incentives and politically-motivated activities).3 Firms, including those that were privatized, financed themselves either from abroad via government guarantees or via the unreformed state-owned banks. Overall external indebtedness rose from 33 percent of GDP at end- 1995 to about 60 percent of GDP at end-1998, with half of the increase accounted for by enterprises. Political interference in the lending of state-owned banks contributed to increasing bad loan problems, with the indebtedness of the enterprise sector (including tax arrears) reaching 95 percent of GDP at end-1998. Rapid growth in domestic demand, fueled by expansionary fiscal policy, resulted in external current account deficits of 10 percent of GDP or more in each of the three years to 1998 (Figure 1 and Table 1). Box 1 provides a regional perspective on Slovakia’s economic performance and vulnerability to crisis. 6. The new government took important steps to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and m-invigorate structural reform. As discussed below, important progress has been made in this regard: the deficit of the general government has been reduced, the external current account deficit has narrowed, and, though yet to be completed, important steps have been made toward restructuring and privatizing state-owned banks and enterprises, including 2 OECD officials have indicated that an official membership invitation to the organization could be issued very soon. 3 The privatization model used in Slovakia did not succeed in restructuring the majority of old enterprises into profitable and dynamic corporations. Instead, old management preserved control in most cases, while these enterprises also remained heavily indebted and unattractive to new investors. The state-owned banks, for their part, continued to finance old enterprises and investment of questionable quality, and became increasingly burdened with portfolios of bad loans.

Macroeconomic Performance and Vulnerability to Financial and/or Balance of Payments Crises: A Regional Perspective While Slovakia’s economic performance during 1996-98 surpassed that of many other economies in central and eastern Europe, external vulnerability increased. The country registered a comparatively strong performance in terms of relatively high real growth and moderate inflation, but large and growing fiscal deficits went hand in hand with external current account deficits of more than 10 percent of GDP (Table 1 of this Box) and ratios of short-term debt and broad money to official international reserves that were high compared to the regional standard (Figure 1 and Table 2 of this box). Based on a range of indicators of vulnerability to financial/balance of payments crises, the Slovak Republic was considered to be highly vulnerable in early 1999 (see S&I/99/155).’ Since then, vulnerability has lessened as encouraging signs of stabilization have emerged. This has been reflected in a narrowing of the deficits of both the external current account and the general government to more sustainable levels, while underlying inflation remained moderate. Other vulnerability indicators that had risen sharply through end-1998-namely, the reserves to imports ratio, broad money to reserves, and short-term debt to official reserves-improved in 1999 (Table 2 of this box), while export performance (Figure 2 of this box) and the real effective exchange rate (Figure 1 of this box) also developed favorably, compared with other countries in the region. On the other hand, some indicators of vulnerability still raise concerns. The ratios of reserves to imports ratio, broad money to reserves, and short-term debt to official reserves, as well as of domestic credit to GDP (Table 2 of this box), are still unfavorable compared with other countries in the region. Moreover, continued fragilities in the banking sector add to vulnerability concerns. Notwithstanding mixed indicators, vulnerability, on balance, seems to have lessened in 1999 and the first months of 2000, and market confidence in government policies has improved. In this regard, the nominal exchange rate has been on an appreciating trend against the euro. In March 2000, a lo-year eurobond was issued at 217 basis points over comparable German bunds, and now trades at a spread of 233 basis points. This compares with a 420 basis point spread when a 5-year bond was issued in June 1999; that bond now trades at a 193 basis points spread. However, Slovak debt is still rated at below investment grade. ’ These indicators have been suggested by Kaminsky, Lizondo, and Reinhart (Staff Papers, March 1998), and other papers on vulnerability.

Progress in accession talks with the EU has added to market confidence, including agreement between the government and the European Commission on a set of medium-term economic policies as documented in the February 2000 Joint Assessment of Medium-Term Economic Priorities of the Slovak Republic (hereafter referred to as the Joint Assessment). Box 2 describes progress on EU accession and the main macroeconomic objectives contained in the Joint Assessment. 7. The determined fiscal tightening associated with the May 1999 package was a key component to reducing macroeconomic imbalances. The deficit of the general government (excluding privatization receipts) was reduced to 3.6 percent of GDP in 1999 (Figure 1 and Table 2). Though somewhat above the authorities’ target of 3 percent of GDP, this represented a contraction of 1 ‘/z percentage points of GDP from the previous year.4 Key elements of the package included an increase in the lower VAT rate from 6 percent to 10 percent, higher excises, an import surcharge, measures to rationalize social assistance programs, as well as significant increases in important administered prices (e.g., gas, electricity, heating, post, and railways).5 Although the authorities were able to hold the line on their target for the state budget, significant overruns in the extrabudgetary sector- especially in the social security funds-led to the under-performance relative to the general government target.6 8. Fiscal tightening and developments in the non-government sector led to a sharp fall in domestic demand in 1999. Excluding stocks, domestic demand declined by 6.5 percent in 1999 (Figure 1); the decline was more pronounced in the last quarter of the year (a 10 percent year-on-year drop). In addition to the effects of the May package in reducing fiscal stimulus, government fixed investment fell by almost 40 percent in real terms, as large infrastructure projects-most notably highways-were put on hold. Non-government investment declined sharply, while non-government consumption increased only marginally, 4 There is some uncertainty about the size of the deficit of the general government in 1998. Measured above the line, consistent with the authorities’ submission to the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the deficit was 5 percent of GDP. However, measured below the line, the deficit was closer to 5% percent of GDP, implying a contraction of about 2 percentage points in 1999. 5 An import surcharge of 7 percent became effective on June 1, 1999 and was reduced to 5 percent on January 1,200O. 6 Notwithstanding relatively weak tax collection, especially in light of increases in the rates of existing taxes and the imposition of an import surcharge, the deficit target of the state budget was met, as overruns in social transfers of the state budget (notably for social assistance) and subsidies were offset by savings in other areas, especially capital expenditure.

The Slovak Republic and EU Accession The coalition government that came into office in late 1998 left a favorable mark on the EU by its western orientation and commitment to economic reforms. The Regular Report of October 1999 noted that the Slovak Republic had made substantial progress in aligning its economy and legislation to that of the EU. i Although the EU decided at the end of 1998 not to include the Slovak Republic in the first group of Central and East European countries with which accession negotiations were started, this was largely out of political concerns, and in December 1999, the EU invited the Slovak Republic to start negotiations on EU accession. The Accession Partnership, released at end-1999, included what the European Commission (EC) saw as the priority measures to be taken in the short and medium-term to meet the (standard) accession criteria. The short-term priorities included: (i) enterprise restructuring, particularly in the energy intensive heavy industries, supported by financial sector reform; (ii) simplification of legal and administrative procedures; (iii) improvement of the bankruptcy procedures; and, (iv) several measures in the areas of public procurement, supervision of the financial industry, competition, and telecommunications (including the establishment of an independent national regulatory authority). Medium-term priorities included: (i) completion of the privatization process; (ii) further deregulation of administered prices; (iii) establishment of a fiscal surveillance procedure in line with those in the EU; and (iv) measures in the areas of financial services, competition, telecommunications, and taxation. The Ministry of Finance has set up a unit to coordinate the work on accession issues, including assessing the yet to be estimated fiscal costs in areas such as infrastructure, the environment, agriculture, and taxation. The accession negotiations started formally in February 2000, when the government submitted its “general position” on the negotiations. The authorities announced that, although they will not request any derogation from the implementation of the acquis communautaire, they will request transition periods in the areas of the internal market, agriculture, transport, the environment, and energy. By the end of May 2000, the negotiations on the first 6 (of a total of 22) chapters had been concluded; the authorities had also submitted their position on a further 5 chapters. The revised National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis Communautaire (NPPA), released in April 2000, sets out the authorities’ alignment agenda. It describes measures adopted and those envisaged-divided into short- and medium-term priorities-with a view to completing the preparation by early 2002, two years prior to the date the authorities aim to join the EU. The Joint Assessment ofMedium-term Economic Policy Priorities of the Slovak Republic, which was agreed upon in March 2000, forms part of the NPPA. The macroeconomic scenario included in the Joint Assessment provides some key macroeconomic objectives. It envisages a gradual reduction in the general government deficit from around 2%-3 percent of GDP in 2001 to l-l% percent of GDP in 2004, consistent with a decline in the deficit on the external current account from around 5-5 ‘/ percent of GDP in 200 1 to 2X-3 percent of GDP in 2004. The scenario also shows a pick-up in GDP growth from 3.2-4.5 percent in 2001 to 5.0-6.5 percent in 2004; and a reduction in (year-average) consumer price inflation from 7.3-7.7 percent in 2001 to 4.6-5.0 percent in 2004. ‘This annually updated document contains the EC’s judgement as to the readiness of countries to join the EU, with reference to the (political and economic) Copenhagen criteria for membership.

Private consumption remained weak in the first few months of 2000 (as evidenced by sluggish retail sales shown in Figure 2). 9. Although GDP growth slowed in 1999, its deceleration to 1.9 percent was limited by strong export performance. In real terms, exports grew by 7 percent-higher than the growth of export markets (Figure 2 of Box I)--reflecting strong productivity growth in exporting industries and the competitiveness gains associated with the depreciation of the koruna in the first half of the year (Figure 3). At the same time, import volume fell by 2% percent in the face of the sharp decline in domestic demand. As a result, the contribution of net trade to annual GDP growth was 6% percentage points in 1999 (Figure 4). The strong momentum of exports continued in the first months of 2000 and was reflected in strong industrial sales growth (Figures 2 and 5): in real terms (deflated by the producer price index (PPI)), exports were 22 percent higher in January-March 2000 than a year earlier.’ 10. In these circumstances, balance of payments diffkulties eased considerably. The external current account deficit fell to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1999 (Table 3).* Meanwhile, the trade deficit narrowed tirther in the first quarter of 2000-to US$167 million compared with US$329 million in 1999-and, by March 2000, official reserves increased to US$3.7 billion (equivalent to 3 months of imports of goods and non-factor services).g The capital account registered a surplus of US$1.8 billion in 1999, reflecting to a large extent official borrowing abroad (a 6500 million bond issued by the government and a government-guaranteed bond for El20 million issued by the Road Fund) and borrowing by the state-owned gas company ’ Because of problems with the unit value deflator, the PPI is used, which can introduce an error in the calculation of real exports. The authorities are in the process of improving unit value indices drawing on technical assistance from the Fund. * From a saving-investment (S-I) standpoint, the 4.3 percentage point of GDP reduction in the current account deficit from 1998 to 1999 corresponded to an increase in the S-I balance of the general government of 1.4 percentage points and an increase of 2.9 percentage points for the non-government sector. Particularly striking is the fact that almost all of this latter increase was accounted for by the operations of five large public enterprises-namely, Slovak Electricity, Slovak Gas, Slovak Railways, Slovak Telecommunications, and Slovak Post. This reflected a sharp decline in their investment (from 6.7 percent of GDP to 4 percent of GDP), as well as the impact of the significant increases in administered prices, which raised their profits in 1999. ’ Data released after the Article IV discussions show that continued strong exports, combined with weak imports, led to a fLrther contraction in the trade deficit in April. In fact, the trade balance was positive, for the first time since 1995, although a temporary fall in the oil price and calendar effects-from a lower number of working days-apparently contributed to this outcome.

In addition, external indebtedness was reduced modestly from 58 percent of GDP at end-1998 to 56 percent of GDP at end-1999. 11. Labor market conditions slackened as the unemployment rate reached almost 20 percent, and pressures to significantly increase wages (or renegotiate collective wage agreements) were therefore weak (Figure 6). As discussed in Box 3, a significant part of unemployment is non-cyclical. Unemployment is expected to remain high in the short run, though it is also likely that the unemployment rate has peaked and that the official figures overstate the actual number of people without jobs. The absence of pressures on wages was evident in 1999: year-on-year economy-wide nominal wage growth fell to 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, while unit labor costs in industry recorded negative or very low growth rates, which continued in early 2000. 12. Even though headline inflation had risen-to 14 percent year-on-year at end-1999-there have been few signs that underlying inflation has been increasing (Figure 7). Estimates suggest that increases in indirect taxes and administered prices under the May 1999 fiscal package contributed some 7 percentage points to the year-on-year headline rate. Although another round of large increases in administered prices in early 2000 pushed year-on-year headline inflation to 16.6 percent in March, underlying inflationary pressures were substantially less: year-on-year core inflation (which excludes the impact of changes in administered prices and indirect tax changes) was 7 percent in the same month of 2000, and fell further to 6.4 percent in April 2000. 13. The NBS has been gearing monetary policy toward meeting its end-2000 target for core inflation of 4.7 to 5.8 percent. In this regard, in October 1998, the NBS abandoned monetary aggregate targeting (in the face: of structural changes in the financial sector, increased capital market activity, and uncertain money demand), and shifted its monetary policy toward inflation targeting (IT). In a related vein, in February 2000, the NBS switched from using excess reserves as its main operating instrument to using it’s official interest rates. However, at this early stage, the transmission mechanism is not well understood, so monetary policy must be described as being only loosely anchored on inflation. In addition, while strongly guided by its inflation targets, the NBS is also concerned with exchange rate appreciation and its effect on external competitiveness, though, so far, inflation and exchange rate objectives have not come into conflict. 14. With wage costs and underlying inflation seemingly at bay, and the fiscal and external current account deficits more manageable, the NBS has allowed domestic interest rates to decline, in circumstances of upward pressure on the koruna. The NBS initially welcomed the strengthening of the currency when it began in mid-1999, as it came on the heels of the sharp depreciation before the May 1999 fiscal package restored confidence in currency markets and contributed to a pickup in capital inflows. However, concerns about losing external competitiveness eventually led the NBS to resist further appreciation, first by sterilized intervention in early 2000 and then-in the context of an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Box 3. High Unemployment: Causes and Possible Remedies1 The registered unemployment rate has increased significantly. It rose to 19.4 percent in the first quarter of 2000, from 15.6 percent at end-1998 and 12% percent at end-1997.’ A large share of unemployment has been long-term: in 1999, around 40 percent of the registered unemployed were out of work for more than 1 year, and 50 percent of those were unemployed for more than 2 years. Unemployment has also been characterized by wide regional variation: while unemployment is almost frictional in Bratislava, it has reached more than 25 percent in some regions in eastern Slovakia. The causes of the high unemployment rate would appear to be many fold. First, the recent slowdown in economic growth has reduced the demand for labor, resulting in cyclical unemployment. Second, since mid- 1998, there has been a speeding up of labor shedding in industry. This has reflected tighter credit conditions (as the state-owned banks have become more concerned with the quality of their lending portfolio), less political pressure to maintain employment at economically unwarranted levels, as well as poor profitability. Third, the fact that the unemployment rate never fell below 12% percent-even during the 1994-97 period of strong growth-suggests that a significant part of the unemployment is probably non-cyclical. Part of this reflects the collapse in output during the early years of transition when many enterprises lost their markets (e.g. heavy engineering and armaments).3 Significant job creation took place during the recovery period of 1994-97, though the unemployment rate stayed high. As compared to the first years of transition in the early 199Os, when unemployment rose rapidly as output collapsed, average GDP growth exceeded 6 percent and some 300,000 jobs were created during 1994-97, notwithstanding continued labor shedding in industry. Most of the job creation took place in the (previously neglected) service sector. Many workers also found new opportunities as selfemployed, whose number increased to more than 6 percent of the active labor force. However, the labor supply also grew significantly (by 230,000). As a result, the unemployment rate declined only modestly, from 14% percent at end-1993 to 12% percent at end-1997. As noted above, it rose sharply thereafter. ” What are some of the non-cyclical factors that have contributed to the high unemployment rate in recent years? First, the particular skill set of many of the long-term unemployed were geared towards positions in industrial companies whose demand for labor has declined sharply under the pressure of market forces. This made it difficult to re-employ them in other sectors. Second, for low-skilled workers, the incentives to seek work are limited by the small difference between wages and unemployment benefits. This difference is particularly small in the less prosperous regions outside of Bratislava, where wages are lower than in the capital, but where benefits are the same (and higher in real terms, in the face of a lower cost of living). In addition, people are reportedly working in the ‘gray’ economy while collecting benefits, apparently reflecting weak targeting and monitoring of eligibility of social transfers (combined with high payroll tax rates). This type of gray economy employment, estimated at around 150,000 (or 7% percent of ‘Chapter I of the accompanying selected issues paper assesses in more detail the nature of the unemployment problem and possible remedies. *According to the data from the Labor Force Survey (LFS), the unemployment rate rose to 18.9 percent in the first quarter of 2000, from 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998. 31n the former Czechoslovakia, the industrial sectors most in need of restructuring were the heavy engineering and armaments industries, and they were concentrated in the Slovak part of the country. As a result, during the transition, unemployment increased to much higher levels in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic.

Recognizing that non-cyclical unemployment reflected distortions in the incentive structure, Fund staff discussed various policies to help reduce the unemployment rate. A major disincentive to hiring labor remains the high rate of social security contributions, an issue to be dealt with over the medium term. At the same time, there may be room for better targeting and administration of the various benefits available for the unemployed, and for strengthening the enforcement of job acceptance requirements, with a view to increasing incentives to work. In a related vein, the recent reduction in unemployment benefits may have encouraged job search. Among other possible measures to deal with unemployment, consideration could be given to: (i) encouraging greater wage and benefit differentiation across regions, to take into account local labor market and cost of living conditions, respectively; (ii) simplifying red tape and administrative costs as a partial means of promoting small- and medium-size enterprises; and (iii) resolving issues concerning property rights over land, thus supporting investment. To the extent possible, as the Labor Code is reformed to meet EU standards, due consideration should also be given to avoiding measures that, by reducing labor market flexibility and increasing administrative obstacles to hiring and firing, discourage job creation. Nevertheless, it will be very difficult to move all the long-term unemployed dismissed by industry to new jobs, given the industry-specific skills of many of them, so additional training may be required. The need for an appropriately targeted social safety net is well recognized, and the authorities have been encouraged to seek World Bank assistance in this regard. Otherwise, growth in 2000 and in later years should be sufficient to at least lower the unemployment rate from its current peak. Simple and preliminary econometric estimates suggest that, in line with economic theory, employment is a tinction of activity (GDP) and real wages (deflated by the GDP deflator).5 The estimated relationship was used to project employment and unemployment, consistent with the assumptions for GDP growth and real wages contained in the macroeconomic framework.6 On this basis, economy-wide employment would grow by some 1 percent in the year to the fourth quarter of 2000. In line with recent experience, labor force growth of 1 percent is assumed, implying that the unemployment rate would be about flat (at 18.4 percent) in the year to the fourth quarter of 2000, but then begin to decline.’ Informal estimates put the size of the gray economy at about 15-20 percent of GDP. ?he estimates were based on quarterly data. Since quarterly data for economy-wide wages were not available, wages in industry were used; judged from annual data, the difference between economy-wide wages and wages in industry was small during the estimation period. Economic theory suggests that, along a long-run equilibrium growth path, employment should grow in line with GDP, adjusted for labor productivity growth. This implies that the (partial) elasticities of employment with respect to GDP and the real wage would be 1 and -1, respectively. When. the econometric estimates restricted the elasticity with respect to GDP to unity, the measured elasticity of employment with respect to the real wage was -0.82. Although this was significantly different from -1, the estimated long-term relationship was surprisingly close to the long-run relationship suggested by theory, given the short estimation period (1993-99). these include real growth in 2000 of 2% percent (implying a pick up in the second half of the year) and moderate, but positive, real wage growth (averaging 1 percent in 2000 and 2001). 7The average growth of the labor force over the period 1995-99 was around 1 percent, based on data provided by the Slovak Statistical Office.

In allowing interest rates to decline, the NBS also took account of the fact that banks (notably those slated for restructuring and privatization) have become much more cautious in their lending activities: the growth of credit to the non-government sector has been very subdued (Table 4). 15. Some important steps were taken toward restructuring and privatizing state- owned banks. These include the Investment and Development Bar& (IRB), Slovak Savings Bank (SLSP), and General Credit Bank (VUB).” The authorities have decided to sell a significant majority of the state’s stake in SLSP and the entire state’s stake in VUB and IRB, overcoming strong political pressures to sell just minority stakes in the fast two banks. Among other steps, preliminary credit diagnostic audits of SLSP and VUB have been completed. Second, the authorities transferred Sk 82 billion of non-performing loans from these three banks to the Consolidation Agency and the Consolidation Bank, and they are about to complete the transfer of an additional Sk 34 billion of non-performing loans. Third, they injected capital of Sk 18.9 billion into the IRB, SLSP, and VUB. With the completion of the second transfer of non-performing loans, it is expected that the banks’ capital adequacy will meet the minimum requirements stipulated according to international standards. l1 Fourth, they selected financial advisors for the privatization of all three banks. Finally, they improved the effectiveness of the Bank Privatization Unit through external technical assistance and the recruitment of additional staff. 16. In addition, commendable progress has been made in strengthening banking regulation and supervision, and initiating necessary legal reforms. The government amended the banking act in order to strengthen the supervisory power of the NBS (e.g., by allowing it to request public disclosure of individual bank information, to impose corrective actions, and to establish and enforce improved prudential rules regarding large exposures and loan classification). With a view to strengthening the role of creditors in bankruptcy proceedings, a number of amendments to the bankruptcy law have recently been submitted to Parliament for approval, which would give creditors greater control over the choice and actions of the liquidator, require strengthened reporting requirements of the liquidator to creditor committees, and call for the expedited completion of bankruptcy proceedings. 17. Enterprise profitability has also improved-albeit modestly and from a low base-and the privatization process has gathered steam. Profits in the non-financial sector increased by 2 percentage points of GDP in 1999, but about one-third of this increase lo Following two years under NBS conservatorship, the Ministry of Finance regained control over IRB in December 1999. Appendix IV provides more details on banking sector developments and performance. l1 Nevertheless, until final pre-privatization audits are completed, the value of the banks’ loans and consequently capital, are still subject to uncertainty. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - was accounted for by improvements in the profitability of state-owned enterprises reflecting increases in administered prices, and profits are still low (equivalent to less than 3 percent of GDP). In addition, other indicators would suggest that governance and profitability have been weak: inter-enterprise arrears remained high (about 18 percent of GDP at end-1999); and recorded profits might have been even lower if the potential losses from the effects of the exchange rate on debt service payments were taken into account. On the privatization front, Slovnaft (the oil refinery) was privatized and the authorities have initiated the process for the divestiture of the majority share in the telecommunications company to a strategic foreign investor. However, they have decided to keep the privatization of other utilities (e.g., the Gas and Electricity companies, and Transpetrol) to a minority share. 18. Notwithstanding this important progress, there have been areas of weakness- significant in the fiscal area- which the authorities would like to address. First, weak tax collections warrant urgent attention: the ratio of tax revenue to GDP dropped to 35.3 percent in 1999 from 37.1 percent in 1998, despite the significant increases in taxes (e.g., the import surcharge, increased VAT rate, and higher excises). Moreover, recent data suggest that tax arrears are a large and growing problem, with the stock of arrears exceeding 30 percent of total tax collection at end-1999. Second, primary expenditure is high compared with other countries in the region and the EU. Spending on social benefits is especially high, and without improvements in their targeting and administration, would remain so. Third, relatively high tax rates (especially on labor) impede private sector activity and employment in the formal sector. Finally, a number of surveys have identified weak governance, including corruption, as a key hindrance to increasing foreign direct investment (FDI), and information on fiscal policy could be more transparent. 19. Another important agenda item is the need to address the remaining weaknesses in the enterprise and banking sectors. Although FDI increased somewhat in 1999, its low level compared with other countries in th.e region reflects the relatively low pace of privatization to foreign strategic investors so far as well as weak governance. Moreover, although a large majority of the state enterprises, other than utilities and banks, has already been privatized, governance in several of them is in doubt, many are heavily indebted, and some are essentially bankrupt (though weaknesses in the bankruptcy framework precluded an official determination). l2 In addition, as noted before, inter-enterprise arrears are high and overall profits in the enterprise sector remain low. Finally, in tandem with the needed improvements in the bankruptcy framework, weak accounting standards and rights of minority shareholders are of particular concern. l2 The difference between the number of accumulated filings and declarations of bankruptcy has been large and growing, having reached 8,190 cases at end-1999. There are many cases pending for 2-3 years, and by the time they finally reach declaration, there is quite often little or nothing left of the estate to administer. In addition, the seniority of most tax claims in arrears discourages the use of bankruptcy procedures at all.

As emphasized by the authorities during the discussions, it was important to build on the successes that have been achieved and ensure that recent gains are not lost. Thus, the discussions focused on protecting and consolidating macroeconomic stability and otherwise laying the foundation for durable economic growth and job creation. In particular, on the heels of huge external current account deficits in the past and the associated rapid build-up of debt, further reducing external vulnerabilities and ensuring a sustainable external current account path over the medium-term were seen as essential. Further fiscal adjustment would help to realize these external objectives, and it would need to be phased in appropriately to take into account near-term developments in domestic demand and the possibility of strong capital inflows. At the same time, relatively high government expenditure and tax rates, especially with respect to payroll taxes, would impede private sector activity, employment in the formal sector, and future economic growth if left unattended. The mission therefore noted that it was essential that policymakers, while striving to meet medium-term fiscal targets, dealt with the fiscal tensions that would arise from reducing these impediments, as well as those that could result from the potential and uncertain fiscal costs associated with meeting accession requirements in the run-up to EU membership. 21. Accelerating the pace of structural reform was viewed as a key building block for achieving durable growth. It was agreed that further and significant restructuring and privatization of the bank and enterprise sectors, and improvements in the bankruptcy framework were matters of high priority. Much of this work was already in train, but yet to be completed. As was well recognized, such actions are key to improving financial discipline, encouraging productive investment, laying the basis for job creation and achieving a high rate of economic growth along with a sustainable external current account. Unfortunately, growth alone may be insufficient to make a serious enough dent in unemployment, which could become a permanent condition for many in the absence of measures aimed at dealing with distortions that have accentuated the unemployment problem. A. Near-Term Outlook, Risks, and Policy Priorities 22. The authorities and Fund staff agreed that potential risks to protecting and consolidating macroeconomic stability were particularly evident in the fiscal area. There were concerns on both sides about plans to increase government expenditure, contingent on financing from privatization proceeds. Some of these expenditures were no doubt important.‘3 However, Fund staff argued-and the Finance Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, i3 Examples of the kinds of additional planned expenditure, financed by privatization proceeds, include housing and highway construction, as well as expenditure related to agriculture and the environment, and would add about Sk 8 billion to the deficit (about 1 percent of GDP). The authorities were also planning to use privatization proceeds to retire (continued.. .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - and Governor agreed, but perhaps not others in the governing coalition-that decisions on spending should be made within the context of fiscal sustainability, and an overall macroeconomic framework. This generally meant that privatization revenues should imply less reliance on debt financing and foregoing the additional expenditures that were being contemplated, unless other expenditures were cut to make room for them. l4 Another concern was that operational control of the extrabudgetary funds-even though they relied on injections of resources from the state budget-remained diffise and largely outside the influence of the Ministry of Finance and the budgetary process. l5 This makes it difficult to meet fiscal targets, as evidenced by the regular overruns that have occurred. Risks may also be exacerbated by the lack of timely data on the overall operations of the general government, which precludes a more timely policy response, and by problems with tax administration, which the authorities are trying to fix drawing on recommendations from technical assistance by the Fund. 23. Concretely, the deficit of the general government in 2000 seemed headed to a level well above the authorities’ target. Specifically, compared with the target of 3 percent of GDP, staff estimated that the deficit could reach an estimated 5 percent of GDP, including planned additional expenditures associated with privatization proceeds equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP at the time of the mission. l6 A,fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP was seen as contributing to a further narrowing of the external current account deficit in 2000 (to 4.7 percent of GDP), to keeping the ratio of external debt to GDP broadly stable at about 58 percent, and contributing to a reduction in external vulnerability.” Although a larger debt obligations of enterprises (covered by state guarantees) and of the Health and Road Funds, equivalent to Sk 14 billion; this would not increase the fiscal deficit. l4 The mission noted other reasons why higher spending financed by privatization could be ill advised. For example, if current expenditure, it is often difficult to reverse at some later point and there is thus the danger that it may become entrenched at levels inconsistent with future revenue. If investment spending, there are implications for recurrent government expenditure which could add to future fiscal deficits. The planned expenditure to be financed by privatization proceeds appeared to include both. ls There are 12 state funds, 4 social security funds, as well as the Land and National Property Funds. l6 This assumed that local governments were in balance, the National Property Fund (NPF) too (i.e., no redemption of NPF bonds this year), and no increase in pensions, though there was some discussion of increasing pensions and a government decision after the mission- which will need to be ratified by Parliament-called for a 7 percent increase, effective August 1. The deficit could exceed 5 percent of GDP if certain assumptions were not to hold. ” Fund staff projected an external current account deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2000. This compared with the projection of the NBS of a deficit of 5.1 percent, also assuming a (continued.. 1) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - external current account deficit was not expected to pose particular financing difficulties in 2000 as long as anticipated privatization revenues were to come in-and, from that perspective, exceeding the fiscal deficit target was not expected to be especially problematic-Fund staff urged the authorities to make every effort to meet their fiscal target. 24. The staff argued that a deficit of the general government close to the target of 3 percent of GDP would seem preferable. First, considerable pressures were already beginning to mount on general government operations for 2001 and there may be hidden fiscal liabilities that are yet to surface. With further fiscal adjustment needed from a medium- term perspective, meeting this year’s target would set a base more conducive for securing fiscal goals in later years, and for adhering to the fiscal adjustment goals espoused in the recently released Joint Assessment with the EU. Moreover, with elections scheduled for 2002, there is merit in cementing fiscal adjustment in the preceding years. Second, a larger external current account deficit associated with a looser-than-targeted fiscal stance would leave the economy more vulnerable to a reduction or reversal of capital inflows in later years, even if the current account did not pose particular financing difficulties in 2000. Moreover, coming out of a period of excessively large current account deficits, and vulnerability to crises, it would be preferable to convincingly bring the current account into a sustainable range this year. Third, fiscal targets had repeatedly been missed during the past several years and it is important to build credibility and confidence in the policy setting environment. This is a critical aspect of attracting much needed foreign investment and ensuring reasonable borrowing costs. Fourth, reasonably good near-term growth prospects (see below) lessen the case for fiscal relaxation. While the authorities agreed with these considerations, they noted the difficulties in reducing the fiscal deficit, particularly given the fragmentation within the coalition government. 25. The possibility of strong capital inflows- associated with prospects for EU accession and other successes-would also pose particular challenges for fiscal policy and the macroeconomic policy mix. To some degree, this had already started to happen, and was prompting upward pressures on the exchange rate.18 Sustained and significant general government deficit of 3 percent of GDP. Private sector forecasts at the time of the mission tended to put the current account deficit at an average of 5 percent of GDP, though the explicit assumptions on fiscal policy lying behind the projections were often unclear. 181n the first half of 2000, the authorities were confronted with significant short-term capital inflows that partly reflected the confidence effects of the EU’s decision to open accession talks. During that period, the government also issued a C500 million bond during that period (with no further borrowing planned for the rest of the year) and Slovak Wireless Finance sold a Cl75 million bond. In addition, a number of bonds are scheduled to be placed by enterprises later this year and significant FDI inflows are expected as well, related to the authorities’ privatization program (most importantly the sale of the telecommunications company, tentatively scheduled for the second half of the year). In the next two years, FDI (continued.. .)

In this regard, staff were skeptical whether sterilized intervention-which had been used recently to deal, in particular, with short-term capital inflows-would have a lasting impact. The authorities were more sanguine and did not preclude the possibility of continuing to use it in the face of short-term inflows, but agreed that sterilized intervention would not be effective to deal with the larger, FDI-related inflows that were being projected.19 At all events, looking ahead, Fund staff encouraged the authorities to use potentially significant FDI inflows related to privatization to retire foreign debt. In the context of urging them to keep the deficit of the general government to 3 percent of GDP, staff also saw merit in the authorities’ plans to place privatization receipts beyond those used for deficit financing in set aside accounts at the National Bank. As long as the funds remained in these accounts, this approach would ensure that the foreign exchange did not go through the foreign exchange market, avoiding potentially unwanted upward pressure on the exchange rate. But adequate transparency and control over the accounts would be required, including through the budget process. If capital inflows, more broadly, were still to pose challenges to macroeconomic management-either because of their impact on inflation, a widening external current account deficit associated with an appreciating currency, or both- fiscal policy would need to be tightened lto contain unwanted demand pressures on prices and the current account. 26. Assuming a general government deficit of 3 percent of GDP, real GDP growth was generally expected to average to about 2’55 percent for 2000. Projected growth was driven by the external sector, with domestic demand declining modestly by about 1 percent. In the event of a more favorable outturn, staff urged that the fiscal target for 2000 be met or surpassed.20 By the same token, staff also urged that if developments proved weaker than inflows are projected to increase; these include the planned divestiture of state enterprises, including state-owned banks and the state-owned gas company. l9 Sterilized intervention seems to have been largely ineffective because it left domestic interest rates high and thereby stimulated additional inflows. Compounding this problem, the NBS had at times indicated publicly that it would intervene to keep the exchange rate from appreciating above a stated target level. To the extent that this had limited market expectations of exchange rate variability, at a time in which the interest differential had remained significantly positive on Slovak assets over those abroad, additional inflows and upward (appreciation-related) exchange rate pressures ensued. In these circumstances, the authorities agreed to refrain from making public comments attaching importance to a particular level of the exchange rate, as this exacerbated the short-term inflow problem. 2o Upside risks included the possibility of higher-than-projected exports, underscored by their exceptionally strong performance so far this year. In addition, while difficult to quantify, growth in the gray economy-which may represent some 20 percent of economic activity- could fuel further consumption growth .

The conditions for monetary easing seemed to be in place. There did not appear to be significant inflationary pressures ahead, especially as wage settlements were expected to be moderate. In these circumstances, it was agreed that as long as the public finances remain under control, there could be room for further, moderate interest rate cuts, while still achieving the inflation targets set by the NBS.** Combined with recent interest rate increases abroad, this could help moderate the recent inflow of short-term capital and some of the unwanted upward pressure on the exchange rate. In fact, in May of this year, the NBS lowered its overnight rate, its main operational interest rate, by 50 basis points to 7 percent.23 To minimize inflationary risks, further cuts should await more concrete evidence of moderation in wage settlements and of fiscal control, or of the downside risks to economic activity. The modalities of the authorities’ IT framework could also be strengthened. In particular, it would be helpful to develop a quarterly forecasting framework, clarifying the role of the exchange rate in the transmission process, extend the time horizon of the inflation targets, and strengthen the transparency and accountability of the NBS’ decision-making process.24 28. Despite some appreciation, the exchange rate still appears appropriately competitive. While the exchange rate (at end-May) had appreciated by 5 percent in nominal *r On the downside, an increase in the household saving rate after its decline of recent years could lower consumption. In addition, investment could be more negatively affected by a lack of access to new bank credits (partly reflecting the hesitancy of some banks to lend more until an improved bankruptcy framework is in place and as some banks ready themselves for privatization) and by weak profitability. ** Preliminary econometric estimates suggest that international import prices (proxied by German producer prices), adjusted for Slovak import tariffs and surcharges, and unit labor costs in industry are important determinants of core CPI inflation. On the basis of this work, it would appear that the main impact of monetary policy on inflation is through the exchange rate; and projected core inflation could fall below the lower end (4.7 percent) of the NBS’ year-end target range. 23 In line with the recommendations of the February MAE mission, the NBS is planning to make the two-week repo facility its main instrument for domestic monetary policy operations. 24 A MAE technical assistance mission visited Bratislava in February to advise the authorities on the possible transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting framework. It was noted that the NBS was probably a year or two away from meeting these requirements of a formal IT framework. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- effective terms since the staff study for tbe last Article IV consultation indicated that the level of the exchange rate was appropriately competitive, recent indicators suggest that the tradable goods sector has remained competitive. This is because continued wage moderation and gains in labor productivity have mitigated potential competitiveness losses, and relative unit labor costs have declined. Moreover, actual export performance has been strong: Slovakia increased its export market share in 1999, and exports have performed strongly and the trade deficit has continued to narrow so far in 2000. Nevertheless, the macroeconomic fi-amework rests on a strong external sector and any further loss of competitiveness could put the envisaged external profile at risk, as -well as the needed stimulus from the external sector for overall growth. In a related vein, at this stage, the exchange rate may be the main channel through which monetary policy affects the economy. The NBS could lower interest rates if confronted with fbture upward pressure on the exchange rate Corn capital inflows, as long as inflationary objectives were not threatened; otherwise support from a tighter fiscal stance would be needed. Without such support, monetary policy could be put in a difficult position, in which it is hard for monetary policy to ignore external objectives. B. 2001 and the Medium Term 29. In addition to bringing core inflation down further in 2001 and later years, a number of other key objectives-broadly consistent with those included in the Joint Assessment and thus moving EU accession forward-were viewed as essential elements of the medium-term macroeconomic framework. These were: a On the external side, a current account deficit of about 3 percent of GDP by 2003, which would also support a number of other important objectives: with higher FDI resulting in a significant surplus for the capital account, the ratio of external debt to GDP would fall to 43 percent in 2003 compared with 56 percent in 1999, international reserves of the NBS would increase (perhaps to 134 percent of short-term debt and around 4 months of imports of goods and services), and external vulnerability would thereby be reduced significantly. 0 A gradual reduction in the deficit of the general government to about 2 percent of GDP by 2003, which would help to secure an external current account deficit of 3 percent of GDP by that year. At the same time, non-government investment as a share of GDP is projected to decline somewhat from its present high level. Higher internally generated funds in the enterprise sector-the result of higher productivity and profitability spurred by structura1 reform-would raise saving and tirther support external adjustment. In fact, exports over the medium term are projected fairly conservatively, and saving in the tradable good sector could correspondingly be higher than in this scenario. 0 The important contribution of structural reform to economic growth. Lower tax rates and reduced government expenditure in relation to GDP should “crowd in” private sector activity, also contributing to raising growth overall. All told-ensuring that investment is productive-a key objective would be to increase real GDP growth to over 5 percent on a sustainable basis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- 30. Given these objectives, Fund staff presented a workshop in Bratislava designed to generate dialogue and to encourage a range of government officials to think about medium-term fiscal challenges within an overall macroeconomic framework.2s One basic issue was to discuss possible measures to secure the fiscal deficit targets established within the macroeconomic framework and to identify early on the tensions that could emerge. In the latter regard, the importance of identifying spending targets, consistent with the fiscal deficit targets, as well as the share of expenditure that is pre-committed, was stressed. The discussion also focused on defining the authorities’ goals for spending on infiastntcture, accession to the EU (the authorities have set up a unit in the Finance Ministry for that purpose) and other international organizations, and the costs of reforms, with a view to calibrating other discretionary public spending to safeguard the fiscal target while also reducing the tax burden. To help prioritize public expenditure, the workshop presented material comparing the level and structure of primary expenditure in the Slovak Republic to other countries. Table 5 provides the broad outlines of the macroeconomic framework, while Table 6 presents the medium-term fiscal scenario that lies behind it.26 An accompanying selected issues paper includes the material presented at the workshop. 31. With preparations starting for the budget for 2001, the workshop and the discussions more generally prompted a dialogue on fiscal policy. In line with the medium- term framework, a further reduction in the deficit of the general government would be called for-to about 2% percent of GDP (excluding privatization receipts and bank restructuring costs)-and staff commended the authorities for having already started their preparations for the 2001 budget. Notwithstanding the positive impact that a projected pickup in domestic demand would have on revenue, the ratio of overall revenue to GDP would be expected to drop in the face of the welcome reduction in the corporate income tax and the removal of the import surcharge.*’ In addiuon, with tax compliance remaining an area of concern, containing expenditure would have to figure prominently in meeting the suggested fiscal target, even assuming that improved tax administration would yield a moderate increase in 25 The workshop was attended by about 35 officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Economy, the NBS, and the offrice of the Deputy Prime Minister for the Economy. 26 This scenario is basically in line with the one developed for the last Article IV consultation (&I/99/155) in terms of growth and inflation. With regard to the external sector, the current framework envisages larger current account deficits (of 2.9 percent of GDP by 2003 instead of close to balance); this is accompanied by higher FDI, partly reflecting improved prospects for EU accession. 27 Having reduced the import surcharge from 7 percent to 5 percent in January 2000, the authorities’ intention is to reduce it to 3 percent by July and to eliminate it by January 2001. Fund staff strongly supported the removal of the import surcharge. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-32- tax revenue in 200 1. To contain expenditure, and raise revenue to some degree, Fund staff and the authorities worked to identify several measures to be considered (see Appendix IV). Among them, the strengthening of tax administration and eligibility criteria and means testing of social benefits as well as the introduction of a more streamlined system of benefits administration would be particularly important. 32. While it is likely that the unemployment rate has peaked-and the official figures surely overstate the actual number of people without jobs-structural measures are essential for dealing seriously with unemployment. Continued high unemployment would clearly be an undesirable outcome from both an economic and social standpoint, and would put additional strain on public finances and the social security system. Measures aimed at improving incentives for seekin.g work and job creation would include improving the targeting and administration of benefits available for the unemployed, and reducing the high rate of social security contributions (Box 3 provides more details). 33. On the structural front, the authorities emphasized their commitment to forge ahead with banking system reform. In this regard, in collaboration with the World Bank, the three large state-owned banks were being readied for privatization with a view to privatizing them as quickly as possible.*” Staff welcomed this development as well as the recent approval of the amendments to the banking act, but stressed the importance of avoiding a culture of regulatory forbearance and a repetition of the drawn out process of dealing with the Investment and Development Bank (IRB). In this regard, it was seen as essential to ensure a prompt resolution to the problems of small- and medium-size banks. More generally, timely implementation of the extended powers of bank supervisors is crucial to the f%ture soundness of the banking system. Putting in place a system of prompt corrective action, and establishing the legal framework to undertake supervision on a consolidated basis, would put supervision on a stronger footing. Banking sector vulnerabilities-related to credit, currency, interest rate, and liquidity risks-make it all the more important to ensure that banks and their supervision are strengthened. This is essential in its own right, and to ensure that capital inflows are appropriately intermediated.29 ** While this might lead to a higher deficit of the general government, reflecting payments of interest on recapitalization bonds (about 1 percent of GDP), this would not, in the staffs view, endanger the key objectives of the macroeconomic framework and should be accommodated in a higher fiscal deficit target. This is because the additional impact of interest payments on aggregate demand is likely to be small: these payments would serve to compensate for losses that would otherwise be incurred by the state-owned banks; and the recapitalization would go hand in hand with significant restructuring and financial discipline in the recapitalized banks. 29 See Appendix V for more details on the banking sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - 34. There are also ongoing efforts to strengthen the bankruptcy framework. This included recent efforts to buttress draft amendments by revising them to give greater control to creditors over the choice and actions of the liquidator and by requiring strengthened reporting requirements of the liquidator to creditor committees. Fund staff also encouraged the authorities to continue improving bankruptcy legislation, particularly in relation to the reorganization of viable enterprises, by adding fast-track features. Once the new bankruptcy framework is in place-ideally by July of this year-it will be important to allow the restructuring agency to begin its work without delay.30 It is crucial that the agency undertakes its work free from political pressure, and there is considerable merit in the agency transferring control of its assets to the private sector-involving the sales of loans and/or the auctioning of asset management control-in order to expedite restructuring at the enterprise level. 35. In the enterprise sector, a key goal is to strengthen corporate governance and raise profitability, including through further privatization. Several indicators (e.g., net profits of the non-financial sector, inter-enterprise arrears, and only limited hedging of foreign borrowing) suggest that enterprise governance has been weak. While the new bankruptcy framework can be expected to contribute to better governance, additional steps could include bringing accounting standards closer to international practices, encouraging better disclosure of company results, and strengthening the rights of minority shareholders. The authorities agreed, noting that progress was being made in particular on minority shareholders’ rights, and that further progress had to be made in improving accounting standards and improving disclosure. With regard to privatization, Fund staff welcomed the recent privatization of Siovnaft, but encouraged the completion of the privatization of the telecommunications company without undue delay in the coming months. In doing so, staff stressed that successful and transparent privatization deals would send a positive signal to foreign investors and set the stage for other deals. In addition, the authorities should reconsider the intention of keeping private participation in the remaining utilities to a . minority share. While the recent increases in administered prices should have improved the financial position of public utilities and transport companies, this is no substitute for improved efficiency. In a related vein, until privatization, Fund staff urged caret3 monitoring and evaluation of the borrowing and investment plans of public enterprises, and oversight of management activities, with a view to strong governance, avoiding state guarantees, and meeting macroeconomic objectives. 3o Bank restructuring involves the carve out of bad loans from the state-owned banks, which are to be worked-out by the restructuring agency.

Slovakia’s trade regime is relatively open, and it is important to guard against policy reversals that threaten to reduce its openness or increase uncertainty about the direction of policy. On the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness, Slovakia is ranked “2”, (“ 1” denotes the most open regime and “10” the most restrictive). There is a wide dispersion in the tariff rates-with statutory rates ranging from zero on certain raw materials to as high as 233 percent on few luxury goods-but average tariffs are estimated at 12 percent. Tariff quotas for current and minimum access to the market have been applied since 1995. Quantitative controls have been largely eliminated, though the government, in 1999, introduced quantitative quotas on imports of footwear from China and quotas on imports of swine meat from the Czech Republic. 37. The government has introduced several legislative changes to liberalize capital account transactions and has also drawn a timetable to eliminate remaining capital account restrictions. On December 3 1, 1999, a new amendment to the Foreign Exchange Act-which includes provisions that ease the rules on trading of foreign securities and foreign government bonds on the Slovak capital market-became effective. The previous requirement that foreign securities had to be issued in an OECD member country was abolished. Another Act on Collective Investments-which replaces the 1992 Act on Investment Companies and Investment Funds-became effective on January 1,200O. The Act regulates the operations of investment fimds, investment management tinds and depositories. In addition, an amendment to the 1990 Act on Bonds-which deregulates the issuance and trading of securities, harmonizing the acts and regulations with the principles va1i.d in OECD member countries-also entered into effect on January 1,200O. 38. The authorities’ efforts to reform the enterprise and financial sectors has been supported by the World Bank in the context of preparation for an Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan from the World Bank. Under the Bank-Fund collaboration agreement of 1989, World Bank adjustment lending operations should take place in the context of an overall assessment of macroeconomic policies by the Fund. The World Bank has indicated to the authorities that consideration of the loan to deal with the problems in the enterprise and financial sector would depend on the existence of an arrangement with the Fund or a staff-monitored program to establish a framework for providing an assessment of macroeconomic policies. Staff had agreed to either of these possibilities, though a request has not yet been made by the Slovak authorities. 39. Since the last Article IV consultation, considerable gains have been made to stabilize the economy and accelerate structural reform, thus setting the basis for improving economic performance on ,a sustained basis. Decisive fiscal actions contributed to a reduction in excessive fiscal and external current account deficits, and core inflation seems set to decline over the course of this year. The authorities should also be commended Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35- for some very important steps that have been taken toward restructuring and privatizing state- owned banks and enterprises, strengthening banking regulation and supervision, and initiating necessary legal reform, notably by strengthening the bankruptcy law. Against this background, progress in accession talks with the EU, including agreement between the government and the European Commission on a set of medium-term economic policies as documented in the recent Joint Assessment, has added to market confidence and contributed to lowering the cost of foreign borrowing. 40. It is important to build on these successes and to ensure that recent gains are not lost. Indeed, this was emphasized by the authorities during the consultation discussions. And given past problems and delays, there is no time to lose if Slovakia is to catch up with the more advanced transition countries in the region and move closer to the EU. On the heels of huge external current account deficits in the past and the associated rapid build-up of external debt, it is important to pursue continued external adjustment and reduce external vulnerabilities generally. Continued fiscal adjustment would contribute to this effort, and to ensuring that inflation objectives are met. Further and significant privatization of the bank and enterprise sectors and improvements in the bankruptcy framework, ideally by end-year, would help improve financial discipline and performance. Work in these areas is already well advanced: it is essential that it be completed without delay. 41. Firm efforts in the fiscal area would be especially important in protecting and consolidating macroeconomic stability. In this regard, staff would urge that the deficit of the general government be kept close to the authorities’ target in 2000, followed by a narrowing of the deficit in subsequent years. This will require strong determination in 2001 as considerable pressures on the budget are already beginning to mount. While the authorities agreed with the staffs assessment of the appropriate targets for the general government deficit for this year and next, delivering on these targets may present difficulties given the diversity of views within the coalition government and the continued difficulties in controlling the operations of the extra-budgetary funds. Broad-based agreement within the government on fiscal matters can only help to secure fiscal objectives. Improving the timeliness and quality of data on the overall operations of the general government also can only help to improve the formulation and delivery of fiscal policy. Staff would suggest that the authorities undertake a self-assessment of fiscal transparency, using the IMF questionnaire developed for that purpose, as part of their ongoing efforts to improve fiscal reporting. 42. As recognized by the authorities, structural weaknesses in the budget need to be addressed over the medium term too. Relatively high government expenditure and tax rates, particularly concerning payroll taxes, impede private sector activity, employment in the formal sector, and future economic growth. It is important for policymakers, while aiming to meet medium-term fiscal targets, to deal with these impediments, as well as other fiscal tensions that can arise because of the potential fiscal costs on the road to EU accession (and NATO), infrastructure needs, and the costs of reform. To help resolve these tensions, improving tax administration could raise fiscal revenues significantly. But the bulk of fiscal - adjustment will need to come from lower discretionary spending: lowering, and improving Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-36- the targeting and administration of social benefits would help keep expenditure in check. In addition, designing fiscal policy in a medium-term framework would provide more opportunity to manage fiscal policy strategically. 43. The staff supports the authorities’ efforts to bring core inflation down further in the medium-term, in the context of an inflation targeting cum flexible exchange rate regime. This framework has worked well so far, if only because inflation and exchange rate considerations have not been in conflict .with one another, though capital inflows may well lead to increasing challenges in the period ahead. As one avenue for preparing for this challenge, the authorities should endeavor to strengthen the modalities of their inflation targeting framework. More proximately, the authorities will want to avoid unwanted upward pressure on the exchange rate from its current and broadly appropriate competitive level. The authorities should seek to limit the impact of inflows by using privatization proceeds to retire foreign debt. Undertaking sterilized foreign exchange market intervention is another possibility, but it is likely to have only a limited impact on resisting sustained upward exchange rate pressure and it is, of course, costly. Allowing domestic interest rates to decline is another option, as long as inflation objectives are not threatened. If capital inflows were still to pose challenges to macroeconomic management because of their impact on inflation, or the current account in the face of an appreciating currency, fiscal policy would need to be tightened to contain demand pressures. 44. High unemployment must be curbed. Not only does it strain the public finances and the social security system, it is clearly undesirable from a broader economic and social standpoint. Since growth alone would appear to be insufficient to make a serious enough dent in the problem, other factors-including the high rate of payroll taxes and the weak targeting and administration of social benefits-must be addressed, with a view to improving incentives for seeking work and job creation. 45. Efforts to accelerate structural reform in the banking sector are most welcome the challenge now is to complete the agenda and improve governance. In the banking sector, staff urges the authorities, in collaboration with the World Bank, to privatize the state- owned banks as soon as possible and would welcome privatization of at least one of them by year end, with a view to trying to complete the process by end-2001. It is encouraging that various political obstacles have been overcome to allow fi~ll foreign ownership of two of the three large state-owned banks and significant foreign majority ownership in a third. Nevertheless, it is also important to ensure a prompt resolution to the problems ofsmall- and medium-size banks. While these banks represent a small share of total banking activity-and the threat of systemic consequences is therefore not the main concern-the authorities must be cognizant of the moral hazard consequences that supervisory forbearance may have on the rest of the system. Further steps are necessary to strengthen the supervision and regulation of the banking system. 46. Stronger banks, along with a strengthened bankruptcy framework, are a crucial element in the strategy for promoting restructuring and financial discipline in the enterprise sector. Thus, approval by Parliament of proposed amendments to the bankruptcy- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - law by mid-year and effective implementation of the bankruptcy framework would be most welcome. Moreover, measures to accelerate and complete enterprise privatization are to be commended and are needed. Additional measures could be taken to improve corporate governance and financial performance, including by bringing accounting standards closer to international practices and encouraging better disclosure of company results, as well as by establishing clear financial performance targets for evaluating management in those enterprises not envisaged for more near-term privatization. 47. All told, protecting and consolidating macroeconomic stability and accelerating structural reform are key to locking in future prosperity. Such actions are necessary for improving financial discipline, encouraging productive investment, laying the basis for job creation, and achieving durable and rapid economic growth. 48. The provision of data by the Slovak authorities is generally adequate for Fund surveillance and the subscription of Slovakia to the special data dissemination standard is welcome. With an eye to enhancing the conduct and monitoring of economic policies, the staff encourages the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the statistical base in a number of areas-including trade deflators, consolidated general government operations, and public enterprises-drawing on the upcoming multitopic technical assistance mission by the Statistics Department that is tentatively scheduled toward the end of this year. 49. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38- Table 1.

The Slovak Republic became a member of the World Bank on January 1, 1993, by joint succession with the Czech Republic to the membership of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. 2. A Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) (US%450 million), approved in June 1991 with Czechoslovakia, was fully disbursed. The Czech and Slovak Republics assumed repayment obligations in the ratio of 2: 1. The Japanese Export-Import Bank cofinanced the SAL in the amount of US$200 million 3. The Board approved a telecommunications loan in May 1993 to strengthen the international and domestic long-distance networks. The loan, with World Bank participation of US$55 million, was cofinanced with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. 4. An Economic Recovery Loan (ERL), approved in November 1993, was fully disbursed. The ERL provided support to the country’s fiscal and structural adjustments associated with the shocks following the breakup of the Federation. The loan supported reforms in four areas: (a) fiscal retrenchment; (b) strengthening and diversifying the fiscal sector; (c) continued privatization, private sector development and enterprise restructuring; and (d) a more efficient social safety net. 5. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), which evaluated the transformation progress of Slovakia’s economy and the main EU accession challenges, was completed in early 1998, on the basis of missions to Slovakia in December 1996 and January 1997. 6. Since the new government took office in late 1998, the Bank’s program of assistance with Slovakia has expanded in several areas. Work to support reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors is being pursued though the preparation of an Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL). An anti-corruption diagnostic has been conducted to identify pocket areas of corruption and support thle government’s anti-corruption reform program, and the Bank is providing technical support to public sector reform and has undertaken assessments of public procurement and financial accountability. and assistance has also been initiated in the social sectors; a social sect.ors expenditures review and an assessment of poverty in the context of a study on emplloyment and growth are underway. Support for reforms in social protection are being supported through the preparation of a Social Benefits Administration Project. 7. A first Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Slovakia will be presented to the Board in July. The overall strategic objective of the CAS is to put Slovakia on a path of rapid and sustained convergence with its ‘Western European neighbors and improve living conditions, particularly among the vulnerable segments of the population. A program of lending and non-lending support would focus on: (i) completing transformation reforms, - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. -51- APPENDIX II restoring high growth, and maintaining economic stability; (ii) strengthening governance and institutions; and (iii) improving social security, enhancing human development and meeting environmental standards. Proposed Bank lending would amount to $500 million and IFC investment about $100 million over three years, in the base case. 8. The IFC opened a resident representative ofice in Bratislava in May 1998 and is expanding its involvement in the country. It has invested in industry, telecommunications and the financial sector and is providing advice on foreign investment. Sectors of particular interests for titure IFC investments include the financial sector and utilities in the context of privatization, joint ventures and SMEs, and social sectors (private pension scheme, health and education). MIGA has several guarantees outstanding. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52- APPENDIX III Slovak Republic: Statistical Issues 1. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy making, the quality of the data, in particular of the national accounts, has improved in recent years. The main issues remaining are (i) the lack of reliable data on prices and volume of imports and exports, (ii) a lack of timely data on the overall operations of the general government and inconsistencies between government accounts and national accounts on government consumption, and (iii) the absence of comprehensive data on public and private enterprises. Slovakia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), meets the SDSS specifications, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet. 2. With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a free and open data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and are also published regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and on the Internet. r Changes in definitions and coverage, however, often diminish the usefi.rIness of published data. Data on core surveillance variables are provided regularly to the Fund, and with minimal lags: a week or less for exchange rates and foreign exchange reserves; three weeks or less for general government financing and detailed state budget implementation data; ten days to a month for consumer prices, ‘reserve money, broad money, and interest rates; two months for foreign trade data; and about three months for other fiscal, balance of payments, and national accounts data. Real sector and prices 3. Much progress has been made in the elaboration of the Slovak national accounts statistics. However, output estimates for the last few years may yet have to be revised in the future. In particular, the contribution of the government sector to consumption and value added is difficult to reconcile with fiscal data.* In addition, private consumption seems to be underestimated when compared with data on retail sales. Another outstanding issue is the construction of reliable price deflators for imports and exports that would enable better estimation of volume changes. In addition, very strong seasonality in stock building complicates analysis. In the area of consumer price indices, it is important that historical data are produced for core inflation. Implementation of the recommendations of the STA technical assistance mission on the national income accounts, which took place in February 2000, should lead to an improvement in the compilation and presentation of these data. It would be important to improve the country’s statistics in general, and, to this end, a multitopic STA mission that has been included in the RAP for FY 2001 would be crucial. ‘Data are available on the web site of the Slovak Statistics Office (www.statistics.&), the National Bank of Slovakia (www.nbs.sk), and the Ministry of Finance (www.finance.gov.sk). * The Slovak Statistics Office (SSO) has indicted that a change in the methodology to derive government consumption that was carried out for the 1999 data will be carried out for previous periods only at the time of a general revision of the national accounts. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIXIII 4. In the enterprise sector, it would be very useful if the authorities produced systematic and detailed accounts of the financial positions of the public enterprises. It would also be helpful if Slovakia could resolve the problems in reporting accurate data on privatization and private sector activity, since the National Property Fund (NPF) does not publish annual accounts of its operations. Fiscal sector 5. Improvements have been made over the past year in fiscal statistics, and data on government operations were published in the 1999 GFS Yearbook for the first time, In addition, the Ministry of Finance has recently introduced a Quarterly Review on Public Finances of the Slovak Republic. However, fiscal statistics provided for the GFS Yearbook, covering the consolidated operations of the central government, are available only for 1998 and do not comply fully with international statistical conventions. The authorities do not currently report data on expenditure by function or data on debt, and no subannual data are reported for IFS. 6. The monthly reporting on the state budget operations is inconsistent with the annual budget data, as the monthly reporting also includes some transactions on the Road Fund, which is an extrabudgetary fund. Also, a fimctional breakdown of government spending would be useC.rl. Moreover, the NPF should publish annual accounts, as mentioned above. Up until end- 1999, reported interest expenditure excluded expenditure associated with discount bonds. However, starting with the 2000 Budget, the authorities have began reporting the discount. External sector 7. The Slovak Republic provides balance of payments statistics in a timely manner. The balance of payment statements are presented in two formats, an analytical presentation and the standard presentation, and are reported on a quarterly basis. Banks are now reporting their arbitrage transactions accurately. Improvements have also been made in reporting nonresidents’ claims and liabilities in Slovak koruny. Information on external debt, including short-term debt, is reported on a timely basis. Some problem areas remain, including: (a) the measurement of inward portfolio investment; (b) the need for more detailed and timely information on public guarantees on enterprises’ foreign debt; and (c) the need to improve data compilation on the composition of exports, to enable needed assessment of export behavior (e.g., by being able to exclude re-exports with low value added). Monetary sector 8. Monetary statistics are of good quality, and are reported on a timely basis to the Fund. A STA mission that went to Bratislava in February 1999 ascertained that (i) banks’ nonstandard loans have been reclassified as of the data from January 1997 onwards in claims on the relevant sector; (ii) loan loss provisions and depreciation of fixed capital are now - separately identified; (iii) banks’ nonstandard claims are reported as memorandum items; and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - APPENDIX III (iv) starting with January 1998, the loan loss provisions in the NBS’s monetary data are also separately identified. The same STA mission recommended that, for the purpose of monetary statistics, securities and equities, which are currently booded at the face value or the purchase price (based on maturity ant the motive for holding), be valued at end-of-periodfair values.

There was broad agreement that if fiscal targets were met, lowering tax rates would need to be carefUlly coordinated with expenditure reduction. Though it is important to see some tax rates fall, there are limits on how quickly taxes can realistically be cut without the necessary determination on the expenditure side. Expenditure measures l The authorities could follow up on thleir 1999 decision to provide moderate increases in public sector wages, which should also help to temper private sector wage demands. According to available statistics, the average wage in public administration (excluding public education and health) is well above, and had been growing at a faster rate than, the economy-wide average wage. Restraining the increase in government wages would also allow the authorities to limit other budgetary expenditures linked to wages (e.g., social security contributions). l The authorities could also rationalize firther discretionary spending on goods and services, equipment, maintenance, and other non-personnel items. A scaling back of subsidies (including the housing subsidy) could be another area of saving. l Regarding the social security funds, lthere are a number of meaningful first steps that could be taken as part of a medium-term strategy aimed at addressing underlying weaknesses more permanently. In the health funds, these could include: (i) reviewing the collection system and increasing compliance with payments of contributions; (ii) introducing deductibles and higher co-payments; and (iii) continuing to reduce the costs of health facilities. Measures for the pension system could include: (i) better enforcement in the collection of social security contributions; (ii) limiting the pensions of retirees who are working (so-called double dipping); (iii) imposing a penalty for early retirement; and, (iv) gradually raising the retirement age (which at 55-60 for men and 53-57 for women is low by internatilonal standards). l There was agreement on the need to cut back untargeted family and other state benefits- which comprise 13 different programs, many of which overlap with more than 20 social assistance programs operated by regi.onal offices-by strengthening eligibility criteria and means testing. With the wide diversity of programs, abuse may result in the unwarranted accumulation of benefits. It may be possible to realize substantial savings by introducing a more streamlined system of benefits administration, possibly to include a singIe means-tested program of social assistance aimed at ensuring social protection for the neediest. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - APPENDIX IV l Fund staff welcomed the government’s plans to reassess the justification and functioning of the extrabudgetary Funds and urged the authorities to examine these Funds on a case- by-case basis, noting that consolidating activities within the respective Ministries could be a possible source of expenditure saving. l In all these structural areas, and to preserve the social safety net in the most economically efficient way, the authorities could seek early further assistance from the World Bank. Revenue measures l An increase in the lower VAT rate from 10 percent to 12 percent accompanied by a reduction in the standard rate from 23 percent to 22 percent should be considered. Such a reduction in the differential between the standard and the lower rate would reduce distortions, and would help generate revenue. Any move to shift goods and services from the standard VAT rate to the lower rate should be resisted. l Reconsideration of the introduction of the tax on motor vehicles. With tax administration continuing to face significant challenges in mobilizing revenue, and tax arrears reportedly increasing, the authorities’ commitment to follow up on the recommendations of the recent IMF technical assistance mission on tax administration was welcome. Action in this area could focus on the formulation of a tax administration reform strategy aimed, among others, at establishing a separate headquarters office of the Tax Administration and strengthening its management, improving the process of providing VAT refunds, strengthening collection enforcement procedures, reducing tax arrears, improving staff training, and establishing a proper regional office structure. l The first steps in the reform of the personal income tax (PIT), including the long overdue adjustment in personal income tax brackets were also welcome. However, a reduction in the number of personal income tax brackets could facilitate taxpayer compliance. Reforming the PIT also has a role in helping to combat unemployment, as it would contribute to reducing the wedge between employers’ total labor costs and employees’ take-home pay, which is close to 60 percent. To this end, the staff recommended, as part of the medium-term strategy, a gradual reduction in the social security contribution rates-though making room for this latter action would mean expenditure cuts. l Further adjustments in the structure and increases in excise taxes would need to be made, so as to bring them in line with the EU. Finally, the operations of the National Property Fund (NPF) deserved special attention, in particular, the possible redemption of its privatization bonds for cash. As this was not expected until the very end of 2001, with the impact therefore felt in 2002, these operations were excluded from the fiscal deficit figures for the earlier year. It is worth noting, however, that, to the extent that the NPF bonds could be redeemed more gradually, the pressures on the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - APPENDIX IV fiscal accounts would be spread out over time, and thereby lessened for a particular year. Possibilities in this regard include exchanging them for shares in utility companies or through other freely negotiated methods. To the extent that the NPF bonds are exchanged for cash, the potential effects of their redemption on domestic demand and the external current account deficit would argue for offsetting fiscal actions.

Banks are aggregated by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) into five groups. At end-1999, the bulk of the financial intermediation was undertaken by group 1 (45.8 percent of total assets compared with 45.6 percent at end-1998) and group 2 (34.2 percent of bank assets compared with 36.8 percent at end-1998). Group 1 comprises the largest state-owned banks: Slovenska Sporitelna (SLSP), Vseobecna Uverova Banka (VUB), and Investicna a Rozvojova Banka (IRB). Group 2 is made up of 17 small- or medium-size banks which are totally or majority privately-owned, either by foreign or domestic investors. Group 3 comprises two special household savings banks, in the early stages of their operations; they fund around 80 percent of their assets with savings accounts and 84 percent of their loans are medium-term consumer loans. In group 4 there are two special state-owned financial institutions (the Slovak Guarantee and Development Bank and the Consolidation Bank). Group 5 contains branches of foreign banks.’ Apart from its ownership of the three group 1 banks, the state has participation, directly or through its enterprises, in four smaller banks. 2. In total, as of end-1999, the banking system comprised 26 financial institutions holding Sk 783 billion in assets (about US$18 billion or 100.3 percent of GDP).* Banking system assets declined by 3 percent between 1998 and 1999, partly due to the higher provisions that were necessary to cover impaired assets. The capital adequacy ratio for the Slovak banks in 1999 was 8.78 percent compared with 3.19 percent in 1998 and 4.8 1 percent in 1997.3 This improvement was basically due to the restructuring of the largest state-owned banks. However, it should also be noted that these ratios may be overstating the true amount of capital because of inadequate provisions and overvalued collateral (described below). ’ The share of capital owned by foreign banks, broken down by the country of license is: Austria (23.5 percent); Czech Republic (20 percent); the Netherlands (19.6 percent); the U.S. (12.8 percent); Germany (13.2 percent); France (3.5 percent); Italy (2.7 percent); and the Russian Federation (1 percent). Minor stakes belong also to the EBRD (2.9 percent). ’ This ratio compares with 85 percent for Poland, 86 percent for Hungary, 127 percent for Slovenia, and 262 percent for the Czech Republic at end-1998. For EU countries, at end- 1998, this ratio was 198 percent for Italy, 235 percent for Austria, 326 percent for France and 345 percent for Germany, at end-1998. Source: IFS and Bankstat (Thompson Bankwatch). 3 These ratios differ from those reported in the Staff Report for the 1999 Article IV consultation (SM/99/155, July 2, 1999) as the NBS used to remove from the aggregate figures those banks that had negative net worth.

The main problem faced by the Slovak banking sector has been the low quality of its loan portfolio. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that most of the loan portfolio has been inadequately provisioned and/or covered with overvalued collateral. This situation-which affects mostly the largest state-owned banks, but it is also a feature of the rest of the system-has given rise to a significant amount of accrued losses, both recognized and unrecognized. 4. The large amount of impaired assets can be explained by three main factors. First, the largest state-owned banks inherited probiematic loans from the central planning days, and accumulated more of these loans during the 1994-98 period, in part because of political interference in bank lending practices. Second, Slovak enterprises have tended to run their businesses with high leverage ratios and ,unhedged foreign exchange or interest rate positions.4 Weak enforcement of bankruptcy regulations, already in need of reform, and/or the reliance on the sometimes implicit state guarantee of state-owned companies’ liabilities have encouraged managers to G.md projects with debt. Third, the volatile financial environment, characterized at times by significant swings in interest and exchange rates, especially during 1997-98, manifested itself in deteriorating financial performance.’ Higher interest rates and the currency depreciation in the face of unhedged foreign borrowings made it more difficult for bank clients to repay their loans. 5. In all, these factors were reflected in poor banking sector performance in 1998 and 1999. The three largest state-owned banks became dangerously undercapitalized, suffering from poor credit portfolios and substantial losses. The smaller commercial banks also had difficulties, even though in most cases they did not have the heavy burden of the problem loans inherited from the past. Some private banks had foreign shareholders that helped them fare better. 4 Estimates provided to Fund staff by several bank managers suggest a high debt-to-equity ratio for the enterprise sector in the 2.5-4 range, which roughly corresponds to a Standard and Poor credit rating of B or lower. 5 High volatility in emerging markets exposes economic agents to large unexpected changes in key prices (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices). This exposure provides a strong justification for corporations in emerging markets to operate with lower debt-to-equity ratios than those operating in more mature markets or, alternatively, for relying on hedging strategies that provide contingent capital if necessary to cover unexpected losses.

The government has designed a comprehensive program for restructuring, capitalizing and privatizing state-owned banks. It has done so in the face of increasing non- performing loans, and pressures to raise banks’ capital bases and comply with international standards with respect to provisions and collateral valuation. The program was developed with World Bank support and was approved by the Slovak Cabinet in August 1999. A Steering Committee has been established to take decisions on the implementation of the program. A Co-ordination Unit for restructuring and privatization (BPU) has been charged with carrying out the decisions of the Steering Committee and also managing day-to-day activity. 7. Bank restructuring and recapitalization involves bad-asset swaps with the following features: l A carve out of classified loans in the portfolio of the three troubled banks in two stages. l A transfer of the carved out loans to the Consolidation Bank and/or to the recently established Slovak Consolidation Agency. l A swap of the carved out loans with a claim against the consolidation agencies, guaranteed by the government. The current intention is to replace this claim in 2001 by government bonds.6 l Cash injections to improve banks’ liquidity and equity. 8. First Carve-Out. The first carve out was completed in December 1999 and comprised loans in the worst categories (doubtful and 10ss).~ It involved a carve out of Sk 45 billion 6 While the financial characteristics of these bonds have not yet been finalized, discussions so far suggest that they could have a IO-year maturity with a fixed interest rate and semiannual payment of interest. Fund staff had earlier recommended that the recapitalization of the three state-owned banks be undertaken in the most transparent way, i.e., by initially using government bonds with clearly specified terms. This was seen as preferable to other schemes involving future government obligations and guarantees with incomplete financial terms. However, the authorities wanted to avoid the immediate fiscal costs on the 2000 budget and other legislative complications. 7 There are five categories of loans: (i) Standard: the client is solvent; delays in payment do not exceed 30 days. (ii) Special-mention: the client is solvent but subject to slight economic or financial problems; delays of payment are between 30 and 90 days; (iii) Substandard: there is considerable risk of the claim not being paid in full; delays of payment between 90 and 180 days; (iv) Doubtful and litigious: repayment in full seems highly improbable or questionable; client is insolvent; delays in payment between 180 and 360 days; and (v) Loss claims: the claim is uncollectible; delays in payment in excess of 360 days; client is in bankruptcy or liquidation.

In the case of SLSP and VUB, classified loans were removed from the balance sheets at face value; but loan provisions remained on their balancle sheets. In the case of IRB, loans were carved out at their value, net of reserves; thus, its claim on the consolidation agencies is smaller than the total face value of the loans removed. 9. Cash injections. These were Sk 8.9 billion for VUB (6.7 percent of total gross assets); Sk 4.3 billion for SLSP (2.8 percent of total gross assets); and Sk 5.7 billion for IRB (4.3 percent of total gross assets).* The total cost of the first carve out plus cash injections was Sk 101.2 billion (14.2 percent of GDP in 1999); as a result, banks met the capital adequacy requirements according to Slovak standards in 1999. However this may not have been so by international standards if the over-valuation of collateral was significant. 10. Second carve out. It is expected to take place in the summer months and comprise part of the loans in the special-mention and substandard categories (around Sk 3 1 billion). The exact proportion of loans to be removed in the second carve out will be based on the reports of the individual banks’ external auditors and the privatization advisors. The loans will not be carved out at their nominal value, but net of provisions. The goal of the second carve-out is to reduce the proportion of classified loans to less than 20 percent and to have banks meet the 8 percent capital adequacy requirement according to international standards (i.e., adequately provisioned). The authorities estimate that the provisions remaining after the first carve out should be enough to adequately cover the classified loans on the banks’ balance sheets after the second carve out takes place. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how foreign investors will value the remaining portfolios. 11. VUB and SLSP have also undertaken operational restructuring measures. VUB reduced its employees from 7,600 in 1998 to 6,200 in 1999 and the final goal is to have 5,500 employees at end-2000. It also reduced its investments in non-bank related activities. In all, this helped VUB reduce non-interest expenses by 12 percent in 1999 while a further reduction of 6 percent is projected for 2000. SLSP reduced its employees from 7000 in 1997 to 6300 at the end of 1999. However, the recent acquisition of Priemyselna Banka implied an addition of 500 employees, raising the current number to 6800. The BPU expects SLSP to carry out further and significant operational restructuring in the immediate future to reduce further the number of employees. Plans a.lso involve the closure of 122 branches, bringing the SLSP retail network to 504 branches. 12. Following two years under NBS conservatorship, during which very little progress was made in the resolution of IRB’s condition or in the restructuring of its operations, the bank was recapitalized through the above-mentioned cash injections, and bad loans were ’ For the calculation of shares of loans and assets, individual total gross assets and total gross loans as of end-1998 were used (as reported by Bankstat, Thompson Financial Bankwatch). _ Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - APPENDIX V carved out. The authorities considered these steps necessary in readying the bank for privatization, but Fund staff has emphasized a flexible approach to privatization. This would entail allowing the privatization advisor to the IRB to offer it for sale without preconditions requiring the preservation of the bank as an institution or the maintenance of current employment levels. Staff has also recommended that in the event that the IRB either can not be sold or that only parts of the bank can be sold, its remaining assets should be liquidated. 13. Although the financial condition of the three largest state-owned banks improved somewhat after the first restructuring phase at end-99, problems remained. Despite an increase in the reported capital adequacy ratio for this group from -0.39 percent in 1998 to 17.43 percent in 1999, problems with collateral valuation and low provisions (that cover 44 percent of total classified loans, net of collateral and 22 percent of total classified loans if collateral is not considered) remain.g Fund staff has attempted to estimate the possible overvaluation of capital by adjusting the level of provisions and assuming different collateral values. The capital ratio could fall into the range below 14.2 percent but above 6.4 percent, depending on the assumptions. lo Moreover, notwithstanding some improvements in the banks’ portfolios (classified loans to total loans ratio went down to 28.6 percent in 1999, from 41.3 percent in 1998, and liquid assets went up to 27.4 percent of total assets in 1999, from 22.3 percent in 1998) they continued making substantial losses in 1999 (a negative return on assets (ROA) of 4.15 percent after negative ROAs of 2.17 percent and 0.75 percent in 1998 and 1997 respectively). 14. The government appears to have overcome political pressures to sell just minority stakes in the state-owned banks. Last February, the Government decided to sell its entire stake in VUB, IN3 and Banka Slovakia (a small state-owned bank).” Recently, for the IRB, the government has agreed to a more flexible approach, with a view to privatizing it in the most rapid way possible. With respect to SLSP, the government approved two possible ’ For comparison, provisions cover 126 percent of non performing loans in France, 192 percent in Germany, and 54 percent in Italy (Bankstat, Thompson Bankwatch, 1998). lo The assumptions are that 100 percent of all classified loans, 10 percent of special-mention loans, and 2 percent of the standard loans were provisioned. Assuming that collateral is fairly valued gives a capital ratio of 14.2 percent; reducing the value of collateral by 25 percent yields a capital ratio of 9.4 percent; and reducing the value of collateral by 50 percent suggests a capital ratio of 6.4 percent. I1 The current government stake in VUB, IRB and Banka Slovakia are 84.54 percent, 69.56 percent, and 60.07 percent of the banks’ total shares, respectively.

SMALL- AND m:DIUM-SIZE COMMERCIAL BANKS 15. The financial health of the small and medium-size commercial banks is quite diverse. Some of them have benefited from having foreign shareholders and have been able to maintain a strong solvency position in spite of the sometimes adverse situation. Many of the banks in this group have clearly been performing poorly. Given the pressures imposed by bank supervisors to raise their capital base and to comply with international standards, some of these smaller banks have already found international investors, thereby strengthening their capital base and increasing prospects of future profits. In other troubled banks, efforts to find partners have been less successful. 16. The capital adequacy ratios for these banks are quite mixed. The NBS reported that the capital adequacy ratio for this group at end-1999 was 12.9 percent. However, if provisions are adjusted to reflect international standards and under different assumptions of collateral over-valuation, the capital ratio could fall to within the range of 7.4-12.5 percent.13 Moreover, these figures mask difficulties in individual banks. Four banks out of 17 in this group did not comply with the capital adequacy regulations in 1999. 17. Banks in this group had a slightly positive ROA of 0.15 percent for 1999 on an aggregate basis.14 This was possible thanks to fee income, that compensated for the decline in the net interest rate margin from 1.17 percent in 1998 to 0.76 percent in 1999. Non-interest ‘* At present, the two possible privatization programs for SLSP are: (i) sale of 87.18 percent of total shares, which represent 89.7 perc,ent of the government stake. In this scenario, the government, through the Ministry of Finance would keep a 10 percent stake in SLSP; or (ii) sale of 63.85 percent of total shares, which represent 65.7 percent of the government’s stake (currently held through the National Property Fund), together with the possible sale of another 23.33 percent (i.e., the current stake held by the government through the Ministry of Finance), if an attractive offer is made. l3 The assumptions on provisions are 100 percent of all classified loans, 10 percent of special-mention loans and 2 percent of the standard loans were provisioned. Assuming that collateral is fairly valued gives a capital ratio of 12.5 percent; reducing the value of collateral by 25 percent yields a capital ratio of 9.1 percent; and reducing the value of collateral by 50 percent suggests a capital ratio of 7.4 percent. l4 This small positive ROA could easily turn negative if the right amount of provisions were made.

Fee income is less cyclical than interest rate margins and consequently it provides some cushion when times are not good. 18. While comprehensive data was unavailable for individual banks, roughly one half of the 17 banks in this group can be identified as a source of concern, based on qualitative analysis and information provided by the NBS. Given that these banks represent around 8.5 percent of total bank assets and their individual size range between 0.45 percent and 2.63 percent of total bank assets, the threat of any systemic consequence arising from their poor condition is not the main concern. The main concern at this stage is the moral hazard consequences that supervisory and regulatory forbearance may have on the rest of the system. For this reason, supervisors must act diligently and use the tools that were provided by the recent amendments to the Banking Law to ensure discipline in bank behavior and reduce excessive risk-taking in the future. l6 IV. BANKINGSECTORWLNEFCABILITIES 19. While macroeconomic imbalances have lessened and, in this sense, the conditions in the macroeconomy help to mitigate the risk of potential future losses, vulnerabilities remain. This reflects the significance noncompliance with prudential regulations and various aspects of credit, currency, interest rate and liquidity risks. 20. Credit risk. The main source of credit risk in Slovak banks emanates from the highly leveraged corporate sector. While the new bankruptcy law should induce lower debt to equity ratios, this may take some time. Inadequate diversification is also a source of credit risk. According to the NBS, all three banks in group 1, and 15 out of 17 banks in group 2 did not comply with the single exposure limit to non-bank clients (25 percent of bank capital), and 9 out of 17 banks in group 2 did not comply with the credit exposure limit to one single bank or banking group (80 percent of bank capital) in 1999. Credit risk also arises from the fact l5 The net interest rate margin is the ratio of the difference between interest income minus interest payments to net average assets. Net average assets are the bank assets net of provisions, averaged over the year. The non-interest rate margin is the ratio of fee income from foreign exchange transactions and securities operations minus operational expenses to net average assets. l6 New remedial measures introduced to the Banking Law include NBS powers to order an increase in bank equity when losses are over 10 percent of the existing equity capital, to restructure or to stop the payment of dividends, royalties or bonuses, to request a bank to file + extra reports on its financial condition, to order a member of the bank board to leave his/her position at the bank, and to suspend the voting rights of specific shareholders. The NBS has also been authorized the introduction of changes to the current loan classification system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - APPENDIX V that most loans are based on floating rates. This has the implication that the interest rate risk is assumed by bank clients (corporations and households) that do not hedge their exposure. Bank managers indicated that while products to hedge currency risk had become more common after 1998, protection against high interest rates is not commonly arranged. Moderating their risks, banks have kept large holdings of cash, loans to other banks, and government securities: the ratio of these transactions to loans is about 1 and, as indicated by bank managers, this ratio increases in times of high interest rates when, due to flight to quality, banks try to call in their loans and invest the proceeds in additional holdings of government securities. 21. Currency risk. Excessive exposure to currency risk may also be present. According to the NBS, 2 banks in group 1 and 11 out of 17 banks in group 2 did not comply with the open position limits in Euro, while 2 banks in group 1 and 3 out of 17 banks in group 2 did not comply with the open position limit in U.S. dollars, during 1999.17 22. Interest rate and liquidity risks. T:here is a considerable amount of maturity mismatch between bank assets and liabilities in Slovak Banks. Savings accounts represent 34 percent of total deposits, sight deposits account for 24 percent of deposits, while the remaining 42 percent are time deposits. However 80 percent of time deposits have maturities of up to 3 months (and 5 1 percent of time deposits have maturities of up to one month). On the asset side, 29 percent of all loans are long term (more than 5 years), 39 percent are medium term (between 1 and 5 years), and 32 percent are short term (up to one year). While floating interest rates can help banks avoid the interest rate risk (but not credit risk) implied by this mismatch, they remain exposed to liquidity risk. According to the NBS, 9 out of 17 banks in group 2, and 2 out of the 3 banks in group 1 did not comply with the liquidity regulations. ‘* v. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN BANKING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION 23. A number of new prudential regulations, and banking and tax legislation came into effect since the last Article IV consultation, and a new bankruptcy law is expected to come into effect by July 2000.” The new legislation and regulations include: (i) a new set of l7 Open foreign currency exposure comprises treasury operations, foreign denominated deposits and loans, and derivative transactions (currency forwards and swaps). l8 Prudential regulations on liquidity require that the ratio of the sum of liquid assets (cash and assets with maturities of up to one month) to the sum of liabilities with maturities of up to one month) be at least 100 percent. lg The draft amendment of the Bankruptcy Code was approved by the Legislative Council of the Government in February 2000. On March 22,200O the government approved this amendment and submitted it to Parliament for approval, For a description of the regulations and legislation issued before July 1999, see Slovak Republic-Selected Issues and Statistical- Appendix (SM/99/160, July 7, 1999).

There are still other issues that could usefully be addressed. In particular, putting in place a system of prompt corrective action would help avoid supervisory forbearance. In addition, introducing tougher criteria for provisioning and new capital requirements for market risk would improve prudential rules. Moreover, the new Banking Act does not provide the legal framework for consolidated supervision at a financial group level. Financial intermediation is undertaken in Slovakia under the universal banking model and banks can also invest in other financial or non-financial companies and can be owned by another financial intermediary (e.g., an insurance company).*’ While consolidated accounting does exist at the level of banks and their bank subsidiaries since 1996 and banks have to report their transactions on a consolidated basis with their non-bank subsidiaries, a true concept of consolidated supervision at the level of the financial conglomerate still does not exist in Slovakia. 25. One of the main problems of the nonexistence of consolidated supervision is the double counting of capital. According to the Slovak capital adequacy ratio, the sum of a bank’s investments in equity capital of other banks are only deducted from the reporting bank’s computable capital if such a sum is higher than 10 percent of the capital of the reporting bank (calculated without deducting that sum) or if it is higher than 10 percent of the capital of the bank in which the investment was made. An equivalent rule applies to subordinated claims. This means that double counting effectively exists across Slovak banks in the case of investments that represent less than 10 percent of bank capital. *’ The amendments pertained to the Banking Act 21/92, Act 118196 on the Protection of Bank Deposits, and Act 3 lo/92 on Home Savings. *’ A Slovak bank can own shares of other banks, other financial institutions, and industrial and commercial companies. If the investment is above 10 percent of the total equity of the acquired company or above 25 percent of the bank’s capital and reserves, the bank should require the consent of the NBS. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - APPENDIX V 26. Concerns also exist regarding the inclusion of all bank investments in the bank’s capital. Before March 2000, banks’ equity investment in non-banking subsidiaries (e.g., insurance companies and commercial companies) were not counted as bank capital. This provision was removed by the amendments to the CAR. While there may be some justifications to count bank investments in a commercial company as bank capital, investments in financial subsidiaries, that are consequently available to cover contingencies in those subsidiaries, should be removed from the reporting bank capital. VI. CONCLUDINGREMARKS 27. In collaboration with the World Bank, the three large state-owned banks should be readied for privatization in the best way possible, with a view to privatizing them as quickly as can be. 28. Timely and rigorous implementation of the extended powers of bank supervisors would also help the future soundness of the banking system. In this regard, the recent approval of the amendments to the tax and banking act are to be welcomed. Particularly relevant are the new powers granted to supervisors to request public disclosure of individual bank information, to impose corrective actions, and to establish and enforce improved prudential rules regarding large exposures and loan classification. The diligent application of these powers would help to bring Slovak banks in line with international standards and promote market discipline by making individual bank financial data available to domestic and international investors. It is important to avoid a culture of regulatory forbearance (and the repetition of the drawn-out process of dealing with the IRB). In this regard, it is essential to ensure a prompt resolution to the problems of small- and medium-size banks. Moreover, putting in place a system of prompt corrective action, and establishing the legal framework to undertake supervision on a consolidated basis would surely be steps forward.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 2000 International Monetary Fund Washington, D. C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Slovak Republic On July 21, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Slovak Republic.’ Background Although the Slovak economy grew at high rates averaging over 6 percent during 1995-98, it was also characterized by large macroeconomic imbalances and the absence of key structural reforms, thus making it vulnerable to crisis. While rapid growth in investment helped fuel rapid real GDP growth, much of this investment was financed either from abroad using government guarantees, or from the unreformed state-owned banks. This resulted in an exceptionally rapid increase in overall external indebtedness and a worsening bad loan problem domestically. The deficit of the general government reached about 5 percent of GDP in 1997-98, compared with a small surplus in 1995. And the external current account deficit was 10 percent of GDP or more in each of the three years to 1998. A strong policy response was essential to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and re-invigorate structural reform. In this regard, the deficit of the general government has been reduced, the external current account deficit has narrowed, and, though yet to be completed, important steps have been made toward restructuring and privatizing state-owned banks and enterprises, including by strengthening the bankruptcy framework. The decision by the EU to invite the Slovak Republic to start negotiations on EU accession has added to market confidence. Determined fiscal tightening-with the package of May 1999-was a key component to reducing macroeconomic imbalances. The general government deficit (excluding privatization ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Key elements of the package included an increase in the lower value added tax rate, higher excises, an import surcharge, measures to rationalize social assistance programs, as well as significant increases in important administered prices. Although tax collection was relatively weak, and social transfers were higher than budgeted, the authorities were able to hold the line on their target for the state budget by achieving savings in other areas. The 3 percent of GDP target for the general government was exceeded mainly because of overruns in the extrabudgetary funds. The authorities recognize that there are structural weaknesses in the fiscal area. For example, as noted above, tax collection has been weak: tax arrears increased in 1999, and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP fell from 37.1 percent in 1998 to 35.3 percent in 1999, notwithstanding higher statutory taxes. Primary expenditure, and spending on social benefits in particular, has stayed high; and the targeting and administration of the latter could be improved. High taxes on labor discourage formal sector employment. Reforms in the pension and health funds would help ease fiscal pressures. In addition to fiscal tightening, developments in the non-government sector contributed to a sharp fall in domestic demand in 1999, which was more than offset by a significant increase in exports. Non-government investment (including that of state-owned enterprises) declined sharply, while private consumption recordecl only a very modest increase, as a decline in real personal income was offset by a decrease in household saving. Although GDP growth slowed in 1999, its deceleration to 1.9 percent was limited by strong export performance: in real terms, exports grew by 7 percent. At the same time, import volume fell significantly, in the face of the sharp decline in domestic demand. Data for the first months of 2000 indicate that the combination of weak domestic demand (particularly consumption) and strong export growth has carried over into this year. In these circumstances, balance of payments difficulties have eased considerably. The external current account deficit fell to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1999. The trade deficit has narrowed further so far in 2000 and, by March 2000, official reserves increased to the equivalent of 3 months of imports of goods and non-factor services. Increases in indirect taxes and administered prices pushed up headline inflation to 14 percent at end-1999 and 16 percent in May 2000. However, with the unemployment rate reaching almost 20 percent, wage pressures have been in check. Moreover, core inflation (which excludes the impact of changes in administered prices and indirect tax changes) has remained moderate: it was 6’/, percent in May 2000. The authorities have been gearing monetary policy toward meeting their target for core inflation. With wage costs and underlying inflation seemingly at bay, and heartened by reductions in the fiscal and external current account deficits, the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) allowed domestic interest rates to decline, in circumstances of upward pressure on the koruna. The NBS initially welcomed the strengthening of the currency when it began in mid-l 999, but, owing to concerns about losing external competitiveness, the central bank eventually began to resist further appreciation, first by sterilized intervention in early 2000 and then-in the context of an expected decline in core inflation-by moving short-term interest rates lower.

The authorities have decided to sell a significant majority of the state’s stake in the Slovak Savings Bank (SLSP), and the entire state’s stake in the General Credit Bank (VUB) and the Investment and Development Bank (IRB). They also transferred non-performing loans from these three banks to the Consolidation Agency and the Consolidation Bank, and injected capital into the banks. The effectiveness of the Bank Privatization Unit has been improved through external technical assistance and the recruitment of additional staff. In addition, the government amended the banking act in order to strengthen the supervisory power of the NBS; and a number of amendments to strengthen the bankruptcy law have recently been submitted to Parliament for approval.

On the privatization front, Slovnaft (the oil refinery) was privatized and the authorities have made significant progress in the divestiture of a majority share in the telecommunications company to a strategic foreign investor. Under current plans, the privatization of other utilities (e.g., the Gas and Electricity companies, and Transpetrol) is to be kept to a minority share.
