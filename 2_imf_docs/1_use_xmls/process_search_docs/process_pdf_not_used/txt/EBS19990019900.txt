The outcomes for real GDP growth and inflation have been better than foreseen, helped by improvements in the seauity situation, the return and settlement of ret%gees, and favorable weather. The impact of the con&t in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on the Rwandese economy and on the government’s capacity to implement economic reforms has been limited. Military spending, which exceeded the budget allocation (by about l/i of 1 percentage point of GDP) in 1998, is being contained in 1999, and spending on social programs, which were underimplemented in 1998, has increased significantly in 1999. l In response to several missed financial performance criteria and emerging revenue shorttYls at end-September 1998, the government took prompt actions to strengthen revenue collection, restrain expenditure and improve its monitoring, and expedite the implementation of structural measures that were behind schedule. As a result, the end- December 1998 financial and structural program targets were broadly met, and the midterm review was completed at end-March 1999. l The 1999 budget targeted a strong improvement in revenue mobilization (while signifi- cantly reducing trade taxes), a significant increase and better monitoring of social spend- ing, reduced military spending, and a considerable improvement in the civil service wage and incentive structure, together with a reduction in the size of the civil service. With the exception of revenue, all these objectives are being attained. In the fbce of signiftcant revenue shortfalls, which emerged partly for exogenous reasons and caused several indi- cative targets for end-June 1999 to be missed, the govermnent responded by implement- ing revenue measures and expenditure reductions equivalent tn 1 percent of GDP (while safeguarding social spending), and by substantially strengthening tax administration, so as to limit the excess of the primary deficit above the original program target for 1999.

The program for 1999/2000 (July-June) aims at tbrther progress in the above-mentioned areas. Revenue collection will focus on implementing the recently adopted action plan for the Rwanda Revenue Authority (with technical assistance from donors) and introducing a VAT by mid-2000, while consolidating trade liberahxation. Social policies will focus on further improving the level and efficiency of budget allocations (in line with the social objectives and their reflection in the medium-term expenditure framework), as well as the monitoring of social performance indicators. l The government made good progress in implementing the structural reform program, although delays were incurred in the tax administration, civil service, financial sector, and social security areas. To accelerate these reforms, the authorities have taken several prior actions, in particular, to strengthen tax and customs administration, as well as to ensure the implementation of the new organixational structure of the civil service and the restructuring plans of several banks. l With a net present value of debt-to-exports ratio of about 500 percent projected for 1999 2000, the debt burden appears unsustainable, and Rwanda is likely to request debt relief under the enhanced HJPC Initiative. l Jn light of the progress made in implementing the program, the authorities’ demonstrated willingness to take corrective actions when necessary, and the strength of the program, the staff supports Rwanda’s request for a second annual arrangement under the ESAF.

On June 24,1998, the Executive Board approved Rwanda’s request for a three-year arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 71.40 (89.1 percent of quota, or 120 percent of old quota), and the first annual arrangement thereunder in an amount of SDR 23.80 million (29.7 percent of quota). At the conclusion of the 1998 Article IV consultation and approval of the three-year ESAF arrangement, Executive Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal sustain- ability through improvements in tsx administration, expenditure prioriti&on, and budget and treaswy management, but they noted Rwanda’s need to continue strengthening its administrative and institutional capacity, and to increase budget allocations for social and other nonmilitary purposes. With regard to structural reforms, Directors stressed that high priority should be given to accelerating civil service reform. 2. The midterm review under the first annual arrangement was completed on March 24, 1999 (EBS/99/22,2/26/99), afler the government had taken corrective actions in response to two missed performance criteria for end-September 1998 and delays in certain structural reform measures. At the time of the midterm review, Executive Directors stressed the need for increasing and protecting social spending and accelerating social sector reforms, reducing military spending, and improving the monitoring and transparency of the budget process. 3. In the attached letter to the Managing Director (Appendix I), dated November 2, 1999, the Rwandese authorities request a second ammal arrangement under the ESAF cover- ing the program period July 1999-June 2000, in an amount of SDR 23.80 million (29.7 per- cent of quota). The arrangement would support the objectives and policies set forth in the memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) (Appendix I, Attachment) and the policy framework paper (PFP) (EBD/99/125). As of September 30, 1999, Rwanda’s out- standing use of Fund resources amounted to SDR 47.8 million (59 percent of quota) (Table 4). 4. On March 29, 1999, the World Bank’s Board approved an economic recovery credit for Rwanda in an amount equivalent to USS75 million for the period 1999/2000, of which the fust tranche of USS40 million was disbursed in June 1999; on June 29, 1999, it endorsed the updated Country Assistance Strategy for Rwanda. The African Development Bank (AfDB) is providing support under a structural adjustment loan equivalent to USS22 million, approved in July 1998 for the period 1998-99, of which the first tranche of USSl2 million was disbursed at end-1998. At end-May 1999, the European Union (EU) approved a structural adjustment grant in an amount of g 50 million for the period 1999/2000, of which the fust tranche of 8 11 million was disbursed in June 1999. 5. Rwanda’s statistical database is broadly adequate for program monitoring, although a number of data weaknesses need to be addressed. The authorities have recently improved the coverage and fresuency of fiscal and monetary data reporting. Further improvements are being undertaken in the area of budget and treasury management (with technical assistance from FAD), social sector monitoring (with assistance from the World Bank and donors), and monetary and price and balance of payments statistics (with technical assistance from STA).

IL DEVELOFMEWSUNDERTHF~~~~~/~~PROGRAM 7. Macraecooomic performonce WIM broodiy in lie with the program targets. In 1998, real GDP growth (10 percent) was higher than targeted (7 percent), reflecting the improved security situation in the northwest, the resettlement of displaced persons returning to cultivate the land, and good weather conditions (Table 4 and Figure 1). In 1999, mainly because of problems in the transport and manufacturing sectors, real GDP growth slowed down and is now projected at 5 percent, compared with 8 percent in the program.’ After a sharp increase in 1997, food prices have gradually returned to their prehike levels in the course of 1998-99, contributing to a drop in the consumer price index (CPl) of 5 percent over the 12-month period ended July 1999.s The period-average inflation rate is now projected at minus -2 percent for the year 1999 (Figure 2). 8. During 1998, the Rwanda franc depreciated by 18 percent in real effective terms, partly reversing a 27 percent real appreciation in 1997. Jn the first eight months of 1999, the Rwanda franc depreciated by 2 percent against the U.S. dollar but appreciated by about 8 percent in nominal and real effective terms; this movement reflects the depreciation of the currencies ofRwanda’s major European trading partners and Kenya against the U.S. dollar, and the closeness of Rwanda’s inflation rate to that of its trading partners (Figure 3). A8er fluctuating at about 5 percent during most of 1998 and the first half of 1999, the parallel market premium has increased to about 10 percent in recent months as a result of an increase in unofficial imports and an emerging misalignment of the offtciai exchange rate. Although the targets for net foreign assets of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) at end-1998 and mid-1999 (adjusted for higher-than-programmed external budgetary support) were not achieved, Rwanda’s gross official reserves position has remained comfortable at 6.7 months of imports during 1998-99. t Both the transport sector and import volumes were adversely affected by the enforcement of maximum truck axle weight regulations in Kenya; the manufacturing sector was a&c&l by a sharp drop in sales of beer/soft drinks by Bralirwa, the monopolist, foreign-owned company, following the increase in excise tax rates in January 1999. Agricultural output growth is projected to slow to 5-7 percent in 1999 (compared with over 10 percent last year), as less land remains to be returned to cultivation. ’ The sharp increase in food prices during 1997 was caused by a combination of security problems in the northwest, drought, and the massive return of refugees.

Fii performance in 1998 fell somewhat short of the program targets, despite remedial revenue efforts in the last quarter (Table 8). Although the target for the primary balance was met, the revenue&-GDP ratio (10.4 percent) was a little below the program target, military spending exceeded the budget allocation by % of 1 percent of GDP (in part related to the reintegration into the army of over 10,000 soldiers of the former government), and there was underspending on the social sector by about the same amount. These issues were addressed in the 1999 budget. 10. The 1999 budget adopted in late 1998 was broadly in line with the objectives of the three-year program (Box 1). Budget execution during the tirst half of 1999 was largely as envisaged except for significant revenue shortfalls, which were in part outside the control of the government (MEF’P, paragraph 5). These shortfalls caused the primary firscal deficit te exceed the Jane target by 0.7 percent of GDP and net credit to Box 1.

Primary expenditure was kept within the June program targets (inchimg for defense), and tke targets for social spending were broadly met, except for some underspending on the health wage bill, reflecting delays in hiring qualified staff. Government capital spending is likely to have fallen significantly short of the program target., owing to continued weak implementation capacity and administrative expertise in dealing with cumbersome donor procedures. The exceptional social spending programs in the budget (outside the primary deficit monitored under the program) were largely implemented as envisaged. 11. In response to the emerging revenue shortfalls (projected at 1.8 percent of GDP for tke year before any measures), tbe government took measures equivalent to over 1 percent of GDP, rougkly qually distributed between the revenue and the expenditure side (Box Q3 With these measures, the revised targets for revenue and the primary deficit in 1999 are 10.5 percent of GDP and 0.7 percent of GDP, respectively (compared with 10.8 percent of GDP and balance under the program). Furthermore, to improve revenue collection on a sustained basis, the government recently adopted an action plan for strengthening the Rwanda Revenue Authority (BRA) with technical assistance from a team of international consultants financed by the UK-DFJD; in addiiion, it implemented a number of prior actions in revenue areas where there had been delays (MEFP, Box 1). The key elements of the BRA action plan are summarixed in Box 2. 12. There was good progress in expenditure management. The authorities improved the monitoring of social spending, including through better communication between the Ministry of Finance. and the social ministries on expenditure commitments, and they stepped up efforts to collect data on social performance indicators. There were further improvements in the budget execution and monitoring process: revised guidelines were issued to all departments in June; domestic arrears were repaid as programmed; the float of to-be-paid payment orders was kept within the normal level (of BF 2 billion); and the expenditure commitments for which payment orders were not yet signed were kept under close watch. Payroll management was improved significantly with the completed computerixation of salary payments for all civil servants and teachers, and the recently completed regulari- ration of about 7,700 civil -ants (mainly teachers), who had been working without pay. Steps are being taken to speed up project implementation through the full operationali- xation and stat&g of the Central Project and External Finance Bureau (CEPEX), the harmonixation of procurement procedures between donors and the National Tender Board (NTB), and the more decentralixed preparation of procurement documents. 3 See MEFP, paragraph 17.

Atter a 3 percent drop in broad money in 1998 (reflecting the rapid fall in prices and the re.lativeIy slower growth of the monetixed sector), money demand remained sluggish in the first half of 1999, and the 12-month growth rate for broad money reached 2 percent at end-June (Table 9). During the same period, reserve money fell by 3 percent, owing to two factors. First, foreign assets (adjusted for higher-than-programmed external budget support) were RF 9 billion below the target, retlecting significant sales by the NBR to commercial banks, which were stepping up their sales in response to demand pressures (including--as mentioned abovtthrough the parallel market). This coincided with the NBR’s hesitation to let the exchange rate depreciate and pursue its net foreign assets target more actively. Second, there was a smaller-than-offsetting expansion, above the adjusted program target, in the net domestic assets of the NBR which met the larger financing needs of the budget and provided liquidity to the banks in the f&e of sluggish activity in the transport and manufacturing sectors. In the event, banks’ liquidity needs were also met through a de facto reduction in reserve requirements following a new regulation, effective May 1999, which allowed banks to count foreign exchange deposited with the NBR as required reserves.’ 14. Bank credit to the private sector grew by 21 percent in the year ended June 1999. Both deposit and lending interest rates fell somewhat but remained strongly positive in real terms.’ Following the completion of the audits of all five commercial banks, the stock of nonperforming loans is provisionally estimated at about 30 percent of private sector credit at end-June 1999, compared with just over 20 percent at end-1997;6 this will require significant amounts of additional provisioning and capital, in particular for the two main problem banks (see paragraph 32 below). 15. As a result of these fiscal and monetary developments, several indicative financial targets at end-June 1999 were missed, in particular, net credit to government (reflecting mainly revenue shortfalls), net domestic assets, and net foreign assets ofthe NBR (reSe&ng the NBR’s liquidity injections and accommodating foreign exchange market intervention). However, based on the fiscal measures recently adopted by the authorities and their renewed ’ In response, banks transfemzd the equivalent of over RF 3 billion in foreign exchange previously held with correspondent banks abroad to the NBR, which included that amount under its foreign assets. To capture the underlying net foreign assets position of the NBR, the program will henceforth monitor the NBR’s net foreign assets position, net of domestic liabilities in foreign currency. ’ Owing to the increase in real interest rates in 1998, as well as banks’ more cautious lending policiegprompted by the significant amounts of nonperforming loans identified in the course of that year-the 1Zmontb rate of credit expansion had slowed down from 50 percent at end-1997 to 20 percent at end-1998. 6 The increase in nonperforming loans since end-1997 is mainly due to a stricter application of the NBR’s loan classification procedures.

On the external side, exports are expected to be somewhat higher than originally projected in 1999, as the temporary decline in the exports of tee, caused by adverse weather early in the year, is being more than offset by an increase in nontraditional exports. Imports are expected to be 25 percent lower than originally projected (or 9 percent lower than in 1998), reflecting the increase in transportation costs on the Kenyan route, as noted in foot- note 1, the decline in imports destined for Burundi, lower food and other humanitarian aid imports, and lower public investment imports. As a result, the current account deficit (ex- cluding official transfers) is expected to decline fiom 17 percent in 1998 to some 16 percent of GDP in 1999 (Table 10). In the course of 1999, Rwanda signed bilateral agreements with its remaining two Paris Club creditors and made progress in the negotiations with several non-Paris Club creditors.’ It has regular&d its arrears situation vie-a-vis the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund and the Araban Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and is expected to do so vis-a-vis the EU before end-1999. 17. During the 199U99 program year, Rwanda broadly implemented the envisaged structural reforms, oltko~~gk some with delays; one structural bencbmork (for Marck 1999)--oa the adoption of l rcatructuring plan for the socioi security systcm- hu not bcu met (Bex 3). Reforms in the arees of taxation (except tax administration), expenditure management, public enterprises, and the exchange system have been implemented according to the envisaged time schedule, while reforms in the areas of tax administration, civil service restructuring, banking supervision, the social security system, and the regulatory framework have experienced delays of four to nine months.

The discussions concentrated on the macroeconomic and structural policies needed to achieve high and sustainable growth and rapid poverty reduction, against the background of the government’s medium-term strategy to address the challenges facing Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide, as well as its macroeconomic objectives for the period 1999/2000- 2001/02.8 The discussions paid particular attention to the need for increasing social and other high-priority spending, based on the recently completed social sector expenditure reviews; for ensuring sustained donor support; and for monitoring the impact of government spending on social indicators. ’ Following the Paris Club agreement in July 1998, the bilateral agreements with the other four Paris Club creditors were signed in the second half of 1998. * MEFP, paragraphs 13-15 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Box 3.

The pmgmm aims at achieving annual real GDP growth of almost 6 percent, while keeping intltion below 3 percent a year. As output is estimated to recover to its prewar level in the course of 1999, sustained growth from 2000 onward is predicated on a Cuther recovery in private investment and savings in response to structural reforms, a fiuther improvement in confidence, and significant levels of govermnent investment focused on improving human capital and rural infrastructure. To finance the required investment while gradually reducing the reliance on humanitarian aid flows and achieving a sustainable debt position over the medium term, national savings arc projected to reach 1H percent of GDPon average in 1999-2002 (from -2 percent during 199698); the improvement is expected to come mainly from private savings, 8s government savings are projected to remain very low as a result of envisaged higher social spending. The pmjected high investment-savings gaps will continue to require very concessional aid, equivalent to about 17 percent of GDP on average during the period, of this, about 12 percent would be channeled through the budget in the form of project financing and budget support (including debt rescheduling) and the remainder would represent humanitarian aid (including through nongovemmental organization (NGGs)) outside the budget Qablel). official reserves are projected to decline from 6% months of imports in 1998-99 to 4% months in 2002, in line with the projected gradual decline in nonbudgetary aid flows and with a fiuther strengthening of confidence.

The achievement of the program’s objectives is underpinned by the following policies: (i) increasing revenue by about 2k of 1 percent of GDP a year on average, mainly through improvements in tax administration and a broadening of the tax base (including the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) in mid-2000); (ii) increasing recurrent social expenditure by about 2% percentage points of GDP during 2000-02 to sustain human development; and (iii) improving the quality of govemment expenditure, including through the progressive introduction of medium-term expenditure tiamework m. In light of Rwanda’s social and rehabilitation needs, a reduction in government savings and higher levels of the overall fiscal deficit-financed by very concessional donor support-would be justified, provided Rwanda strengthens its own efforts. These efforts are focusing on (i) improving domestic revenue mobiiition to reduce aid dependence over time; (ii) putting in place a transparent budget prac~, with regular public expenditure rcvicws and continuous monitoring of the impact of government spending; and (iii) enhancing coordination with donors. In this regard, the program incorporates contingency mechanisms to ensure that additional revenue and donor financing above the programmed amounts are allocated to priority program areas, in close consultation with the staffs of the Fund and World Bank. The macroeconomic tiamework takes into account reasonably predictable levels of donor financing, as well as expected improvements in the government’s implementation capacity. It also incorporates a repayment of government debt to the social security fund and a gradual reduction in the offtcial reserves coverage, which will allow part of foreign savings to be pmgressively channeled to the private sector (Table 1). 21. To raise the revenu&o-GDP ratio, the government is focusing on strengthening the tax administration efforts within the RRA, while reducing tariffs and income tax rates in line with those of its regional trading partners. In this regard, the staffreuxnmended that the government continue to pursue its objective of trade liberalisation consistent with progress in the region under the Cross-Border Initiative (CBI) and resist domestic pressures for protection (Table 2). Accordingly, the staffrecommended that the temporary surcharges of lo-15 percent, imposed in July 1999, be eliminated with the 2000 budget. The authorities argued that, in view of revenue and other domestic considerations, it would be difficult to remove the surcharges so soon; nevertheless, they agreed to a halving of the surcharges with the 2000 budget (effective upon announcement of the budget in late November 1999) and their elimination by July 2000.

Current government expendii would rise from 12.6 percent of GDP in 1999 to 14.4 percent in 2002, mtlecting the combination of a doubling of social spending and constant spending in nominal terms on defense (including the recently established national police9) (Table 8). The reduction in military spending is expected to result from the demobilization of about 11,400 soldiers during 1999-2000 and of a knther 5,000 in 2001, the savings of which will be only partly offset by the costs of operationahzing the national police and the planned mechanization of the army. The government wage bill is projected to decline from 5 percent in 1999 to 4% percent in 2002 as a result of demobilization, a tinther streamlining of the core civil service, a net hiring of teachers, and modest annual pay increases (after the significant pay increase in early 1999). 23. Structural reforms during the three-year period will focus on (i) completing the civil service restrucuning with a slimmer and betterqualified core civil service and a gradually expanding teacher corps that is consistent with the objective of achieving universal primary education (UPE) by 2005; (ii) completing the restructuring of the banks and strengthening banking supervision; (iii) completing the privatization of public enterprises; and (iv) restruc- turing the social security system. The program also aims at stepping up the efforts to improve economic governance. 9 The costs of the national police tknctions are estimated at the equivalent of about 0.5 percent of GDP in 1999 and are expected to remain at that level in 2000-02.

Under the second-year program, straddling the 1999 and 2000 budgets, improving tax administration and the implementation capacity for social spending will be at the center of heal policies. As discussed above, the revenue target for 1999 has been revised do wnward by 0.3 percentage point to 10.5 percent of GDP, which incorporates the impact of the recently implemented revenue measures. Primary expendiire in 1999 is targeted at 11.2 percent of GDP, which incorporates the impact of the agreed-upon expen- diture reduc&ons (including on defenae) during the second half of 1999. The target for social spending is to be maintained as envisaged (equivalent to 3.7 percent of GDP) and includes the impact of the reguki&on of teachers. The financing needs corresponding to the now higher primary deficit (of 0.7 percent of GDP), exceptional social spending, elimination of domestic arrears, and repayment of other domestic debt are expected to be fully covered by already disbursed or committed budgetary support from World Bank, EU, AtDB, and bilateral donors. 2s. For the year 2000, revenues are programmed to improve to 10.7 percent of GDP, or by r/i of 1 percentage point of GDP when the impact of the phasing out of the import surcharges is taka~ into account. Achkving this target will require considerabk effort on the part of the BBA to improve preshipment inspection, the control of transit trade and smuggling, and tax auditing, as well as to accelerate computerization. The only major new tax measure foreseen for 2000 is the introduction of a VAT, beginning with tbe coverage of large and medium-sized enterprises from mid-2000 onward. A number of preparatory steps have been taken or are plamred for the coming months, including the submission to parliament of the draB VAT law and the senaitization of the public to its impact. Initially, the VAT is expected to be revenue neutral, and the revenue loss from the elimination of cascading effects of the current 15 percent turnover tax to be offset by a wider coverage of tramactions and an appropriate choice of tax rate. 26. Current expenditure is programmed to remain at just over 12% percent of GDP in 2000, with the share of the social sectors increasing to the equivalent of 4 percent of GDP (from 3.7 percent of GDP in 1999) and the share of defense spending declining to 3.7 percent of GDP (kom 4 percent of GDP in 1999). The wage bill is projected to decline slightly to 4.8 percent of GDP. Based on the new organimtional structures of the ministries and the envisaged further replacement of unquaMied civil servants by qualifkd ones (in particular, in the health sector), the government aims at containing the civil setvice size at not more than 9,500 core civil servants and about 28,508 teachers in 2000 (MEPP, paragraph 26). The envisaged increase in social spending is based OII social sector expenditure reviews, which are being updated and are providing estimatu for unit costs in health and educa- tion. Partkukr attention is being paid to ensuring adequate budget allocations for books and medicinea and other essential equipment for the health renters,” as well as to lo Over the past two years, Rwanda has implemented a decentralii system of health care, under which 39 health districts have one district hospital and an average of 8 primary (continued.. .)

The authorities are committed to @ither improving the monitoring of the impact of social spending (MEFP, paragraph 29). However, in view of Rwanda’s limited capacity in this regard, strong technical support 6om the World Bank UKDFID, and other donors remains essential. Exceptional social spending is projected to increase to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2004, on accotmt of the transfers to the tImd for assistance to genocide survivors, the cost of demobilixation, the cost of governance institutions, and the cost of food for the 130,000 prisoners accused of genocide.” 27. On budget/expenditure management, the program envisages a number of important steps to enhance the transparency of the budget process (including the progressive intro- duction of a medium-term expenditure framework); expenditure management; and govern- ment accounts (MEFP, Box 2). Furthermore, the wmputerixation of budget and treasury operations is under way, with technical assistance from the AtDB, and public expenditure reviews of the justice sector and the agriculture and transport sectors will be undertaken (with technical as&tance t?om the EU and the World BanbVK-DHD, respectively) in the course of 2000. 28. On the fuuncing of the budget io 2088, in addition to the financing requirements of the primary deficit and exceptional social spending, the program foresees the repayment by the government of depositors of the public savings fund under liquidation, as well as of government debt owed to the social security ibnd. The external financing gap-after budgetary project financing and rescheduling and refinancing from Paris Club, non-Paris Club, and certain multilateral creditor-is estimated at about US0100 million. This gap is expected to be financed by already committed budget support from the World Bank (US.835 million), EU (USSZO million), and, for the remainder, bilateral donors, including through their contributions to the Multilateral Debt Trust Fund for Rwanda. C. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies 29. Monetary and exchange rate policies will be rimed at keeping inflation (measured by the GDP deilator) at or below 3 percent and meeting the NBR’s net foreign assets target. The monetary program remains based on a reserve money target, which the NBR intends to reach mainly through money market interventions. In this context, the authorities agreed with the staff on the importance of providing adequate and timely information to the market participants on key monetary aggregates and the NBR’s own health units each. Coordination with donors has improved through the involvement of the latter in the budget process and the establishment of better contacts with a reduced number of NGGs. ” In view of declining food aid from the World Food Program, these costs are included under exceptional social expenditure in the 2000 budget. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-22- monetary policy intentions. In view of the lower money demand experienced thus far in 1999 and the adequate official reserves coverage, the authorities agreed with the statT’s suggestion to lower the 1999 targets for broad money and reserve money growth (to about 5 percent) while aiming for a somewhat lower level of net foreign assets.. For 2000, money growth has been projected at 8 percent, in line with nominal GDP; a slightly lower target has been set for reserve money, taking into account a projected increase in the money multiplier.‘2 In addition to money market auctions, the NBR will increasingly use treasury bill auctions to intluence banks’ liquidity (MEFP, paragraph 33). In this context, the staffemphasized the importance of progreaaively wnverting the wnsolidated government debt to commercial banks into more liquid treasury bills and of developing a secondary market for these bills.” 30. Regarding exchange rate policy, the authorities indicated that they were considering taking into account a real exchange rate objective in their foreign exchange intervention, while assigning an accommodating role to money market intervention consistent with a reserve money target. The staff recommended instead (and the authorities agreed) that the exchange rate should be market determined, with the NBR’s intervention geared toward meeting the net foreign assets target and smoothing short-term exchange rate fluctuations, while not resisting underlying trends, such as evidenced by increases in the parallel market premium (MEFP, paragraph 34). In this regard, the statT stressed the importance of the NEtR’s more actively pursuing its net foreign assets target, as well as the need for closely monitoring the NBR’s foreign exchange liabilities owed to domestic banks and counted as required reserves. 31. The NBR has recently taken a number of steps to enhance the tinctioning of the foreign exchange market (IvEFP, paragraph 35). The further liberalisation of the exchange system toward tree capital account transactions-consistent with improvements in the soundness of the financial system-is being considered by the authorities in consultation with Fund staff. 32. Improving the soundness of the financial system is a major objective of the program for 1999/2000. To this effect, revised restructuring plans are being drawn up, prudential and other banking supervision regulations are being strengthened, and the NBR’s supervisory department is being reinforced. While preparation of the reform of Rwanda’s social security system has taken more time than originally envisaged, key steps for putting in place a new structure are expected to be implemented over the coming months (see Boxes 4 and 5 and MEFP, paragraphs 36-38.) l2 The multiplier is expected to increase as commercial banks may reduce some of their excess reserves generated by the transfer of part of their foreign exchange holdings to the NBR (with the RF equivalent being counted against their reserve requirements). l3 At end-1997, the stock of nonperforming government bonds held by the banks (equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP) had been restructured over 15 years at a 7.5 percent interest rate.

Medium-Term Balance of Paymentu Outlook, Debt Sustainability, and Capacity to Repay tbe Fund 33. The medium-term balance of payments outlook has worsened vis-a-vis the projection at the time of approval of the three-yesr ESAF arrangement. This bleaker outlook reflects lower international prices for coffee and tea and the slower-than-expected pace of structural reforms in the coffee and tea sectors. Gver the next three years, export growth is projected at 5 percent a year in U.S. dollar terms, rising to IO percent during 2003-06. Coffee export volumes sre projected to grow at only about 6 percent a year until 2003, owing to slower- than-expected progress in the rehabilitation of coffee plantations; therea&rr, as the new high- yield varieties mature, production is projected to grow at 10 percent a year, reaching the prewar peak level of 35,000 tons in 2009. Because of the slow progress in privatixation thus far, growth in tea export volumes is projected at 4% percent a year until 2003, increasing to 10 percent a year thereat&. The share of nontraditional goods (artisanal goods, light manufactures, procemed food, and horticuhural and mineral products), about 15 percent in recent years, is projected to double over the next ten years. 34. Import volumes are projected to grow at a rate of 7 percent a year through 2002, as high levels of capital and intermediate gcod+following the underimplementation of the PIP in 199&9%would more than offset the projected decline in humanitarian aid. On this basis, the external current account deficit (excluding offtcial transfers) is projected to rise to about 17 percent of GDP in 2000-02 before declining gradually thereafter (Table 10). 35. In light of Rwanda’s eligibility under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative), the medium-term external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assumes a hypothetical stock-of-debt operation on Naples terms at end-1999 (Appendix VI).” On this basis, the net present value (NW) of debt is projected to remain at about 500 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services during 1999-2002, before declining to below 400 percent in 2008. Also, the ratio of scheduled external debt service to exports (before the impact of existing debt-relief mechanisms) is projected to remain at about 40 percent during 1999-2002, before declining to about 30 percent in 2007. After the impact of the assumed debt relief, the debt service-to-exports ratio would be about 10 percentage points lower during 1999-2000, and about 5 percentage points lower there&er. Assuming for illustrative purposes that Rwanda were to reach its decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in 2000, the NPV of debt relief would be about 350 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services, or about USS400 million in NPV terms. A preliminary HIK Initiative document will be prepared over the coming months for presentation to the Executive Board in early 2000. Rwanda is strengthening its debt- management capacity (including coordination between the Ministry of Finance and the NER) with technical assistance from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development OJNCTAD). ” Based on the debt situation projected for end-1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26- 36. Rwanda’s stock of debt is currently estimated at about USSl.3 billion, of which about 85 percent is owed tomultilaterals (including 5 percent to the Fund) and the remainder to Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors in broadly equal parts (Table 11). Total Fund credit, which at mid-1999 amounted to SDR 49 million (or 61 percent of quota), is expected to peak in 2001 at 96 percent of quota. Debt service to the Fund will rise gradually from 4 percent of exportsofgoodsandnon&ctorsetvicesin1998to81percentin1999,andpeakat 10.1 percent in 2000 (Table 13). Given its projected adequate reserves coverage and established track record in servicing its debt to the Fund, Rwanda should be able to meet its financial obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. E. Otker Structural Policies 37. Regarding the civil service, the recent adoption of the new organisational structures of all ministries and the job classification for all civil servants, as well as the preparatory work based on the census, has put the government in a good position to implement the new structures over the coming months, with technical assistance from the United Nations development Program (UNDP) and World Bank (Box 6 and MEFP, paragraphs 43-44). Regarding trade p&y, the authorities remain committed to an open trade regime in line with the CBI objectives. With the envisaged elimination of the temporary import surcharges in July 2000, Rwanda’s trade restrictiveness index will return to its early 1999 level of 2 (from 3 in 1998 and in the second half of 1999). Under the CBI and COMESA commitments, intraregional tariffs will be eliminated in October 2000. 38. Regarding privatisation, the government is proceeding with the divestiture of all 46 remaining enterprises (out of the total of 69 public enterprises and enterprises with government minority share holdings in the divestiture program adopted in 1998) during 1999-2001, half of them by mid-2000. The timetable for the privatization of the public utilities has been revised to reflect delays in preparing regulatory Meworks for the telecommunications and electricity/gas/water sectors (now expected to be adopted by parliament in 2000) and in completing the restructuring/privatization modalities for the two public enterprises involved (Rwandatel and Electrogax). The sale of Rwandatel and the restructuring/splitting of Electrogaz into three separate companies (and the privatixation of key components) are expected to be completed by late 2000 and mid-2001, respectively @=I’, wwmh 45). 39. With respect ta the regulatory framework for the private sector, the new labor code, which is expected to be promulgated over the coming months, will eliminate wage controls, gender discrimination, and restrictions on labor mobility, and thereby promote a better-gmctioning labor market. The new land reform law, expected to be submitted to parliament by end-1999, is aimed at providing security of tenure, regulating ownership and inheritance (ensuring rights for women), and establishing a land market.

During the last five years, output, which had dropped by 50 percent in 1994, has recovered to its prewar level. While output growth has been relatively stronger in agriculture, the majority of the population is still worse off today, and poverty incidence--estimated at 70 percent-is higher than in the prewar period,lr for several reasons. First, agricultural output growth has been much slower in the high-nutrient and high-value-added crops (such as coffee, with production at only half the prewar level in 1999, owing to the demolition and lack of maintenance of the coffee plantations), and faster in low-nutrient crops (such as bananas). !Second, the deterioration of the road network has hampered the distribution of food from surplus to deficit areas. Third, owing to erosion, soil exhaustion, and resettlement, the pressure on the cultivable land has increased, leaving many people with insufficient acreage for subsistence. 41. During 1998/99, Rwanda made satisfactory progress in improving social policies and intermediate output indicators. In education, about one-fourth of the previously unpaid teachers (largely comprising qualified returned retitgees who had been reinserted but not yet paid) were mguhui&. Also, salaries of all teachers were increased significantly in early 1999, and a system of training teachers at new specialised colleges and through in-service training was initiated.r6 A new curriculum is progressively being introduced in primary and secondary schools, and the construction of new classrooms was enhanced by the increased participation of parents at the community level. In health, good progress was made in strengthening the capacities of the health districts, including by authorizing local management to pumhase drugs. Furthermore, for both health and education, the monitoring of budget execution and the collection of social statistics has been strengthened, and the 2000 budget allocations are being based on public expendii reviews, including unit cost estimates. To make Gtrthsr progress on its social objectives,” the government envisages significant increases in budget allocations to these sectors over the coming years, with ” In 1998, poverty is estimated to have atfected three-fourths of the rural households and one-half of the urban households (about one-tenth of the population lives in urban areas); the average incidence is 70 percent, compared with just over 50 percent in 1993 (based on the World Bank’s 1998 “Rwanda Poverty Update”). ” Sec. MEFP, Table 4. r’ These include, for education, achieving UPE by 2005 (from the over 85 percent gross enrollment of today) and improving the transition rate to secondary education to 40 percent by the same date (from the over 20 percent of today) and, for health, increasing the share of fully equipped and stat&-d health centers to 50 percent and the proportion of qualified staff to 60 percent by 2001.

In addition to these social policies, the government’s strategy to reduce poverty contains the following elements aimed at raising the incomes of the poor: (i) improve sgriculturai productivity through the facilitation of the development of markets for inputs and outputs, the provision of extension services, the improvement of feeder roads and water supply, the promotion of rural credit schemes, and the introduction of a legal framework providing secmity of land tenure; (ii) promote small and medium-size entegrises in both rural and urban areas, so as to reduce Rwanda’s dependence on agriculture; ‘* A new budget classification-more directly linked to social objectives--for the health and education ministries will be implemented with the 2000 budget. I9 In this regard, the government is strengthening the regulatory framework for small-scale credit (through savings and loans cooperatives), revising the commercial code to facilitate the establishment of enterprises, and removing restrictive labor regulations with the revised labor code.

Governance and Transparency 43. The authorities are strongly committed to improving governance in tbe public sector. In the area of revenue collection, they are strengthening-with donor assistance- the autonomous RRA, with a special focus placed on the audit department and computer&d control mechanisms, the anticorruption and antismuggling unit, and the training of staff In the budget nrea, the transparency of tire budget preparation and execution process is being improved through the adoption of the organic budget law and the regulatory framework for public accounts (end-1999), snd through the development (in the course of 2000) of a system of public accounts within the treasury, with technical assistance gem A53B and the Fund. The National Tender Board (NTB), established in mid-1998, has been instrumental in improving transparency, competition, and cost-efliciency in public procurement. The Central Project and External Finance Bureau (CEPEX), established in late 1998, is aimed at improving coordination of project implementation and financing with donors. The independent Auditor General, appointed in April 1999, has fidl investigative powers and reports to the President, Cours de cornpies, and the National Assembly. Within the Ministry of Finance, the General Finance Inspectorate is being strengthened, while the Privatization Commission continues to aim at ensuring transparency in the offer for sale and biddii process. A number of ongoing steps are aimed at improving the integrity of the civil service, including the strict application of recruitment procedures, the revision of the civil service statutes and code of conduct, and the envisaged issuance. of public disclosure rules for senior public and elected officials. H. Statistical Capacity, Technical Assistanec, and Program Monitoring 44. The government is addressing wcakncssea in the macroeconomic, financial, and sectal database, so as to enhance its ability for economic analysis and policy formulation (MEFF’, paragraph 50). There has been good progress made in improving fiscal data 2o The elimination of the coffee export tax and increase in tea producer prices, both effected in early 1999, as well as the privatimtion of the government-owned tea plantations and factories, envisaged for late 2000, should help improve the living standards of the over one-fifth of Rwandese households (many of them smallholders) that are dependent on coffee or tea. ” This includes special programs to assist victims of genocide (many of whom are among the most vulnerable) through direct income support, provision of medical treatment and shelter, and programs to reintegrate them into the schooling system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- reporting and monitoring; further improvements are being undertaken, including with the assistance of two longterm FAD advisors in the areas of budget preparation and treasury operations. The NBR has recently taken steps to improve the coverage, consistency, and timeliness of the reporting of monetary aggregates, including an enhanced reconciliation of these aggregates with the use of bank financing by the budget. To ensure consistent reporting, as well as close coordination on external and domestic debt management, the collaboration between the NBR and the Ministry of Finance is being strengthened. Furthermore, the authorities are addressing weaknesses in the qualiiy and timeliness of balance of payments, national accounts, and price. data, as well as in social statistics, and have requested follow-up technical assistance from STA, the UNDP, and bilateral donors. 45. Quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks under the second annual ESAF arrangement sre set out in Tables l-2 of the MEFP. Government spending on social services is monitored on a quarterly basis with the use of detailed social indiitors (MEFIr, Tables 3-5). The completion of the first review (not later than March 2000), observance of the quantitative performance criteria at end-December 1999 and the structural performance criteria through end-December 1999, and adoption of a satisfactory budget for 2000 will be conditions for the second loan disbursement under the second annual ESAF arrangement. Prior actions are listed in Box 1 of the MEFP. The program continues to incorporate contingency mechanisms to accommodate shortfalls or excesses in external budgetary support, with flexibility to allow additional social or exceptional social spending and larger primary deficits (in agreement with World Bank and Fund stat%) if additional external financing is available. The monitoring of program implementation is being strengthened through the extension of the Interministerial ESAF Committee to include the Ministries of Education and Health and through improvements in coordination and staffmg of the Technical ESAF Committee. n’. STAFF- 46. The Rwandese authorities made satisfactory progress in implementing the 1998/99 program despite constraints in institutional capacity. The impact of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the economy and on the implementation of economic reforms has been limited. Output growth remained strong in 1998, but slowed in the first half of 1999, suggesting that the recovery of the Rwandese economy from the 1994 war may be almost complete and that sustained, robust growth-necessary to reduce the poverty that at&cm 70 percent of the Rwandcse-will need to come gem increases in productivity, in particular in agriculture, and will require significantly higher levels of public and private investment. The CPI declined by 5 percent during the 12 months ended August 1999, reflecting mostly falling food prices. 47. Fiscal policies during 1998 and 1999 have fallen somewhat short of program objectives. In response to slippages in the second half of 1998 (in particular in revenue collection), the government took prompt actions to safeguard the end-1998 financial targets. The government’s fiscal program for 1999 foresaw important tax measures (including a reduction in trade taxes), a significant increase in social spending and improved monitoring, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-32- a reduction in the share of defense spending, and considerable improvements in the pay and incentive structure of the civil service. Ah these objectives are largely being achieved. However, revenue performance in 1999 is again failing significantly short of the target, in part bemuse of persistent weaknesses in tax and customs administration. The authorities took significant measures in July and August (equivalent to 1 percent of GDP) to improve revenue and reduce nonsocial expenditure (in&ding defense), so as to limit the excess primary deficit for the year. They also adopted, and started implementing with technical assistance from donors, a comprehensive action plan for the RRA. In recognition of these efforts, the statf is of the view that somewhat less ambitious revenue and primary deficit targets would be justified. To attain the revised revenue targets for 1999, as well as to lay the basis for sustained improvements in tax collection, it is important that the authorities vigorously implement the RRA action plan. It is also essential that they continue to protect social programs against any cutbacks and contain defense expenditure within the budget aliocation. 48. The fiscal framework for 2000 is appropriately ambitious. The modest increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio reflects in part the phasing out of the temporary import surcharges and the replacement of the sales tax by a VAT in the course of the year. In this regard, it is important that the authorities continue to pursue their trade liberalization objectives under the Cross-Border Initiative, as well as accelerate the preparation of the VAT. In view of Rwanda’s rehabilitation and social needs, the envisaged iiuther increases in recurrent social spending, based on the recently updated social sector expenditure reviews and in consultation with donors, are wdcome. Further improvements in the monitoring of the level and effectiveness of such spending are essential for sustained improvements in Rwanda’s social indicators. Furthermore, to create room for human resource. development and other programs to reduce poverty, it is important that defense spending be contained and closely monitored to avoid any overruns. 49. The ongoing efforts to improve the budget preparation and execution process and improve coordination with donors are welcome, not only to achieve a better prioritization of spending, but also to ensure donor financing commitments on a sustained basis. The staff also welcomes the government’s commitment to improve governance and transparency in budget and other government operations. Jn this regard, it is important to promptly operationalize the Auditor General’s office, establish a system of public accounts, and further strengthen the National Tender Board. The authorities’ efforts in these areas will need to be supported by extensive technical assistance from donors. 50. The NBR’s monetary policies have been broadly appropriate during 1998/99, despite the nonobservance of several indicative financial targets at end-June 1999. Jn the face of the lower-than-expected demand for money, the slowdown in real growth and very low inflation, and the adequate level of official reserves, the policy response was adequately balanced by modest money market injections, a relaxation of reserve requirements, and pursuance of a somewhat lower official reserves target. However, in view of the persistent widening of the parallel market premium and the need to meet the net foreign assets targg it is important that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33- the NBR allows the exchange rate to adjust in response to underlying trends and be market- determined wile relying on tight macroeconomic policies to contain exchange market Pres==s. 51. Staff projections indicate continued large external financing needs of the government (including for meeting Rwanda’s heavy debt-service obligations). Given the magnitude of Rwanda’s financing requiremen~which are nevertheless expected to be met on highly wncessional- the projected growth in exports, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio (atter full use of traditional debt-relief mechanisms) is expected to remain at about 500 percent during 1999-2002. This projection indicates that Rwanda could potentially qualify for significant debt reliefunder the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 52. There has been satisfactory progress in structural reforms, and almost all structural measures under the 1998/99 program were implemented, although with delays in some areas, largely became of institutional capacity constraints. The authorities are to be commended for their streamlining of the civil service payroll (including the removal of “ghost” workers and the regularization of teachers) and the recent adoption of new organizational structures for all ministries. With these elements in place, it is important that they proceed promptly with the implementation of the new structures and the conversion of all staff based on job descriptions. They should ensum that, outside meeting the needs of the social and justice sectors, new recruitment be limited to the replacement of unqualified staff. 53. Good progress has been made in improving the soundness of the financial system with the promulgation of the banking law, the issuance of key banking supervision instructions, and the completion of audits for all commercial banks. It is important, however, that the hanks quickly adopt and implement revised restructuring plans, which include meeting the Basle capital adequacy standards by 2002, and that the NBR accelerate efforts to strengthen its supervisory capacity. Good progress was made in the area of privatization, as a total of almost 40 (mainly smaller) enterprises have been sold, liquidated, or offered for sale since mid-1998 (out of almost 70 enterprises in the divestiture program). However, the authorities need to step up their efforts to privatize the tea sector (with a potentially large impact on poverty reduction), as well as the public utilities (with an expected favorable effect on competitiveness). Rwanda’s economic, social, and financial database is broadly adequate for program monitoring, and the authorities are improving their submission of data to the Fund. They are aware, however, that there remain important data weaknesses (in particulsr, regarding prices, the external sector, national accounts, and social indicators) that hamper analysis of economic developments and their impact on poverty, and they are committed to improving Rwanda’s statistical capacity in these areas, with technical assistance from the Fund and other donors. 54. The Rwandese authorities made significant progress in implementing the 1998/99 program. They have demonstrated a strong commitment to economic reform, a high degree of national ownership, and a willingness to take prompt actions, when necessary, in response to fiscal slippages, adverse circumstances outside their control, and delays in structural reforms. Given Rwanda’s institutional capacity constraints, it remains important that the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-34- wide-ranging reforms be adequately phased and supported by effective and timely capacity- building e&ts; continued external technical assistance remains essential in this regard. In light of the risks associated with the fragile sociopolitical situation in the region, the authorities are s&r&ening their efforts to rebuild Rwanda’s social and economic intktrudure and achieve sustained growth and poverty reduction. To support these efforts, substantial international assistants on concessional tams, including through debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, remains critical. On this basis, the staffrecommends Executive Board approval of the authorities’ request for a second annual arrangement under the ESAF. 55. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Rwanda be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35- V. PRO- DECISION The following decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: 1. The government of the Rwanda has requested the second annual arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. 2. The Fund has appraised the progress of Rwanda in implementing economic policies and achieving the objectives under the program supported by the first annual arrangement, and notes the updated policy framework paper set forth in EBD/99/125. 3.

APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT Rigali, November 2, 1999 Mr. camdessus: 1. The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) of the Government of Rwanda describes the progress made in implementing the 1998/99 (April- March) program supported by the first annual arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), which was approved by the Executive Board of the Fund on June 24, 1998. The MEFP sets out the objectives and policies which the Government intends to pursue under the 1999/2000 (July-June) program for the second annual arrangement under the ESAF and for the medium term. This program was formulated in conformity with the Government’s updated policy framework paper (PFP) for 1999/2000-2001/02, which was prepared in wllaboration with the stat% of the Inmrnational Monetary Fund and the World Bank and which is being transmitted to the IMF and the World Bank. The Government will make the PFP and the MEFP available to the public. 2. In support of these objectives and policies, the Government of Rwanda hereby requests the second annual arrangement under the ESAF, in an amount equivalent to SDR 23.80 million (29.7 percent of quota). The Government will also request support Tom the World Bank, the AfDB, the EU, and other multilateral and bilateral creditors. 3. The Government of Rwanda will continue to provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requires to assess Rwanda’s progress in implementing the policies described in this letter and attached memorandum, as well as the policy framework paper mentioned in paragraph 1. Moreover, Rwanda will continue to consult with the Fund on its economic and financial policies, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations. 4.

During the period of the second ammat arrangement, the Government of Rwanda will consult with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at the initiative of Rwanda or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation.

The macroeconomic objectives under the 1998/99 (April-March) program were broadly achieved. The outcomes for real GDP growth in 1998 (9.5 .percent) and inflation (as measured by the average urban consumer price index (CPI) (6.8 percent) were better than foreseen under the pmgram, reflecting the strong recovery of agricuhural output, which, in turn, was helped by the improved security situation in the northwest and the resettlement of returned retirgees. 2. The midterm review of the first annual ESAP arrangement was originally expected to be based on performance through end-September 1998. However, the quantitative perfor- mance criteria on net foreign assets of the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) and the net repayment of domestic arrears were missed mainly reflecting delays in donor disbursements (in part related to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)) and problems in monitoring government expenditure; there were also significant emerging revenue short- falls. In light of these slippages, the authorities took prompt remedial actions during the last quarter of 1998 (in particular to strengthen revenue collection) to safeguard the targets of the financial program for end-December 1998, as well as to expedite the implementation of structural measures that were behind schedule. As a result, the financial and structural program targets for December 1998 were broadly met, and the midterm review was completed on March 24,1999. 3. While the primary fiscal accounts for 1998 were almost in balance (within the program target equivalent to -0.2 percent of GDP), there was a shift in the composition of spending with military spending exceeding the budget allocation by about % percent of GDP (reflecting in part the reintegration into the national army of returned soldiers of the prewar government) and underspending on the social sectors (related to delays in regularizing and biting new teachers). In the context of the midterm review of the first annual ESAP arrsnge- ment, as well as the 1999 budget, the Government has reiterated its commitment to wntain- ing defense expenditure snd significantly increasing social spending, while improving the monitoring of social sector developments through quarterly spending targets (effective since early 1999) and regular social performance indicators. 4. ln the first half of 1999, despite good agricultural performance, real GDP growth slowed down, reflecting problems in the transport and manufacturing sectors (including beer/lemonade production), and is projected at 5 percent for the year. Inflation was almost zero in the first half of 1999 as the fall in food prices that occurred during most of 1998 slowed down. Inflation is expected to remain low, with the 12-month CPI projected to be below 3 percent at end-1999. In the first eight months of 1999, the exchange rate of the Rwanda franc depreciated by about 2 percent against the U.S. dollar; it appreciated by about 8% percent and 7% percent in nominal and real effective terms, respectively, as the dollar appreciated vis-&is the currencies of Rwanda’s main trading partners, while Rwanda’s Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-52- inflation was close to that of its trading partners. The parallel market premium rose substamially from about 5 percent early in the year to about 10 percent in recent months. Official reserves have remained close to their 1998 level, equivalent to over six months of imports c.i.f 5. In the first half of 1999, the authorities broadly implemented fiscal policies under the 1999 budget, as agreed under the ESAP-supported pmgram. However, the primary fiscal deficit exceeded the indicative target for June by 0.7 percent of GDP, mainly as a result of revenue shortfalls. These shorttblls were due to several factors, partly outside control of the Government: higher-than-expected revenue losses, owing to a significant tariff reduction in January in line with the Cross-Border Initiative (CBI) objectives; transport problems on the Kenya route, owing to the enforcement by the Kenyan government of maximum axle weights since late 1998; the drop in transit trade of goods to neighboring countries in the Great Lakes area; a drop in sales of beer and soft drinks, problems in customs administration; and delays in the collection of tax arrears and the tax assessment of small and medium enterprises. 6. The Government kept primary expenditure (including on defense) within the targets for June 1999, and met most social spending objectives except for some underspending in health, related to delays in recruiting new qualified staff. However, a temporary overrun (of about 0.2 percent of GDP) on defense expendiie is expected for the third quarter related to the purchase of equipment; this will be offset by a wrrespondingly lower expenditure in the last quarter. Exceptional social spending programs were largely implemented as foreseen, with the transfer as budgeted to the 8md for genocide survivors and the demobilization payments to the 3,600 soldiers demobilized at end-1998. With recent improvements in expenditure monitoring, domestic arresrs were repaid as planned and the float of new arrears on goods and services and transfers was kept within the “normal” level of RP 2 billion. In addition, expenditure commitments and payment orders continued to be closely monitored to avoid abnormal delays in the signing of payment orders. 7. At end-June 1999, foreign-financed capital spending (which accounts for almost all public investment projects) was less than one-quarter of the budget allocation for the year, because of delays in project preparation and weak implementation capacity within the line ministries, exacerbated by arduous pmcedural requirements of donors. Reflecting larger- than-expected disbursements of external budgetary support in the second quarter of 1999, the Government was able to build up deposits with the BNR. However, a&r adjusting for the excess budgetary support above the projected amounts, the indicative program ceiling for net credit to government at end-June was missed by about RP 2 billion, as the higher primary deficit was financed by the use of external budgetary support. 8. After sluggish growth in 1998, money demand remained subdued in 1999, with broad money growth at about 2 percent in the 1Zmonth period ended-June 1999 reflecting faster growth in the nonmonetized sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture. Despite the significant disbursements of external budgetary support, net foreign assets of the BNR remained flat in the first half of 1999, and the target for end-June was missed. In light of the lower-than-targeted reserve money growth through net foreign assets, banks’ liquidity demand was in part met by modest liquidity injections by the BNR. Banks’ net foreign assets Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - deteriorated sharply in the first half of 1999, reflecting withdrawals Tom resident foreign exchange acwunts, banks’ sales to the foreign exchange bureaus in response to higher demand, refleoted in premia on the foreign exchange markets (perhaps related to unrecorded trade and net private capital outflows), and banks’ deposits of foreign exchange with the BNB. Growth of credit to the private sector remained close to 20 percent in the 12-month period through June 1999. During the first half of 1999, deposit and lending interest rates fell slightly, but real interest rates remained positive. 9. In 1998, the external current account delicit (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have remained close to the 1997 level of 17 percent of GDP, as lower imports of goods and services and higher-than-expected volume of tea exports more than offset lower coffee export volumes and prices. Imports are estimated to have dropped by about 8 percent in dollar terms in the first half of 1999, reflecting in part increased transport costs on the Kenya route. However, unrewrded imports seem to have increased. Official reserves were less than envisaged at mid-1999, reflecting substantial sales by the BNK to wmmercial banks. In recent months, Rwanda signed bilateral rescheduhng agxecments 116th all its Paris Club creditors. It is seeking agreements with its non-Paris Club creditors on terms at least comparable to those granted by Paris Club creditors. Furthermore, it has regularised its arrears situation vis-a-vis the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and the OPEC Fund, and will do so vis-kvis the European Union before the end of the year. 10. The structural reforms envisaged for 1998 were broadly implemented, although some with delays, in psrticular in the areas of fiscal and civil service reform. The authorities took several steps to render the IlKA operational and to improve tax administration; these included increased preshipment inspection (PSI), monitoring of transit trade, and the use of insurance bonds for both transit trade and imports en route to domestic customs depots. Expenditure management was improved through a close monitoring of expenditure commitments, payment orders, and payments; the completed computer&ion of the payroll, including for all teachers; the initiation of the wmputerization of budget/treasury operations; and the wide circulation of budget execution guidelines. With respect to civil service reform, in the course of 1998 about 3,600 ghost workers were removed Tom the payroll; almost 3,600 unqualified civil servants were retrenched; a civil service census was carried out at year-end; progress was made in reconciling payroll and census data during the following months, and a new salary structure (including the monetixation of all fringe benefits) was introduced in JMUIY 1999, significantly improving incentives for civil servants. Furthermore, new organizational structures for all ministries and a new job classification&-ading system were prepared. 11. The Government prow&d with public enterprise reform. Since June 1998, it completed the sale of 20 enterprises, offered for sale 14 more enterprises, and initiated the liquidation of 3 enterprises. In the financid sector area, the new banking law was adopted by parliament at end-March 1999 and promulgated in late August; the financial audits of the five wmmercial banks were completed in May 1999. At end-1998, the authorities wmmenced treasury-bill auctions with a view to tiuther enhancing indirect monetary policy instruments. The exchange regime was tinther liberalised, prior to the authorities’ acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII in December 1998. In this context, the BNK recently Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-54- issued and widely publicked the new consolidated exchange regulations, and the modalities of their implementation, including the new rules for the operation of foreign currency accounts. 12. In response to the above-mentioned delays in structural reforms, the Govemment is committed to implement, before end-October 1999, the measures listed as prior actions in Box 1. Box 1.

OBJEcrrvEs AND POLICIES FOR 1999moo 13. The Government’s strategy for high growth, which is essential for bringing down Rwanda’s high incidence of poverty (estimated at 70 percent) is centered on (a) maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to private savings and investment; (b) improving government revenue mobilization and expenditure management and prioritization, with particular emphasis on good governance and human resource development; (c) accelerating structural reforms in the areas of civil service, financial sector, and public enterprises; and (d) establishing and maintaining M institutional framework conducive to private sector activity and external competitiveness. Wii a view to stren8thening the link between ewnomi&ocial policies and poverty reduction, the Government intends to develop a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, for completion in the wurse of 2000. 14. The Government remains committed to reducing the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) and achieving a sustainable debt position over the medium term. In light of Rwanda’s social and rehabilitation needs, the current macroeconomic environment with very low inflation, and the prospects for very wncessional donor support for the social sector through the budget, the Government envisages significant increases in social spending over the next years. The Government is aware that this strategy requires close collaboration with donors to ensure their sustained support, a transparent budget process incorporating the results of the recent social sector expenditure review, and close monitoring of the quality and impact of this spending. The Government is also aware of the need to redouble the efforts to mobilize domestic revenue to ensure the sustainability of social and other priority expenditure over the medium term. 15. Consistent with this strategy, Rwanda’s ewnomic policies are aimed at achieving the following macroeconomic objectives for 1999/2000-2001/2002: (i) to attain on average an annual real GDP growth of almost 6 percent; (ii) to maintain the average Mation rate at below 3 percent a year; (iii) to contain the extemal current account deficit (excluding official transfers) at about 17 percent of GDP; and (iv) to maintain gross official reserves at a minimum of four months of imports c.i.f. during the period. Achieving these objectives, while laying the basis for sustainable fiscal and government debt positions, would require an improvement in government revenue by about % of 1 percentage point of GDP a year, wntaimnent of the primary fiscal deficit at an average of about 1 percent of GDP, and M increase in investment to almost 20 percent of GDP in 2001-02 (from 15.7 percent in 1998). A. Fiil Policies 16. Fiscal policies in 1999/2000, straddling the 1999 and 2000 budgets, will be broadly consistent with the program supported by the three-year ESAF arrangement. However, in view of adverse exogenous factors affecting revenue performance in 1999, as well as delays in tax administration reforms taking effect, the Government’s revenue targets have been revised downward. The key objectives are to (i) increase revenue from 10.5 percent of GDP in 1999 (10.2 percent, excluding proceeds from import surcharges) to 10.7 percent of GDP in 2000, while maintaining trade taxes consistent with the CBI objectives; (ii) contain the wage Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-56- bill at about 5 percent of GDP, while achieving a ttnther improvement in the civil service pay and incentive structure; (iii) reduce defense expenditure from 4.0 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2000 (and Tom 3.5 percent of GDP to 3.2 percent of GDP excluding the national police); and (iv) increase social spending &om 3.7 percent of GDP in 1999 to about 4 percent of GDP in 2000. Consistent with these targets and the expected financing of the budget, the primary fiscal deficit is targeted at 0.7 percent of GDP in 1999 and near balance in 2000 (wmpsred with near balance and a surplus of 1 percent under the original program, respectively). 17. 1999 budget. Jn light of the revenue shortfalls in the first half of 1999, the Government has taken several measures under the midyear budget revision to contain the revenue shortfall and the primary deficit: the imposition of IO-15 percent temporary import surcharges on imports subject to the maximum and intermediate rates (of 25 percent and 15 percent, respectively) (estimated revenue gain equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP in 1999); after a 4 percent price increase in January 1999, a further increase in retail petroleum prices by 8 percent effective September, together with the adoption of a flexible pricing mechanism under which retail prices are adjusted monthly to reflect developments on the world market. reductions in the range of IO-15 percent in the budget allocations for nonsocial expenditure on goods and services (including on defense) to partly offset the needs of two additional ministries created in February 1999; and immediate steps to improve tax and customs administration, in particular, the strengthening of preshipment inspections, the enhanced collection of tax arrears and debt service t?om identified public enterprises, the presumptive income tax from small and medium enterprises, and nontax revenue, based on the results of the recently undertaken measures (partly as prior actions, see Box I). Also as a prior action, the RRA has, by mid-September 1999, adopted a prioritixed action plan and timetable for the period October 1999/end-2000 to strengthen tax and customs administration. The plan will focus on the following elements: (9 Strengthening of preshipment inspection: to 80 percent for non-petroleum imports equivalent to USS5,OOO and higher, and to 100 percent for petroleum imports. For non- petroleum imports equivalent to USS5,OOO and above without preshipment inspection, post arrival inspection (wvering both bank and nonbank bmsactions) will be carried out. For all other imports below USS5,000, periodically updated reference prices fiom SGS and internationally accepted valuation codes will be applied. (ii) Strengthening of the wntrol of transit trade, including by full application of insurance bonds to all transit imports and the strengthening of the system of warehousing of goods. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-57- (iii) Acceleration of wmputerization of the tax department to monitor assessment and wllection; and strengthening the use of the customs documentation system, ASYCUDA. (iv) Strengthening of enforcement of the penalty system and of the Revenue Protection SCNiW. (v) Strengthening of stafftraining in tariff classifkation, PSI/valuation, tax assessment, acwunting, and auditing. 18. Furthermore, the Government is stepping up the preparation of the value-added tax, based on the VAT implementation plan adopted in June 1999, including the submission to parliament of the draft VAT law (by end-1999) and the ongoing campaign to educate the public on the VAT. 19. With the measures undertaken to improve revenue collection and the Government’s commitment to restrain nonsocial expenditure for the rest of 1999, the agreed primary fiscal deficit target of 0.7 percent of GDP for 1999 is expected to be attained. To ensure meeting these targets for 1999, the authorities have fixed monthly revenue and expenditure targets for the remainder of the year; meeting these targets through end-September 1999 would be a prior action. 20. The Government remains committed to safeguarding expenditure on IwIth and edueatien. In this regard, it wmpleted by end-October the reguhuixation of all teachers and other civil servants. It will also further improve the monitoring of social spending and its impact through regular monitoring of performance indicators (Tables 3-5). Exceptional social spending programs-related to assistance to genocide survivors, demobilixation and reintegration of ex-soldiers into society, retrenchment of civil servants, and the establishment of governance institutions’-are expected to be implemented as programmed (equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP). 21. Capital expenditure is expected to increase to 7.6 percent of GDP in 1999 (wmpared with 6.7 percent of GDP in 1998 and 9.5 percent under the program) as a result of the Government’s efforts to improve the implementation and monitoring capacity for investment projects. In this regard, the establishment at end-1998 of the Central Project Bureau (CEPEX) (which wordinates project selection, external financing, and project monitoring), and a strengthening of the procedures of the Central Tender Board with assistance from the World Bank, AfDB, and UNDP have proved useful 22. Regarding expenditure management, the Government is implementing several mechanisms to improve the transparency of the budget process, expenditure control, and ’ These include the Commissions for National Unity and Reconciliation, Human Rights, and Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which were established in February 1999, June 1999, and October 1999, respectively. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-58- govemment accountability (Box 2). Furthermore, with technical assistance from UK-DFID and the Fund, the Government is in the process of introducing a medium-term expenditure fiamework, which aims at pmgressively introducing program-based budgeting, linking expenditures to monitorable outputs in each ministry.

Regarding domestic financing, the program for 1999 foresees a net repayment of RF 3.5 billion, including all arrears outstanding at end-1998 (RF 1.5 billion), arrears to the CSR and post office (RF 0.8 billion), arrears on account of World Bank and JFAD projects (RF 0.7 billion), wage arrears owed in respect of regularizing the status of civil servants Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-59- (RF 0.6 billion), and newly identified arrears (in part incurred by the prewar govemment, RF 2.1 billion). This net repayment takes into account the normal “float” of not-yet-paid payment orders, which the Government is committed to keep within RF 2 billion. The Government will also start repaying the Caisse sociale du Rwanda, based on a restructuring plan for the CSR and the consolidation of government debt to the CSR, scheduled for adoption by December 1999. 24. 2000 budget. The authorities aim at increasing revenue to 10.7 percent of GDP in 2000, while maintaining an open trade regime consistent with the CBI objectives. In this regard, the temporaty import surcharges will be reduced by 50 percent with the 2000 budget, with till elimination in the uxnse of 2000. The improvement in revenue collection (by 55 percent of GDP, when the revenue loss from the elimination of surcharges is taken into account) will be achieved through a broadening of the tax base (including through the introduction of a VAT &om mid-2000), a reduction in tax exemptions, and the implementation of the RRA action plan). 25. The authorities are committed to reducing defcnse spending to below the equivalent of 3.2 vt of GDP, taking into account the envisaged demobilisation of 11,400 soldiers during 1999-2000. The Government intends to maintain the budget allocations for the national police at 0.5 percent of GDP and that for other nonsocial primary spending at 3.2 percent of GDP, both equivalent to their expected 1999 levels. 26. The authorities intend to contain the Government’s wage bill to the equivalent of 4.8 percent of GDP and 45 percent of revenue (iroom 5.0 and 48 percent, respectively, in 1999), while tinther improving the salary and incentive structure. This will be achieved through a reduction in the size of the military; a tInther retrenchment of unqualified civil servants; and a streamlining of the core civil service (excluding teachers), in line with the newly adopted organizational structures of ministries, to not more than 9,500 in 2000 (from an average of about 9,700 in recent months), while safeguarding the needs of the health and justice sectors. The recruitment of new teachmbove the current number of almost 28,008 aff er regular&ion of teachers not yet on the payroll and removal of ghosts-will be subject to approval by the ministers of Finance and Civil Setvice and will be based on availability of qualified teachers and teaching infrastructure. 27. Recurrent se&l expendiiurc (including for the health and education ministries), as agreed upon with World Bank and Fund stat& will be increased to about 4 percent of GDP (Born 3.7 percent targeted for 1999; Table 3). In the context of the 2000 budget, the Government will identify social and poverty reduction priority spending programs. The quarterly spending targets for these programs will be agreed upon with the statfs of the World Bank and the Fund at the time of the first review of the second-year ESAF arrangement. In case revenue collection exceeds the program target, the additional resources will be allocated to the agreed social and other priority sectors. 28. The Government is preparing social spending programs, based on the social sector expenditure reviews and in consultation with, and technical assistance from, donors. Emphasis will be placed on: (i) adequate provision of teaching and health care supplies, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6o- including books and medicine; (ii) improving salaries and on-the-job training of teachers and health workers; and (iii) increasing the number of qualified health workers. After a significant increase in spending on tertiary education in 1999 with a view to meeting the urgent rehabilitation needs of several institutions (including for teacher and nurse training), the share of tertiary education in total education spending will decline to below one-third in 2000 and the balance will shift to primary and secondary education. In this context, the authorities will implement efficiency-enhancing measures in tertiary education, including a system of student loans (to be effective Room the 2000/01 academic year). 29. The Government will tinther improve the monitoring of social spending through recipient and beneficiary surveys, the regular reporting on intermediate output and outcome indicators (Tables 3-5), and an increase in the implementation capacity of the social minis- tries (with technical and financial assistance from DFID, World Bank, and other donors). 30. Exceptional social spending in 2000 is projected at the equivalent of 1.8 percent of GDP; in addition to assistance to genocide survivors, emphasis will be placed on the reintegration of demobilixed soldiers into civil life, training and severance payments for retrenched civil servants and public enterprise employees, and provision of food to prisoners. The composition of exceptional social expenditure is monitored accordiig to detailed understandings with Fund staff In light of their special nature related to the aftermath of the genocide, these expenditures would remain outside the primary fiscal balance targeted under the program; if Rwanda receives external budgetary support in excess of the programmed amounts, the excess can be used either to increase exceptional social spending or to increase the budget allocations for the social sector, in consultation with Fund and World Bank staffs. 31. Regarding domestic fmancing, the Government intends to repay the depositors of the Caisse d’@rgne (under liquidation) in an amount of RF 1 billion. B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies 32. Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to aim at keeping annual inflation at or below 3 percent and meeting the BNR’s net foreign assets target. Intlation, which has been very low during the past one and a half year, is expected to pick up somewhat as the increase in food supplies that has caused food prices to drop is leveling off. The increase in the GDP deflator in 1999 is projected at 2 percent. The monetary program remains based on a reserve money target, which will be pursued primarily through the BNR’s money market interventions. In order to assist the commercial banks in the efficient management of their liquidity, the BNR will, in addition to providing banks with statistics on money and banking in Rwanda, publicize their intentions regarding monetary policy (e.g., through public statements, press releases, and letters to banks). In particular, they will clarify their policy that the exchange rate will be market determined, and that liquidity policy will be determined by the targets for reserve money. 33. Taking into account the lower projected growth in real GDP and money demand, both reserve money and broad money are now projected to grow at 5 percent in 1999, and about 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in 2000. To influence banks’ liquidity, the BNR will Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61- continue to use both money market snd treasury bill auctions. It will gnther enhance the transparency of these operations for the participating banks, including by providing advance notification and indicating the volume of the intended sales or purchases. They will also increase the tlequency of auctions and the variety of maturities. With a view to enhancing banks’ liquidity, the authorities will initiate the conversion of consolidated government debt to commercial banks into treasmy bills in the fourth quarter of 1999, thereafter, the process of gradual conversion of this debt into tressmy bills is expected to be completed by end-2000. To enhance the development of a secondary market, the BNR will issue an instruction requiring banks to hold a minimum proportion of their assets in liquid form. The transfer of eligible government bank accounts Room commercial banks to the BNR will be wmpkted in the course of 2000. 34. Exchange rate pdicy will continue to be guided by the principle of allowing the exchange rate to respond to market conditions, with intervention by the BNR aimed only at meeting the net foreign assets target and at smoothing excessive short-term exchange rate fluctuations (such as those related to commodity price fluctuations and the disbursement pattern of donor support) without resisting underlying trends. The competitiveness of the tradables sector will be assessed on an ongoing basis by monitoring the real exchange rate, relative prices, profitability and productivity growth, and other relevant indicators. The net foreign assets target takes into account a gradual decline in the import coverage of ofBciai reserves from its current level of about six months of imports c.i.f to a minimum level of four months. In view of recent developments on the exchange market, the authorities are committed to more actively pursue the BNR’s net foreign assets target and facilitate a reduction in the parallel market premium. 35. ‘Tire excbauge regime. AtIer recent steps to widely publicize the revised regulations, the authorities are guther enhancing the fimctioning of the foreign exchange market by strengthening the supervision of banks’ and foreign exchange bureaus foreign exchange operations consistent with existing regulations; by informing economic agents about the advantage of bank settlements instead of cash transactions. The operation of the forward market, which was established in May 1999, will also be encouraged but witbout any involvement of the BNR. The BNR is committed to strictly enforcing the limits on banks’ and foreign exchange bureaus’ net open foreign positions. Furthermore, the BNR will refrain from swap and similar arrangements to buy/sell foreign exchange from banks for the purpose of meeting its net foreign assets target. 36. Financial sector reform. At end-September 1999, the BNR reached agreement with the five commercial banks on the amounts of additional provisioning and capital required, based on the recently completed audits. By end-December 1999, it will agree with the banks on revised restructuring plans, as well as on a timetable for each bank for added provisioning, the recognition of impaired assets, and the increase in capital. In this regard, all banks are expected to meet the minimum provisioning standards and reach a capital adequacy ratio of 5 percent by end-2000 (and the Basle capital adquacy standard of 8 percent by mid-2002). Most new capital will be provided by the private sector (including foreign bank shareholders) and not by the Government, which has decided that it will become a minority shareholder in the two largest banks (BK and BCR) in which public interests presently represent one-half or Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-62- more. The BNR is further &eng&ning its capacity for banking supervision to ensure compliance with the recently issued regulations under the new banking law. It will increase the coverage and frequency of on-site inspections of each bank through a comprehensive inspection every 12 months and a full external audit of each bank at least once every two years from early 2000 onward. These inspections/audits will include monitoring bank loan approval arrangements in line with sound banking practices. Banks will be expected to put in place internal audit departments that report to their boards. 37. The Government, meanwhile, is taking several steps to help improve the recovery of nonperforming loans by expediting the production of d ocumentation necessary for foreclosure; accelerating seizure procedures; and establishing commercial courts. Furthermore, the arbitration center, established by the private sector last May, will help the loan recovery process even though it tacks legally binding authority. With regard to other financial institutions, the Government is expecting to shortly appoint a liquidator for the state-owned Caisse d’dpargne. With the new banking law, the UBP has been brought under the supervision of the BNR and the relevant regulation for cooperative savings and loans institutions will be issued by early 2000. A financial audit of the UBP will be commenced by March 2000, and based on its recommendations an organixational and financial restructuring plan will be put in place in the course of 2000. 38. The restructuring plan for the Caisse sociale du Rwanda (CSR), based on the recently completed financial, legal, and organixational audits and actuarial study, will be final&d and adopted by end-December 1999. The plan calls for determining the amount of the Government’s nonperforming debt to the CSR, which is to be consolidated. The consolidation of this debt will be initiated in January 2000, through the use of external budgetary support. The Government will submit to parliament, by March 2000, a draft organic social security law which sets out the regulatory framework for a two-tier benefit system: one with obligatory enrollment for all government and private sector workers subject to the labor code and provided by the public sector; and a complementary one with voluntary participation which could be provided by both public and private agencies. C. External Sector Policies 39. The authorities remain committed to the CBI objective. They will progressively phase out the temporary import surcharge (to be eliminated in the course of 2000), and are aiming at implementing zero intraregional tariffs consistent with progress made by other countries in the region. Furthermore, the Government intends to review the existing 4 percent Magenva tax (of which 1 percentage point accrues to the publicly owned warehouse company) with a view to replacing it by a statistical tax to reflect the cost of warehouse services and consistent with WTO rules in 2001. The authorities will also pursue the other CBI objectives regarding the promotion of investment and cross-border trade and factor flows. In this regard, the technical working group will be established by December 1999 and the Letter of the CBI Policy will be completed by March 2000. 40. Regarding external financing, residual financing gaps-after projected official transfers and project loans, obtained debt relief and refinancing from Paris Club creditors and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - muhilateral creditors, and debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors to be final&d over the coming months-are.pmjected at about USSlOO million in both 1999 and 2000. These gaps are expe&xJ to be fully covered by budgetary support from the World Bank, AtDB, EU, and bilateral donors. The Government will continue to pursue its prudent external debt management stmtegy (including through close coordination between the Ministry of Finance and the BNR) and retiain t?om contracting external debt on nonwncessional terms. 41. Rwanda’s external debt situation is likely to remain very difftcult in the medium term. The updated debt sustainability analysis, prepared in consultation with Fund and World Bank staffs, indicates that even under optimistic export growth projections, Rwanda’s net present value (NPV) of debt-to-exports ratio and debt service-to-exports ratio, atIer application of traditional debt relief mechanisms, will remain in the order of 500 percent and 30 percent, respectively, during the KM-2001 period. The Government will, therefore, seek qualification for assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, based on its track record under ESAF- and earlier Fund-supported programs. D. Other Structural Policies 42. In addition to structural reforms in the fiscal, financial, and external trade areas, the Government atta&es high priority to the reform of the civil service, the demobilization and reintegration of soldiers, the privatization of public enterprises, and private sector development (Box 3). 43. The authorities remain committed to vigorously pursue the ongoing reform of the civil seervice with a view to establishing an efficient, well-paid and qualified public administration, which promotes good governance, i.e., transparency, accountability, and integrity. In the remainder of 1999, the authorities will-with technical assistance from UNDP and World Bank-implement the new organimtionai structures of all ministries (including for the decentralized departments in thepr&clures and public agencies), complete the job descriptions, and convert all statTint positions/grades. With these new structures and the recent removal of ghost workers identified in the civil service census, it is envisaged that the size of the core civil service will be wntained within 9,500 during 2000, and that the number of teachers (estimated at almost 28,000 at end-September 1999 after reguhuization) will not exceed 28,500 in the 1999/2000 school year. 44. Regarding civil service sahuies, after the adoption of a new more differentiated pay structure in early 1999, the authorities intend to revisit the salary structure with the 2000 budgettoemure wnsistency with the new otganizational structures. To promote efliciency, accountability, and transparency, the Government intends to further strengthen the recently established National Tender Board and ORice of the Auditor General. Furthermore, it is revising the civil service statutes/Code of Conduct and preparing a “leadership code,” including, financial disclosure rules, for both senior public and elected officials.

The Government will accelerate the implementation of the privatization program. By mid-2000, the Government will sell, liquidate, bring to the point of sale, or sell its shares in a cumulative total of 46 out of the 69 public enterprises included in the divestiture program (based on tbe attached timetable, Table 2), with priority to the privatization of the 9 tea factories and the liquidation of C&se d’+rgne du Rwanda in the course of 2000. Regarding the public telecommunications company (Rwandatel), the Government will submit to parliament, by December 1999, a regrdatory Ranrework to abolish its monopoly and regulate the sector, and it intends to complete the offer for saleby September 2000. Following the abolishment of the monopoly of the electricity and water company (Electrogaz) in September 1999, the Government intends to adopt a policy 6amework for the restructuring of the company and submit to parliament a regulatory framework for the sector by June 2000, with a view to completing the restmcturing/privatization of Electmgsz by July 2001. The authorities will continue to ensure the transparency of the privatization process (including through a wide advertisement of the offer for sale) and accelerate the actual sale (including through the timely preparation of title deeds). 46. The Government has recently revised the 1997 demobilhtion program to take into acuxmt the recent reintegration of ex-FAR into the army. Following the demobilization of about 8,600 soldiers during 1997-98, the Government intends to demobilize 11,400 soldiers during 1999-2000 and another 5,000 in 2001, thus bringing the total to 25,000 (from 20,000 under the original program). The demobilization pmgram provides for short-term sssistance to demobilized soldiers in the form of cash allowances, training, and subsidized small-scale credits, with total costs estimated at about RF 1.9 billion in 1999 and RF 2.4 billion in 2000. 47. Regarding the regulatory framework for the private sector, parliament is expected to adopt, in the next few months, the new labor code which aims at enhancing labor mobility, eliminating gender discrimination and wage wntrolq and reducing labor costs. The Rwanda Investment Promotion Agency is expected to be tidly operational by mid-November 1999. E. Social Policies 48. A critical element of the Government’s social policy is reducing the incidence of poverty, estimated at over 70 percent of households. As discussed in the Government’s policy framework paper (PFP), the authorities are adopting a range of measures to raise rural incomes through improving the distribution of inputs (with subsidies for target groups), developing microcredit schemes, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs at tbe wmmunaJ level. A significant improvement in the status and opportunities for women will be pursued through the recently adopted changes in the laws concerning property rights, and educational programs to reinforce these laws. 49. Budgetary recurrent spending on health and education is projected to increase by just over 40 percent each in 1999, and by almost 35 percent and 15 percent in 2000, respectively. Special emphasis will be put on improving the quality and geographical distribution of teachers and primary health workers, and on improving enrollment, retention, and progres- sion rates in primary and secondary schools, in particular for girls. The Government will Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-66- tbrther t&e&en the monitoring of key poverty and social performance indicators. To this effect, the special obsmwfq within the Ministry of Finance, which will work closely with the social ministries, will be established by December 1999. Plans are under way to undertake specific beneficiary surveys to measure access of the population to basic social services. Furthermore, household living conditions surveys are expected to be completed in 2000. F. StatisticdIsauea 50. The Government is wmmitted to addressing weaknesses in the macroeconomic and social database. The BNR is addressing statistical problems in the monetaty accounts and improving the. reconciliation with the use of bank financing by the budget, in close coordination with the Ministry of Finance. The BNR has also prepared an action plan to improve the collection of balance of payments statistics based on recent recommendations and technical assistance hm the Fund. In the fiscal area, the Gov-ent will further improve data reporting (including Government Finance Statistics Corn end-December 1999 onward) with assistance from the Fund in the areas of budget preparation and treasury operations. The authorities have also requested tbrther technical assistance from the Fund in the areas of national accounts and prices. G. Prior Actions, Performance Criteria, Benchmarks, and Reviews 51. Progress in economic policy implementation under the program will be monitored through quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the period October 19994eptember 2000 (Tables l-2). The quantitative targets for December 1999 and June 2000 will constitute performance criteria and those for March and September 2000 quantitative benchmarks. 52. The program wntains automatic contingency mechanisms to adjust the monetary program targets for shorttYls/excesses in external budgetary support vis-a-vis the program- med amounts. In the case of a shortfall, net bank financing of the budget in allowed to increase (with an annual cap equivalent to about 1% percent of GDP), but only to the extent that the shortfall was not offset by a shortfall in exceptional social spending or social spending. In the case of an excess, the additional external budgetary support may be spent on the agreed exceptional social spending or social spending items in consultation with the staff8 of the Fund and World Bank and donors (with a downward adjustment in the primary fiscal balance. target in case of additional social spending which is tidly financed). Any remaining excess budgetary support will be deposited in the Government’s accounts with the banking system. 53. The Gov-ent is further strengthening the monitoring of the program, including through the timely reporting of the budget execution by ministry within two weeks atIer the end of each month; a detailed repotting of government bank accounts; the regular provision of the bank deposits and other financial acwunts of public enterprises and autonomous public agencies; and the quarterly provision of dam on social spending and performance indicators (Tables 3-5). To enhance program monitoring and coordination, the authorities are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-67- extending the Jntenninisterial Committee for the ESAF-supported program (with representation from the ministries of Education and Health) and are strengthening the associated Technical Committee. 54. The implementation of program policies will be subject to two reviews by the Fund. The Cmt review, to be wmpleted not later than March 2000, will focus on assessing the revemre impact of the tax measures foreseen under the program (including the phasing out of the import surcharges), as well 88 progress in civil service reform. Completion of the first review, obse~~~cc of the quantitative performance criteria at end-December 1999 and the s.tructural performance criteria through December 1999, and adoption of a satisfactory budget for 2000 will be conditions for the second loan disbursement under the second annual ESAF arrangement. The seeend review, to be wmpleted no later than September 2000, will focus on pmgress in tax reforms (including the VAT) and financial sector reform; completion of the second review and observance of the quantitative performance criteria at end-June 2000 llndstNcturaiperfblmance criteria through June 2000 will be a condition for the third loan disbursement under the second annual ESAF arrangement. 55. The Government has taken a number of prior actions, 8s indicated in Box 1; in addition, meeting the agreed upon government revenue and expenditure targetmonsistent with the program targets for the year-through September 1999 will be a prior action.
