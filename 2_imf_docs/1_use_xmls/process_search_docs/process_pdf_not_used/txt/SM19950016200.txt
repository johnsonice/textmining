Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Namibia took place against the background of the inauguration of President Nujoma (SWAPO) for a second and final term and the celebration of Namibia's fifth year of indepen- dence. The discussions were conducted in Windhoek during March 9-23, 1995 and, because the new Cabinet was appointed at the end of the mission's stay, the exchange of views continued after the mission's return to Washington, until April 28, 1995. lJ In concluding the 1994 Article IV consultation (SM/94/109), Executive Directors commended the authorities on the smooth introduction of the Namibia" dollar in September 1993. However, noting the emerging fiscal pressures and uncertain future revenue receipts from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), Directors called for a lasting fiscal consolidation effort. Given Namibia's high level of unemployment, they also emphasized the need for policies aimed at increasing private sector activity and labor absorption. Data on international reserves, the central bank balance sheet, interest rates, external current account balance, and overall fiscal balance are reported in a timely and consistent manner (Appendix III); the national accounts are being revised to reflect new source data and the 1993 SNA standards. However, a number of outstanding statistical issues need to be addressed. The CPI is based on sample data that are not representative of the economy. Information on merchandise trade, which is acquired largely from annual surveys. needs to be improved by developing sufficient capacity at the Department of Customs and Excise. There is a lack of data on employ- ment , wages, and the sectoral distribution of domestic credit. Finally, fiscal expenditure and revenue do not reflect all development spending and the related financing by donors; by excluding these amounts, development spending is understated by nearly 50 percent in the 1995/96 budget. II. Background to the Policy Discussions 1. Develcaments in 1994 In 1994, the increase in real activity--estimated at 6& percent- primarily reflected a recovery from the 1992 drought and a rebound in value added from the mining sector. Gross national savings increased to 1/ Namibia's first post-independence elections were held in December 1994; the new Cabinet was installed on March 21, 1995. The mission met with Mr. Hanekom, and his successor as Minister of Finance, Mr. Angula; Mr. Ahmad, Governor, Bank of Namibia; representatives from other ministries and the National Planning Commission; and the private sector. The staff team comprised Mr. Carstens (head), Mr. Mardi. Ms. Rehm, Mrs. Randall (EP), and Ms. Williams-Smith (assistant) (all AFR). Mr. Conrad (OMD) and Mr. Potter (FAD) were also in Windhoek for the fifth annual Tripartite Revi,ew of the IMF/UNDP technical assistance project.

Cross investment appears also to have risen to nearly 20 percent of GDP in 1994, owing to a modest accumulation of inventories, although gross fixed investment is estimated to have declined as a result of a slowdown in investment in fishing and fish processing. The direction of price movements in Namibia tends to reflect develop- ments in South Africa. During 1994, inflation (Windhoek CPI) accelerated from 9.7 percent to 11.4 percent, reflecting the effect of climatic con- ditions on food prices throughout the region, higher inflation in South Africa, and the depreciation of the rand vis-B-vis major international currencies. 1/ Despite the robust economic growth, job creation appears to have been well below the annual increase in the labor force of 16,500. Unemployment may be as high as 25 percent overall, and 40 percent in urban areas. 2/ Wages in the formal sector are most likely high by regional standards, owing in part to a remuneration structure inherited from South Africa, and to a surge in real wages during 1990-92. Available information points to a subsequent moderation in nominal wage growth: private sector real wages were reported to have declined by about 2 percent a year since 1993; and government expenditures on personnel declined by about 1 percent in real terms during 1993-94. In recent years, the authorities have made considerable efforts in the areas of human resources development. Education programs have focused on providing the necessary teacher training. As the first phase of a program aimed at in-service training and education reform, in December 1992, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) developed an in-service teacher education policy. Substantial success has also been reported with regard to adult literacy programs, which are now accessible in most communities. Health care efforts have emphasized community-based primary care: one achievement has been the widespread implementation of the Expanded Program on Immunization, supported by UNICEF and other international organizations. J/ The original 1994/95 budget called for a 6.8 percent increase in total expenditure (including net lending), and projected a 5.2 percent rise in total revenue (including grants). However, after provisions made under the I/ The Namibia" dollar has a fixed 1:l relationship with the rand.

The fiscal deficit (including grants), which remained at 3.9 percent of GDP, was financed largely through the issue of domestic debt instruments (the public debt increased from 16.5 percent of GDP at end-March 1994 to 21.1 percent at end-March 1995). 1/ During 1993, the yield on short-term issues increased by about l-lb percentage points above that in South Africa, reflecting the pace of new issues, the recent introduction of the public domestic debt instruments, and the lack of a secondary market. HOWeVer, as the weight of new issues shifted to longer- term debt during 1994, both short-term and long-term rates on public debt instruments were broadly in line with similar rates in South Africa. Broad money, excluding rand in circulation, z/ grew by 26 percent in 1994, reflecting mainly the strengthening of the balance of payments. This has allowed the commercial banks to expand credit to the private sector rapidly for the second year in a row. J/ The Bank of Namibia (BON) did not extend credit to the Government, and was not involved in financing the private sector. Under these conditions, and because the BON lacks the legal authority to alter cash and liquidity reserve requirements, growth in domestic credit has emanated entirely from commercial banks. To some extent, the commercial banks benefited also from resources made available to them by the South African parent banks. Interest rates rose modestly during 1994, following increases in the rates in South Africa, and the spread between commercial banks' lending rates and the return on three-month deposits remained about 4 percentage points higher than that in South Africa. Owing in part to the higher rate of inflation in Namibia, average deposit rates turned negative in real terms--particularly for the small saver--while real lending rates remained positive. 4/ L/ Namibia began monthly auctions of treasury bills in May 1991, and net issues amounted to NS19.2 million at end-March 1992, N$195.6 at end-March 1993; and N$269 at end-March 1994. Auctions of longer-term debt began in October 1992, with amounts outstanding equivalent to N$130 million and N$473.6 million at end-March 1993 and 1994, respectively. These issues were absorbed by commercial banks to meet liquidity requirements, and other institutional investors in both the public and private sectors. 2/ Issues of the Namibia" dollar--introduced in September 1993--a-e fully backed by holdings of rand and convertible currencies; although the rand also circulates as legal tender, the authorities do not have a reliable estimate of the quantity in circulation. J/ The Bank of Namibia does not yet maintain information on lending by sectors. &/ This spread does not, however, fully reflect the rates applied to large savers and borrowers, which more closely approximate the corresponding rates in South Africa. As a result, the return on deposits for large savers remained positive in real terms.

The capital account deteriorated, however, as gross outflows from pension funds and life insurance companies rose by USS34.2 million, notwithstanding the introduc- tion of a domestic asset requirement for the pension funds. Gross official reserves rose to about 6.5 weeks of imports of goods and nonfactor services. III. Report on Policy Discussions The activities that have comprised the core of the economy to date are unlikely to provide the growth required for a sustained increase in living standards or sufficient employment: arable land has reached productive limits; mining activities are unlikely to undergo a sustained expansion of the magnitude required; and growth prospects for fishing are limited by hard ecological constraints. Thus, the development of new manufacturing and other nontraditional activities is needed to provide the impetus for economic growth. The binding constraint on the development of new sources of growth appears to be related to investment, rather than savings: during 1991-94, gross national saving averaged 24 percent of GDP. Namibia's investment climate could be improved by an appropriate choice of policies. Private sector confidence would depend on a sustained medium-term effort to improve the overall fiscal balance through a steady reduction in the burden of recurrent spending; the merits of such a strategy relative to present policies is discussed in Section IV. Other policy issues that have to be addressed include the misalignment between wages and productivity; the loss of transparency that has resulted from various investment incentive schemes; the lack of sufficient legislative and institutional capacity to support an adequate supervision and regulation of domestic financial markets; and the restrictions on capital flows outside Lhe Common Monetary Area (CMA) that place Namibia at a disadvantage. Against this background, the discussions with the authorities focused on the macroeconomic and structural policies that would enhance the prospects for domestic and foreign investment. 1. Structural policies a. Waees. employment. and comuetitiveness The authorities expressed concern that the expected growth of the core sectors over the medium term was unlikely to create sufficient employment. The fishing and fish processing industries are projected to contribute ultimately a total of about 16,000 new positions--somewhat less than the annual increase in the labor force; mining operations are becoming increas- ingly capital intensive; and the tourism sector is expected to remain relatively small.

The Namibia" representatives agreed that a more competitive trading environment would emerge as a result of the liberalization of trade in line with the GATT-related undertakings by South Africa. In this context, the staff representatives underscored the need to consider also the conditions outside the SACU, I/ as a number of other countries in the region were liberalizing trade, in some cases as part of the Cross Border Initiative. The authorities recognized that, in the absence of exchange rate measures, the adjustment would have to come from lower wages, 2/ higher productivity, and an increase in the skills of the labor force. They intended to rely on labor training programs, such as those contained in the National Vocational Training Act (October 1994); I/ export processing zones with less rigid labor regulations; tax provisions for training costs; and apprentice-type schemes. The authorities indicated that they were not considering a change in the parity with the t-and. They pointed to the large share of imports in production, and expressed concern that a devaluation would be immediately offset by higher costs, while the lack of additional capacity in key sectors would limit the export response. Under these conditions, the staff representatives agreed that efforts to improve productivity and the skills of the labor force were essential. They also emphasized the need for wage restraint, and the importance of the Government taking the lead in this respect. b. Incentive schemes Since 1993/94, the authorities have instituted a number of investment incentives in the form of tax holidays and exemptions for manufacturing enterprises, with additional provisions for exporters. &/ The Namibia" representatives indicated that participation in these schemes had been L/ The Southern African Customs Union (SAW) comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland, and provides for a common external tariff, determined by South Africa; free trade within the union; and a revenue sharing arrangement. While tariff reductions specified by South Africa under the Uruguay Round will apply throughout the customs union, the partner countries will continue to be compensated at a rate equal at least 17 percent of the dutiable base, unless there is a change to the underlying arrangement. The renegotiation discussions did not conclude as intended in March 1995, and are expected to continue until at least the end of 1995. 2/ Estimates for South Africa indicated that a sizable reduction in wages would be required to move toward full employment (SM/93/255). J/ The National Vocational Training Act calls for the establishment of six vocational training centers, and is also expected to foster a flexible wage structure to accommodate differing skills and work experience. &/ These,incentives are described in the companion document on recent economic developments in Namibia.

They indicated that the 1995/96 budget called for a reduction in the company tax rate from 38 percent to 35 percent to align rates with those prevailing elsewhere in the region. They also noted that the incentives provided advantages similar to those achieved by the lower preferential tax rates implemented elsewhere in the region to foster an expansion of the manufacturing sector. The staff representatives expressed the view that the effectiveness of tax holiday* and exemptions for investment had been widely questioned, owing in part to the generally low profit* earned by new enterprises. The poten- tial for abuse and an undue narrowing of the future tax base was substan- tial. Moreover, these mea*ure* were not sustainable and undermined confidence in the stability of the economy. Studies commissioned by the authorities and the report of the February 1994 FAD technical assistance mission advocated the replacement of the holidays, exemption*, and ad hoc arrangements with a uniform company tax, and a widening of the tax base to include the parastatals. The staff repre- sentatives expressed support for this view, and urged the authorities to unwind the existing schemes where participation was limited. 2. Fiscal volicies The continued expansion of the public sector--and the civil service in particular--has made the fiscal situation more fragile: wages absorb more than half of total revenue; public savings have averaged about 3 percent of GDP since 1991/92; and the recent deficits constrain re*ource* available to the private sector. The budget process also lacks the framework and commitment required for credibility. Against this background, the staff representatives noted with concern that the 1995/96 budget calls for a deficit equivalent to 4 percent of projected GDP, about unchanged from the estimated outturn for 1994/95. In addition, the 12 percent projected increase in total revenue (including grants) reflects a 28 percent surge in SACU receipts; 1/ other tax reve- nue* are cautiously estimated to reflect the proposed reduction in the company tax rate; a tripling of the threshold for individual income taxes since end-1993; and generally lower marginal rates. The staff representa- tives regretted the lack of a plan to save the increase in SACU receipts, given the uncertain future of the arrangement. The staff also noted that, as a result of the Uruguay Round, trade mea*ure* were being de-emphasized as a .soui-ce of revenue, owing to the implications for re*ource allocation and the competitive structure of production. They emphasized that the other revenue measures--affecting domestic sources of taxation--needed to be integrated into a sound medium-term revenue mobilization strategy. lJ SACU payment* are negotiated among the members prior to the start of the fiscal year, and are based on import data from two years earlier. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 The 1995/96 budget calls for a 12 percent increase in total expenditure and net lending, which include* funding for 1,182 additional posts, and a general wage rise of 10 percent. The Namibia representatives cited pressures for a larger wage increase, owing to the effect of recent restraint, and to the 20 percent raise granted to members of Parliament. The staff representative* emphasized the danger inherent in raising wages without a reduction in the size of the civil service, and noted that a further 10 percent rise in the civil service wage bill would, inter alia, add about 1% percentage points to the deficit as a share of GDP. The authorities stated that, in view of the substantial unemployment, they did not foresee a large reduction in the size of the civil service, but envisaged a progressive reduction in personnel cost* as a share of GDP through a reallocation of existing posts over time. This would allow for the additional teachers and health care workers necessary to Serve Namibia's growing population, without further growth in public employment. The staff representatives urged the authorities to move more decisively to reduce personnel costs through a comprehensive civil service reform. While the authorities have tried to strengthen the budget process, the share of off-budget development projects--usually directly funded by donors--has grown over time, reducing the transparency of the budget process. The budget for 1995/96 understates development spending and receipts by an estimated N$310 million. The staff representatives empha- sized that these amounts as well as the implications of development expenditure* for recurrent *pending should be integrated into the budget. In this context, they welcomed the draft of the first five-year National Development Plan (NDPl), which is expected to be presented to Parliament during 1995, and urged that the various ministries be closely involved in its implementation. 3. Monetary issues The wider spread between deposit and lending rates in Namibia, compared with South Africa, was attributed to a "cost-plus" pricing policy on the part of commercial banks, similar to that observed in retail goods and labor markets, and a lack of sufficient competition. The representatives of the BON expressed hope that, once new legislation had been enacted, financial markets would benefit from the creation of additional institutions and a wider set of instrument*. They also indicated that the institutional capacity and legal authority to supervise and regulate commercial banks remained at a developmental stage: while the BON now monitors the cash and liquidity positions of the commercial banks, a comprehensive framework has not yet been developed; the BON lacks the authority to alter liquidity and cash reserve requirements; and there is no systematic monitoring of bank portfolios. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public8 - The new Bank of Namibia Bill and the Banking Institutions Act, l/ which are expected to be presented to Parliament during 1995, would constitute an important step in addressing these issues, and provide for the implementation of international standards for capitalization and exposure. The staff representatives emphasized the importance of adequate supervision and regulation for investor confidence, and indicated that priority should be given to the required legislation, as a failure to do so would undermine Namibia's ability to compete for investment flows. The authorities indicated that the impact over the medium term of domestic financing of the fiscal deficit on interest rates and resources available for the private sector could be avoided by limiting the outflow to South Africa of Namibia contributions to pension funds and life insurance companies. Accordingly, legislation had been enacted during 1994 that required pension funds to hold 10 percent of their asset base in Namibia, with a scheduled increase to 35 percent during 1995; these requirements have been extended to insurance companies. The staff representatives expressed serious concern regarding the impact of the domestic asset requirement on the efficiency and stability of financial markets in Namibia, and on the pension funds and life insurance companies themselves. In this context, they cited reports of overexposure on the part of commercial banks to developments in the construction sector, and a reported oversupply of office buildings, and expressed concern about the indicated lack of profitable alternatives. In view of the lack of an adequate supervisory framework, they urged the authorities to roll back these requirements, or at least delay further increases. 4. External sector The current account surplus is expected to decline to 4.2 percent of GDP in 1995, owing in part to the effect of adverse oceanic conditions on exports of fish products. Reserves are expected to increase to the equiva- lent of 7.2 weeks of imports by end-December 1995. Namibia's external debt (12.4 percent of GDP) does not pose a serious problem, owing in part to a policy of avoiding borrowing abroad at market interest rates. About 68 per- cent of Namibia's external debt reflects obligations to South Africa accumulated prior to independence. At end-1994, it was agreed, in principle, that the debt would be written off by South Africa, although the details of the arrangement continue to be discussed. '2/ I/ These bills have benefited from comments and review by MAE and LEG. In addition, MAE has also reviewed amendments to the existing Central Bank and Commercial Bank Acts that would, if enacted, strengthen the BON's supervisory facility. 2/ Under the existing agreement, Namibia would be required to make payments of N$78.5 million a year during 1995-2012. An agreement was reached to postpone the payment due in April 1995 until June, pending the compl.etion of the negotiations. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public9 Following the abolition of the financial rand mechanism by South Africa and Namibia on March 13, 1995, the authorities indicated their intention to eliminate other restrictions on payments and transfers for current inter- national transactions, with a view to accepting the obligations of Article VIII status during the course of the year. The staff representatives en- couraged the removal of the remaining restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions, as this would enhance Namibia's ability to attract investment flows. The Namibia" representatives indicated that the recent elimination of the financial rand mechanism constituted a necessary first step toward a relaxation of the restrictions on investment flows outside the CMA, and anticipated that this would constitute a" important improvement in Namibia's investment climate. With regard to the authorities' decision to maintain the parity with the x-and, the staff representatives noted that the currency board arrange- ment and parity with the South African rand provided a basic stability, particularly in view of the limited control over domestic credit, and limited regulatory capacity. Over the longer term, however, Namibia's competitive position should be periodically reviewed, and consideration should be given to whether a change in the parity--supported by appropriate policies to restrain wages and prices--would be beneficial. IV. Medium-Term Prosuects Real growth is expected to slow to about 1 percent in 1995. Over the medium term, improved climatic conditions and increased investment, under- pinned by higher savings, could support positive real per capita growth during 1996-99. I" later years, the expansion of fishing and related processing activities reaches ecological limits, and a slowdown in real GDP growth below that of the population is likely, unless the Government can achieve a strong growth performance in other sectors by taking early actions to stimulate private investment and remove the existing infrastructure bottlenecks through appropriate public investment. Against this background, the fiscal policies indicated in the 1995/96 budget are not sustainable over the medium term: a continued expansion in personnel expenditures by 2 percent a year in real terms would increase the deficit to over 5 percent of GDP, assuming (a) other spending grows by no more than 4 percent a year; (b) SACU receipts continue to grow in line with imports; (c) other revenues rise roughly in line with nominal GDP; and (d) inflation moves in line with the South African inflation rate, and the Namibia" dollar remains pegged to the South African rand. Cumulative borrowing requirements during 1996-2000 would be about NS4.5 billion, and the public debt would rise by 10 percentage points as a share of GDP. Such a pace of debt accumulation would most likely result in a substantial risk premium on borrowing from either foreign or domestic sources. Under this scenario, the financial situation would be weakened, gross national savings would decline, the external current account deficit would Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 widen, the debt/GDP ratio would rise substantially, and reserves would fall as a ratio of imports. The worsening fiscal position--through its adverse effects on the availability and cost of domestic financing--would be an obstacle to the growth of private investment and production. This scenario has several other sources of risk. Infrastructure improvements, particularly in electricity and water, I/ and other develop- ment spending not included in the budget could have recurrent implications that exceed amounts included in the projections. Moreover, if the ongoing renegotiation of the SACU agreement results in a substantial reduction in receipts, it is unlikely that alternative revenue sources could fully offset such a shock. If these risks materialize, then the fiscal situation and the outlook for private sector investment and output would be much worse than discussed above. At a minimum, an appropriate fiscal stance would require a steady reduction in current spending to allow for the gradual elimination of the deficit (Table 6). The staff's medium-term scenario assumes that public investments are fully integrated in the budgetary framework, and the related recurrent implications are met through a redeployment of other recurrent spending. It also assumes a 3 percent real reduction in noninterest recur- rent spending during 1996, followed by a 2 percent real decrease in each of the subsequent years. This would entail a steady reduction in personnel spending. The reduction in recurrent spending would also need to accom- modate the early retirement and separation costs that would result from the downsizing of the civil service, as well as any adjustments to the structure of wages. On this basis, the deficit would be eliminated by 2000. The total increase in domestic debt under these assumptions would amount to about N$l.l billion, which could potentially be absorbed in domestic markets, without relying on domestic asset requirements as a source of demand or deterring private investment. Consistent with this fiscal adjustment path, the external trade account is projected to improve steadily as a share of GDP, owing to the continued expansion of fishing and fish processing, as well as the effect of private and public sector wage restraint on import demand. A moderate expansion of tourism activities contributes to a continued surplus on the current ac- count, and reserves are projected to rise to the equivalent of 4k months of imports of goods and nonfactor services by 2000. The scenario of stronger fiscal adjustment, when supported by the earlier discussed measures to correct the existing structural distortions in fiscal incentives, wage policies, and the financial sector, would yield two major benefits relative to a scenario of unchanged policies. First, the 1/ Depleted underground sources and low rainfall have resulted in water shortages throughout Namibia, including the major urban areas, and the capacity to produce/import additional electricity is limited. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public11 improved policy framework holds out the best hope of stimulating the devel- opment of the private sector and new areas of economic growth, which would be needed to make up for the projected slowdown of the traditional sectors toward the end of the decade. Second, the improved policy framework would yield sustained improvements in the fiscal position, national savings, and gross official reserves through the end of the decade. It would leave the economy less vulnerable to shocks, better positioned to face any eventual slowdown in domestic output growth, and the possibility of income from the substantial surpluses invested abroad. V. Staff Appraisal The key economic challenges facing the Namibia" authorities are to reduce unemployment, foster an expansion of the private sector, and reduce Namibia's vulnerability to external shocks. A long-term solution to the unemployment problem will require improve- ments in productivity and the skills of the labor force, as well as a policy of wage restraint. The staff welcomes the National Vocational Training Act and the authorities' emphasis on investment in human capital. As the use of exchange rate policy is constrained and other countries in the region are liberalizing their trade regimes, a policy of wage restraint in both the public and private sectors is crucial for safeguarding competitiveness, and the staff urges the Government to take the lead. To facilitate the expansion of the private sector, the authorities will need to strengthen the fiscal position and reduce the borrowing requirements of the Government on a sustained basis. Progress should be made toward a transparent and less distortionary tax system, by phasing out the various fiscal incentive schemes. To reduce reliance on trade taxation, attention should be given to developing the domestic sources of taxation. A steady reduction in current expenditure--in the wage bill in particular--is necessary if the Government is to increase public savings and improve the infrastructure. The staff also believes that reductions in the size of the civil service should be combined with increases in social services and efforts to reprioritize public spending. The spread between bank lending and deposit rates, with deposit rates- on average--negative in real terms, is indicative of a lack of competition in the financial sector. Moreover, the monetary authority does not yet have the institutional or legislative capacity necessary for effective super- vision. In this environment, the staff feels that requiring pension funds and life insurance companies to hold an increasing share of their assets in Namibia could adversely affect the efficiency and the stability of domestic financial markets. It would be more appropriate to increase competition in the financial sector and rely on macroeconomic stability for the purpose of retaining investment flows in domestic markets. The staff also urges the authorities to provide the institutional capacity and legal framework necessary for the effective regulation and supervision of financial markets.

However, Namibia continues to maintain restrictions on the making of pay- ments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of limits on certain transfers to nonresidents and on travel and emigrants' allow- antes. The staff welcomes the Namibia" authorities' intention to eliminate the remaining restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, with the intention of accepting the obligations of Article VIII in the near future, possibly during 1995. The staff welcomes the improvements to the national accounts, but emphasizes the importance of an improved statistical base for a timely understanding of developments in the economy. This is particularly important for Namibia in the areas of financial data, wage rates and employment, merchandise trade, and the consumer price index.

Nonfinancial Relations VII. Exchange Rate Arraneement Namibia's currency, the Namibia dollar is pegged at par to the South African rand, and both currencies are currently legal tender in Namibia. On March 31, 1995, the rate was: N$l - USSO.2796. The "financial rand" system which created a dual exchange.rate practice was abolished by South Africa on March 13, 1995, thus paving the way for a unified exchange rate for the rand. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The most recent Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 8. 1994, and the staff report on the last Article IV consultation (%-l/94/109) was issued to the Executive Board on May 3, 1994. The following decision was adopted at the conclusion of the 1994 Article IV consultation: Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public22 APPENDIX I Namibia Relations with the Fund (continued) (As of May 31, 1995) 1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with Namibia, in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with Namibia conducted under Decision No. 5392.(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. As described in SM/94/109, Namibia maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of (i) limits on certain transfers to nonresidents, (ii).l' 't 1m1 s on travel and emigrants' allowances, and (iii) a multiple currency practice arising from the dual exchange rate for the commercial and financial rand. The Fund encourages Namibia to reduce its reliance on these restrictions, and to eliminate them as soon as possible. IX. Technical assistance As reported last year, the first phase of the IMF/UNDP technical assistance program for Namibia, which started in 1990, was concluded by end-1993. During this period, institutional capacity was established in the main areas of.the macroeconomic management responsibilities of the Bank of Namibia and the Ministry of Finance. The cost of the technical assistance, training, and equipment provided to these two institutions under the program amounted to over US$5 million--US$3.2 million from UNDP and US$2 million from the Fund. The UNDP contribution included a special cost-sharing contribution of US$200,000 from Sweden to finance a bank supervision advisor. The project was independently, and favorably, evaluated by the joint Government, UNDP. and IMF team, before a decision was made to proceed with further assistance under the second phase project which started on January 1, 1394. During the period covered by the Phase II project, 1994-96. long-term experts in the Bank of Namibia will be gradually phased out, as will the Fund's involvement in strengthening the customs and excise administration which is now concentrating on computerization through a separate Danish-financed project to introduce UNCTAD's ASYCUDA system. The technical assistance will now focus on improving budget management and eqxznditure control and on strengthening the Ministry of Finance's capacity to formulate and implement tax policy. In addition, emphasis has been placed on establishing appropriate linkages and coordination between the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Commission to ensure that the Government's development expenditures are consistent with the overall macroeconomic framework. Training of Namibian counterparts will be given partidular emphasis over the next two years. As a measure of the Government’s commitment, it has made a cash contribution of US$163,000 to the cost of the second phase project, with UNDP Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - APPENDIX I Namibia - Relations with the Fund (continued) (As of May 31, 1995) contributing UDS1.5 million, the IMF USS1.3 million, and Sweden US$lSO,OOO. As in the past, the Fifth Tripartite Review of the IMF/UNDP technical assistance project was completed during the Article IV mission on March 15, 1995. The review concluded that commendable progress has continued to be made. Three departments in the Fund are involved directly in the technical assistance project: Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department, Fiscal Affairs Department, and Statistics Department. (=I Monetarv and Exchange Affairs Department (MAE) MAE played a key role in the establishment of Namibia's Central Bank--the Bank of Namibia (BON)--which became operational in August 1990. Subsequent MAE technical assistance missions have assisted in drafting Namibia's Central Banking Act and the draft Deposit-Taking and Financial Institutions Act. To date, MAE has seconded the following experts to BON: the first Governor, whose term expired in August 1991, the General Manager, and Director of Research, all financed by the Fund (their assignments ended in 1992). MAE also appointed the following experts financed by the UNDP: Director of Banking Supervision (until 1992), and two advisors in the areas of banking supervision and bank accounting. The latter advisor has been recently assisting with the introduction of the new currency and the management of foreign exchange reserves. The advisor in banking supervision (partly financed by SIDA) left in January 1994. A new Governor, MAE expert and IMF-financed, began his assignment in early May 1994. (b) Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) Technical assistance provided by FAD aims at strengthening fiscal and budgetary management, establishing a customs and excise directorate, and providing various forms of manpower training. Previous FAD missions and resident advisors have provided technical assistance on customs administration, tax policy and administration, fiscal and budgetary management, and budget accounting. At present, FAD has assigned a long-term general fiscal advisor to the Minister of Finance, who also acts as the IMF/UNDP project coordinator; this position is financed by the Fund. A long-term tax administration advisor position is also financed by the Fund. In addition, under Phase II of the project, FAD has two long-term experts financed by the UNDP currently in position: these are a budget and an account- ing advisor. All long-term advisors are involved in training staff in the Ministry of Finance. Phase II of the UNDP program will end this year. The need and scope for further fiscal technical assis- tance to Namibia is under review.

The long-term experts provided by STA in monetary statistics and balance of payments statistics completed their assignments in May 1992 and September 1993, respectively, thereby ending Phase I of the UNDP-financed project. The January 1994 GFS mission assisted the authorities in compiling data for 1992/93 and 1993/94, which covered only budgetary central government because of the absence of information on extra-budgetary accounts, as well as regional and local government operations. The mission also made recommendations to improve the functional classification of expenditures and expand the coverage of government finance statistics.

Namibia applies the exchange system of South Africa, and maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of limits on some transfers to nonresidents and on travel and emigrants' allowances. Both the Namibia* dollar (introduced in September 1993) and the South African rand are legal tender in Namibia and, in March 1995, both countries unified the dual exchange rate for the commercial and financial rand. 1/ SAW comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa; the arrangement provides for a common external tariff--determined by South Africa--and a revenue sharing arrangement.

Outstandiwz statistical issues Commetidable progrkss has been made.in Namibia in 'thk last four years to establish a reliable statistical database for key macroeconomic variables as well as improve on their quality, through the contribution of the IMF/UNDP technical assistance experts, and other donor agencies like SIDA. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) recently revised the national accounts data with a view to broaden the coverage, reduce the incidence of underestimation in certain key sectors and variables; and make it consistent with the new System pf National Account (1993 SNA). However, there still remains chronic shortage of statistical information in a number of key areas, and limited coverage in certain key variables. Data on labor market situation labor force, employment, unemployment, prdductivity, wages', etc., are not available, thus co&training any meaningful analysis in these areas. A national labor force survey is planned for 1997. On prices, the coverage is limited to only the capital city--Windhoek CPI-which is not representative Of the entire country. During 1994 the CSO conducted a household income and expenditure survey which iS currently being processed and is expebted to provide on a preliminary basis, a bloader-based CPI. In addition. the National Planning Commission in conjunction with the CSO is preparing a cabinet document to address this issue; this document will provide the needed framework for the CSO to embark on nationwide survey for a new index. The private sector is expected to be involved in the proposed exercise. Presently a new interim CPI for Windhoek using weights from 1985 and re-based to December 1992=100 is being published--this has replaced the old series based on 1975 weights which had 1980 as a base year. A comprehensive survey of living conditions is planned for 1998. In the area of BOP statistics (including trade), the BON has continued with efforts to enhance the quality of what is presently available. The coverage is being expanded regularly as new information becomes available. However, there remains considerable scope for improvement particularly in respect of the capital account. Comprehensive data on direction of trade is still not available and trade data are available only on an annual basis, although the authorities hope that with the introduction of ASYCUDA (Automated System for Customs Data), these data will become readily available. Data on external debt in its present form is not satisfactory, although external debt is not yet a serious problem in Namibia. In the monetary sector, information on the sectoral allocation of credit is not available, making it difficult to discern the linkage between sectoral performance and credit developments.

Core data for surveillance The core data for Fund surveillance--exchange rate, 'international reserves, reserve/base money, interest rates, and CPI--are available on a monthly basis, with a time lag of about 1.5 months. The remaining data needed for surveillance--overall government balance, GDP, exports/imports, and current account--are available only annually, with a lag of about one year. So far there is no compelling reason to question the quality and coverage of most of these data, except for the specific cases noted in (1) above. In the case of the overall government balance (fiscal year April- March), monthly cash flow is available with a lag of l-3 months, which provides indicative information about fiscal behavior during any one month Furthermore, except for the monthly cash flow, which is obtained only on request, all other data are reported to the Fund regularly via fax, mail, or during mission, and are all published by the authorities. While GDP data are published only annually, since 1993 the BON has been generating and publishing quarterly data on key production sectors of the economy--output of major minerals and weighted overall index; principal agricultural production and an overall weighted index; principal volume of fish catches and an overall index; and output of some major industrial production and an overall weighted index. These are published with a lag of about one quarter and provide indicative information of economic performance within the year.

APPENDIX IV , Namibia - Relations with the World Bank Grow (As of May 31. 1995) The World Bank Group has not been involved in any lending operations in Namibia. According to the World Bank's classification, Namibia is not IDA-eligible because of its high per capita income, which stands at US$1,660 in 1993 (World Bank Atlas, 1995). The Bank's involvement is currently limited to providing mainly technical assistance by means of economic and sector studies, and ED1 training. Among the sector studies carried out by the Bank are: a. Namibia: Poverty Alleviation with Sustainable Growth (October 1991). b. Namibia: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector (1993). c. Namibia: Reassessing Namibia's Membership of the Southern African Customs Union (August 1993). d. Health Survey (1993). e. Public Expenditure Review (June/July 1994)--Final Report being awaited. A joint World-IFC mission visited Namibia during February 28-March 10, 1995 to carry out the fieldwork for the study on Private Sector Assessment. The mission focused on four main areas: investment incentives and the regulatory framework; the role of the financial sector; parastatals and public enterprises; and the development of indigenous entrepreneurs. The report of this mission is currently under preparation. Another mission to undertake a more comprehensive study on the operations of public enterprises in Namibia is planned for later in 1995.
