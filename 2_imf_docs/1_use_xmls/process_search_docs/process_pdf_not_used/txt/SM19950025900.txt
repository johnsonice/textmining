Introductior, The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with St. Vincent and the Grenadines were held in Kingstown during the period July 2J-August 11, 1995. The staff representatives were Mr. E. Williams (Heed), Ms. Guin-Siu, Mr. Juan-Ramon (all WHD), and Ms. Chanda (PDR). Mrs. Anthony-Browne and Ms. Lewis from Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and Mr. 0. Williams from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) accompanied the mission. Mr. Duenwald, Assistant to the Executive Director for St. Vincent, participated in the policy discussions. u St. Vincent's statistical base is weak; in particular, the national accounts, balance of payments, end prices data are of poor quality. Adequate monetary and fiscal data exist but there have been delays in submitting these to the Fund. These data shortcomings have complicated economic management and made Fund surveillance somewhat more difficult. The authorities have undertaken to address promptly the question of timely submission of available data to the Fund and have requested Fund technical assistance in the area of national accounts and balance of payments statistics. II. Backeround At the time of the last consultation, concluded by the Executive Board on October 21, 1994, Directors acknowledged the good performance of the Vincentian economy for many years, but noted the slowdown in economic activity in 1993-94, which related mainly to the sharp decline in banana production. In this connection, Directors welcomed the Government's efforts to restructure the banana industry to enable it to compete with the lower- cost Latin American producers and to diversify the productive base of the ~CO*Ollly. In view of the required expansion of public investment and the reduced availability of concessional financing, Directors stressed the need for an increase in public sector saving over the next few years. They emphasized that external competitiveness under a fixed exchange rate system depended on a tight fiscal stance and a prudent wage policy. The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with the authorities focused on the recent progress achieved in the implementation of the Government's strategy and the prospects for the next few years. u St. Vincent accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in August 1981 and is presently maintaining an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. St. Vincent's relations with the Fund are presented in Appendix I. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2 - III. Current Developments Real GDP is projected to increase by around 5 percent in 1995 (Table 1). following two years of virtual stagnation. The resumption of economic growth is mainly due to a recovery in banana production which in 1993-94 fell sharply due to a severe drought; banana export volume in 1995 is expected to double to 60,000 metric tons. Inflation averaged about 4 percent a year in 1992-93 and declined to less than 1 percent in 1994 when the authorities eased import restrictions on agricultural commodities to supplement domestic supplies which were curtailed by drought. Inflation is projected to be around 2 percent in 1995. u Based on the outturn for the first half of the year, the public sector (Table 2) is projected to register a current surplus of 7.9 percent (com- pared with 8.7 percent of GDP in 1994) due to a decline in the surplus of the public enterprises (mainly the electricity company). Central eovernment savings are expected to remain roughly unchanged in terms of GDP as higher revenues from import and consumption duty collections are offset by higher current expenditures on interest payments and personnel emoluments, arising from an interim pay adjustment (of EC$900 per month) pending a decision on a new wage contract to take effect from 1996. Public sector capital expenditure is expected to rise (by around 0.8 percentage point of GDP) in 1995 reflecting an increase in investment of both the Central Government and the public enterprises (largely the electri- city corporation). On this account, the overall balance of the uublic sector is projected to swing from a small surplus in 1994 to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 1995, covered by net external financing. The growth in bank liabilities to the private sector, which was sluggish in 1993-94, has accelerated in the first half of 1995 (Table 3). Bank credit expansion to the private sector was depressed in 1993 but picked up in late 1994 and in 1995, in part reflecting large bridging loans by the state-owned bank to two major tourism projects that have run into financial difficulties. u There has been a slight increase in interest rates in 1995 with savings deposit rates at most banks currently at 5 percent (above the 4 percent lJ In the current consumer price index, food and beverages (largely agricultural items) account for about 60 percent of the basket. A household survey is now being conducted as a basis for a new consumer price index. u As discussed later, the Ottley Hall marina and ship repair project and the Union Island tourism project are both foreign direct investment projects with minor government participation. The former, however, involves a government guaranteed loan of US$50 million.

Merchandise exuorts are projected to increase by 18 percent in 1995 almost entirely due to the above-mentioned rise in banana export volume (Table 4); average unit banana export values are expected to be about 17 percent lower than in 1994. Based on partial data for the first half of the year, total imports are projected to rise by 5 percent; however, excluding imports related to the two large tourism projects in 1994, the increase in imports is of the order of 20 percent and could reflect some rebuilding of consumer goods inventories. With tourism earnings also projected to increase (by about 35 percent), the external current account deficit is projected to decline from around US$48 million (20 percent of GDP) in 1994 to US$43 million (17 percent of GDP) in 1995. The 1995 deficit is expected to be largely covered by net private capital inflows. External public debt at the end of 1995 is projected to be around US$90 million (Table 5), or about 35 percent of GDP. Debt-service payments in 1995 are projected to be around 6 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. IV. Policv Discussions The authorities reiterated their commitment to maintain prudent financial policies but saw certain challenges in the next few years. They were generally satisfied with the advances being made in the banana industry, but were somewhat concerned about the limited progress on diversification which made it difficult to reduce the high rate of unemploy- ment (estimated at around 20 percent). 1. Fiscal uolicy There is the possibility of a weakening in fiscal policy in 1996 unless new fiscal measures are introduced. With effect from next year, the maximum marginal rate of personal income tax is to be reduced from 45 percent to 40 percent u and import duties are to be lowered from the present range of O-35 percent to O-30 percent. These measures are estimated to produce a revenue loss of about 0.3 percent of GDP. In addition, the Cabinet is considering proposals by a Government appointed commission for a new wage contract for salaried employees of the Central Government which involves increases of 18 percent over three years, including an 8 percent adjustment in 1996. If the proposal is ratified, the cost of the increase in 1996 will be about 0.4 percent of GDP. In these circumstances, public sector savings could be reduced by close to 1 percentage point of GDP, end given lower than expected grants and the 1/ A similar reduction in the corporate tax went into effect in 1993.

To limit the decline in the current surplus, the authorities plan to examine the possibility of reducing import duty exemptions (discretionary exemptions are estimated at about 3 percent of GDP annually), improving tax administration (a program to this effect, with technical assistance from the Canadian Government, is currently underway), and replacing automatic annual increments (which range from 2-2.5 percent of salaries) by a more selective system based on performance. Consideration also may be given to an increase in electricity tariffs to help finance the corporation's investment program. The staff noted that central government salaries had risen by 7 percent in reel terms since 1990, justifying e much smaller wage increase than was currently being proposed. In addition, the staff urged the authorities to accelerate steps to divest two public enterprises to reduce government transfers to finance debt-service payments. 2. Monetary uolicv u The commercial banks are still very liquid with sizable net foreign assets and balances at the ECCB. However, credit policy could come under increasing pressure if there is need for public sector recourse to the banking system and if the two large tourism projects continue to be financed domestically. In the context of a strategy to broaden financial intermediation in the region, the Eastern Caribbean Home Mortgage Bank began operations in June 1995. A mission from the Fund's Monetary and Exchange Affairs (MAE) Depart- ment will visit the ECCB in December to assist the authorities in formula- ting arrangements for the marketing of government securities. 3. The incentive framework During the past year the incentive framework has been improved through a reduction in the number of commodities subject to price controls (from 36 to 8 items, produced under monopoly conditions) and in import licensing requirements (which now cover about 8 percent of imports). Direct taxes are being lowered in line with levels prevailing in other OECS countries and work is proceeding on an amendment to the Aliens' Landholding regulations to facilitate the purchase of real estate by nonresident nationals. u St. Vincent's membership in a regional monetary union limits its monetary policy autonomy.

Exchanne rate and trade policy The authorities reiterated their satisfaction with existing exchange rate arrangements and the Level of the peg, u which they thought was not a constraint to export expansion. They noted that there was agreement among OECS countries that the banana shock should be handled by increasing productivity in the industry and Lowering transportation costs rather than through changes in the exchange rate. The staff, however. emphasised the importance of prudent financial and incomes policies for maintaining competitiveness. As noted above, import tariffs will be reduced from O-35 percent to O-30 percent by the end of 1995; the regional Common External Tariff agreement calls for a tariff range of O-20 percent by January 1, 1998. St. Vincent, Like the other OECS countries, maintains a 2 percent temporary customs fee on all imports. 5. Incomes uolicy Private sector wages have increased on average by around 4-5 percent in the Last two years. Nonetheless, average wages are still generally lower in St. Vincent than in most of the other OECS countries. The staff emphasised that public sector wage restraint would provide the needed example for continued Low increases in the private sector. 6. The banana industry u The authorities explained that a replanting and rehabilitation scheme initiated in Late 1994, was ahead of schedule and that St. Vincent should be able to achieve its BU quota of 82,000 tons by 1998. The scheme together with the upgrading of cultivation practices and more intensive use of fertilisers is expected to increase output from its present level of 7-S tons per acre to an average of 12 tons (the average for Latin American producers is 20 tons per acre) over the next few years. Problems with product quality continue despite the introduction of a new tiered pricing formula that gives a premium for high quality bananas. In early 1995 regional banana producers concluded a new agreement with their traditional transportation and marketing agent (GEEST) which Lowers freight charges by about 20 percent. 2/ u The currency of St. Vincent, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of ECS2.7 per U.S. dollar since 1976. 2/ A more detailed discussion of recent changes in the banana industry is provided in the Statistical Annex. 1/ Under the terms of the new agreement, GEEST is no Longer the exclusive transportation and marketing agent for the Windward Islands and a new institution, owned by the regional governments, WIBDECO, will handle marketing arrangements in the BU. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - The staff noted that pressures for dismantling the EU banana policy are increasing. The authorities recognized the need to accelerate steps to increase productivity but observed that given the Low production costs of most Latin American producers, Windward Island producers could only compete if there ware a further significant reduction in transportation costs. For this reason, Windward Island producers were examining the scope for entering into joint venture arrangements with foreign companies involved in the transportation of bananas. 7. Diversification The authorities emphasized that the expansion of upscale tourism offered the best hope for economic diversification in St. Vincent. This sector provided scope for a sizable increase in employment and in foreign exchange earnings as well as Linkages to the agricultural sector. The public sector investment program included several projects to expand tourism infrastructure and a tourism school has been established. However, the tourism sector strategy had received a temporary sat back as two of the three major projects under construction--The Ottley Hall marina and ship repair project and the Union Island tourism project both foreign direct investment projects with minor government participation--were now facing financial difficulties. New financing arrangements are being sought but it is envisaged that there could be some delay before the projects are in full operation. As regards domestic aericulture, the authorities indicated that programs to boost output of selected agricultural commodities were having some success, but that farmers were facing increasing nontariff restrictions in certain regional markets. There were small gains in exports to non- regional markets but a major breakthrough continued to be constrained by the absence of adequate marketing arrangements and the shortage of reasonably priced transportation. The manufacturine sector has languished since 1992 when the three Largest enclave industries ceased operations. The authorities believe that the absence of an international airport makes St. Vincent relatively unattractive (compared with the neighboring islands) for larger export industries and are now focusing their efforts on attracting a few niche industries. Currently, the Government is working on a plan to reorgsnize the St. Vincent Development Corporation to improve its ability to do industrial promotion and provide technical and financial assistance to small industries. 8. Povertv and environmental issues The St. Vincent Government, with the assistance of the CDB, is currently conducting a poverty assessment survey. The results of this survey will be used to formulate a national policy aimed at poverty alleviation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - In June 1994, the Government of St. Vincent, with World Bank technical assistance, completed a National Environment Action Plan, which identified solid waste management as the top priority pollution issue. Under a regional project approved by the World Bank in May 1995, St. Vincent is to receive lJSS3.6 million in grants and concessional Loans for waste manage- ment. The Government also is working with the World Bank on the design of cost recovery mechanisms in this area. V. Medium-Term Outlook The baseline scenario presented in Table 6 assumes that beginning in 1998 St. Vincent will achieve the EU banana export quota under current preferential arrangements and that the two major tourism projects (Ottley Hall and the Union Island Development) will come into full operation one year Later than previously envisaged, in 1996 and 1997, respectively. On this basis, and assuming continued implementation of sound financial policies (including fiscal savings of at Least 8 percent of GDP) and an incomes policy geared to maintain export competitiveness, real GDP is projected to increase at around 4.5 percent a year and inflation should be kept low (in the range of 2-3 percent a year). In the base case scenario, the external current account deficit is projected to decline from around 17 percent of GDP in 1995 to less than 12 percent of GDP in 2000. Exports (in U.S. dollar terms) are projected to rise sharply in 1996 because of further growth in banana export volume, but to remain stable thereafter, as banana exports remain at the quota Level; imports are projected to increase by 4 percent e year Largely reflecting volume growth. Tourism receipts are projected to rise sharply in 1997 and 1998 as the new projects come on stream. The current account deficits, averaging about US$40 million a year over the period would be financeable by expected direct investment inflows related to tourism projects, net external public sector borrowing largely related to projects currently in the pipeline, and disbursements of EU grants of about US$7 million a year. u If St. Vincent's preferential market access to the EU is reduced from 1996 (Table 7), both banana export volume and unit export prices would be expected to fall. Given historical supply elasticities, this could Lower banana export earnings by US$5 million to US$LL million per year over the medium term. In addition, if there are delays in the completion of the two major tourism projects now under construction, tourism receipts could on average be Lower by about US$lO million par year after 1997 relative to the base case scenario. Since the banana and tourism industries are major u The banana restructuring program is being financed in part from a ECS18.3 million grant from the EU (under the STABEX program) approved in August 1994. In August 1995, the EU approved another grant of US$34 million (to be disbursed over four to five years), part of which would be earmarked for the agricultural diversification effort.

In the base case scenario, public sector debt service would remain at around 6 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. There is, however, the possibility that the Government may need to contribute to the servicing of the US$SO million loan associated with the Ottley Hall, in which case the debt-service ratio could rise up to 11 percent. u VI. Staff Aooraisal While economic performance has been generally satisfactory in recent years, St. Vincent faces a number of challenges which could have far reaching effects on the country's medium-term prospects. These uncertain- ties underscore the need for continued prudent macroeconomic policies and for accelerating steps to improve the competitive position of the banana industry and diversifying the economy, The high Level of fiscal savings since 1990 has allowed the Government to maintain public sector investment levels. Given the urgency of maintaining the level of public sector investment, it is important that the fiscal stance not be relaxed in 1996 and over the medium term. The envisaged Lowering of income tax rates end import tariffs is justified to bring the tax structure in St. Vincent in Line with the other OECS terri- tories. Consequently, the achievement of the fiscal goals will depend heavily on the containment of current expenditures. Given the difficulty of making major employment cuts, in Light of the high level of unemployment, public sector wage restraint should be a major focus of policy and the wage increases should take into eccount the need to maintain public sector savings of at Least 8 percent of GDP. The increase in real wages of public sector employees since 1990 also justifies a much Lower salary award for 1996-98 then is currently being proposed. The authorities should also keep in mind that additional fiscal adjustment could be required over the next few years if the Government is required to contribute to the servicing of the US$50 million external loan. A responsible public sector wage policy also is critical to set the stage for wage restraint in the private sector. With no scope for exchange rate action under the monetary union, prudent financial end incomes policies are a prerequisite for maintaining export competitiveness. Wage restraint, together with additional measures to improve the incentive framework (further reductions in import licensing requirements and price controls), will also strengthen efforts to attract foreign investment and diversify the economy. The staff urged the authorities to eliminate the temporary import lJ The Government of St. Vincent and the co-guarantor, Italian Export Credit Agency, are seeking to have their guarantees canceled because of alleged financial irregularities surrounding the project.

The banking system in St. Vincent is basically sound and credit policy up to now has contributed greatly to price and balance of payments stabil- ity. The recent role of the state-owned bank in providing sizable Loans to two government-backed private sector projects which were unable to secure alternative financing is an unfortunate precedent. The arrangement may not be consistent with the bank's normal operations whereby credit is extended only in accordance with strict commercial criteria. This type of Lending raises moral hazard issues to the extent that there is en implicit Govem- ment guarantee of a private sector debt. The possibility that market arrangements for bananas in the L%U could be significantly Liberalized in the next year or so, could imply that St. Vincent would need to compete for market share with more efficient Latin American producers much sooner then expected. This situation puts pressure on the authorities to accelerate steps to reduce production coats and improve banana quality. The Likelihood of a change in the fortunes of the banana industry also underscores the need for a more aggressive pursuit of economic diversification. Public sector external debt-service payments which are currently manageable at the equivalent of 8 percent of government revenues could rise sharply over the next few years if the Government is required to contribute to the servicing of the Large private sector Loan that it guaranteed. The staff cautions the authorities to avoid any further guarantees of private sector external debt. Deficiencies in the avaiLabiLity and quality of key statistics have complicated the process of economic management and Fund surveillance. The staff welcomes the authorities' commitment to reduce the leg in the sub- mission of monetary data and to begin to send monthly fiscal data to the Fund. The staff also supports the need for technical assistance in the area of national accounts and balance of payments statistics. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 Tat&. 1.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Statistical Issues 1. Outstandine statistical issues a. Real sector STA has sent Report Forms 60R (prices, production, and external trade) and 90R (national accounts) to both the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, but the report forms have not been returned. Moreover, statistical bulletins from St. Vincent are not received on a regular basis. STA's main sources of data have been WHD; the UN Statistical Bulletin and other secondary sources such as the ILO; and the mission that returned from the Caribbean in early 1993. The complete accounts by major expenditure category on gross domestic product end after 1992. GDP figures at constant prices are based on 1977 prices and should be brought up to date. b. Government finance STA's data base includes annual data through 1990 for the Central Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. These data are published in the GFS Yearbook and in IFS. Data on grants and public sector investment programs are not reliable and need revision. Apparently, nontax revenue includes gross receipts of some commercial undertakings (harbor, airport, post office, and a vehicle funding scheme). The GFS correspondent did not provide replies to the 1993, 1994, and 1995 GFS questionnaires. c. Honetarv accounts The ECCB has been reporting statistical data for its member cowtries for publication in XFS with several months delay. The mission encouraged the representatives of the ECCB to resume regular reporting of monetary data to STA with minimum delay. d. Balance of uavments STA has sent letters to the authorities explaining the procedures for converting St. Vincent's balance of payments statement from a classification based on the fourth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual to one based on the fifth edition. The staff supports the need for technical assistance in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments statistics. 2.
