The Iranian economy is characterized by heavy dependence on volatile oil export earnings and a large public sector including the banking sector. The growth has been constrained by structural rigidities including price distortions reflected in negative and inflexible real interest rates, multiple exchange rates, and low domestic prices of petroleum products and some essential foods resulting in large implicit subsidies. These rigidities have necessitated the administrative allocation of credit and foreign exchange, and the maintenance of trade restrictions discouraging private investment and adversely affecting competitiveness of non-oil exports. Recent developments. The 30 percent drop in global oil prices in 1998/99 sharply weakened Iran’s internal and external positions. Despite compression of capital outlays, the budget deficit is estimated to have widened to 5 percent of GDP in 1998/99 (March 21, 1998-March 20, 1999) from 2.7 percent in 1997/98. Reflecting partly the fall in public capital outlays, growth of real GDP slowed to an estimated 1.7 percent from 2.6 percent in 1997/98. Monetary expansion accelerated to 27 percent in 1998/99 from 16 percent in 1997/98 owing to the sharp increase in credit to the government and state enterprises and, reversing the recent trend, inflation picked up to an estimated 24 percent from 17 percent in 1997/98. Moreover, the external current account shifted from a surplus of US$l.6 billion in 1997/98 to an estimated deficit of US$2.2 billion in 1998/99. The authorities responded by drawing down official foreign reserves and rephasing external debt-service payments to major creditor countries, while the Iranian rial was allowed to depreciate fiuther in the Teheran Stock Exchange (TSE) market. Summary of discussions. The external constraints and economic slowdown will persist in the short term and ease only gradually in the medium term. The discussions focused on policies to address the twin dilemma of weakening balance of payments and falling growth. The authorities’ adjustment program, which was initiated in February 1999 and will cover the fiscal year 1999/2000, aims at restoring market-based prices and the supporting demand management. It includes: liberalization of the exchange rate system to unifjr rates by 2000/01; 70 percent increase in domestic petroleum product prices; 50 percent reduction in the inflation rate to help restore positive real interest rates; increased revenue effort to reduce the budget deficit to 1 percent of GDP; and introduction of new market-based instruments of liquidity management. The staff recommended building upon these steps to comprehensively tackle underlying structural rigidities, in particular, to develop a comprehensive energy pricing policy to quickly achieve parity with world market prices, initiate far-reaching reform of the state . enterprises sector including the banking sector, introduce market-based interest rates, establish an efficient social safety net, and liberalize import restrictions. Staff appraisal. The staff supports the thrust of the authorities’ program and enc0urage.s additional steps to reinforce it which could facilitate Fund technical and financial support in the period ahead. In view of the actions taken so far and the timetable proposed to reform the exchange system, the staff recommends approval of the two multiple currency practices and one of the exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII.

Discussions for the 1999 Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran were held during November 7-23, 1998, January 8-14, 1999, and February l-5, 1999.’ The authorities were represented by Governor Nourbakhsh, Deputy Governors Mojarrad and Komijani, senior officials of the Plan and Budget Organization, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, and various other ministries, commercial banks, and the private sector. 2. Concluding the 1997 Article IV consultations on January 30, 1998, the Executive Directors commended Iran’s progress in the past few years in eliminating external payments arrears and normalizing external financial relations, significantly reducingthe debt burden and improving the maturity structure of the external debt, lowering inflation, and strengthening international reserves. They regretted, however, the reliance on controls and a complex exchange system which had discouraged investment resulting in slower economic growth. The Executive Directors stressed that the economy remained vulnerable to the fall in oil prices, while non-oil exports appeared to suffer from a lack of competitiveness. They noted that the policy framework based on trade and payments restrictions, multiple exchange rates, implicit subsidies, and administrative allocation of resources was inappropriate for promoting sustained high growth. It was emphasized that Iran’s growth potential could be tapped by liberalizing the economy and promoting the development of the private sector. To that end, the Executive Directors called for maintaining a tight credit policy, pursuing fiscal consolidation, and adopting an agenda of exchange rate unification, trade liberalization, elimination of implicit energy subsidies, improvement in financial intermediation, and an ambitious privatization program. The improvement in Iran’s social indicators, in particular, the progress made in the. health and education areas, was commended. Iran continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV but maintains no exchange restrictions under these arrangements. Iran maintains several exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices that are subject to approval under Article VIII.2 3. Data provided to the mission are generally adequate for the assessment of economic developments in Iran. The quality, currentness, and reporting of data to the Fund have continued to improve, in particular, the establishment of the Foreign Debt Department by the Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran (central bank) has brought a significant improvement in data on public and publicly guaranteed external debt and debt-service obligations. However, ‘The staff team consisted of Mr. Dhonte (head), Mr. Iqbal, Mr. Williams, Mrs. Liu, Ms. Bhattacharya (all MED), and Mr. Selassie (PDR). Mr. Mirakhor participated in the discussions. Mr. Swinburne (MAE) also participated in some discussions. The main author of this report is Mr. Iqbal. ‘Iran’s relation with the Fund and the World Bank group are summarized, respectively, in Appendices II and III.

The Fund intends to provide technical assistance during 1999 to help integrate external debt data with the balance of payments, to facilitate generation of national accounts data on a quarterly basis, and on the determination of a market-based risk premium charged by the central bank on foreign exchange guarantees. There is a need to compile more disaggregated fiscal data, including subsidies and to better monitor the performance of public enterprises. Provision of financial data on a regular basis to the global market would facilitate capital inflows. II. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS A. Overview 4. The Iranian economy is characterized by a rapid increase in population-it grew at an annual average rate of over 2 percent over the past decade to a total of 61 million in 1997198, heavy dependence on oil exports which account for about 80 percent of total exports, a large public sector including the banking sector, and extensive price distortions, reflected, in particular, in negative real interest rates, overvalued exchange rates, and low petroleum product prices. These distortions have necessitated the administrative allocation of credit and foreign exchange, resulting in large implicit subsidies.3 In the process, competitiveness of non- oil exports has been undermined and private investment discouraged. Economic growth is slow even as the labor force is projected to grow at a faster pace during the next decade or so. Official projections are for an annual increase in the labor force of about 800,000 (5 percent) in 1998/99, moderating to around 500,000 by 2005/06. At present, unemployment is officially estimated at about 13 percent of labor force. Unless real GDP growth picks up significantly, the unemployment rate would increase steadily over the medium term. 5. Between 1994195 and 1997/98, exchange and trade restrictions, iiscal restraint, and relatively high oil export receipts led to cumulative surpluses in the external current account and to a decline in external debt. At US$13.5 billion (13 percent of GDP), Iran’s external debt is not large, but average maturities are short. Short-term debt accumulated in 3Prices of about 20 items including basic foods (wheat, sugar, rice, edible oil, red meat, and tea), with a high import component are regulated by the Organization for the Protection of Consumers and Producers (OPCP). These prices are legally binding, but some trade also takes place in the informal market at unregulated prices. In addition to these 20 items, the OPCP also sets recommended prices for some other commodities which are produced by state and quasi-state enterprises such as automobiles, paper products, petrochemicals, agricultural machinery, and mineral products. These prices are not legally binding; if these items are sold at higher-than-recommended prices, then producers/distributors are required to pay a certain proportion of “excess profits” to the OPCP. In addition, petroleum products are supplied at a fraction of world prices (Table 2). Moreover, public sector imports, at highly appreciated official exchange rates provide large implicit subsidies.

The bulk of the remaining restructured debt should have been paid off by 2000/01, but as described below, in light of the decline in oil prices, an 18-month deferment of the residual maturities was negotiated with the main creditors in the second half of 1998199. 6. Oil export prices, which had risen steadily for three years to US$20 per barrel in 1996/97, fell to an average of US$lO.53 per barrel in 1998/99, resulting in a sharp contraction - in import capacity and budgetary revenues with a significant dampening effect on domestic growth. Oil prices are projected to recover slowly over the medium term; they would remain broadly unchanged in 1999/2000 before rising to about US$13 per barrel in 2002103, i.e., 35 percent below the peak in 1996197. Therefore, over the medium term, the external account will remain under pressure and the import capacity will remain constrained. 7. The authorities are aware of the underlying difftculties and have proposed a far-reaching program of economic adjustment and reform as part of a National Rehabilitation Plan issued in August 1998. This plan aims at restoring average real GDP growth of 6 percent per annum with social justice through reduction in inflation; strengthening the budget and reducing subsidies; progressively removing price distortions; expanding the role of the private sector in resource allocation; reforming the financial sector; restoring a market-based exchange system, removing exchange and trade restrictions; and reducing reliance on the oil sector. This strategy will underlie the Third Five-Year Development Plan (TFYDP) (March 2000-March 2005). In line with this strategy, the authorities’ near-term program aims at addressing the emerging balance of payments difficulties so that fundamental structural reforms can be initiated. B. Developments in 1997/981998/99 8. Growth of real GDP is estimated to have decelerated to 2.6 percent in 1997/98 and 1.7 percent in 1998/99, mainly on account of a contraction in gross capital formation by both the public and private sectors (Table 1 and Chart 1). This slowdown was associated with a drop in oil sector output while the construction sector (which had spearheaded economic expansion in 1996/97) also contracted.4 Reflecting adverse weather conditions, growth of agricultural output was also halved to less than 2 percent in 1997/98 but rebounded in the following year. The rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, decelerated significantly to 17 percent in 1997198, but picked up to an estimated 24 percent in 1998/99, reflecting increased monetary financing of the budget deficit in the face of reduced import capacity. 4See Box 1 on the oil and gas sector.

Oil and Gas Sector Iran possesses the fifth largest oil reserves and the second largest natural gas reserves in the world. It is the second largest producer among OPEC members with a quota of 3.904 million barrels per day (mbd). Under an agreement for voluntary production cuts to stabilize global crude oil prices, the quota was reduced by some 300,000 barrels per day effective July 1998. Since then, crude oil production has remained around 3.62 mbd for 1998/99, or about the same as in 1997/98. However, crude oil exports, which have been falling since 1995/96 when they stood at 2.6 mbd, have fallen tirther to an average of 2.3 mbd in 1998/99. Average export price, on the other hand, has fallen by about 30 percent. Although known natural gas reserves stand at 742 trillion cubic feet, domestic production, though expanding sharply, remains relatively low at an estimated 76 billion cubic feet in 1998/99; exports stood at less than US$300 million in that year. Since 1995, steps have been taken to expand production capacity and modernize the existing infrastructure under buy-back and build-operate-transfer schemes. Under the former, the foreign investor is expected to cover all investment costs, fi,md the project, and recoup, over a five- to seven-year period, from the sale of oil and gas its capital investment and associated financial charges, opeiating costs, and the negotiated rate of return. The projects that have been offered so far to foreign investors could, if f%lly implemented, increase Iran’s proven reserves by some 30 billion barrels of oil and over 700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. These include South Pars gas project, which was signed in 1997 with France .(Total), Russia (Gazprom), and Malaysia (Petronas) involving an investment of US$2 billion. The long-term objective of the authorities is to raise crude oil production capacity to about 7 mbd by 2020, or about the same as in the 1970s. 9. Implicit subsidies remained high. Although such subsidies have fallen as a percent of GDP over the last few years, they stood at about 13 percent of GDP in 1997/98. While domestic prices of some petroleum products were raised in line with the CPI, they were at levels well below the world market prices particularly for nongasoline products (Table 2). Subsidies for basic goods fell to about 1.6 percent of GDP in 1997/98 on account of adjustments in administered prices and a drop in commodity coverage; the 1998199 budget aimed to hold them to about 1.5 percent of GDP. 10. Budgetary situation weakened. Despite a compression of capital outlays, the overall fiscal deficit, which had been falling steadily since 1994/95, rose to 2.7 percent of GDP in 1997/98 and 5 percent in 1998/99 as oil prices fell (Chart 2 and Table 3). A small pat-t of the deficit was financed by the sale of the Government Participation Papers (GPPs) (Box 2); these however were largely acquired by the banking sector.

Participation Papers In 1994/95, the issuance of participation papers in line with Islamic principles was approved by the Money and Credit Council. The papers issued thus far can be classified into two broad groups: those issued by government agencies, municipalities, and public enterprises; and government participation papers (GPPs) that are issued by the government for budgetary financing. From October 1994 to November 1998, a total of nine issues was - made by government agencies, municipalities, and public enterprises in order to mobilize resources for specific investment projects such as roads, hospitals, housing, and plant expansion for an amount totaling Rls 1,071 billion. These issues have been in amounts ranging from Rls 16 billion to Rls 325 billion, with an expected rate of return of 20 percent per annum and with maturity in three to five years, except for one issue at 24 percent and two issues for a maturity of 25 years. Holders are considered to be owners of equity rather than creditors. Also, only in three of all cases was the full amount of the issues taken up by the public. The rest was taken up by banks. The most recent being an issue of Rls 300 billion by the Ministry of Energy which was oversubscribed by the private sector, but bonuses on top of the 20 percent interest rate might have played an important role. During 1997/98 the authorities sold GPPs for the amount of Rls 2,174 billion. Of this amount, only Rls 760 billion were picked up by the private sector, while the Bank Markazi extended about Rls 1.1 trillion in loans to commercial banks to purchase outstanding papers. It is anticipated that a total of about Rls 1,500 billion will be sold in 1998/99. The Bank Markazi is planning to introduce, shortly, a central bank Participation Paper (CPP) which will securitize Bank Markazi’s claims on the government and will be tradable on the TSE. CPPs will also serve as an instrument of monetary policy so that it can make the transition from direct to indirect instruments of monetary control. Returns on CPPs will be tied to returns on specified public sector enterprises in the TSE. The Bank Markazi is considering a number of applications from the private sector for right to issue participation papers. Borrowers have an incentive to issue participation papers, given the credit ceilings imposed on individual banks by Bank Markazi. Particularly restrictive, individual credits are limited to a maximum of Rls 5 billion unless granted specific exemption by the Bank Markazi. At the same time, Bank Markazi guidelines regulate sectoral allocation of credit. For investors, these papers offer an opportunity to earn returns above those available from term deposits at banks. They also divert funds from the “informal” market which presently provides a competitive alternative to the formal financial system.

Growth of money supply slowed to about 16 percent in 1997/98 as net foreign assets contracted by almost 7 percent of the initial stock of broad money (Table 4 and Chart 3). Bank financing of the fiscal deficit was sharply expanded to 9 percent of the initial broad money stock in 1998/99 as compared with 4 percent in the previous year. Owing to the sharp increase in credit to the government and state enterprises, the growth of domestic liquidity picked up sharply in the second half of the year to an estimated 27 percent for 1998199, resulting in a buildup of liquidity which, unless addressed decisively, could add to inflationary pressures in 1999/2000. Steps were initiated to strengthen bank regulation and supervision and preparatory work was undertaken to establish indirect market-based instruments of monetary policy including the GPPs and the Central Bank Participation Papers (CPPs). Until 1997/98, credit allocation continued to be based on sectoral and overall ceilings administered by the Bank Markazi on a bank-by-bank basis with negative real rates of return; these were discontinued in 1998/99. Domestic credit expansion in 1997/98-1998/99 continued to be partly sterilized, largely through advance import deposits of up to 90 percent of the import level which commercial banks were required to keep with Bank Markazi. Interest rates have not been an instrument of policies; the nominal interest rates structure has remained unchanged since 1995/96 despite variable rates of inflation.’ 12. The balance of payments weakened on account of lower oil prices. Despite a contraction in imports (made possible, in part, by lower import prices), the external current account surplus turned from a surplus of USS5.2 billion in 1996/97 to a deficit of USS2.2 billion in 1998/99 (Table 5, Chart 4). Non-oil exports also declined, in part owing to the erosion in competitiveness but also restrictions imposed on Iranian imports in some markets. This, together with the large repayments of medium- and long-term external debt, shifted the overall balance from a surplus of US$3 billion in 1996/97 to deficits of about US$4 billion in 1997/98 and US$1.3 billion in 1998/99. Consequently, gross official reserves which had been built up earlier fell to about US$4 billion at end-January 1999, equivalent to three months of imports. 13. All imports remained subject to government approval and exchange allocation. A “positive import list” of 30 broad categories of goods applies to imports at the TSE rate and the export rate (see below para. 14). Imports are subject to licensing by the Ministry of Commerce and, until February 1999, approval of the Bank Markazi was required for foreign exchange allocation or the opening of letters of credit. Import duties range between zero and 100 percent; with exemptions, the effective average rate at present is about 8 percent. ‘In line with the Fund technical assistance to improve bank regulation and supervision, the Bank Markazi started implementing a new data reporting system in conformity with international standards. An offsite Supervision Division has been created which will first focus on establishing capital ratios for banks in line with international practice, followed by close monitoring of other key financial indicators.

The exchange rate system consists of: (i) two official rates, the “floating rate”-Rls 1,750 per US$l-and the “export rate”-Rls 3,000 per US$l-which cover oil exports, public sector imports and debt service; and (ii) import certificates traded on the TSE, which provide an officially approved market-based rate and cover a gradually increasing share of current account transactions. In addition, an informal market prevails with a more depreciated rate than the TSE rate and covers about 5 percent of current transactions. In view of the relatively higher inflation in Irap than in its trading partners, and also because of the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the two official fixed rates exhibited an effective real appreciation by 23 percent during 1997198 and about 8 percent in the first nine months of 1998/99. The weighted average rate, including the TSE rate, also appreciated by 4 percent in real effective terms during 1997/98 and the first nine months of 1998/99 (Chart 5). 15. The authorities allowed the Iranian rial to depreciate by 24 percent in the TSE exchange market during the first nine months of 1998199, a larger share of transactions was transferred to the TSE market, and non-oil exporters were permitted to sell all of their foreign exchange receipts at the TSE rate (Box 3)” Nonetheless, import demand continued to outstrip supply at the TSE exchange rate and the parallel market rate weakened sharply; the latter rate stood at a discount of 40 percent at end-January 1999.’ !6. In February 1999, the authorities initiated a broad-based policy to reform the exchange system aimed at rapidly enlarging the role of the market-determined TSE rate with the ultimate objective of unifying the exchange rates in 2000/01. The introduction of the new market-based TSE exchange rate has resulted in a d.epreciation of the Iranian rial in this market to Rls 6,434 = US$l on March 2, 1999 as compared with Rls 5,700 = US$l at end- January 1999. 17. The short-term outlook is for a tightening of the import constraint in light of lower oil exports and large debt-service payments obligations.

The authorities had replaced the bonus associated with the surrender requirement with a retention allowance, thus eliminating the implicit multiple currency practice. A foreign exchange guarantee scheme associated with short-term credit financing has been in practice but does not give rise to a multiple currency practice.

Recent Developments in the Exchange Market At present, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintains four official or officially approved exchange rates. These are official exchange rates -the “floating” rate (Rls 1,750 = US$l); the export rate (Rls 3,000 = US$l); the Teheran Stock Exchange (TSE) exchange rate (Rls 6,355 = US$l); and a rate closely linked to this rate for tourists and other services transactions. In general, the “floating” rate’ applies to oil and gas export receipts, imports of essential goods and services, and repayment of public and publicly guaranteed external debt. Until June 1997, the export rate applied for all other current account transactions. Since then, however, non-oil exporters, after surrendering 50 percent of their receipts at the “export” rate, have been allowed to sell their entitlement (“certificates”) to import with the balance on the TSE. This led to the emergence of the more market-determined TSE exchange rate. Starting in January 1998, non-oil exporters were allowed to retain 100 percent of their earnings to sell on the TSE market. The period for the repatriation of exports was also lengthened from five months to eight months. As an incentive to exporters to repatriate their proceeds early, a bonus of 1 percent a month of the amount surrendered provided by the Bank Markazi thereby eliminating the resulting multiple currency practice. During 1998/99 some 30 percent of imports are set to be made at the TSE exchange rate compared with just 11 percent in 1997/98. In addition, there is a thin and volatile informal parallel market; the Iranian rial depreciated sharply on this market to Rls 7,000 = US$l in mid-November 1998. There are ten approved.traders in the TSE market, comprising of representatives of the six commercial banks and four specialized banks. Importers with approved import licenses bid for foreign exchange through these traders. Imports of goods on the positive list of 30 items (largely comprising essential industrial inputs) approved by the Ministry of Commerce, and other goods subject to valid import licenses, and authorized service payments are allowed to be issued through the TSE market. During the course of 1998/99, the TSE rate has been allowed to depreciate. In tandem with the steps taken to increase supply of foreign exchange and deepen the market, the twice weekly fixing sessions at the TSE were replaced by all-day trading sessions five days a week. The weekly volume of transactions accordingly has increased, though the TSE market has failed to clear during November 1998-January 1999. Since mid-February 1999, the authorities have taken actions to clear the queuing for foreign exchange in the TSE market and allow the TSE rate to adjust by about 11 percent to Rls 6,355 = US$l at end-February. ‘In practice, the rate has remained unchanged since early 1994.

Such import compression, combined with the underlying structural rigidities, could stymie economic growth at a time when pressures for additional employment opportunities are mounting. III. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS 18. The demographic pressures and the low oil prices together point to a need to restructure the economy, remove trade and’exchange restrictions, and establish market-based mobilization and allocation of resources. The focus of the discussions accordingly was on the appropriate pace of restoration of market-based prices, and on the need for a supportive tightening of financial policies. The authorities were keen to cutdown the fiscal deficit, despite the low oil prices, and contemplated bold steps to liberalize the exchange market; they felt strongly, however, that the necessary adjustments in domestic oil product prices would need to be staggered over several years, and were concerned that the conservative monetary growth targets recommended by the staff could further dampen economic activity. A. Pricing Policies Petroleum product prices 19. Domestic prices of petroleum products will be raised kffective March 21,1999 by 70 percent across the board in order to reduce implicit subsidies and to improve the environment (Table 2). In the process, the pump prices for gasoline will rise to the equivalent of about half of the world market price. Although the adjusted prices for other products remain considerably below the world market equivalents, the overall fiscal impact is equal to 0.8 percent of GDP in 1999/2000. The Iranian representatives were cognizant of the need for further forceful action on this front but explained that such action must be balanced by reform of the safety net. They explained that the authorities, as an objective of the TFYDP, intend to raise domestic prices to the level of border prices by March 2002. This would call for annual price adjustments averaging 70 percent per year with a cumulative effect equivalent to 8 percent of GDP. The authorities would request technical assistance in order to help formulate this policy and to advise them of its impact on the rest of the economy. However, the increase in electricity tariffs has, so far, been limited to 20 percent. Interest rate structure 20. The mission observed that the ability of the financial system to mobilize and efficiently allocate private savings is circumscribed by the negative real interest rates, an inflexible interest rate structure, lack of competition, and the administrative guidance of credit allocation. The rigid nominal interest rates structure, in light of high inflation in the past, has resulted in negative real interest rates and has discouraged holding of the Iranian rial- denominated financial assets. Moreover, the interest rate rigidity has constrained the monetary Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lS- authorities’ ability to effectively manage exchange rate policies and to regulate domestic liquidity. 21. The Iranian representatives indicated that in order to increase interest rate sensitivity to market forces, the authorities had decided to take the following steps: . An open deposit account at the Bank Markazi would be made available for commercial banks to deposit their excess reserves at market-based rates of return; these rates would be adjusted as needed. . Legal and regulatory steps would be initiated to establish CPPs at the Bank Markazi to securitize its claims on the government (presently about Rls 59 trillion); these papers would be tradable on the TSE and the interbank market. Given the time lag involved in completing the procedures, the Iranian representatives believed that such papers could be issued by September 1999.* . In addition, consideration was being given to expanding the role of the GPPs by, if necessary, raising the rate of return from the present 20 percent. 22. The Iranian representatives stressed that the,development of such instruments would facilitate effective liquidity management by the monetary authorities as well as provide the much-needed anchor for the commercial banks’ interest rate structure. As a further enhancement, a private nonbank financial institution had been established with the freedom to set its own market-based rates; the planned establishment of more similar institutions in the period ahead would stimulate competition in the financial sector leading to greater flexibility in commercial banks’ rates of return and charges. Moreover, greater freedom had been accorded to banks in the allocation of credit and, accordingly, indirect prudential supervision had been expanded. Lastly, under the TFYDP, the authorities would deepen and widen the financial sector by increasing private sector participation in the financial and insurance sector. Exchange rates, trade, and payments system 23. The authorities recognize that implicit subsidies arising out of the overvaluation of the Iranian rial impose a heavy burden on the budget and the balance of payments, and necessitate the maintenance of inappropriate administered prices and import restrictions. Thus, in order to rationalize and liberalize the exchange system, they have, based on Fund technical assistance, developed a strategy to unify the multiple exchange rates at a market- determined rate by March 20,200l. The Iranian representatives explained that: 8Return to the CPPs will be tied to returns on specified public sector enterprises in the TSE. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- . As a first step, which became effective in February 1999, the TSE exchange rate has been freed of ollicial interference, and will be determined by market forces. All importers holding valid import licenses would be allowed unrestricted access to the TSE market. Consequently, the queue that had developed over the past months for foreign exchange in the TSE market would be eliminated. The government would auction a pre- announced “baseload” of oil and gas export receipts on a weekly basis; official foreign exchange intervention would be limited to smoothing out sharp fluctuations on the margin. . The share of current account payments at the TSE market rate would be increased to 45 percent in 1999/2000 from 34 percent in 1998/99 and 14 percent in 1997/98. In the event, the proportion of the budgetary oil and gas export receipts sold at the TSE rate would rise to 25 percent in 1999/2001 fi-om 15 percent in 1998/99. . Banks and dealers in the TSE market would be allowed to freely conduct exchange transactions for current account purposes, at negotiated rates, with customers and among themselves. . Foreign exchange repurchase rights and exchange settlement (import) certificates in the TSE market would be abolished, repatriation bonus discontinued, and the requirement of the surrender of non-oil export proceeds to the central bank would be ended; henceforth such proceeds would be surrendered to commercial banks. The central bank will not influence commercial bank decisions with regard to the use of such foreign exchange. . The volume of transactions at the export rate (Rls 3,000 = US$l) would be reduced drastically to US$700 million in 1999/2000 from US$l.3 billion in 1998/99. Effective March 21, 2000, all transactions at that rate would be discontinued and foreign exchange demand under this rate would be shifted to the TSE market. . Effective March 21,2001, the “floating” rate (Bls 1,750 = US%l) would be eliminated, ending the multiple exchange rate system. 24. Moreover, the Iranian representatives indicated that with the aim of liberalizing the payments system: . Exchange restrictions on travel and other invisible payments have been removed effective mid-February 1999. All bona fide current invisible payments including for travel purposes in excess of the indicative limits would henceforth be approved without undue delay and foreign exchange for such transactions may be purchased freely from commercial banks. . The imposition of advance import deposit requirements would be discontinued by September 2000. The authorities have indicated their intention to do so sooner if alternative mechanisms become available to effectively regulate domestic liquidity. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - . The risk premium charged by the Bank Markazi on foreign exchange guarantees would be increased to market levels by December 1999, thus avoiding an implicit subsidy.g B. Structural Reforms 25. A highly restrictive positive import list has so far been used to support and sustain the complex multiple exchange rate system and the underlying subsidies. The Iranian representatkes agreed to consider a staff suggestion that, in line with the liberalization of the exchange system underway, the authorities should, in the context of the TFYDP, shift to a short negative import list and an open general licensing system. In addition, quantitative controls on imports would be eliminated during the TFYDP as a market-based exchange system goes into full effect. The import tariff system would be reformed through a reduction in rates, the structure rationalized through a reduction in the number of bands, and all other fees and duties on imports would be incorporated into the tariff structure. Precise modalities of these reforms are yet to be defined. 26. In order to foster a greater role for the private sector and increased market- orientation, the government has been given the mandate by the parliament under the 1997/98 and 1998/99 budget laws to assess the financial position of all state enterprises with the aim of either liquidating, privatizing, or restructuring them. The Iranian representatives expected that the ad hoc committee, under the chairmanship of the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, would announce the government’s strategy shortly in this regard and also facilitate the elimination of state monopolies (except natural monopolies). The implementation of this committee’s recommendations would start during 1999/2000. A three-pronged strategy would be implemented: loss-making enterprises would be either.closed down or sold off; other enterprises would sell shares on the TSE as a step toward privatization; and finally, natural monopolies would be defined and would be limited to the public sector. Enterprises to be privatized would be sold on the TSE or through direct sales. The 1999/2000 budget had for the first time provided for Rls 500 billion of privatization proceeds. In the same vein, the government was evaluating the operations of public enterprises in order to ensure that information on their activities and financial position was shared with the market. Comparable steps were being asked from the private corporations, including the “foundations”; however, the private character of these enterprises imposed severe limitations on the government’s ability to subject them to reporting requirements, 27. As part of the medium-term rehabilitation program, the authorities have indicated their intention to develop an effective social safety net, with possible FAD technical assistance, to replace the current system of generalized consumption subsidies including on petroleum ‘A Fund staff technical assistance mission will assess the existing risk premia and provide ’ recommendations to adjust such premia in order to prevent the scheme from giving rise to a multiple currency practice.

The Iranian representatives recognized that these subsidies have been an obstacle to the mobilization and effective utilization of resources, and noted that the primary focus of the reform effort would be on shifting away from subsidized prices toward income transfers to appropriately targeted groups. A planning committee had been formed, within the context of the preparatory work for the TFYDP, to design an effective safety net to replace the existing system. The authorities intend to approach the World Bank to seek technical and related assistance in this regard. 28. In order to mobilize external nondebt-creating capital inflows, foreign direct investment (FDI) will be encouraged by clarifying and simplifying the existing regulations governing FDI and by allowing FDI in all sectors of the economy, including the non-oil sector. The Iranian representatives explained that new legislation would be enacted during 1999/2000 reforming the 1950 Law on the Encouragement and Protection of Foreign Investment in order to facilitate FDI. Iran had successfully used the “buy-back” and “build-operate-transfer” (BOT) techniques in the oil sector, and would extend their use to other sectors. C. Demand Management 29. Financial policies will be sharply tightened in 1999/2000 to support price liberalization and contain balance of payments pressures. Moreover, the Iranian representatives agreed to target a sharp reduction in the rate of inflation relative to present trends and to the assumptions underlying the budget for 1999/2000. 30. The budget for 1999/2000, which was recently approved by the parliament, calls for a sharp reduction in the overall deficit to about 1 percent of GDP from 5 percent of GDP in 1998/99.” The budget targets a 70 percent increase in total revenues to about 27 percent of GDP, mainly through an increase in non-oil revenues (of about 5.7 percent of GDP to 17.5 percent of GDP). Oil export receipts are projected to rise somewhat in U.S. dollar terms, and a larger share of such receipts would be sold in the TSE exchange market, raising oil-related revenues to 9 percent of GDP from 7 percent in the previous year. Tax revenue is also budgeted to increase to 7.4 percent of GDP through removal of a number of tax exemptions including for all state enterprises and the “foundations.“” Removal of such exemptions would apply to customs duties and corporate income tax, and would generate additional revenue (equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP) from state enterprises and the “foundations” alone. Nontax revenues are budgeted to double in nominal terms to 7 percent of GDP in large part on account of the increases in prices of petroleum products, “The 199912000 budget is based on an average oil export price of US$l 1.8 per barrel, 20 percent inflation rate, and a TSE exchange rate of Rls 5,700 = US$l. “The “foundations” are holding companies in the private sector based on unclaimed assets ’ after the revolution. Their earnings are used for charitable purposes. They do not receive direct subventions from the budget but benefit from certain tax exemptions.

Of this, increase in excise duties on automobiles, cigarettes, mobile telephones, beverages, and on steel and copper will generate revenues equivalent to 1.0 percent of GDP. In addition, the transfer of profits from state enterprises to the budget will be doubled to about 0.5 percent of GDP. Finally, the authorities intend to initiate implementation of the privatization program which is expected to raise about Rls 500 billion in revenues. - 31. Overall expenditure is budgeted to rise from 24 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to 28 percent in 1999/2000 primarily on account of a recovery of capital expenditures, which had fallen steadily over the past few years. Current expenditures would be left broadly unchanged as a percent of GDP. The increase in capital outlays would be linked to the increase in prices (“development excises”) budgeted for electricity and telecommunica- tions. 32. In discussing these projections, the mission questioned the underlying assumptions, noting in particular, the downside risk associated with oil prices. Moreover, because of revisions in assumptions for growth and inflation, revenues were likely to be less than targeted. In addition, administrative and institutional constraints could militate against revenue collection. Staff estimates based on the targeted inflation,.nominal growth in GDP, expansion in the taxable base, and the targeted increases in excises and prices, indicated that the non-oil revenues could at best be Rls 62 trillion (15.5 percent of GDP) as against Rls 70 trillion (17.5 percent of GDP) that had been targeted by the budget. Hence, the need for scaling back expenditures in the event of revenue shortfall to ensure the achievement of the targeted budget deficit. 33. In response, the Iranian representatives reaffirmed their commitment to reducing the deficit to about 1 percent of GDP as provided in the budget, if necessary through a postponement in capital outlays. They further reafftrmed that there will be no monetary financing of the budget deficit. If necessary, additional GPPs will be sold by adjusting rates of return in order to make them an attractive instrument to finance the deficit. Moreover, they could mobilize additional Iranian rial revenues through a larger reallocation of oil and gas receipts to the TSE exchange market. An accelerated reform of the tax system, centered around a value-added tax (VAT) was planned. A draft law envisaging a unified VAT at the rate of 10 percent, with zero rating for exports, some transportation, and small agricultural producers, would soon be submitted to the parliamenti The revenue yield from the proposed VAT, when fully implemented, is projected by the authorities at around 2.4 percent of GDP. “The proposed legislation benefited from a recent Fund technical assistance mission which made recommendations concerning the VAT as well as on steps to improve tax administration.

The Iranian representatives accepted the staiPs suggestion to sharply reduce the annual rate of inflation to 12 percent on through-the-year basis during 1999/2000 as compared with the estimated 24 percent during 1998/99. They recognized that the success of the newly liberalized TSE exchange market hinged on containing inflation so as to avoid a destabilizing depreciation of the Iranian rial. The proposed monetary program would limit the growth of net domestic assets (NDA) to 12.3 percent as against an estimated 30 percent during 1998199 with broad money growing at the same rate as the NDA. The underlying policies implied some pickup in the income velocity on account of the buildup of excess liquidity in the latter part of 1998/99 and the liberalization of the TSE foreign exchange market. In order to squeeze out the excess liquidity, the government aimed at backloading credit expansion to the last two quarters. In line with the strategy to impose a stricter budget constraint on state enterprises, the increase in credit to these enterprises would be limited to 3.1 percent of the initial stock of broad money as compared with 9 percent in 1998/99. This would require that the state enterprises enhance efficiency and adjust the domestic prices of their products in line with the higher cost of foreign exchange following the liberalization of the TSE exchange market and to meet the higher cost of petroleum products. On the other hand, credit to the private sector would be increased by 9 percent of the initial money stock. Recognizing the tightness of the monetary program, the Iranian representatives asserted that, should it cause a serious adverse effect on domestic activity, they would approach the stafFto review alternative policy options. 35. In order to ensure effective monetary restraint, the authorities may need to temporarily reimpose bank-by-bank credit ceilings (which were discontinued in 1998/99) till such time that the new instruments-including the central bank open deposit account and central bank participation paper-are fully operational. Similarly, the advance import deposits will be retained temporarily to reinforce credit restraintJ3 Balance of payments and external financing 36. The Iranian representatives explained that the unanticipated severity of the oil price decline had led them to seek a bilateral rephasing of their obligations falling due to some major creditors (Germany, Italy, and Japan) in respect of previously rescheduled liabilities; in addition, they had secured some oil prefinancing. These arrangemetits, however, had carried rather short maturities and had resulted in a loss of cover by some of the export credit agencies. They were aware that unless addressed immediately with intensified restiaint on short-term borrowing, debt difficulties could deepen in the near and medium term. Therefore, new gross short-term (less than one year in maturity) borrowing would be limited to about 131n the event of deviation in oil prices from the price implicit in these objectives, the response would be through expenditure adjustments, some compression in bank lending to the nongovernmental sectors, and a limited deviation from the money supply target.

Medium- and long-term capital inflows were likely to fall somewhat in 1999/2000, and to remain at about that level in 2000/O 1 on account of the loss of cover for such flows by export credit guarantee agencies of major creditors following the rephasing of past debt-service obligations. The Iranian representatives noted that the government would seek to mobilize additional medium- and long-term resources. They recognized that a substantive increase in such flows would crucially depend upon the restoration of cover by the export guarantee agencies. The government intended to re-establish Iran’s traditionally high - credit rating by ensuring repayments as scheduled. 37. The Iranian representatives explained that the external current account deficit would fall in 199?/2000, largely on account of reduced external financing. With a small increase in oil and gas export receipts but a likely US$500 million deterioration in the capital account, and given the target of avoiding any further drawdown of gross offtcial reserves, imports would be further reduced by 5 percent to US$13 billion leading to a small trade surplus. With the deficit on services account also falling, the external current account deficit would contract sharply from US$2.2 billion in 1998/99 to less than US$O.5 billion in 1999/2000 (0.4 percent of GDP). Although external debt would remain low relative to GDP, its maturity structure would worsen as the share of short-term debt increased (Chart 6, Table 6). IV. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK 38. The mission prepared a medium-term scenario (ZOOO/Ol-2002/03) based on the continuation of structural reforms in line with the steps already taken in the 1999/2000 budget (Tables 1, 3, and 5).” This scenario assumes that all foreign exchange transactions would be shifted to a single market-determined exchange rate by 2001/02, that domestic oil product prices would be raised to that of world prices by 2002/03, and that financial policies would aim at reducing the rate of inflation to 10 percent in 2000/01 and to 6 percent by 2002/03. Fiscal policy would generate budget surpluses of 0.5-l .O percent of GDP during 2001/02-2002/03. These will facilitate reduction in credit expansion combined with its shift 14The staff considered whether a more comprehensive program based on the unification of the exchange rate and more ambitious domestic oil price increases during 1999/2000, elimination of the positive import list, and liberalization of interest rates, would provide a stronger basis for faster growth in the medium term. The Iranian representatives stressed that they were intent upon moving in the direction of such a strategy. However, a faster implementation of adjustment as implied by this strategy would be difficult at present not only in view of the institutional limitations but also because of its political and social implications, which might be counterproductive for further substantive action in the medium term. Moreover, they recognized that the success of a faster adjustment would presuppose reform of the state enterprise sector including the banking sector and the establishment of a well-targeted social safety net which, at present, were not in place.

The amount of foreign exchange allocated to subsidized products and government imports would be reduced from US$6.5 billion (6 percent of GDP) in 1999/2000 to US$4.5 billion in 2000/01 and left unchanged for the subsequent years. All subsidies would be explicitly budgetized. Total subsidies, including on energy, would be reduced progressively during 2000/01-2002/03 to 6 percent of GDP from the present 13 percent. Since a hard budget constraint is imposed in terms of access to bank credit (below 3 percent of total credit in 2000/01-2002/03), the state enterprises will be exp.ected to adjust their prices and reduce costs. On the other hand, total investment and gross national savings - would rise from 20 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to 24 percent in 2002/03. 39. Balance of payments projections suggest that a moderate import growth could resume during 200 l/02-2002/03. In .view of the increase in short-term external debt in 1998/99-1999/2000 following the rephasing of service payments on the rescheduled debt, the ratio of public and publicly guaranteed debt to GDP would rise to about 15 percent in 1999/2000 before declining to 13 percent in 2000/2001. The debt-service ratio (excluding short-term debt), which had increased in 1998199 owing to the drop in oil exports, would fall in 1999/2000, in part, owing to the rephasing of debt-service obligations. This ratio is projected to level off at an average of 12 percent in 2001/02-2002/03 which should not pose any difficulties to Iran. The level of external debt would remain broadly unchanged for the rest of the forecast period. 40. . Because of import constraints and a moderate pickup in investment, the growth of GDP will recover only gradually and would remain below the authorities’ targeted average annual growth rate, underscoring the need for a speedy reduction in price distortions; the intensification of the authorities’ strategy to correct these distortions over the next two years would help in this process. However, since the subsequent removal of subsidies could jeopardize the financial stability of state enterprises and f$ther weaken the financial sector, an early financial restructuring of state enterprises and a strengthening of the banking system will be necessary. The financial resources needed for such restructuring would have to be made available through the budget, thus calling for a more concerted action on tax reform and reduction in current expenditures, while the correction of exchange rates and petroleum product prices takes effect. Pending the establishment of the social security system, subsidies for households will have to be clearly targeted and covered explicitly in the budget. Such reform should aim at establishing a tax system containing only a few broad-based taxes with simple and low-rate structures with VAT as an important component of such a strategy. The mission also recommended that the authorities build upon the important recent steps to f%rther rationalize the banking system, in particular through greater freedom to banks in developing their interest rates in an active interbank market with greater private sector participation, and a more independent central bank. 41. Notwithstanding the easing of exchange restrictions and liberalization of the TSE market, widespread import controls are maintained which is a prima facie evidence of a disequilibrium exchange rate.

The adjustment to the exchange rate in the market should be sufficient to allow the government to remove the existing import controls and move toward the introduction of a small negative import list. The Iranian representatives concurred with this assessment and assured the staff that the government intended to proceed ahead along these lines with the aim of allowing exchange rate unification by 2001/02. V. STATISTICAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ISSUES 42. Information provided to the Fund is generally adequate for an assessment of economic developments and to determine the economy’s medium-term outlook. Data reporting has also improved in a number of areas, in particular, on external debt owing to the establishment of the Bank Markazi’s Foreign Debt Department. The in-depth analysis of the economy, particularly in view of the planned expanded access to the international markets for FDI and capital inflows, would require the generation and dissemination of timely and more disaggregated data on the TSE exchange rate, external reserves, budget, and the national accounts. There is also a need to disseminate information on the activities of public sector enterprises and also on the “foundation” in the private sector. The authorities are cognizant of these requirements. They have requested Fund technical assistance to help integrate the external debt database with the balance of payments statistics, and also facilitate preparation of quarterly national account statistics. Additional technical assistance would be use&l in devising the mechanism to establish a unitary exchange system in an orderly fashion, to help eliminate subsidies implicit in the foreign exchange guarantees mechanism, and to facilitate the development of an active interbank market. VI. STAFF APPRAISAL 43. In 1998/99, the sharp fall in the global oil prices dramatically weakened Iran’s external accounts. In an effort to shield domestic economic activity, the Iranian authorities responded by drawing down official reserves and rephasing debt-service payments to major creditor countries, while the Iranian rial was allowed to depreciate tirther on the TSE exchange market. Public capital outlays were reduced as budget revenues fell, which contributed to a sharp slowdown in economic growth while unemployment increased. Nevertheless, the budget deficit widened to about 5 percent of GDP in 1998199, monetary expansion accelerated, and the external current account shifted to a large deficit despite continued import compression while inflation picked up. . 44. Owing to the continued weakness of world oil prices, low level of non-oil exports, and limited access to external financing, the short-term outlook is for a continuation of the external constraints and a &rther slowdown in economic growth. Over the medium term, the anticipated gradual recovery in oil prices and stabilization of external debt-service payments would ease the external constraint and allow some restoration of import capacity. However, the authorities are &lly aware that price distortions, the administrative allocation of resources, and inefficient state enterprise and financial sectors, will be major impediments to the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - restoration of sustained high growth which is needed to address the employment challenge. For these reasons, they have embarked upon a strategy that aims at fiscal consolidation and at addressing the major distortions and constraints to growth. 45. The authorities should be commended for breaking with past practices and decisively responding to the twin crises of falling growth and a weakening external position. The broad support for a market-oriented system and the reliance on private initiative in the authorities’ Rehabilitation Plan is appropriate. The staff welcomes the steps taken so far, or contemplated, in the implementation of this strategy. These include: (i) liberalization of the exchange system through the development of the TSE exchange market; (ii) adoption of a timetable to unifjl the exchange rates by March 20, 2001; (iii) a 70 percent increase in domestic prices of p&roleum products for 1999/2000 as a step toward parity with world market prices by March 2002; (iv) targeting a reduction in the inflation rate to 12 percent, thus helping restore positive real rates of interest; (v) a fiscal program to reduce the budget deficit to 1 percent of GDP from 5 percent in the previous year; and (vi) introduction of new instruments of liquidity management in order to increase the role of market forces in the determination of the interest rate structure. If tilly and forcefUlly implemented, this program should facilitate the establishment of a market-determined price system which should improve resource allocation and growth prospects in the period ahead. 46. Success of the price liberalization requires that steps be taken to reduce the dependence of the economy on the large implicit subsidies associated with inappropriate prices for energy and foreign exchange. Given that a large part of these subsidies accrue to the state enterprises, their removal should be coordinated with a strategy for that sector aiming at restructuring and privatization. The staff welcomes the government’s decision to reduce the size of the public sector and urges that the deliberations of the committee established under Article 35 of the 1997/98 and 1998/99 budgets be completed and its recommendations for the transfer, privatization, and liquidation of state enterprises implemented without delay. In the absence of such a strategy, established in a medium-term context, the financial consequences of the reduction of distortions in exchange and interest rates, and in energy prices on such enterprises, would not be manageable. Moreover, work on a social security system and a social safety net should proceed apace so that consumer subsidies can be appropriately targeted at a time when important fi,uther adjustments in administered prices are to take place.. It would also be helpful to correct accounting conventions so that the cost of implicit subsidies is explicitly identified in the budget. 47. The rigidity of the interest rate structure and the prevalence of negative real interest rates have resulted in administrative guidance of credit allocation, and rendered the banking system unable to allocate resources according to market signals. The staff welcomes the tighter monetary policy envisaged for 1999/2000 and the recent efforts to introduce greater market sensitivity to the interest rate structure, discontinue credit allocation, divers@ the financial system, and develop new financial instruments, such as the various types of market- based participation papers. However, bolder action would be advisable to establish a positive real interest rate structure, develop open-market securities, and to create an interbank market. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - Moreover, it is important that banks should be accorded greater freedom in setting their own rates of return and in allocating credit. It is also crucial to provide the central bank additional autonomy and powers to more effectively conduct prudential supervision and to design and implement monetary policy. 48. The authorities have initiated steps, on the basis of Fund technical assistance, to strengthen prudential supervision of commercial banks. The staff encourages the authorities to - strengthen internal governance of banks and improve the banking system’s soundness by building up banks’ capital position. The enhancement of market discipline through the establishment of new financial institutions in the private sector would be helptil in promoting an efficient allocation of resources. 49. The authorities should be commended for allowing the TSE exchange rate to be determined by market forces, which should provide a more realistic indication of the opportunity cost of foreign exchange. It is crucial that the authorities adhere to their timetable to unify the multiple exchange rates at the market-determined TSE rate. This would help increase import capacity by improving competitiveness of non-oil exports, strengthen the budgetary position, and generate resources to finance the restructuring of state enterprises. Concurrently, a tirther liberalization of the trade system would be crucial to restoring an efficient allocation of resources. In particular, quantitative import controls should be eliminated, tariff rates reduced, and the tariff structure rationalized by reducing the number of bands and incorporating all fees and duties into the tariff structure, and applying the TSE exchange rate for valuation purposes. The staff encourages the authorities to adopt as soon as possible a negative import list with open general licensing instead of the present highly restrictive positive list which is subject to discretionary decisions. 50. The rephasing of service obligations falling due in 1998/99-1999/2000 on the previously rescheduled debt has eased the balance of payments pressures but has shortened the maturity structure of the outstanding debt. Although the debt remains low relative to GDP and debt-service payments manageable, it is crucial that Iran maintains its past excellent debt- servicing record so that the cover for medium- and long-term loans to Iran by export guarantee agencies of major creditor countries can be fi~lly restored. The staff supports the authorities’ decision to avoid increasing net short-term indebtedness during 199912000. The authorities have made a welcome start in liberalizing rules governing FDI by undertaking the planned clarification of the existing laws with the aim of establishing a transparent legal framework. It is important that the planned new law be implemented during 1999/2000. 51. The staff encourages the authorities to build upon the measures already taken in line with suggestions above to comprehensively tackle the underlying structural rigidities which have hampered growth and employment. In particular, substantive steps aimed at: (i) delineating a comprehensive energy pricing policy including a timetable to achieve parity of petroleum product prices with world prices; (ii) initiating a far-reaching reform of the state enterprises sector; (iii) enhancing the market-based interest rate flexibility for commercial banks; (iv) adopting an efficient and transparent trade regime with a short negative list and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - low external tariff rates; and (v) clarifjling the legal environment for FDI, should be introduced in the period ahead. The establishment of an efficiently targeted social safety net and appropriate labor market measures would be crucial to the successfbl implementation of these reforms. In the view of the staff, adoption of such a strategy would unleash the formidable economic prospects of the country, based, in particular, on its vast oil and gas reserves, agriculture, and human capital which has been well preserved through substantial improvement in social indicators. In the event, the Fund would be ready to provide its technical and financial support to facilitate continued reform, which in turn would help Iran in its access to foreign credits and FDI. 52. Iran maintains multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). One multiple currency practice arises from the multiple exchange rate system comprised of (i) the two fixed official rates; (ii) surrender of non-oil exports at a fixed rate of Rls 3,000; (iii) the sale of foreign exchange in the TSE market to legal importers for imports on a positive list for 30 broad categories of goods through the redemption of “import certificates” and the use of an additional rate for certain service transactions based on the TSE rate; (iv) a “parallel” rate arising from trade of locally held foreign exchange earnings sourced from abroad (through means other than export receipts that are subject to a surrender requirement); and (v) a registration fee for purchasing foreign exchange for imports on the positive list payable to the treasury @Is 50 or Rls 250, . depending on whether the imports are essential commodities or ordinary goods, respectively). A second multiple currency practice arises from the advance import deposit requirement, which is not remunerated and also gives rise to an exchange restriction. The exchange restriction on travel and other invisibles has been ehminated following the authorities’ public announcement in mid-February 1999 that all requests for foreign exchange for bona fide transactions above the approved limits of Bank Markazi can be met at the TSE rate. However, additional exchange restrictions arise from (i) availability of foreign exchange due to the shortage of import certificates necessary in the TSE market; and (ii) limitations on remittance of earnings by foreign nationals working in Can. The first restriction would be expected to be eliminated as the rate in the TSE market adjusts in response to market forces. 53. In light of the envisaged plans to eliminate both the advance import deposit requirement and the multiple exchange rate system, and the related steps taken toward that goal, the staff recommends the approval until the next Article IV consultation or March 3 1, 2000, whichever is earlier, of the multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions arising from the multiple exchange rate system and of the advance import deposit requirement. 54. The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to improve Iran’s statistical base and encourages the authorities to ensure regularity in the flow of statistical information to the Fund. It is important that the transparency of economic information, including on the “foundations,” to the market participants, foreign investors, and creditors, be increased. The staffwelcomes the authorities’ plans to define property rights more precisely.

PROPOSED DECISION The following draft decision is proposed for adoption by the Executive Board. 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran’s exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in light of the 1999 Article IV Consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The Islamic Republic of Iran maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices as described in SM/99/58. In the circumstances of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Fund grants approval until the next Article IV consultation or March 3 1, 2000, whichever is earlier, of the multiple currency practices and exchange restriction arising from the multiple exchange rate system and the advance import deposit requirement.

Exchange System The foreign exchange market has operated mostly under a multiple exchange system over the past few years. A dual fixed exchange rate system was introduced in 1995, consisting of an official exchange rate pegged at Rls 1,750 7 US$l and a second official exchange rate-the - “export” rate-pegged at Rls 3,000 = US$l. In July 1997, the TSE market for foreign exchange was introduced: upon full surrendering at Rls 3,000 = US$l to the banking system, non-oil exporters are given the right in the form of “import certificates” to repurchase the full amount of foreign exchange Corn Bank Markazi; and can either use this right themselves for importing, or sell the right to a legal importer on the TSE market and, thus, effectively give rise to a more depreciated TSE rate. The TSE market is closely managed by Bank Markazi; the daily rate moves within a wide, unannounced “crawling band,” which is reset from time to time. A step adjustment was introduced in September 1998. The effective TSE rate, which was around Rls 4,800~Rls 5,200 = US$l in March-August 1998/99, was allowed to adjust in September 1998 to about Rls 5,700 = US$l which remained unchanged until mid-February; on February 23, 1999 this rate stood at Rls 6,233 = US$l. Government oil export proceeds are C.rlly surrendered to Bank Markazi at Rls 1,750; in return, they are mostly earmarked for government imports (including essential goods) and external debt service at the same rate, with a small share allocated at Rls 3,000 and TSE rate to public enterprises for capital imports. The TSE rate applies to imports based on a positive list of 30 categories (mostly raw industrial materials). In May 1998, an interbank rate linked to the TSE rates was introduced for certain current account transactions on services. The period between the date goods are exported and the date export earnings are repatriated has been extended to a uniform eight months for all exports. A bonus system is in place (in the form of retention allowance) which is equivalent to 1 percent per month of the export proceeds for early repatriation and surrendering. Iran continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV but maintains no exchange restrictions under these arrangements. Restrictions on bona fide current invisible in excess of the limits has been removed (early February 1999) and request for such invisible payments may be met without undue delay through commercial banks. It maintains an exchange restriction on multiple currency practices-multiple exchange rate system-that are subject to an approval under Article VIII. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 30, 1998.

Technical Assistance The Fund has provided technical assistance to Iran in various areas including improvement of the policy-related statistical base and enhancement of the conduct of economic policies. An MAE mission on exchange system reforms was conducted in late January-early February 1999. Two MAE missions which overlapped with the Article IV missions in 1995 and 1996, respectively, provided assistance in strengthening the prudential regulation and supervision of commercial banks, foreign asset management, and monetary control. In addition, MAE also - fielded a mission in May 1997 to assist the authorities in designing the modalities of issuance of central bank “participation certificates.” FAD staff participated in a Public Management Improvement Program mission together with staff of the World Bank in December 1996. In July 1998, a FAD mission provided assistance in designing the framework for the introduction of the value-added tax in Iran.

In 1991, Bank lending to Iran resumed - following the war with Iraq and the substantial decline in incomes, and as the government initiated a program of economic reform and undertook a major reconstruction effort. From 1991 to 1993, the Bank made six loans totaling US$847 million. During that period, the Bank has also prepared a series of economic and sector work, including sector notes on agriculture, mining and industry, energy, environment, transport, education, trade reform, and financial institutions and capital market. The World Bank group has not approved any new loans for Iran in the past five years. Since 1994, Bank activities have focused mainly on supervising the implementation of five ongoing projects in flood control, irrigation improvement, power sector efficiency, Teheran drainage system, and basic health, All projects are, in general, well implemented and are disbursing satisfactorily. During 1998, the Bank responded to government requests for technical support through four IDF grants. The grants focus on value- added tax reform, enhancing institutional capacity for foreign investment promotion, strengthening banking supervision, and central bank’s asset and liability management. ‘Supplied by the World Bank staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX IV Islamic Republic of Iran: Statistical Issues The data transmitted to the Fund, through direct contacts with the authorities and/or through the Executive Director’s office, provided basis for a sound assessment of economic developments and to form a realistic perspective on Iran’s medium-term prospects. The improvement in the key statistical database, in particular, the establishment of the Bank Markazi’s Foreign Debt Department has brought a vast improvement in data on public and publicly guaranteed external debt and debt-service obligations. Real sector statistics Price statistics have generally been reported to STA in a timely manner. However, time series on export and import price indices (based on the export and import components of the WPI) were reported to STA through December 1993. National accounts statistics are basically sound and compilation follows 1993 SNA methodologies. MED has received national accounts estimates for 1998/99. Bank Markazi has recently compiled quarterly GDP statistics for the period 1986-96, for which, a technical assistance from the STA has been scheduled in 1999 to review, and improved the methodology for the compilation of quarterly GDP. Government finance statistics Preliminary estimates on accounts of the general government (central government and 26 provincial governments) for 1998/99 have been provided to MED. Budget data for 1999/2000 were shared with the Fund staff during the consultation discussion. An economic classification of public expenditures was made available to the consultation mission in 1997. Data were also provided on government transfers to cover public enterprises’ financial losses through the 1998/99 budget. The STA database contains annual data for the consolidated central government through 1997198. There are differences between data reported to STA and MED on revenue, expenditure, and net lending, as well as in data classification. A large part of the differences results from the inclusion of data on quasi-fiscal exchange operations in the data provided to MED. Local government data reported to STA are only available through 1989. Only aggregated data on financing have been reported through 1996/97. Monetary statistics Monetary data are in general provided on a timely basis. Long-standing issues pertain to the lack of information on: (i) detailed accounts on net foreign assets, (ii) detailed accounts on other items net, and (iii) on the data of several time series shown under the international ‘liquidity section of International Financial Statistics.
