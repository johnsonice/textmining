The budget achieved modest surpluses in 1995 and 1996 and inflation fell from 587 percent in 1994 to zero in 1996. A change in government in 1996 led to an unwarranted loosening of the fiscal stance in the following two years. The overall fiscal deficit rose to 11 percent of GDP in 1998, and was financed mainly by banking system credit. The loose stance of fiscal and monetary policies led to a rapid widening of the spread between the official (fixed) exchange rate and the parallel market rate in the course of 1998. Together with the depressed state of international commodity markets, the strong growth of domestic demand led to a large increase in the deficit of the external current account. The authorities devalued the official rate by about 43 percent on January 1,1999. However, a gap emerged immediately between the official and the unofficial markets, which has since widened to 65 percent, despite the depreciation in the official rate of 14 percent that has taken place over the last five months. Policy issues The size of the gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates is a clear indication that the stance of fiscal policy remains far too expansionary. First priority must be given to bringing the budget back under control. The government has enacted a number of tax measures, but the recent increase in civil service wages is considerably greater than what the mission had recommended. Monetary policy is dominated by the need to finance the budget deficit. The present system of marginal liquidity requirements is cumbersome, and should be replaced by a uniform reserve requirement in due course. Despite progress in establishing an adequate legal framework for the financial sector and the operations of the central bank, supervisory standards are, in practice, far from international norms. The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates should be closed and the foreign exchange market unified by a large discrete devaluation of the official rate. The exchange rate regime that is then adopted must be adequately supported by fiscal and monetary policies. Suriname’s statistical infrastructure is in very poor condition. The national accounts are particularly weak, but problems with tbe budgetary and monetary accounts, including the accounts of the central bank seriously impede both analysis and policy making.

The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions with Suriname were held in Paramaribo during January 12-26, 1999, and concluded in Washington during February 3-5, 1999. Suriname’s representatives included the Ministers ofFinance and Planning; the President of the Central Bank of Suriname (CBS); and other senior officials in the Ministries of Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy and Forestry; and Social Affairs. The mission also met with representatives of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Suriname Bankers’ Association, leading parastatals and state foundations, and several embassies. The staff representatives were Messrs. Mackenzie (Head), Braumann, and Tadesse, Mrs. Randall, Ms. Dabla-Norris, and Mrs. Quelch (Assistant), (all WI-ID). 2. Suriname has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.’ The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 4, 1997. Directors expressed concern about the weakening of the fiscal position and the decision to grant a wage increase of 50 percent to civil servants, They were of the view that a strengthening of the fiscal position was needed to preserve stabilization gains achieved during 1995-96, and urged the authorities both to resist additional wage pressures and to implement their plan to reduce the size of the civil service. 3. Economic statistics in Suriname suffer from very serious limitations. National accounts data, in particular, are beset by significant measurement error and coverage problems (which are compounded by the presence of a large and growing informal sector).* Both the composition of the consumption basket and the base period of the consumer price index have not changed in 30 years. The information on the government’s financial operations is neither comprehensive nor timely, and there are no comprehensive financial data for public enterprises. Money and banking statistics data are subject to serious classification problems, and the balance of payments statistics are produced only on a cash basis and with long lags. These deficiencies severely constrain the effective monitoring and analysis of economic and financial developments in Suriname. 4. Suriname is on the 12-month consultation cycle. Staffing constraints made it impossible to complete the Article IV consultation process with Suriname within the normal cycle. ‘A summary of Suriname’s relations with the Fund is presented in Appendix I. Suriname has not had arrangements from the Fund nor has it had financial operations with the World Bank. A summary of Suriname’s relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is presented in Appendix IV. 2These problems led the staff to develop a simple method of estimating GDP and its components that, although not a substitute for a thorough revamping of the official accounts, would provide more reliable estimates of the level of economic activity.

The growth of real GDP, including the informal sector, is estimated to have fallen from over 10 percent in 1997 to 4 percent in 1998 (Table 1). The growth of the service sector slowed in 1998, and the level of output in manufacturing, utilities and agriculture declined. In particular, rice production slumped because of a 40 percent decline in area under cultivation, owing to decaying infrastructure as well as a protracted strike by rice farmers protesting the special exchange rate applied to rice exports. A prolonged strike at Surland--the country’s banana company-damaged the banana tree stock and affected all stages of production. Manufacturing output was reduced by firm closures, partly as a result of the increased foreign competition entailed by Suriname’s accession to the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Finally, abnormally low rainfall reduced hydroelectricity production and agricultural production in general. 6. Inflation revived in 1997-98-ending a brief period of relative price stability-as a result of a strongly expansionary shift in fiscal policy and an accommodating monetary policy (see below). The 12-month increase in the CPI rose from 1 percent at end-December 1996 to 22 percent as of end-December 1998. In addition, the spread between the parallel market and the official exchange rate increased from 8 percent at end-1997 to 78 percent at end- 1998. When the official rate was devalued by 43 percent from Sf 401 to the dollar to Sf 700 to the dollar on January I, 1999, a spread of about 10 percent immediately developed between it and the unofficial or black-market rate. 7. The overall balance of the central government, having swung from a small surplus in 1996 to a deficit of 5.2 percent of GDP in 1397, deteriorated further in 1998, when it recorded a deficit of 11.1 percent of GDP (Table 2). A fall in the ratio of total revenues and grants to GDP and an increase in the ratio of expenditure and net lending accounted in about equal measure for the swing of 6 percentage points in the deficit in 1997-98. Current expenditures rose by 50 percent on the strength of a 66 percent increase in wages and salaries and a 46 percent increase in expenditures on goods and services. Capital expenditures declined as a share of GDP following the completion of an important phase of a bridge construction project and reduced expenditure on regional development Net lending expenditures increased as a share of GDP, as the CBS continued to borrow externally in order to engage in policy-based net lending to agriculture and housing.” 8. Tax revenues proved to be buoyant in 1998, rising from 21.2 percent of GDP in 1997 to 23.1 percent of GDP in 1998. Indirect taxes continued increasing their share of total tax revenue as a result of the introduction of the general sales tax (GST) in February 1998 and the impact of falling profit margins in the bauxite sector on income tax revenues from that ‘This lending is consolidated with budgetary operations Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- sector.’ However, the proceeds from the GST (Sf 12.8 billion or 2.8 percent of GDP) were lower than had been expected (Sf 16 billion)-owing to the wide scope of exemptions and to initial administrative difflculties.5 Nontax revenues declined from 4.0 percent of GDP in 1997 to 3.3 percent in 1998, while the decline in external grants (from 8.5 percent of GDP in 1997 to 3.8 percent of GDP in 1998) reflected the continuing stalemate in Dutch/Surinamese Development Cooperation talks.6 9. The government’s deficit in 1998 was primarily financed by borrowing the equivalent of over 7% percent of GDP from the domestic banking system. The government’s direct recourse to the CBS amounting to about one-third of domestic financing, and borrowing from commercial banks accounting for the rest. The government’s net external borrowing amounted to 2.5 percent of GDP, and there was a buildup in arrears to suppliers amounting to 1 percent of GDP, reportedly incurred by line ministries issuing orders without appropriate authorization. IO. The incrense in net bank credit to the public sector in 1998, which amounted to 25 percent of liabilities to the private sector at the beginning-of-period, crowded out credit to the private sector and largely accounted for the increase in the growth of broad money from 19 percent in 1997 to 31 percent in 1998 (Tables 1 and 3). The increase in private sector credit declined from 15 percent of private sector liabilities in 1997 to 9 percent in 1998 and there was a substantial decline in the net foreign assets of the banking system. 11. Nominal interest rrtes, over which the CBS exercises considerable moral suasion, were reduced slightly in 1998 despite the increase in inflation, with the result that real rates of interest on deposits turned negative. The average lending rate was 26 percent while the average deposit rate was 16 percent, compared with an average rate of inflation of 19 percent. 12. Suriname’s exports performed poorly in 1998. Agricultural export volumes were lowered by the difficulties already noted, but export values were also reduced by significant declines in world prices for alumina/aluminum, crude oil, gold, rice, and marine shrimp. Despite near capacity output levels, alumina volumes were not sufficient to compensate for ‘Rather than introduce a value-added tax with a credit mechanism based on the invoice method, the authorities adopted a single-stage sales tax applying at the import and the manufacturing stages, in the case of goods, and at the point when the service is rendered in the case of services. Raw materials are exempt, so as to avoid a cascade effect, and tax relief is also provided for capital goods purchases. ‘Forty “basic commodity groups” were both duty-free and sales-tax exempt in 1998 6The event triggering the deterioration in relations was the issue of an international arrest warrant in the Netherlands for a senior coalition party member on drug trafficking charges. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicthe export price decline, and the value of alumina exports, which account for about 69 percent of total goods exports, fell from USS312 million to US$296 million. Similarly, a decline in prices largely explains the fall in the value of aluminum exports from US$47 million to US$39 million. The share of nonbauxite exports in total exports declined from 33 percent in 1997 to 22 percent in 1998. Their lackluster performance undoubtedly owed something to the substantial appreciation of the real effective exchange rate that took place during 1998 (Figure 1). The devaluation of the official rate at the beginning of 1999 markedly improved Suriname’s competitive position, but this gain has been eroded by the 40 percent increase in consumer prices that took place between December 1998 and April 1999. 13. The weak performance of exports and a drop in offkial unrequited transfers resulted in a deterioration in the external current account balance from a surplus of UC325 million to a deficit of US$llS million (or 10 percent of GDP) (Table 4). Import values actually declined from US$507 million to USSSOI million, as a modest increase in non- oil import values was offset by a drop in oil imports from US$65 million to US%5 1 million. The impact of the swing in the current account on the overall balance of payments was offset by large net capital inflows, including foreign direct investment by the bauxite companies, external borrowing by the government, and substantial borrowing by the banking system. The increase in capital inflows limited the decline in net international reserves to US$6 million, reducing the end-year stock of reserves to US$140 million, equivalent to 3% months of imports. The stock of government and government-guaranteed external debt rose, however, from US$ I58 million in 1997 to US$ I76 million in 1998, equivalent to 27 percent of GDP. III. REPORTONTHEDISCUSSIONSANDPROSPE~TSFOR~~~~ 14. The policy discussions focused on two issues: the measure of the stance of fiscal policy in 1998; and the implications of the further loosening of the stance of fiscal and monetary policies in 1998 for the outlook in 1999, in the light of the unfavorable turn in the external environment. The authorities agreed with the mission that fiscal policy had been excessively expansionary in 1998. They did note, however, that the political situation had been very difficult, meling pressures for the very large wage and salary increases already noted. They also maintained that the actual deficit may have been lower than the mission’s estimates, both in nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP.’ 15. The mission explained that the conclusion that fiscal policy had become much more expansionary was robust to different measurement assumptions and ways of estimating GDP. It expressed concern that the expansionary shift in fiscal policy in 1998, and the accommodating posture of monetary policy, had led to a marked deterioration in financial ‘Specifically, the authorities felt that nontax revenues had been understated and goods and services expenditures overstated (in guilder terms) and that the mission’s GDP estimates might underestimate the size of the informal sector.

The mission underscored the importance of the 43 percent devaluation of the official exchange rate at the beginning of the year. It needed, however, to be complemented by a large fiscal adjustment in 1999, and by supportive monetary policies, if the pass-through effect of the devaluation on domestic prices was not to degenerate into a wage-price spiral. The challenge facing economic policy was compounded by the unpropitious external environment expected in 1999. The prices for Suriname’s principal exports are expected to fall somewhat in U.S. dollar terms. Offtcial grants are also expected to decline, as are net capital inflows, which were relatively high in 1998. A. Fiscal Policy 17. Projections prepared by the mission in the field on the assumption of unchanged policies illustrated that the fiscal stance of 1998 would not be sustainable in 1999. The projections assumed a decline in real GDP of I percent, and an average inflation rate of about 60 percent in 1999. The tax system was assumed not to change, and most expenditure categories-and notably, wages and salaries-were assumed to grow at the same rate as GDP. These assumptions resulted in a budgetary deficit that was essentially unchanged as a percentage of GDP. The deficit on the external current account was projected to reach US5110 million, about the same as in 1998, but its share of GDP increased by about 4 percentage points to 14 percent, entailing significant pressures on reserves. 18. The authorities shared the views of the mission on the importance of a drastic reduction in the budget deficit. Their basic objectives for 1999 were an overall deficit that did not exceed 5 percent of GDP, and balance between current revenue and grants and current expenditure. To illustrate how these objectives could be achieved, the mission prepared an active scenario, based on a set of revenue and expenditure measures aimed at reducing the deficit to below 5 percent of GDP (Table 2). (The scenario has been updated to reflect the increase in consumer prices of about 40 percent observed in the first four months of 1999.) Three revenue measures with a total yield of 1.5 percent of GDP were proposed: . Raising the rate of the sales tax on domestically produced goods to 7 percent, thereby harmonizing it with the rate on imported goods (projected yield: 0.4 percent of GDP). . Broadening the base of the sales tax to include the 40 basic goods that are now exempt from both the sales tax and customs duties (projected yield: 0.8 percent of GDP). . increases in excise tax rates (projected yield: 0.3 percent of GDP). Three expenditure measures (or targets) were also proposed: Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- . Limiting the increase in the wage bill to 35 percent in nominal terms (Projected savings compared with 1998 outturn: 3.6 percent of GDP). . Limiting the increase in subsidies and transfers expenditure to 50 percent in nominal terms: (projected savings: 0.6 percent of GDP). . Elimination of the net lending carried out by the CBS, a quasi-fiscal activity included in the statI’s presentation of the budget (projected savings: 2.2 percent of GDP). 19. The increase in the sales tax rate of 2 percentage points on domestically produced goods would stiIl leave these rates relatively low by international standards, nor would the rate of tax on the 40 basic goods (7 percent) be especially high. As regards the expenditure measures, the mission stressed the great importance of avoiding fi.tII indexation of civil service salaries. Although salaries may have been compressed in real terms during 1992-94, as the authorities maintained, they had increased by almost 100 percent in the interim. Allowing some erosion in real terms was justifiable under the circumstances-civil servants are not poor-and was in any case made necessary by the budgetary situation. It was also important that the authorities develop a plan to rationabze the civil service. 20. The authorities did not oppose any of these measures, and they expressed strong agreement with the statTon the need to avoid fill indexation of public sector wages and salaries. However, they did wish to consider alternatives to the total elimination of the sales tax exemptions, given the potentially undesirable social impact of that measure. One such alternative might be an increase in the rate of sales tax on luxuty items. The staff expressed its support of the authorities’ resolve to redress the deterioration in the government’s accounts, and underscored the importance of the preparation of a new budget that would reflect both the devaluation and the measures that had been proposed to reduce the deficit. The staffs analysis implied that a return to a robust external position would take more than one year, although its active scenario would achieve most of the required adjustment (see Section 7). 21. The authorities subsequently took a number of measures along the lines proposed by the mission: specifically, an increase in the rate of sales tax on both imported and domestically produced goods to 9 percent; an increase in the rate on services to 7 percent; the elimination of certain exemptions under the sales tax; increases in the rate of sales tax on luxury items; and increases in excise tax rates. These measures were alI effective April1 1999, except for the excise tax increase, which is pending approval by the National Assembly. The staff estimates the yield of these measures to be about 1 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side of the budget, the authorities proposed a general wage increase of 42 percent effective from January 1, The increase implied a decline in real wages of about 10 percent given the authorities’ inflation projection, and was considerably more than the mission had recommended. The authorities also stated that they would not resume on-lending operations, and that they intended to increase electricity and water tarit%, to reduce the budgetary subsidy to the public utilities. These measures will, in the staffs judgement, go a fair way to achieving the necessary degree of fiscal adjustment. To achieve the staffs deficit target, however, they Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- will need to be supported by additional expenditure reductions equivalent to 3 percentage points of GDP. Otherwise, inflation will be higher than it would be under the staffs active scenario, as will the external current account deficit (Tables 2 and 4). B. Monetary Policy and the Financial System 22. The authorities agreed with the St&that the rate of credit expansion over the past year was clearly excessive.* In addition to the demands of the government for loans from the commercial banks, credit expansion in 1998 reflected a boom in unsecured personal lending-possibly related to the substantial appreciation in the real effective exchange rate during 1998-and the growth of convertible currency deposits (CCD), a new financial instrument that allowed commercial banks to circumvent the credit ceilings imposed on their operations9 In the course of the year, the CBS was able to close up the loophole in the credit ceilings that these instruments had permitted, and the growth of CCDs leveled off. The mission stressed the importance of ensuring that the present system of credit control not become vulnerable to financial innovations of this sort. 23. The authorities acknowledged the urgent need to re-establish control over liquidity, in the first instance by reducing the public sector borrowing requirement. Control would be further enhanced by moving to a system of full reserve requirements, The mission agreed that while a move to a required reserve system was desirable on administrative grounds, certain transitional measures may be necessary for those banks that have not conformed to the present credit ceilings. 24. The staff noted the substantial decline in real interest rates during 1998, which had resulted in negative real rates for deposits. It urged the authorities not to constrain interest rates to be negative in real terms in 1999, because this could only lead to financial disintermediation. *Monetary policy in Suriname currently relies on a system of statutory credit ceilings, under which banks are allowed to increase their lending during a given year by a certain percentage of the increase in their deposit liabilities that varies with the type of deposit. These credit limits are equivalent to marginal liquidity requirements, with a 100 percent requirement for demand deposits. The present system also allows banks to carry over any margins left over or unlent at the end of one year to the next,’ and to increase credit ceilings by the equivalent of 25 percent of their net profits, ‘Convertible currency deposits allowed banks to transfer some of their foreign exchange liabilities into long-term local currency deposits, which were then used to extend credit domestically. Although the foreign exchange ceded to banks was invested abroad, domestic liquidity expanded considerably. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- 25. The staff expressed its concern over the continuation in 1998 of two quasi-fiscal operations by the CBS: on-lending to state banks offinds borrowed abroad, and the purchasing of industrial gold.“’ Some Sf 10 billion in fimds had been channeled through the CBS to commercial banks for on-lending in 1998. The authorities emphasized that they had adopted a policy of no additional on-lending as of September 1998. The mission held the view that to the extent that there is a role for them, on-lending operations should be conducted by the central government, in a fully transparent manner, with any subsidy element reflected clearly in the budget. 26. The CBS continues to play a key role in the country’s industrial gold business, and increased its purchases of industrial gold from 3,600 kg in 1997 to 6,100 kg in 1998. The authorities intend to establish a mint in the near future, at which point they will cease participation in the gold industry.” The mission noted that the function of developing and managing the gold market in Suriname was not one of a central bank’s core responsibilities, and that the creation of a separate establishment for refining industrial gold should be guided by cost considerations. Additionally, the mission expressed concern over the central bank’s accounting treatment of gold swaps and gold backed loans and urged the authorities to take into account any charges against gross international reserves before deriving their net official foreign asset position.12 27. The banking system in Suriname is not sound. The existing laws governing the activities of financial institutions are outdated and the regulatory and supervisory structure is deficient.‘3 Commercial banks face a number of prudential problems, and a majority of the ‘OIn both 1997 and 1998, the CBS borrowed funds abroad on a relatively short-term basis for on-lending in local currency to the agriculture and industry sectors through the state banks at concessional rates, an activity that poses considerable exchange and credit risk for the central bank. “Currently, industrial gold is sent abroad for refining before being added to the monetary gold reserves. ‘*The swap arrangement typically entails a spot sale of gold with a forward repurchase arrangement. The increase in foreign exchange increases gross international reserves, but the liability entailed by the repurchase agreement is not treated as a claim on those reserves. “Supervisory procedures and standards fall far short of international best practices. The central bank routinely neglects to use its supervisory authority to encourage adherence to standards or to impose sanctions on banks which fail to meet prudential requirements. Additionally, there are no commercial banking laws in place and the activities of insurance companies, pension funds and finance companies are not regulated, leaving the financial system and depositors exposed to a number of potential risks, such as the pyramid schemes (continued.. .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- state-owned banks are insolvent, with a very high proportion of nonperforming loans in their portfolios. Provisioning practices are inadequate and there is a low average ratio of capital to risk adjusted assets (typically less than 8 percent).” Loans are often improperly classified and no systematic policy for the foreclosure of loans exists. 28. While the mission welcomed recent efforts made by the authorities to improve the existing legislative framework following the advice oftechnical assistance from MAE, it noted that, in addition to the legal reform, a substantial improvement in supervisory and regulatory standards and practices was needed.” It was also necessary that the authorities develop further their strategy for the privatization and restructuring of the government-owned banks. C. External Policies 29. The unfavorable outlook for commodity prices means that the current account of the balance of payments will remain in deficit in 1999, although the deficit can be contained if the government adopts and maintains an appropriately tight fiscal stance. The capital account is expected to record a smaller surplus than that of 1998, when it mostly offset the large current account deficit. The composition of capital inflows has been changing, however, in that the share of net inflows in the form of official borrowing has increased at the expense of long- term foreign direct investment. The change in the composition of the capital account will result in a substantial increase in debt service. 30. The government took an important step toward unifying the foreign exchange market and eliminating a complex system of multiple exchange rates by devaluing the official exchange rate by 43 percent to Sf 700 per dollar on January 1, 1999. The requirement that foreign exchange be surrendered to the CBS was kept in place. Under the new exchange rate regime, the official market rate on any given day is determined by the average rate that commercial banks and cambios report to the central bank at the close of the previous day which, in turn, is based on the average of the rates applied to their off%zial rate transactions and “treasury transactions” (i.e., when buying foreign exchange from remittances, tourists, and others). In all their transactions with licensed importers and exporters, commercial banks must utilize the official market rate established by the CBS. When buying and selling foreign ‘3(...continued) that proliferated a few years ago. 14No quantitative information on nonperforming loans or the adequacy of loan loss provisions is available. “A new Financial Institutions Act and a Central Bank Act are expected to bring the supervisory and regulatory framework closer to international standards. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- exchange for treasury transactions, the banks are allowed a margin of 3 percent around this rate.16 31. Since more than 90 percent of commercial bank transactions are with licensed importers and exporters, the average rate for their transactions tends to stay close to the official market rate. Some fraction of commercial banks’ foreign exchange business, however, is undertaken at the more depreciated rate applied to treasury transactions, and as long as there exists a gap between this rate and the official rate, continuous depreciation of the official rate will ensue. As of mid-May 1999, the official rate has depreciated by about 14 percent, to about Sf 8 10 per U.S. dollar, since January 1, 1999. 32. Commercial banks can purchase foreign exchange from the CBS, but only on the basis of specific import orders from their clients, for which the CBS is often unable to provide the full amount of foreign exchange. In other words, the CBS is rationing foreign exchange among commercial banks, leaving them to choose which importers they will satisfy.” The unofficial market was not eliminated by the January 1 devaluation. A gap between the official and unofficial market of 10 percent emerged the day after the devaluation. It has widened considerably since then, and as of mid-May stood at about 65 percent. The authorities took the view that the continued presence of the unofficial market reflected nothing more than illicit activities and/or the unwillingness of traders to deal with the administrative requirements of the formal sector.‘8 33. The staff acknowledged that the new exchange rate regime was more flexible than its predecessor, but expressed serious concern that it was not flexible enough to clear the market for foreign exchange, and continued to be strongly biased against exports. The large and rapidly widening gap between official and unofficial market exchange rates indicated the need for prompt adjustment of the official rate, and for strong fiscal adjustment and supportive monetary policy. 34. To eliminate the gap between the official and parallel rates and unify the foreign exchange market, the staffproposed that the authorities effect a large discrete devaluation of 16A week after the start of the new exchange rate regime, the CBS passed a directive that prevents commercial banks and cambios from offering rates on their treasury operations that are outside a band of 3 percent around the official market rate. The commercial banks are presenting a legal challenge to this 3 percent rule, but it remains operative. “The excess demand shows up in importers’ being obliged to wait weeks or months for their foreign exchange. ‘*In line with this view, the authorities have reportedly resorted to closing down key operators (including the shutting down of hitherto tolerated roadside stalls and makeshift foreign exchange bureaus in central city locations).

Subsequently, a crawling peg regime with an adequate degree of flexibility might be adopted to guard against overvaluation. Regardless of the precise form of the exchange rate regime the authorities chose, the staffemphasized that, to be success!%l, it had to be supported by disciplined fiscal and monetary policies. 35. Exports and imports continue to be subject to licensing requirements. Specifically, in addition to their general license for exporting/importing, traders are required to have a specific licence for each individual shipment. These licenses are issued liberally, but the resulting extra layer of documentation requirements increases the transactions costs of trade. Apart from licenses, trade in a few agricultural products is subject to quantitative restrictions and, in very few cases, outright prohibitions. 36. The requirement that exporters deposit their foreign exchange earnings in advance of receiving payments was eliminated in 1998, although the foreign exchange surrender requirement remains in place. The authorities stated that there are plans for further trade deregulation for 1999, as part of a trade reform project supported by the IDB. The government intends to overhaul the present licensing system by adopting a negative list system, in which all imports and exports are to be allowed except those few that are specifically prohibited. The staff urged the authorities to abolish the system of specific shipment licenses and to rationalize the system of quantity-based restrictions, preferably by replacing them with tariffs. 31. With respect to the tariff structure, Suriname’s acceptance ofthe CARICOM Common External Tariff (CET) since 1996 has reduced tariffs to an average of 25 percent on most goods. Imports from CARICOM countries, a limited number of raw materials, and 40 basic goods continue to be exempt from tariff duties. The CET is likely to be reduced to an average level of 20 percent in 1999, but the authorities noted that Suriname has received authority to delay participating in the next round of reductions in light of the need to limit the associated revenue losses. 38. Payments for invisible transactions, and the transfer of profits and remittances remain free of official control, although reporting requirements apply for certain large transactions. However, the current shortages of foreign exchange at commercial banks imply that commercial banks may not always have sufficient funds to provide the desired amount of foreign exchange for invisible payments. 39. According to ministry of finance figures, the stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt rose from US$158 million to US$176 million between 1997 and 1998. This raised the debt to GDP ratio from 21 to 27 percent, reversing the falling debt to GDP ratios observed for 1996 and 1997.19 Arrears of US$lS million have been outstanding since 1995. “The 27 percent debt to GDP ratio for end-1998 GDP is calculated at the parallel market (continued...)

The staff observed that the authorities should significantly limit their short-term commercial indebtedness. Market conditions permitting, it would be desirable to extend the debt’s average maturity.” IV. MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS 40. Despite the worsening of the external environment projected for 1999, a very sizeable fiscal adjustment in that year can minimize the loss in international reserves. The beneficial effects of front-loaded fiscal adjustment are reinforced by the expected improvement in Suriname’s external environment in 2000 and subsequent years. The staffs medium-term projections, which incorporate the active fiscal policy stance described above, assume a gradual recovery in the prices of Suriname’s commodity exports from the lows projected for them in 1999, and the maintenance of a competitive exchange rate. The level of offkial grants is assumed to recover in the year 2000, on the assumption of a normalization of relations with the Netherlands and a disbursement of timds from the European Union. Net capital inflows decline in 2000, because of the high level of repayments of debt recently contracted, but recover subsequently. 41. Under the scenario prepared by the staff, economic activity starts to recover in 2000, with real GDP increasing by 3.5 percent in that year, and by 5.0 percent in 2001. There is definitely scope for rapid growth in Suriname, although in some sectors-agriculture in particular-additional investment or rehabilitation expenditure will be necessary for a strong recovery. Both investment and national saving are projected to increase as a percentage of GDP. In 1999, private sector saving is projected to fall in the face of declines in real output, households’ disposable income, and corporate retained earnings as well as a terms of trade loss, but the fall in private sector saving is offset by the increase in the government’s current budgetary surplus. In the active scenario, inflation starts to abate in mid-1999, and continues to decline in 2000-2001. Fiscal policy is tightened further in 2000, although most of the adjustment has already taken place. The overall external balance is expected to show a modest surplus for the years 2001-2003, consistent with the objective of lowering inflation and building up international reserves. Both external debt and debt service decline substantially, and the threat of an unsustainable external position recedes. 42. The impact of fundamental public sector reform and, in particular, of civil service reform, if undertaken in the period 1999-2001, would probably not show up in the accounts “(...continued) exchange rate. GDP in U.S. dollar terms at the official rate is US$l,OSS million versus USS640 million at the parallel market rate. The debt to GDP ratio is near 17 percent if GDP is calculated at the official market rate. “The debt figures do not include debt that may have been contracted separately by the CBS.

Nonetheless, the budgetary savings would begin to make themselves felt in subsequent years. 43. The medium-term outlook is highly sensitive to projections for aluminum prices, which are forecast to rise by 4 percent in 2000, I2 percent in 2001, and 9 percent in 2002. If world aluminium prices were instead to stay at their 1999 levels (US%l,200 per metric tons), forestalling recovery in the levels of bauxite exports and in foreign direct investment, the external resource balance will deteriorate by at least US%45 million (5 percent of GDP) in both 2000 and 2001. The projections for the aluminum industry are also sensitive to assumed production volumes. The stafl’s projections assume modest (3 percent) volume growth in 1999 and 2000, followed by slightly higher growth of 5 percent in later years, coinciding with improved world prices. News received recently about the closing of an aluminum smelter would appear to imply lower bauxite sector export earnings of around 13 percent, or US$39 million for 1999. However, as the companies were not operating at capacity levels (due to power limitations), it is quite possible that they will utilize the extra power supply now available to raise their output of alumina. Consequently, although a further decline in export earnings from the bauxite sector below the lower level already projected for 1999 is certainly possible, the stat%‘s projections remain reasonably conservative. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL. 44. Suriname’s economy endured a long period of decline during the 1980s and early 1990s. The combination of a more buoyant external environment and a tightened fiscal stance in 1994-95 improved materially the economy’s performance in 1995 and 1996. These gains are now threatened by the expansionary swing in fiscal policy that has marked the last two years. 45. Given the depressed outlook for the prices of its major commodity exports, limited external financing, and the financial imbalances characterizing the domestic economy, it is essential that Suriname achieve a large and sustained reduction in the budget deficit if it is to avoid a further decline in the already low level of reserves and even higher rates of intlation. The actions taken thus far this year are a significant step in the right direction, but they do not go far enough. Wage restraint must be the cornerstone of the effort at fiscal restraint in 1999. The civil service wage bill now accounts for about 16 percent of GDP, and both employment and average remuneration seem excessive. Wage restraint needs, however, to be supported by restraint of other expenditure items. In particular, other current expenditure on goods and services must decline in real terms, and the central bank’s program of on-lending, which is a quasi-fiscal activity, should not be revived. 46. The staff commends the authorities for their adoption of the package of tax measures described earlier. The performance of the sales tax should, however, be closely monitored. The administrative difficulties of its first year may simply have been teething problems, or may have reflected more basic difficulties either with the design of the tax or with its Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- administration. If, for urgent social reasons, it is not feasible to eliminate the remaining exemptions to the sales tax, it is essential to find some appropriate alternative. 47. The authorities’ efforts to redress the budgetary situation are handicapped by the state of the finance ministry’s management information systems. Granted the need for basic reform of the expenditure reporting system and public financial management, some comparatively simple steps can be taken that would allow the compilation of a much more accurate picture of the state of execution of the budget. An urgent complementary measure is the revision of the budgetary projections for 1999 to take account of the devaluation, and their recasting in an analytically tractable format. It is just as urgent to improve the accounting of the CBS’s balance sheet and the monetary survey as a whole. Problems in this area have affected the authorities’ assessment of the stance of both fiscal and monetary policy in 1998. The severe weaknesses that characterize economic statistics generally have been underscored above. They must also be addressed without delay. 48. The conduct of monetary policy was inevitably handicapped by the monetization of a large part of the budget deficit. Furthermore, there are indications that the system of control of private sector credit is both administratively cumbersome and not watertight. A move to a system of uniform reserve requirements would improve monetary management, although it too will not work ifthe government deficit is not under control. 49. The large share of credit taken by the government is crowding out legitimate private sector activity. However, the current state of the banking system is exercising a drag on the efficient mobilization of resources for private sector investment. Confidence in the banking system is affected by the lack of sound accounting and prudential standards. The government’s efforts in this area are therefore welcome. At the same time, interest rate policy needs to be more flexible. Although it is difficult to say how elastic the demand for bank deposits is with respect to their real rate of return, a failure to increase rates from their currently low level invites financial disintermediation. The rationalization of the state banks should take account of the budgetary impact of the proposal ultimately adopted. 50. The large gap between official and unofficial exchange rates is a clear sign that the exchange rate is not functioning as an effective device for allocating foreign exchange, and that it strongly discourages exports. A large discrete devaluation adequately supported by financial policies is necessary to address these problems and eliminate the gap. Once the right exchange rate level has been found, a crawling peg arrangement with sufficient flexibility to maintain competitiveness may be considered. The exchange rate regime ultimately adopted must, however, be supported by appropriately tight financial policies. 51. Although lackluster international commodities markets, poor weather, and the lax stance of financial policies, all contributed to the worsened current account deficit, failures of structural reform also played a role. Addressing outstanding structural and policy impediments to trade should thus remain a priority concern, especially if the recent decline in nonbauxite exports is to be reversed. In this connection, the staff would urge the authorities to expedite Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- their plans to eliminate licensing requirements on exports and imports, and to replace existing quantitative restrictions on imports with tariffs. The staE would also emphasize that projections of the current account in 1999 and beyond will need to be based on a realistic assessment of the likely level of external grants. 52. Suriname has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4. Although there are no limits to the amount of foreign exchange that may be taken per trip abroad, amounts in excess of US%lO,OOO must be declared. The remittance of profits and dividends needs prior approval, but this is granted freely for ail bona fide requests. 53. The following measures give rise to restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval by the Fund under Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3 of the Articles of Agreement: (4 Suriname maintains two sets of effective rates for foreign exchange conversions: an of&% rake, and a rate for treasury transactions. This system gives rise to a multiple currency practice as there is no mechanism to ensure that the spread between ah the effective buying and selling rates does not exceed 2 percent. The requirement imposed by the CBS that ah transactions with licensed importers and exporters take place at the official rate, together with the inability of the CBS to provide all the foreign exchange required for legitimate import orders at that rate, give rise to an exchange restriction. In this regard, the unsatisfied demand for foreign exchange indicates either an official rate that has been set too high or a rationing of foreign exchange by the CBS, both of which are restrictive practices directly attributable to the authorities. This existence of a restriction under Article VIII, Section 2, is also evidenced by the presence of the tbriving black market for foreign exchange, with rates that differ from the official rate by up to 65 percent. Alternatively, the “forcing” of foreign exchange transactions into the black market may also amount to a multiple currency practice. In the absence of a definitive time frame for their removal, Fund approval for the retention of the above measures by Suriname is not being recommended by the staff. 54. It is recommended that Suriname remain on the 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - Table 1.

SDR department: SDR Million Net cumulative allocation 1.75 Holdings 2.13 Percent of Allocation 100.0 27.5 Iv Financial arrangements: Suriname has not had any financial arrangements with the Fund. V. Projected obligations to the Fund (SDR million; baaed on existing use of resources and present holdings of SDRs): None VI Exchange rate arrangements: On July 11, 1994, the authorities replaced a multiple official exchange rate system that had been in place since October 1992 by a unified exchange rate managed by the Central Bank of Suriname (CBS). The exchange rate following unification was around Sf 180 per U.S. dollar. Soon after unification a defacto dual exchange market system developed, with a market for central bank transactions and another market for transactions between banks and exchange houses (cambios) and the public. At times, the Suriname guilder traded at a discount of up to 20 percent in the second market with respect to the central bank market. By end-l 995, the spreads among the various exchange rates had virtually disappeared, following the CBS’s intervention in the foreign exchange market in mid-1995. However, the spread between the parallel and official markets widened to 5.5 percentage points beginning in May 1996, within the context of the uncertainty surrounding the electoral process, before narrowing to 3.3 percentage points in December 1996. The exchange rate in the otXcia1 market remained more or less fixed at Sf 401 per U.S. dollar throughout much of 1996, and at end-December 1996, the parallel rate was Sf 410 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate spread then widened and was consistently in excess of 5 percent from early 1997 through much of 1998. The exchange rate spread in December 1998 was 78 percentage points. On January 1, 1999, the authorities devalued the official exchange rate to Sf 700 per U.S. dollar, with a view to eliminating the large gap that had developed between the official and parallel Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - APPENDIX I market rates by the end of 1998. Under the new exchange rate regime, the of?icial rate on any day is the average rate for all foreign exchange transactions entered into by commercial banks and cambios on the previous day. In this regard, the CBS requires that all foreign exchange transactions with licensed importers and exporters take place at the official rate. For the buying and selling of foreign exchange for other transactions (i.e,. the so-called “treasury transactions”), commercial banks and cambios are free to set their own rates, which may not be more than 3 percent higher or lower than the official rate. The average of all rates, which will determine the official rate for the following day, is reported to the CBS at the close of each day. This new exchange rate regime gives rise to a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3, because there is no mechanism in the system to limit the spread between the official and treasury transactions rate from exceeding 2 percent. In addition, foreign exchange can only be purchased from the CBS by commercial banks on the basis of specific import orders firorn their clients. The CBS is often unable to provide the full amount of banks’ client-backed foreign exchange requests, resulting in long lags in securing foreign exchange and an unofficial (i.e., black) market for foreign exchange. This evidences an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2. Alternatively, the existence of the unofficial market also gives rise to a multiple currency practice. During the first three weeks of January, the freely negotiated rates commercial banks utilized for treasury transactions were more depreciated than the official rate that was initially set at Sf 700 per U.S. dollar. As a result, the average rate utilized by banks and cambios, and hence the rates reported daily to the CBS, depreciated gradually over time. By the third week of May 1999, the official market rate reached Sf 8 10 per U.S. dollar, representing a 14 percent depreciation since the beginning of the year. Moreover, reflecting continued shortages of foreign exchange at the ot%ial rate, the exchange rate in the unofficial market reached Sf 1,300 per U.S. dollar by mid-May 1999. VII. Last Article IV consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 4, 1997 (EBh4/97/57). Suriname’s exchange restrictions were not approved. Suriname is on the standard 1Zmonth Article IV consultation cycle. VIII. Technical assistance: In June 1995, the Statistics Department provided technical assistance in the areas of government finance, balance of payments, monetary, national accounts, and price statistics. The authorities received technical assistance from FAD, in the area of budget preparation in May 1997. A technical assistance mission from MAE visited Paramaribo in June 1997, in order to conduct an assessment of the soundness of the banking system. Mr Gilles Hubert, a long-term MAE expert, is serving with the CBS.

There are serious problems with the quality of macroeconomic statistics in general in Surinam~pertaining particularly to limitations in coverage and accuracy-as well as with the currentness and timeliness of statistical data, as identified by a STA multisector mission in June 1995. These problems, which have worsened in recent years, are due in part to various resource constraints, including the scarcity of qualified staff, insufficient training programs, and shortages of equipment and supplies. The STA mission provided technical assistance in the areas of government finance, balance of payments, monetary, national accounts, and price statistics. The mission made a number of detailed recommendations, only a few of which have been implemented. The authorities have recently expressed an interest in receiving further Fund technical assistance on money and banking and balance of payments statistics. They are already receiving technical assistance from the IDB to enhance economic and social statistics (see discussion below). Suriname has very few statistical publications, which are usually not available on a regular basis owing to resource constraints. The General Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is the official agency responsible for the publication and dissemination of economic data. The IDB recently implemented an institutional strengthening project for the ABS comprised of five components: the first component was designed to strengthen ABS’s organizational and administrative capabilities, and has resulted in the computerization of the Statistics Bureau and provided computer training to the stti There has also been a concerted effort, under the IDB program, to work in collaboration with the Customs Office’s Automatic System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) to improve the comprehensiveness, reliability and timeliness of trade statistics produced by the ABS. The IDB project will also result in the execution of an enterprise survey, which will update the registry of enterprises and regularize the production of reliable enterprise statistics. The most recently published information on wages and employment is through end- 1995. The new enterprise survey is now scheduled to be executed in 1999 to produce 1998 data, which will in turn, permit a rebasing of the national accounts data to 1998. Currently, the quality of national accounts data in constant prices is impaired by the use of an outdated base year (namely, 1980). In addition, the IDB project will encompass a household expenditure survey, which will permit an updating of the consumer price index (CPI) consumption basket and thus a rebasing of this index (the current base period is April 1968-March 1969). A. Real Sector National accounts statistics are currently available through 1997 in the most recent publication by the ABS, although the authorities have working estimates through 1998 that are unpublished. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - APPENDIX III However, important methodological problems remain-pertaining in part to efforts to estimate the output of a large and growing informal sector-which undermine the credibility of the official estimates. The June 1995 STA mission, which included a review of national accounts and consumer prices, noted that compilation of these statistics had been seriously constrained by the weakness in the institutional capabilities of the ABS, such as a lack of qualified staff, inadequate data processing facilities, insufficient timds to conduct field surveys, and limited independence of ABS as a bureau of the Ministry of Planning. The mission identified several shortcomings in the compilation of national accounts statistics, including a significant nonresponse problem in the source data, the lack of adjustment for holding gains, derivation of private consumption expenditure as a residual, the use of an outdated base year (1980) and over-reliance on the CPI for compiling the estimates at constant prices, Due in part to these weaknesses, national accounts data have not been reported for publication in the International Finance Stutisfics (IFS) since 1993. The CPI is compiled on a monthly basis. Its weights, however, are based on a market basket established from 1968-69, and geographic coverage is limited to the Paramaribo and Wanica districts. Also, the CPI excludes many widely used goods and services (including medical services, electronic consumer goods, and rental accommodation). The June 1995 mission underscored the importance of conducting a household budget survey to revise the CPI weights and list of items, and recommended that the survey cover a broader geographical area. A producer price index has not yet been compiled in Suriname. Suriname does not report data on imports and exports on a regular basis for publication in the IFS. The June 1995 mission made recommendations concerning improvements in the compilation of trade statistics, including the use of the single customs document for export and import transactions, the implementation of regular reporting of customs data to the ABS, the monitoring of Customs’ progress with the ASYCUDA system, the clearing of the ABS backlog in processing customs documents, and the enhancement of ABS trade data validation and verification checks. Progress appears to have been made on several of these fronts as a result of the IDB’s project for institutional strengthening at ABS, although some problems still remain pertaining to the accuracy of statistical data entry by Customs staff. More recently, ABS’s efforts to reduce the backlog of unprocessed historical customs data (from 1995 through end-1997) appear to have been hindered by the strikes and work stoppages that have affected the civil service. B. Public Finances In the past, the Fund staff relied on fiscal data reported in the Flash Report prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, which records the fiscal outturn on a monthly basis, This report has not been produced since end-1995, due to staffing problems, and the Ministry of Finance is now in the process of changing to a new classification system. In the meantime, both the Fund staff and the Ministry of Finance Economic Affairs Department use the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - APPENDIX III monthly Liquidity Report (based on the central bank’s Daily Balance Statement on Government Operations), supplemented by other information sources to compile the monthly fiscal data. These data, like the Flash Report, suffer from a number of shortcomings. They are compiled from different data sources, resulting in differences in timing of recording, and there are problems with respect to both the comprehensiveness of the coverage of fiscal operations and the consistency of the data across the sectors. In particular, the data on domestic and external financing, external debt service, and most external grants must be supplemented with information from other sources. In addition, the staff must adjust for the fact that the Liquidi~ Report fails to capture ah of the operations of the central administration, including those that are not channeled through the main account of the CBS. There are also numerous classification problems, and the accounts are presented only on a cash basis. An IDB project was implemented last year, which is designed to strengthen the Ministry of Finance’s Department ofEconomic Affairs and Treasury Department. This project will: (a) revise the present budget codes so as to establish consistency with the government finance statistics system (GFS); (b) broaden the coverage of the fiscal accounts to include ah extrabudgetary items; (c) attempt to regularize the reporting of information by public enterprises; and (d) centralize and computerize the preparation of comprehensive accounts for the central government within the Office of the Central Paymaster. There are currently no data on central government operations in Suriname available for publication in the IFS. Moreover, publication of data for Suriname was discontinued after the 1991 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), as the latest GFS data for Suriname referred to 1986. A substantial improvement in the quality of Suriname’s government finance statistics needs to occur before the resumption of publication in either the GFSY or in IFS can take place. C. Monetary Sector Data on the monetary sector have serious shortcomings and need to be adjusted before they are usable for analytical purposes. These adjustments seek to: (a) reconcile information on net foreign assets with balance of payments data; (b) reclassify some government accounts in the balance sheet of the CBS; (c) identify exchange losses; and (d) reclassify gold certificates. In addition, the June 1995 STA mission identified inconsistencies in the historical valuation of monetary gold and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, and pointed to other shortcomings such as the fact that the available information does not allow the separation of bank accounts (deposits and loans) denominated in domestic and foreign currency. In practice, only a few recommendations from the 1995 multisector mission’s report have been implemented. In particular, gold certificates held by the public and by banks are now being separately identified in the accounts of the central bank and commercial bank accounts, and accounts for bridging aid and balance of payments support are included in the central government Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- APPENDIX III deposits. The authorities have recently requested additional technical assistance from STA in the area of money and banking statistics, which is being sought to: (a) revise the call report forms and instructions provided to the commercial banks; (.b) prepare a key table directly from the banks’ trial balances (or chart of accounts) in order to generate the monetary statistics; and (c) review the classification by instrument and sector of the accounts of the CBS and the commercial banks, with a view to correcting any remaining inconsistencies. STA has tentatively scheduled a money and banking follow-up mission for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2000. D. External Sector Balance of payments data on a cash basis must be adjusted to a transaction basis with information obtained from several independent sources, which results in problems of coverage and differences in timing of recording. Moreover, recent changes in methodology and modifications in the coverage of balance of payments data have resulted in major breaks in the historical series, In addition, data from different sources on the same variable frequently do not match, and stock and flow data are usually inconsistent. Although there has been some improvement in the currentness of the trade statistics following the implementation of the ASYCUDA (designed to enhance trade data entry) in January 1996, there are still some problems remaining pertaining to the accuracy of data entry by Customs workers. Efforts to revise the balance of payments presentation to conform with the methodology of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual began in 1997. Although there have been improvements in the presentation of external debt data, there is still no comprehensive information on disbursements, and on the breakdown between payments on current obligations and payments on arrears. The authorities have requested additional follow-up technical assistance from STA in the area of balance of payments statistics, and STA has informed the. authorities that this request will be given further consideration during the upcoming fiscal year. The last balance of payments data included in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook and the IFS refer to 1994.

As of February 24, 1999, the IDB had approved five loans totahng US$48 million, ofwhich UW7.6 million had been disbursed, and numerous technical cooperation projects. I. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION Loans Three loans totabng USS37.8 million are in execution at present. Two of the loans totahng US$7.8 million were approved in 1987 for a project to upgrade the Nickerie Hospital and have been almost completely disbursed. A third loan of US%30 million for an Agriculture and Trade Policy Reform Program (ATPL) was approved in November 1998. The ATPL is a policy-based loan that will be disbursed in two tranches of US%18 million and US$12 million, following the execution of policy reforms. The general objective of the ATPL is to promote sustainable economic development by improving the economic policy and institutional framework in the areas of agriculture and trade. The specific sectoral components are: (i) elimination of trade licenses and quantitative import restrictions and their replacement with a transparent and modem system of trade controls; (ii) elimination of the requirement to surrender foreign exchange for nonmineral export products, and the need to deposit a letter of credit before exporting; (iii) elimination of unnecessary institutions, inefficient services, price controls and retention quotas in the rice sector; and (iv) development of a forestry management policy and improvement in the monitoring and control of forest exploitation. The ATPL requires a supportive and sustainable macroeconomic framework, with particular emphasis on fiscal equilibrium and a realistic exchange rate. Technical cooperation At present, 15 technical cooperation projects amounting to US$10.4 million are being carried out. The largest technical cooperation projects are for the institutional strengthening of the Department of Economic AtTairs in the Ministry of Finance, the institutional strengthening of the General Bureau of Statistics, the institutional strengthening of the Office of Tax Administration, the establishment and strengthening of the National Institute for Environment and Development of Suriname, and health sector reform. In October 1995, the IDB approved nonreimbursable financing of US$l million for a technical cooperation project to help the Government of Suriname improve the timeliness, coverage and accuracy of the fiscal data produced by the Ministry of Finance’s Department of Economic A%irs. The project has six specific objectives: (i) application of internationally accepted standards for government financial statistics (GFS), based on the IMF’s GFSManual; (ii) improvement of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - APPENDIX IV the capacity for fiscal analysis; (iii) inclusion of extra budgetary items in the department’s reports; (iv) support to related areas, such as debt management, utilities and state enterprise data production, and the Central Paymaster; (v) modemization of the Department of Economic Affairs; and (vi) training. In January 1996, the IDB approved nonreimbursable financing of US.Sl.7 million for a technical cooperation project for the institutional strengthening of the General Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The objective of the project is to improve the coverage, quality, and timeliness of economic and social statistics produced by the ABS in order to provide policymakers and the general public with better tools for evaluating economic policies and the socioeconomic situation of the country. The major components of the project include statistical organization and management, national accounts, an enterprise census, trade statistics, and household surveys and the consumer price index. In November 1997, the IDB approved nonreimbursable financing of US.Sl.8 million for the institutional strengthening of the tax administration office. The project has four objectives: (i) development of a comprehensive proposal to simplify and improve the tax system; (ii) improvement of the tax administration office’s organizational structure; (iii) expansion of the tax base; and (iv) increased coverage and productivity of auditing activities. In May 1998, the IDB approved nonreimbursable financing of USS1.4 million for a technical cooperation project to strengthen and support the initial operations of the National Institute for the Environment and Development of Suriname (NIMOS). The project is financing: (i) technical assistance and stafftraining during the first two years of the institute’s operations; (ii) establishment of the institute’s operational capacity; and (iii) development of environmental legislation and regulations, In November 1998, the IDB approved nonreimbursable financing of US.Sl.4 million for a technical cooperation project to assist the Government of Suriname in health policy reform The project will assist the government in: (i) developing and initiating health policy reforms to improve the efficiency, equity and financial sustainability of services; (ii) strengthening the policy making capacity of the Ministry of Health; (iii) improving the financial sustainability of the State Health Insurance Fund; and (iv) improving provider reimbursement methods and the targeting of subsidies. II. OPERATIONALPROGRAM At present, the operational program consists of four projects that would be financed by loans, A Financial Sector Reform Program (FSRP) is at an advanced stage of development. The FSRP would be a policy-based loan of USS25 million that would be disbursed in two tranches. The sectoral components of the FSRP would be: (i) development and implementation of a legal framework to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial sector; (ii) enhancement of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX IV central bank’s statutory powers and institutional capacity; (iii) strengthening of the Bank Supervision and Insurance Supervision Divisions; (iv) rationahzation of state-owned banks; and (v) establishment of a framework to ensure the safety and soundness of the insurance and pension sectors. The IIvIF has provided comments on successive drags of laws for the financial sector. A project for a Community Development Fund (CDF) that would be financed by a loan of US!610 million is under preparation. The primary objective of the CDF would be to improve the living conditions, economic opportunities, and social well being of the poorest communities of Suriname. The project would achieve this goal by financing small-scale, locally generated projects that meet the needs of the poorest communities. A project for low income housing that would be financed by a loan of US$7 million is under preparation. The project would have two main components: (i) the establishment of a direct demand subsidy program for housing rehabilitation and new construction for low- and moderate- income households by the private sector; and (ii) technical assistance to reform policies in order to attack the causes of high costs of building materials and land, and to move mortgage finance dowmnarket.
