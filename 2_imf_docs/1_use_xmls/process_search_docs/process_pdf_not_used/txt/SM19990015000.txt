The immediate cause was the prolonged tightening of fiscal and monetary policies in response to the large external imbalance and currency crisis in 1997. Also, the reaction of consumers and investors to the crisis was much sharper than could have been anticipated. . However, serious structural deficiencies were at the root of the problems: slow progress with bank and enterprise restructuring and weak corporate governance led to the large capital inflows received in the mid-1990s being channeled into excessive credit growth, large real wage increases, misguided investments, and in some cases outright asset stripping. The problems were brought out in the open in 1998 as the large banks tightened lending policy under the prospect of being privatized and strengthened supervision/regulation. This brought many enterprises to the verge of collapse. . On the positive side, the tight policies-combined with favorable temporary factors-led to a sharp reduction in the current account deficit and inflation, which helped insulate the Czech Republic from the turbulence in international fmancial markets. Short-term macroeconomic prospects and policies The main challenge now is to foster a recovery while preserving the adjustment gains. Fiscal and monetary policies were appropriately eased from late 1998, but there are no clear signs yet of a turnaround and the recovery is likely to be slow. Consumer confidence can be expected to remain subdued, banks are unlikely to ease the recent tight credit policy significantly in the near term, and key export markets continue to be weak. . The main stimuli in 1999 would likely come from private consumption and government expenditure, but domestic demand and output would be flat at best for the year. Inflation could pick up somewhat in the second half of the year reflecting the recent exchange rate depreciation, but should remain below 4 percent. The current account deficit should remain broadly unchanged at about 1% percent of GDP and easily covered by FDI. . Wages have been slow to respond to the rapid decline in inflation and some uncertainty and concern remains for 1999. However, the weakening labor market should help contain wage pressures. The government needs to send the right signal for next year by limiting wage increases in the government and state- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- controlled enterprises to no more than expected inflation, The absence of wage moderation could jeopardize the prospects for a sustainable recovery. . The fiscal budget for 1999 was oriented to stimulate growth, with some increase in the deficit owing mainly to higher capital expenditures, Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to play to help counter weaker than expected growth. However, with the fiscal deficit possibly reaching 4 percent of GDP in 1999 and worrisome prospects for the coming years (reflecting the low buoyancy of the tax system and mounting pressures from social transfers, bank and enterprise restructuring costs, contingent liabilities, and EU accession costs on environment, infrastructure, etc.), it is urgent to develop a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy. The 2000 budget must be conceived within this context. . Interest rates should be set to the lowest level consistent with the medium-term inflation target. However, the room for further easing is probably limited following the most recent interest rate cuts. Some Snther moderate depreciation of the koruna would not be unwelcome owing to uncertainty about the strength of competitiveness and the need to support the recovery of exports and output. Appreciation pressures should be resisted, if needed through interest rate cuts. Structural reforms Demand stimuli alone will not be enough to support a sustainable recovery and a real economic take-off. It must be coupled with a revival and acceleration of the stalled structural reform process, including first and foremost bank and enterprise restructuring/ privatization, but also far-reaching reforms to the legal and institutional framework. . The bank privatization process has been accelerated, including with the very recent successful sale of CSOB to a strategic foreign investor (Belgian KBC). A clear strategy for preparing the remaining state-controlled banks @33 and CS) for sale is needed to comply with the plan to sell them by early 2000. Any balance- sheet clean up or capital injection prior to sale should reflect the true value of the banks. Also, supervision and regulation must be further strengthened. . The industrial revitalization plan approved in April must be targeted to enterprises that are deemed viable, in whole or in part, with the sale of good parts to foreign strategic investors who have the needed capital, management, and marketing expertise. Non-viable enterprises should be liquidated. The program should be strictly time-bound. . The bankruptcy system must be strengthened as a matter of urgency to deal with the presumably many unviable enterprises. More generally, far-reaching reforms to the legal and institutional framework are required to provide proper business incentives.

The 1999 Article IV discussions with the Czech Republic were held in Prague during April 6-16, 1999.’ The mission met with Prime Minister Zeman, Finance Minister Svoboda, Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Tosovsky, several members of the CNB Board, senior offtcials in government ministries, the CNB, and the Czech Statistical Office, labor unions, financial market representatives, and the EU delegation. Mr. Jonas, the Advisor to the Executive Director for the Czech Republic, participated in many of the meetings. 2. At the conclusion of the 1997 Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic on February 13, 1998, Executive Directors commended the authorities for their determined response to the major challenges they had faced in mid-1997, but observed that the costs of adjustment had been high, with a steep decline in investment and growth and rise in unemployment. However, noting that the external position remained fragile and inflation high, Directors stressed the need to maintain tight financial policies and to pursue a much more vigorous approach to wage discipline. Also, restructuring of enterprises and addressing weaknesses in the banking system were seen as essential for setting the stage for renewed growth in a noninflationary environment. 3. Since then the economy has slipped into a severe recession, while the current account deficit and inflation have declined markedly. The discussions focused on the role of prevailing policies in bringing about these developments and on the policy changes needed to foster a sustainable recovery. In addition, the mission carried out an in-depth review of the banking sector, examined enterprise restructuring and corporate governance issues, and helped the authorities develop a medium-term fiscal framework. 4. Following the June 1998 elections, the Social Democratic party formed a minority government. The new government has continued to pursue prudent macroeconomic policies, but progress with structural reforms has been uneven and the lack of a parliamentary majority has made it difficult for the government to advance its legislative agenda. The Czech Republic joined NATO on March 12, 1999 and is continuing discussions with the EU, aiming to become a member in 2003. 5. The Czech Republic accepted the obligations under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement as of October 1, 1995, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on making payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Czech Republic approved the quota increase under the Eleventh General Review of ’ The mission team comprised Messrs. Artus (Head), Laursen, and Haksar (all EUl), Mr. Ariyoshi and Ms. Guide (both MAE), and Mr. Symansky (FAD). Mr. Nord, the regional representative for Central Europe, participated in the discussions.

The Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement has been submitted to Parliament for approval. II. BACKGROUND 6. The marked slowdown of growth in 1997 was followed by a severe recession in 1998. The immediate cause was the prolonged tightening of fiscal and monetary policies in response to the widening of internal and external imbalances and the resulting currency crisis in early 1997. While the economy was overheated in early 1997, serious structural deficiencies were at the root of the problems. Weak corporate governance in the state-controlled banks and in the enterprise sector resulted in the channeling of the large capital inflows received in the mid-1990s into excessive credit growth, which supported large real wage increases for employees and even more for management, misguided investments, and in some cases outright asset stripping. Tight fiscal and monetary policies-combined with favorable temporary factors-eliminated the macroeconomic imbalances, but without adequate structural changes the cost was high in terms of economic activity. With the benefit of hindsight, the tightening may also have gone too far-the automatic fiscal stabilizers should have been allowed to play in 1998 and monetary policy could have been eased sooner. On the positive side, the tight policy stance helped insulate the Czech Republic from the turbulence in international financial markets. Macroeconomic policies were eased in late 1998, and the strong appreciation pressures on the koruna during most of 1998 were reversed in early 1999. 7. Output contracted by close to 3 percent in 1998, reflecting a large decline in domestic demand, especially tixed investment (Table 1; Figure 1). This was related to persistently high real interest rates, reluctance of banks to lend, and, more fimdamentally, low profitability in the enterprise sector. Private consumption also declined sharply in the first half of 1998, but was only marginally lower in the second half compared with the year before. This reflected a sharp adjustment of growth in household incomes-with the real wage bill contracting about by 2 percent in 1998, in part because of a surge in unemployment from 4% percent in 1997 to 6 percent in l998-and a steep rise in the household savings rate. By March 1999, the unemployment rate had reached 8% percent. 8. Inflation decelerated rapidly from early 1998 (Figure 2). CPI inflation-after reaching a peak exceeding 13 percent in March 1998 owing in part to large administered price adjustments in January-fell to 7 percent in December and dropped tiuther to less than 3 percent in March 1999 as inflationary pressures receded and additional administered price adjustments were relatively small. The decline in inflation reflected the tight policy stance and increasing output gap, but also favorable temporary factors, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Figure I.

Wage growth (average monthly earnings) in the corporate sector and industry slowed during the year from about 13 percent to 8-9 percent, owing partly to a reduction in overtime work, with wage rates thus decelerating less markedly (Figure 3). Wage settlements for 1999 in the enterprise sector appear to have been mainly in the range of 7-8 percent, but there is some uncertainty, given the absence of comprehensive information on wage agreements, significant variation in the settlements reported, and the fact that a large share of the labor force is not covered by collective agreements. In the government sector, a wage increase of 13-15 percent was agreed to compensate for the nominal wage freeze imposed from mid-1997 through 1998. 9. The external current account deficit declined sharply to 2 percent of GDP in 1998 from 6 percent of GDP the year before, reflecting mainly the weakness of domestic demand and strong export growth, but the decline in world commodity prices also led to a 5 percent improvement in the terms of trade (Table 2; Figure 4). Import volume increased by 9 percent, entirely on account of the high import content of exports. Export volume rose by 11 percent, reflecting the coming on stream of several large export-oriented investment projects. However, export growth slowed markedly in the second half of 1998 and turned negative toward the end of the year and in early 1999, as economic activity weakened in Europe and the impact of the real exchange rate appreciation was being felt (Figures 5,6). Also, as a significant part of the improvement in the current account was related to the downturn in the economy, the improvement in the underlying deficit was less marked. 10. The upward pressures on the exchange rate in the first half of 1998 subsided in the second half of the year and were reversed in early 1999. Capital inflows stabilized in the second half of 1998 with a decline in interest-sensitive inflows offset by higher FDI (Figures 7, 8). The konma depreciated by about 8 percent in early 1999 as the sharp slowdown in export growth became apparent and the interest differential narrowed with the easing of the monetary stance.’ Intervention purchases raised the CNB’s foreign reserves to US$12% billion in September 1998 (equivalent to five months of imports) from US%10 billion at end-1997, but reserves have remained stable since then in the * Net inflation (excluding administered price adjustments and changes in indirect taxes) fell from 8 percent in March 1998 to less than 2 percent in December-well below the CNB target range of Y/2-6% percent-and declined to less than zero in March 1999. 3 Exports (in dollar terms) declined by 3% percent in January-April 1999 (year-on-year). The current account deficit is estimated to have been about 2% percent of GDP (including aircraft imports of about % percent of GDP) in the first quarter of 1999-more than covered by FDI at about 5 percent of GDP.

With the lower current account deficit in 1998 ti~lly financed by FDI, net foreign indebtedness remained broadly unchanged: total external debt amounted to US%24 billion at end-December, equivalent to 44 percent of GDP; of this, one third was short term, equivalent to 40 percent of the banking system’s short-term foreign assets. 11. After fiscal policy was tightened in the second half of 1997, it remained quite tight in 1998 despite the severe downturn in the economy (Table 3; Figure 9). The central government deficit amounted to 1% percent of GDP in 1998 compared with a deficit of % percent of GDP in 1997.4 However, the deficit in the rest ofthe general government was contained at about one-half of the expected level reflecting, inter alia, financing constraints in the local governments. Overall, the general government deficit remained broadly unchanged at about 2 percent of GDP from 1997 to 1998, but with the output gap estimated to have increased by some 5 percentage points in 1998, the structural deficit of the general government was reduced from an estimated 2% percent of GDP in 1997 to only % percent of GDP in 1998. In view of the weak economic activity, Parliament approved a state budget for 1999 with a deticit of 2 percent of GDP (including the impact of the adjustment of income tax brackets agreed in December, estimated to lower revenues by % percent of GDP), implying a deficit of about 3 percent of GDP for the general government. With real GDP growth of 1% percent assumed in the budget, the structural deficit would increase slightly, by % percent of GDP, to 1 percent of GDP. 12. The monetary policy stance was kept tight during most of 1998, but was eased significantly beginning in the last quarter and into 1999 (Figure 10). The level of interest rates was left unchanged during the first half of the year to stem contagion pressures from the international financial crisis, but this also reflected political uncertainty related to the June elections and the attempt to establish the credibility of the new inflation targeting framework. However, with real interest rates rising and the exchange rate appreciating from early 1998, monetary conditions tightened substantially. The policy stance was eased slightly in the third quarter, with modest interest rate cuts broadly in line with the decline in inflation. This cautious approach reflected a balance between the concerns caused by mounting evidence of a sharp slowdown in the economy and the uncertainty related to the Russian crisis and the fiscal intentions of the new government. However, as it became clear that inflation would stay well within target and that the economy was in a severe recession, interest rates were then cut more aggressively 4 The budget for 1998 was balanced; the worse-than-expected outturn reflected mainly higher-than-budgeted expenditures, as revenues in the budget had been conservatively estimated and compensated for the lower economic activity.

On the structural front, the deteriorating tinancial condition of banks and enterprises was brought out into the open in 1998. This reflected the tight monetary conditions, which worsened the cash flow of highly indebted enterprises, with the recession compounding the problems. Furthermore, the major banks’ willingness to lend was affected by a tightening of the legal and regulatory Framework, including stricter capital adequacy regulations and provisioning requirements, and the planned privatization of the state-controlled banks. These factors led to a sharp deceleration in the growth of bank credit to enterprises and households to 3 percent in the 12 months to March 1999 from 8 percent a year earlier after adjustment for special factors (Table 4). A large number of medium-sized and large companies have not been adequately restructured and are excessively indebted, owing to poor corporate governance and weak lending policies by the state-controlled banks. Several of these companies have been brought to the verge of collapse, and bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against some ofthe large industrial conglomerates in 1998. At the same time, the enterprise sector includes a small number of large, well-performing firms-typically linked with foreign investment/ownership and producing for export to the EU, and a substantial number of medium-sized and small firms doing well, thanks to linkages to the leading companies or foreign manufacturers. This makes the available aggregate data difficult to interpret, but even these data point to low and declining basic earning power, profit margins, and returns to equity, as well as increasing indebtedness and over-reliance on short-term debt (see Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper for a discussion of financial performance and corporate governance in the enterprise sector). DX P~LI~YDECUSSIONS 14. The discussions focused on the reasons for the current crisis and the key challenge facing the authorities at the current juncture: how to stop the deterioration in the economic situation and foster a recovery while consolidating the gains in external adjustment and disinflation, thereby maintaining confidence in a difftcult external environment. In this context, significant attention was devoted to medium-term structural issues. The authorities agreed that the main factor behind the current crisis was the lack of effective privatization and restructuring in the economy, but that fiscal and monetary policies might also have been kept too tight through most of 1998. The statf noted that in recent years it had consistently pointed out the urgent need to address the structural problems in the economy, but acknowledged that-while the 5 Since July 1998, interest rates have been cut in 12 rounds by a total of more than 8 percentage points, to just under 7 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - reaction of consumers and investors to the crisis had been much sharper than might have been expected-it had been slow in recognizing the need to ease macroeconomic policies. 15. There was now a broad consensus that a less stringent macroeconomic policy stance was needed to provide a boost to aggregate demand and bring a turnaround in economic activity, but that boosting demand in the economy needed to he combined with a strengthening of the supply side to ensure that future growth would be sustainable. The staff welcomed the recent easing of monetary and fiscal policy, but noted that to lock in progress on inflation, nominal wage claims needed to decelerate faster than they had to date. However, it agreed with the authorities that the worsening labor market situation and financial condition of enterprises should help moderate wage pressures. Moreover, the authorities and staff shared the view that addressing the serious structural problems in the economy was key to avoiding the resurgence of macroeconomic imbalances. Structural reforms were required not only in the banking and enterprise sectors, but also in the legal and institutional framework to ensure proper governance and incentives for conducting business in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, medium-term fiscal reform was needed to prevent the structural problems in the budget from undermining stability as the economy recovered. A. Macroeconomic Prospects and Policies for 1999 16. The authorities and statf agreed that while the recent easing of monetary and fiscal policy should hdp stabilize the economic situation in 1999, the recovery would be slow. Consumer confidence is likely to remain subdued, given the rapidly deteriorating labor market situation; the ongoing credit crunch will persist in the coming months, as the weak financial situation of many enterprises will discourage the extension of new credit and banks continue to strengthen their balance sheets ahead of the planned privatization; and exports will continue to be affected by the slowdown in growth in Germany and other main trading partners. The staff expects the economy to turn around over the course of 1999, but projects real GDP to be flat at best for the year. Net inflation may pick up somewhat in the second half of the year as a result of the recent depreciation of the exchange rate, but it should remain below 4 percent for end-1999. CPI inflation would be at roughly the same level. The external current account deficit should decline Rnther, to about 1% percent of GDP. The authorities broadly concurred with this assessment, although they were slightly more pessimistic regarding growth and inflation prospects. Private sector analysts generally shared the staffs and the authorities’ assessment of the macroeconomic outlook. 17. There was broad consensus that the main stimuli to economic activity would come from private consumption and government expenditure. Private consumption should grow slightly as a result of a rise in real income, but the household savings ratio Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- would likely rise further, reflecting the increasingly uncertain job prospects6 Nominal wage growth in the economy could be about 9 percent judging from concluded wage negotiations (see above), but with unemployment expected to rise to almost 11 percent by end-1999, the growth in the nominal wage bill would be contained at about 6 percent. Administered price adjustments would be limited in 1999 and would add only 1% percentage points to end-period inflation, with CPI inflation averaging only 3-4 percent and the real wage bill thus rising by 2-3 percent. The budget would provide some stimulus to domestic demand, mainly through public investment. Private investment, on the other hand, would continue contracting as a result of the credit crunch and low profitability, which would likely outweigh the impact of lower real interest rates and a more competitive exchange rate. 18. Contrary to the situation in 1998, net foreign demand was not expected to provide any significant stimulus to growth in 1999. As noted above, export growth had already slowed sharply, and the boost to exports in early 1998 from significant new investment projects coming on stream was unlikely to be repeated this year. However, the depreciation of the koruna in early 1999 and expected gradual recovery in Europe should improve export performance later in the year. At the same time, import growth would slow dramatically, owing to the continued weak domestic demand and slowdown in exports, With the terms of trade projected to be broadly unchanged, the current account could register a Rnther, albeit small, improvement. 19. The current account deficit should be easily financeable since foreign direct investment was expected to remain above 4 percent of GDP, assuming continued moderate inflows of privatization revenue from abroad.’ Despite a downgrading of the Czech Republic by the major rating agencies in late 1998, the ratings remain among the highest in the region. Moreover, external borrowing spreads are still low, medium- and long-term debt-service obligations are modest, and offtcial reserves are ample. On the other hand, if contidence were to suddenly disappear, there could potentially be significant capital outflows related to problems with rolling over short-term debt, withdrawal of portfolio investments, or capital flight from domestic sources. On balance, however, external vulnerability appears limited, although somewhat less favorable than, for example, Poland but broadly similar to Hungary and better than in many other emerging markets. The current account deficit is expected to remain moderate, FDI should continue to be buoyant, the CNB’s reserves cover the stock of short-term debt by 6 Subsequent to the mission, retail sales data for March 1999 provided an early, albeit uncertain, signal that private consumption had bottomed out. ’ PDI inflows could be even higher with privatization of banks and regional utility companies.

Wage developments remained a source of concern. The authorities, including the CND, had been engaged in discussions with social partners, but while unions had accepted the need for no real wage increases they had not been convinced of the low inflation prospects for 1999 and no agreement on incomes policy had been reached. The staff expressed concern about the slow response of wage developments to the decline in inflation and noted that the outlook for 1999 remained uncertain. The authorities agreed that there had been delays in adjusting inflationary expectations to the rapid decline in inflation, but looking ahead, they believed that the marked weakening in the labor market and financial problems in the enterprise sector would help contain wage pressures in 1999 and limit growth in the real wage bill to a few percentage points at most. The staff indicated that the large wage increases in the government sector and the railways in 1999 had sent a poor signal to the enterprise sector, and that in 2000 it would be essential for the government to insist that wage increases in state-controlled enterprises and the government sector not exceed expected inflation. It would also be necessary to ensure sufftcient wage differentiation between enterprises that were performing well and those that were not. The staff argued that wage moderation would facilitate further monetary easing and improve external competitiveness while avoiding a resurgence of inflationary pressures as aggregate demand recovered. 21. The authorities explained that the central government budget for 1999 was oriented toward stimulating economic growth. Notably, capital expenditures-which had been severely curtailed in recent years-had been augmented, especially in the areas of infrastructure/transportation and housing. Furthermore, the economic downturn was putting pressures on social transfers, and the government had also felt it was necessary to cushion the impact of the recession on the enterprise sector (notably railways, mining, and agriculture) through higher subsidies and to provide additional support to exporters. On the revenue side, corporate income taxes were affected by the increase in the limit on investments in tangible assets, which could be immediately written off (in effect from July 1998) and the accelerated depreciation schedule for real estate and machinery approved subsequent to the budget. The staff fully supported the need for the budget to help address the weak economic situation, but noted that it would have preferred a huther reorientation of expenditure toward productive capital projects rather than increasing transfers to enterprises which could slow the required restructuring in the economy. 22. The authorities acknowledged that the fiscal deficit was likely to be higher than budgeted because of the weaker-than-expected economic activity, but they were uneasy about allowing automatic stabilizers to play fully. This reflected a * Defined as the stock of short-term debt outstanding (US% 8.5 billion at end-1998) and principal on medium- and long-term debt falling due (USIE4.3 billion in 1999).

As a result, the government had restricted nonmandatory expenditures to 45 percent of the budgeted level in the first half of 1999, and the state budget had been in surplus in the first quarter, Given the severity of the recession, the staff argued that the authorities should allow the automatic stabilizers to operate and refrain from increasing taxes or cutting expenditures in 1999, but emphasized that accepting a significant increase in the deficit in 1999 added force to the need for developing a medium-term consolidation plan. It estimated that the fiscal deficit could reach 4 percent of GDP in 1999 (excluding restructuring costs and privatization revenues), in line with the authorities’ revised “passive” projections.’ About one half of the increase in the deficit from 1998 would be the result of stimulative discretionary actions included in the budget. The staff cautioned that any slippage above this level should be offset to sustain the external adjustment and noted that the budget for next year should be conceived within a framework that not only took account of growth prospects but also began reducing the structural deficit. With output growth projected to recover to about 1% percent in 2000, the fiscal deficit should be reduced to about 3% percent of GDP implying an estimated need for measures of about 1 percent of GDP. In the event that the expected recovery fails to materialize, one would need to consider allowing a slightly higher deficit. 23. The authorities were generally of the opinion that monetary policy had been eased as much as possible to help address the recession while being consistent with the inflation target, although there could be some small room for additional cuts in interest rates. While acknowledging that it was very difficult to forecast inflation in the current environment, where the weakness of the economy could alter relationships observed in the past, the CNB believed that the current stance of monetary policy was consistent with both the short-term inflation target for end-1999 of 4-5 percent and the end-2000 inflation target of 3%5% percent, although inflation could go somewhat higher in early 2000. The room to cut interest rates was circumscribed by the temporary factors depressing inflation, and the need to maintain some margin over euro-area rates. The CNl3 was satisfied with the depreciation of the koruna and viewed the current level of about CZK 38 per euro as broadly appropriate. The staff argued that the CNB should not be too concerned with the short-term outlook for inflation, over which it had little control, and that it should set interest rates to the lowest level consistent with the medium- term inflation target. It noted that there could be room for some further easing, as no significant inflationary pressures were currently evident in the economy and the large increase in the out on core inflation. ,f ut gap and unemployment was likely to put more downward pressure While there was no clear evidence that the exchange rate was overvalued, the staff argued that uncertainty about the adequacy of external 9 Higher than budgeted privatization revenues would be used to finance the budget deficit and required capital injections in the banking sector. lo In the event, the CNB reduced interest rates on May 3 by 30 basis points Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - competitiveness made some further depreciation of the koruna desirable to support a recovery in exports and enhance growth prospects (Box 1). On the other hand, the staff pointed out that an appreciation would have deleterious effects on the economy and that any significant upward pressures on the exchange rate (potentially arising from substantial foreign direct investment inflows related in part to the planned privatizations) should be resisted through sterilized intervention or possibly additional interest rate cuts to the extent that this could credibly be viewed as consistent with the medium-term inflation objective.” B. Bank and Enterprise Restructuring 24. Despite some progress in recent years in improving corporate governance and the financial system, the economy remained burdened by m weak banking sector, by the continued existence of many large, inefficient, and excessively indebted industrial corporations, and by an inadequate, cumbersome, legal and institutional system. The authorities realized that these problems were at the heart of the current economic malaise, and that this legacy had to be cleared if an efficient financial and industrial system were to be reconstructed and confidence from domestic and international investors restored. On this background, they had accelerated the process of privatizing the state-controlled banks and approved a schedule for selling the nonbank strategic enterprises as well as a plan for revitalizing the enterprise sector. Meanwhile, steps had been taken to improve capital market regulation and a plan was being drawn up to strengthen the legal and institutional framework. 25. In the Czech Republic, the widespread use of voucher privatization had created particular governance problems. Although secondary trading had led to a progressive concentration of ownership, generally considered good for corporate governance, the investment funds that ended up holding most of the vouchers had turned out in many cases to exercise very poor oversight. The liberal licensing and enforcement framework had likely contributed to a proliferation of poorly supervised investment funds. Insider deals and fraudulent transactions had flourished, to the detriment of minority shareholders and the reputation of the Czech capital market. In many enterprises, the old management has not been replaced and incentives had been distorted by significant employee ownership in the enterprise. ” The virtual breakdown of the credit channel of monetary policy-with financially troubled and poorly governed enterprises unable to obtain new credits-and general uncertainty regarding the medium-term inflation outlook, provided some room for flexibility.

Czech Republic-Competitiveness The level of competitiveness is assessed here on the basis of trends in real exchange rate indices based on relative prices and costs, market share developments, as well as a forward looking view of a sustainable current account deficit. It is hard to judge which past period provides a good benchmark for comparing the cwrent level of competitiveness. Comparisons here are made against the situation prevailing in early 1996 before the onset of the external diseqailibtiotn that was ultimately manifested in the 1997 currency crisis. Following the sizeable depreciation of the nominal exchange rate in early 1999, the CPI and PPI based real effective exchange rate indices are at levels somewhat more appreciated than those prevailing in early 1996 (Figure 6). The CPI-based measure is a&&d by taxes, as well as prices of consumption impoti and non- traded goods, while the PPI-based measure makes no allowance for productivity. Hence a real exchange rate index defined in terms of relative unit labor costs (ULC’s) is also considered, with manufachning used as a proxy for the traded goods sector. Developments in relative ULC’s have been less favorable reflecting continued strong wage growth as well as falling labor productivity, such that the ULC-based real effective exchange late remains well above levels in early 1996. However, part of the recent decline in labor productivity is related to the current cyclical position. Oo the other hand, methodological problems may overstate the mcasoremcnt of productivity gains. For example, relative ULC’s are based ongross output in Czech industry which probably grew faster than enterprise value added as cash profitability has fallen while accmed losses have probably been rising, as reflected in the increase in bad bank debt. The recent slowdown in export growth mainly reflects the weakening of demand in Western Europe during 1998, illustrated by the fact that Czech export market shares in the European Union-indeed with the rest of the world-were not eroded and have in fact increased substantially when compared with shares in early 1996 (Figure 12). Further, compared with key competitors from the Visegrad cotmtrics, Czech market penetration in the EU has remained unchanged, suggesting again no change in the relative competitive position from that prevailing in early 1996. However, a lack of information makes it di&ttlt to assess the extent to which Czech export market shares are buoyed by exports from loss-making entetprises, which would not reflect a better competitive position. Thus it remains hard to make a judgement on the adequacy of competitiveness based on the current levels of real exchange rate indices and recent trends in market shares. Ultimately, the assessment hinges on the balance of payments outlook. Recent developments have contributed to a substantial adjustment in the extemal cwrent account deficit which fell to less than 2 percent of GDP in 1998. However. adjusting for the cyclical position relative to tmding partners as well as lagged effects of changes in the real exchange rate, the underlying current account deficit could be as high as about 4 percent of GDP. This is consistent with the medium-tetm balance of payments projection which assumes gradual closure of the output gap led by investment, restoring internal equilibrium. While the envisaged level of the current account deficit may appear slightly on the high side, it should be sostaioable given the prospects for substantial foreign direct investment as stmchual reforms gtadualIy translate into a higher rate of retom on capital. Thus, while available evidence does not suggest an obvious problem with competitiveness, the margin for error remains high, and the issue should remain under SCrUti”Y.

Since 1996, the authorities have taken several steps to improve the legislative and regulatory framework with the objective of improving corporate governance, hut several shortcomings remain.” Amendments to the Commercial Code and the Investment Fund Act strengthened the protection of minority shareholders and corporate disclosure rules, while aiming as well to improve the accountability of fund managers. The establishment of an independent Securities Commission in April 1998 constituted an important step toward better enforcement of regulation in the Czech capital market. However, the protection of minority shareholders remains weak in some areas and enforcement of existing laws and regulations is still an area of concern. The staff noted that the Securities Commission should be allowed the same type of regulatory powers enjoyed by similar bodies abroad. It also noted that improvements in the bankruptcy and foreclosure laws were proceeding very slowly (Box 2)” In addition, there was a widespread belief in academic and financial circles that a significant strengthening of the legal and institutional framework more generally and the enforcement of existing laws were needed to improve the environment for conducting business in the Czech Republic. This stretched from ordinary regulatory and administrative activities to the judicial and court procedures, which are often cumbersome and nontransparent. 27. Following repeated delays since the mid-1990s, the hank privatization process had been accelerated significantly over the past year, with a clear policy emerging of introducing foreign capital and expertise. In 1998, a controlling interest in IPB (one of the four large state-controlled banks) was sold to a foreign investment bank, and in late May 1999 the government announced the sale of its 66 percent share in the CSOB to Belgian KBC.14 The remaining two state-controlled banks (Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni Banka) were scheduled for sale by early 2000. However, the statT noted that this could be more difficult as the financial position of the banks remained uncertain and the government had yet to establish a clear policy regarding balance sheet improvement prior to the sale.” A tight deadline for the privatization of the remaining institutions would help avoid any further deterioration of the banks’ assets and, in time, allow the institutions to resume normal intermediation functions. The staff urged the ” World Bank: “Czech Republic: Capital Markets Review,” May 1999. l3 Subsequent to the mission, LEG has discussed the nature of the problems in the bankruptcy system and a possible framework for reform in this area with the Czech authorities and may follow up with technical assistance if this is requested. I4 The KBC also made an indicative bid at the same price per share for the 24 percent shareholding in the CSOB held by the Slovak National Bank. Is However, the recent issuance of an initiating memorandum for the sale of CS attests to the authorities’ commitment to the tight deadline. Also, the government has approved a CZK IO billion capital increase for KB. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - Box 2. The Bankruptcy Framework in the Czech Republic The Czech Bankruptcy Act was initially enacted in 1992 and amended ten times since then. Since 1992, there has been a steady increase in the number of filings, reaching over 4000 in 1998. However, bankruptcy procedures are very slow and more than half of the cases are still pending. As a result, many view bankruptcy as a last resort aimed at liquidation rather than as a process of financial and corporate restructuring. Few, if any, large enterprises have gone through bankruptcy despite severe financial difficulties. The bankruptcy process is initiated by the filing of a petition with the court. However, the court has substantial discretion in issuing a bankruptcy order and it is not unusual for there to be a delay of up to one year before the court accepts the petition. In principle, the petition can be for liquidation or settlement (called “composition”). However, mainly because of the long delays involved (and the di&ulty in obtaining injunctions or restraining orders that would ensure that there would be some remaining assets) there have in fact been no cases of court-supervised settlement since 1992. In addition, while in the absence of any cases this has not been tested, some observers point to potential weaknesses in the law governing composition, such as the requirement that the debtor satisfy the court that a minimum proportion of liabilities will be able to be repaid. ’ By all accounts, the most important bottleneck has been the weakness of the Czech court system. An emphasis on form over substance often compounds the already long delays and the absence of case law makes the outcome of any court procedure extremely uncertain. Moreover, there is a wide-spread lack of expertise in financial matters that has stymied a rapid and efficient bankruptcy process. In particular, the court-appointed administrators-while not civil servants, but typically private sector lawyers-often lack both experience and, more importantly, the incentive to ensure an efficient bankruptcy process as their remuneration is determined principally by the duration of their involvement rather than the size of the recovery. Unlike in some other countries, the creditors have no say in the appointment of the administrator. Ideally, the bankruptcy framework would encourage a substantial number of out-of-court settlements in the shadow of bankruptcy, quite common in some countries. This option exists and has been used in the Czech Republic-on a purely contractual basis. To encourage more recourse to out-of-court settlements, two factors are of critical importance. First, there should be no legal or tax barriers to seeking an out-of-court work-out. Current Czech tax law, for example, treats a debt write-down as a taxable receipt by the debtor. Second, most importantly, the threat of bankruptcy as an alternative should be credible and enforceable. This will require a strengthening of the legal framework for bankruptcy and steps to improve the functioning of the court system. Following examples in other countries, the creation of specialist bankruptcy courts may be an attractive option. ‘Czech Republic-Capital Markets Review, A World Bank Country Study, May 1999 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- government to expeditiously review the banks’ portfolios and decide on an appropriate strategy for restructuring the banks prior to privatization. In this process, the authorities should ensure that any balance sheet clean-up or capital injections reflected the true value of the assets (Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Paper elaborates on banking system issues). 28. Banking sector restructuring needed to be supported by an appropriate regulatory and supervisory environment. Over the past couple of years significant progress had been made in adapting the prudential and supervisory framework to EU norms and BIS standards. Remaining areas for additional action included establishing rules and legal provisions that would allow for consolidated supervision and require incorporating market risk in capital adequacy calculations. The recent decision by the CNB (to be phased in over a period of three years) to prohibit the deduction of real estate collateral from required provisions was made in response to the difftculties experienced by banks in realizing collateral. While costly for banks, as it would require significant additional accumulation of capital, staff noted that the decision was an appropriate supervisory reaction pending improvements to the legal standing of creditors, 29. In April 1999, the Czech government announced an Industrial Revitalization Program aimed at addressing the difficult situation faced by many of the traditional Czech manufacturing enterprises. Many of these enterprises were privatized (wholly or in majority part) during the two waves of voucher privatization in the first half of the 1990s. Most of these large or medium-sized enterprises were inadequately restructured and had been kept afloat by rolling over credits from state-controlled banks. Hence most of them had become excessively indebted. The centerpiece of the program was the establishment of a Revitalization Agency, to be operated as a private equity fund, which would take majority stakes in enterprises in exchange for (nonperforming) bank debt (Box 3). However, while objective qualification criteria had been established, no enterprise would automatically be entitled to participate: the final decision would lie with the administrator of the RA-an internationally reputed.investment bank. 30. The statTnoted that the success of the program would be contingent on a number of conditions. The key advantage of the program was that it could allow a rapid, but orderly restructuring of (parts of) viable industrial enterprises and their divestment to foreign strategic investors-a process that was currently stymied by the absence of a well- functioning bankruptcy process. However, there were considerable risks. First and foremost, the staff noted that it would work only if it were free from political interference. If the RA were compelled to take over inherently unviable enterprises that it was unable to sell, the economic cost of prolonged state ownership could be substantial. Second, the incentives for the manager/administrator of the RA needed to be set judiciously, maximizing the likelihood that it would pursue a rapid and efftcient divestment process; there should be no advantage to the RA of clinging to enterprises in its portfolio. Finally, the revitalization program should not be viewed as a substitute for an effective bankruptcy process. Many enterprises that would not be selected by the RA Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- Box 3. The Industrial Revitalization Plan The first step in the Industrial Revitalisation Plan is the creation of a Revitaliiation Agency @A), which would be set up as a joint stock company with an initial capital of CZK 100 million. Initially, it would be fidly- owned subsidiary of the Consolidation Bank SOB), the public sector work-out bank established in 1991. Others will be invited to hold stock in the RA by providiig additional capital, in particular the administrator of the RA (see below) and, if they wish, domestic creditor banks. The objective is to reduce KoB holdings in the RA to below 50 percent, while remainin g above 34 percent. The structure of the RA comprises three main bodies: a five-member Board of Directors (in which the administrator is likely to have a majority), a nine-member Investment Committee (which, in addition to the members of the Board, would include representatives of other involved parties such as domestic commercial banks and possibly EBRD and IFC); and a Supervisory Board, which has the responsibility to conduct broad oversight over the operations of the RA, comprising representatives from the public sector and chaired by the Minister of Industry and Trade). The second step consists in the preliminary selection of the RA’s portfolio. according to four criteria: . Employment of a selected enterprise must be at least 2000 . Purchases from local suppliers must exceed CZK 1 billion annually . The amount of classified loans must exceed CZK 3 billion . Enterprises must have a positive EBIT (earnings before interest and tax), based on the 1998 results of the principal firm (excluding subsidiaries) Meeting three of the four criteria would qualify an enterprise for selection; however, qualification does not mean selection. It is estimated that some 3C-35 enterprises meet at least three of the criteria, representing some 1 S-20 percent of industrial production. Final seleclion would be the responsibility of the Board of the RA. The third step is the selection of the administrator. It is envisaged that the administrator of the RA would be *an internationally-respected investment bank. A tender will be launched by KoB by June. The precise conditions of the contract (remuneration; incentives) are still under discussion. The fourth step is the final selection of the Portfolio. The selection must be consistent with the principles of the Czech Republic’s industrial policy andbank privalization strategy, but the Board of Directors of the RA makes the final decision regarding which enterprise debts to take over. The authorities did not expect more than lo-15 enterprises to be selected for the program. The price at which the debts are transferred is to be determined by an independent auditor on the basis of a detailed examination of the value of the enterprise. It is expected that in most cases, the RA will make its decision on purely commercial considerations. However, in selected cases the government could extend guarantees for new loans to the RA to allow it to finance certain take-avers, not exceeding 50 percent of the principal of the loans. The key criterion for the RA is likely to be the viability of the enterprise and the speed with which it can be divested to a foreign strategic investor. Current shareholders in the enterprises will need to be convinced to concnr with the debt-equity swap. The threat of bankruptcy, if credible, should be a powerful incentive. In addition, it is possible that current shareholders could maintain some stake in the enterprises, albeit a minority holding. The final step before divRsUnenl is the frnancipl and orgaoizstionnl m.vtructuring of the ente@ses. Jr is likely that prior to sale, considerable financial and orgsnizational restructuring will need to take place. The target is to plan and implement the restructuring for the selected enterprises within 6-12 months. Their divestment could be rapid; but at the outer limit could take until January 1,2003, the target date for EU accession. Social support mechanisms, including active employment and retraining programs, will be used to cushion the social impact of restructuring.

Rapid improvements in both the bankruptcy law and the surrounding judicial procedures were vital to this process. 31. The authorities approved in late 1998 a schedule for privatizing most of the nonbank strategic enterprises by 2001-02. These included telecommunications, energy generation and distribution, and several manufacturing companies. The staff noted that concrete plans for implementing the divestment program remained to be formulated and urged the authorities to accelerate the sale of both strategic enterprises and the many stakes in smaller companies. It stressed that this would improve corporate governance and efficiency required to compete in the EU, and also send a strong signal of the authorities’ commitment to the privatization process in relation to the bank and enterprise restructuring programs. The authorities confirmed their intention to complete the price deregulation process by 2002; the staff urged the authorities to announce a schedule for completing this process. C. Medium-Term Economic and Fiscal Strategy 32. The key objective of the authorities over the medium term is to prepare the Czech economy for accession to the EU by 2003. The progress report issued by the EU in November 1998 was very critical of the Czech Re ,c? ublic’s efforts thus far, and this has served to focus attention on what needs to be done. The authorities were in the process of preparing a medium-term economic and fiscal strategy as part of EU accession discussions (joint assessment), with medium-term fiscal projections also required as part of next year’s budget, However, the authorities had not yet defined clear macroeconomic goals and a comprehensive policy strategy consistent with such goals. In general, they saw 1999-2000 as a period to undertake necessary and overdue restructuring of the economy, which could lay the basis for high rates of growth from 2001. There had not been much discussion of external objectives-with the current account deficit reduced to a low level and not expected to increase significantly, and FDI more than covering the deficit and expected to remain strong, this did not appear to be much of a concern. 33. The CNB had prepared a medium-term monetary strategy for discussion with the government. Under this proposal, the inflation targeting approach would be continued, with the objective of reducing net inflation by about l/2 percentage point per year to I-3 percent by 2005. This was based on the expectation that the country would join the EU in 2003-05 and that entry into the single currency could come soon after that. Given the openness of the Czech economy and its geographical proximity to low- inflation EU members, the CNB believed that sustained high inflation and consequent I6 In addition to the inadequate progress with bank and enterprise restructuring, the EU pointed to the slow pace in adopting the acquis communautaire, notably in the areas of institutional and administrative capacity, internal market, justice, and home affairs, and the environment.

While the government shared this view, it believed that the CNB’s medium-term inflation objective was on the ambitious side.” 34. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy was not yet clear. They were very worried about the medium-term fiscal outlook, with their preliminary projections based on current policies indicating very large fiscal deficits of about 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, even excluding potential additional costs related to the EU accession process. The authorities were also concerned about the longer term financial viability of the pension system. However, there was considerable uncertainty as to what would be a sustainable and acceptable level of deficit and how the required adjustment would be achieved. The government favored shifting the burden of taxation from direct to indirect taxes, but was committed to not raising the overall tax burden-thus recognizing that the adjustment would need to be found mainly on the expenditure side. 35. The staff agreed that the medium-term macroeconomic objectives should be focused on achieving a marked acceleration in economic growth, while maintaining a prudent and sustainable current account deficit and converging toward EU inflation levels. Under favorable conditions created by speeding up and deepening the structural reform process, this could imply a current account deficit of about 3 percent of GDP, largely covered by FDI. Inflation could be a few percentage points higher than in the EU, which, with relatively rapid productivity growth in the tradable goods sector, could be consistent with a stable nominal exchange rate vis-A-vis the euro. Nevertheless, given uncertainties related to the potential effects of structural changes on the real exchange rate, staff noted that the authorities should refrain from any premature fixity of the nominal exchange rate. It also stressed that the government should aim for complying with the Maastricht fiscal criteria in the run-up to EU accession (although this was not a formal requirement) and eventually for a balanced fiscal position in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact. 36. The staff presented an illustrative medium-term scenario based on the assumption of prudent macroeconomic policies-including measures to contain the underlying fiscal imbalance-and wage moderation, as well as vigorous pursuit of the structural reform process (Table 6). While the recovery would likely be relatively slow, it could gain momentum from 2001, and relatively high growth rates of 4-5 percent should be achievable over the medium term as the output gap is closed and the supply I7 Subsequent to the mission, the authorities agreed on the key objectives for 200042: real GDP growth would rise from 1% percent in 2000 to 3% percent in 2002, while CPI inflation would decline from 6 percent to 5 percent (implying about 3% percent for net inflation given plans for price deregulation). This is in line with the CNB’s medium-term monetary strategy. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - side of the economy strengthened.” The recovery could be driven mainly by private investment, with the growth in private consumption contained by the moderate real wage growth needed to consolidate the adjustment gains and underpin a shift in income from labor to capital. Export growth should recover as market conditions improve, new FDI projects come on stream, and competitiveness is improved. This scenario is consistent with a stabilization of the current account deficit at about 3 percent of GDP, with debt and debt-service ratios declining gradually over the medium term. The main risk is that bank and enterprise restructuring will be delayed, leading to continued ineffIciencies in resource allocation, output losses, and increasing unemployment, which would also jeopardize the fiscal adjustment. Further risks relate to the uncertain prospects for recovery in Europe and for wage moderation, which could undermine the potential for investment and export-led growth and progress with reducing inflation, resulting potentially in renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange market and tightening of policies to maintain stability. 37. The staff worked with the authorities to analyze the medium-term outlook for the public finances (Box 4 and Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues Paper). Under current policies, and without any EU-related expenditures, the fiscal deficit would remain at about 4 percent of GDP over the medium term (the authorities’ projections were even more unfavorable given their lower growth and higher inflation assumptions). This is the result of the structural weaknesses in the budget, notably the large share of and mounting pressures from mandatory expenditures and the low buoyancy of the tax system arising from, inter alia, the use of specific excises on many goods. Taking account of additional EU-related expenditures and costs associated with contingent liabilities,lg the deficit would rise to more than 6 percent of GDP, and could be even higher, owing to potentially significant bank and enterprise restructuring costs. The staff urged the authorities to develop a strategy aimed at containing the deficit at a sustainable level consistent with the macroeconomic framework, without increasing the overall tax burden. Moreover, there was a need to reduce the high income tax rates by shifting to greater reliance on indirect taxes consistent with EU harmonization. Preliminary staff estimates suggest tha! shifting goods to the high VAT rate and increasing excises while containing subsidies to enterprises and mandatory transfer programs could reduce the deficit to moderate levels I8 Specifically, the output gap (projected at about 6 percent in 1999) is assumed to be closed by 2003, with potential output growth trending upward from 2000 and reaching about 4 percent as investment recovers and structural reforms take hold. I9 The expected present value of contingent liabilities is estimated to be about 15 percent of GDP, which is assumed to be securitized at end-1999.

Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Since the early 199Os, the fiscal position of the general government has deteriorated although the deficits have not been substantial and debt has been modest, even when accounting for what is described as “hidden liabilities.” As the Czech Republic prepares for ELJ accession, it must demonstrate control over its fiscal position. I” light of the recent deterioration in the fiscal position described in the the main report, the staff, with the cooperation of the authorities, have constructed several scenarios to gauge the likely trajectory of revenues and expenditures over the medium-term (see background paper for details). The macrccconondc assumptions underlying these scenarios are discussed in the main text (see also Table 6) and for simplicity assumed to be the same in all scenarios. while the nlacroeco”o”lic implications of alternative fiscal strategies could be quite different, there is considerable uncertainty about the size and eve” signs of these effects (depending on e.g. the degree of Ricardian equivalence). The boselinefiscol scenario, which can be character&d as unchanged or passive fiscal policy, assumes that statutory tax rates remain at their current levels, mandatory spending programs grow as determined by current laws. and non-mandatory spending is restrained with real growth in the different categories vatiying between zero and the growth in real output. Even with these fairly optimistic assumptions, the deficit remains at about 4 percent of GDP over the medium-term and only declines to under the 3 percent of GDP Maasbicht reference value by 2006. (The authorities unchanged policy baseline scenario is markedly worse, largely because they assume lower real growth and higher inflation than the statT.) This is the result of the structural problems in the budget with tax revenues tending to decline as a share of GDP and large share of mandatory expendihucs exerting mounting pressures on the budget. More worrisome is that once the staffs baseline scenario is adjusted to include both modest additional infrastruchrre invesmtenf that will likely be necessary both for accession to the EU and to sustain growth, as well as the cost of the conttngent liabilities (estimated at about I5 percent of GDP; see background paper for details) that are assumed to be secutitizc& the fiscal position deteriorates signiiicantl~e deficit reaches over 6 percent of GDP and debt over 60 percent of GDP, Therefore, the government will need to find ways to improve the budget over the medium-ten” to ensure stability and satisfy EU requirements. While the share of govcnunent spending to GDP compares favorably with other leading transition economies, it is still quite high given the level of per capita income and a” increase in the overall tax burden should be avoided. Although there are a variety of alternative measures that could produce the required savings, the a&mmtent scenario that puts the fiscal position on a path consistent with the medium-term macro framework combines VAT hannonization (certain excise taxes are transferred to the VAT and the 5 percent rated goods are raised to the higher 20 percent rate) with reduced growth in both subsidies to enterprises and several of the mandatory transfer programs such as pensions and health care. It is essential that the govenunent demonstrate the inevitability of reforming these programs and begin implementation now to avoid an unsustainable evolution of deficits and debt, likely preventing the economy from achieving its potential growth fates and thus further exacerbating the fiscal problem. Furthem~ore, as shown in the background paper, there are plausible scenarios that assume less robust growth, as well as less containment over expenditures-partly attributable to EIJ accession-that would imply a significant worsening of the deficit outlook. T’his would argue for eve” more deficit reducing measures. ’ See “Czech Republic: Toward EU Accession,” Country Economic Memorandum (World Bank Draft, June 19991. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - of 2-3 percent of GDP over the medium term.” This could be tolerable given the low level of debt and the favorable external financing prospects. FAD will provide follow-up technical assistance on the medium-term fiscal program. 38. Looking further ahead, the staff shared the authorities’ concern that demographic developments would destabilize the pension system soon after EU accession unless appropriate measures were taken, and noted that now was the best time to make the necessary changes to ensure the sustainability of the pension system. The staff indicated that these measures should include scheduling of an additional increase in retirement ages to take account of changes in life expectancy, improving the actuarial fairness of the early retirement provisions, eliminating the accrual of benefits during periods when people are not in the workforce, lengthening the period for which past earnings are assessed, and indexing pensions solely to inflation. Furthermore, it urged the authorities to strengthen the link between contributions and benefits and to consider partially pre-funding the pension system to spread the burden of retirement financing more equally across generations and to enhance fiscal discipline. D. Other Issues 39. The Czech Republic continues to maintain a highly liberal foreign trade regime, and has improved incentives for attracting foreign direct investment, The government approved an incentive package to promote FDI in the spring of 1998, including cash and tax incentives. Recent modifications have included lowering the minimum threshold for participation and removing the restriction to greenfield investments. 40. The authorities have made progress in improving their data standards, but some deficiencies remain. The authorities have subscribed to the SDDS and posted their metadata on the DDBB, and the timeliness, coverage, and quality of data are generally adequate for surveillance purposes. However, the staff noted that weaknesses remained especially in the areas of the labor market and national accounts. 41. The CNB appeared well prepared to address the potential year 2000 computer problems. It had issued a regulation stipulating the requirements for ensuring safe operation of the banking system with respect to this risk and required banks to ” Subsequent to the mission, the lower house ofParliament approved a tax package raising excises on fuel, cigarettes, and alcohol from July 1, 1999, while lowering direct taxes from 2000 (the corporate tax rate would be lowered from 35 percent to 3 1 percent, the marginal income tax rate would be lowered from 39 percent to 32 percent, and the tax on dividends and capital gains would be lowered from 25 percent to 15 percent). This would increase revenues by about CZK 3 billion in 1999, whereas the impact in 2000-01 would be broadly neutral, according to official preliminary estimates, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - present a strategy for resolving the issue and evaluate progress on a monthly basis. Information pertaining to the year 2000 problem had been posted on the CNE3’s website. ff’-. STAFF h’PRAlSAL 42. The Czech economy is going through a ditlicult phase. The difficulty is deep- rooted-in a lack of banking and enterprise sector restructuring that in time overwhelmed orthodox financial policies and brought the country to the edge of financial crisis. Orthodoxy averted that crisis, but, in tandem with a fundamental reassessment of prospects by both consumers and the banking community, prompted an unexpectedly large downturn. While policies since then have been appropriately relaxed, the authorities nonetheless face the daunting task of effecting structural adjustment at the micro level within a sluggish macro context. This does not augur well for a quick turnaround, but strong growth should resume over the medium term if the authorities are steadfast in finally forcing adjustment on present or ex-state enterprises and banks and in implementing institutional reforms within stability-oriented fiscal and monetary policies. 43. Given the weakness of economic activity, the government should allow automatic stahilizers to operate in 1999, and the CNB should set official short-term interest rates to the lowest level consistent with the medium-term inflation target of 3%-S/i percent for end-2000. While current short-term real interest rates are not high, there could be room for some further easing given the current situation and prospects with no evidence of any significant intlationary pressures in the economy; however, following the most recent cut in interest rates on May 3, this room is probably limited. After the recent correction of the exchange rate, there is no clear evidence that the koruna is overvalued, but given the uncertainty about the level of external competitiveness and worrisome sharp slowdown in export growth, the authorities should be flexible and willing to accept some additional moderate depreciation of the exchange rate if consistent with the inflation target. An appreciation is the last thing the economy needs in the current situation, and any upward pressures on the exchange rate should therefore be resisted, if necessary through buther interest rate cuts to the extent that this could credibly be viewed as consistent with the medium-term inflation objective. 44. Wage moderation would facilitate more monetary easing and also improve the external competitiveness of the economy, hut some concern remains in this area. Wage growth has been slow to respond to the decline in inflation and wage settlements for 1999 appear to have been well in excess of expected inflation. The large wage increases agreed in the government sector and railways for 1999 sent a poor signal to the enterprise sector, and it was not possible to convince unions of the significant decline in inflation that would occur in 1999. While the weakening labor market conditions and increasing financial problems in many enterprises should help contain wage pressures in 1999, it is essential that the government show leadership in the 2000 wage negotiations by limiting wage increases in the government sector and state-controlled enterprises to expected inflation, take fiuther steps to improve corporate governance, and persuade the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - unions that inflation will be low. Further thought could be given to low initial settlements with lagged catch-up clauses. Wage moderation is essential to prevent the recovery of aggregate demand from being followed by a marked rise inflation, necessitating once again a monetary squeeze to re-establish some price stability ahead of EU accession. 45. While the authorities should refrain from taking discretionary measures to contain the fiscal deficit to the level envisaged in the budget for 1999, they should as a matter of urgency develop policy options to address the structural weaknesses in the public finances to ensure stability over the medium term. The budget for 2000 must not only consider the growth prospects but must also be cast within a comprehensive and well-articulated medium-term fiscal strategy that begins the process of reducing the structural deficit. This is not needed simply as part of the EU accession process. It is also required to address the mounting pressures from mandatory expenditure programs, to minimize the risks associated with the large stock of contingent liabilities and bank and enterprise restructuring costs, and to make room for additional expenditures on the environment, infrastructure, and defense. Indeed, the medium-term fiscal outlook is quite worrisome, even after accounting for increased EU transfers and privatization revenues. To put public finances on a sustainable path, it will be necessary to reform the tax system and contain expenditure programs. This could include broadening coverage of the VAT and harmonizing the rate at its highest level as well as containing subsidies to enterprises and transfer programs. It would also be necessary to reform the pension system through raising retirement ages and modifying other parameters to ensure its longer term viability. 46. The process of restructuring the banking and enterprise sectors should he pursued without any delay to improve corporate governance and reconstruct an eficient financial and industrial system. The authorities’ intentions in this regard are most welcome, including the announcement of an ambitious timetable for selling the remaining state-controlled banks and a plan for revitalizing the enterprise sector that both acknowledge the need to bring in strategic foreign investors. However, these plans should be coupled with an accelerated divestment of nonfinancial strategic enterprises and the many stakes in smaller companies. On the bank privatization, the government will need to have a clear view of the value of the banks to assess bids in a timely fashion, and any necessary measures to strengthen the banks’ balance sheets prior to sale should reflect this review. It will also be necessary to support bank privatization with an additional strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory environment, including in the capital market area. Regarding the enterprise revitalization plan, it is crucial that this be implemented as envisaged. Notably, it should be targeted to a limited number of enterprises that are-at least in part-viable, and the program should be strictly time- bound. Enterprises, or parts thereof, for which no buyers can be found, or which are not selected for the program and insolvent, should be liquidated, At the very least, the government should refrain from providing additional subsidies to the enterprise sector. 47. It is therefore necessary to speed up the preparation of an efFective foreclosure and bankruptcy system. More generally, far-reaching reforms to the legal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39- and institutional framework and improved enforcement of existing laws regulating economic activity are needed to ensure proper business incentives. This stretches from ordinary regulatory and administrative activities to the judicial and court procedures, which are often cumbersome and nontransparent. 48. In sum, the Czech Republic faces large challenges in the period ahead as it seeks to lay the foundation for high sustainable growth over the medium term and advances preparations for EU accession down the road. Prudent financial policies need to be continued and there is no time to lose in addressing the deep-rooted structural problems in the economy. 49. The authorities’ subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard is welcome. However, while the timeliness, coverage, and quality of data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, the staff strongly encourages the authorities to improve their statistical base in a number of areas, including not least the labor market and national accounts, 50. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a basket of two currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996, the Czech National Bank widened the exchange rate band from *to.5 percent to +I.5 percent around the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. On June 1, 1999, the exchange rate ofthe Czech koruna stood at CZK 36.01 per U.S. dollar.

The Czech Republic became a member of the World Bank on January 1, 1993, by joint succession with the Slovak Republic to the membership of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. 2. A Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) of US.8450 million, concluded in June 1991 with Czechoslovakia, has been fully disbursed. The Czech and Slovak Republics have assumed repayment obligations in the ratio of 2: 1. The SAL was cotinanced by the Japanese Export- Import Bank in the amount of US%200 million. A Power and Environmental Improvement Loan of US$246 million was assumed completely by the Czech Republic, of which US$49 million remains undisbursed, as of May 1999. 3. In April 1996, the Czech Republic paid the outstanding balance (US$10.3 million) of a telecommunications loan approved by the World Bank for US$80 million in September 1993. The government continues to pursue a very prudent borrowing strategy thereby limiting its recourse to credits from international financial institutions, including the World Bank. 4. The Banks renewed program with the Czech Republic includes several analytical pieces as well as technical assistance: A Capital Market Report was completed (in red cover) in June 1999; an EU-focused Country Economic Memorandum, the first for the Czech Republic, will be discussed with the government in June 1999; technical assistance in the area of quality of fiscal adjustment, focused on contingent liabilities and fiscal sustainability framework, was provided during 1998-99; support to the National Energy Efftciency Study was also provided in 1998. Work on EU related environmental issues (water) is being done with the cross support from EU member states. 5. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has made loans and equity investments in industrial and financial companies. Total IFC outstanding gross commitments by March 1999 amounted to US.8412.38 million. The IFC has also provided advisory assistance in a number of privatization deals. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has two outstanding investment guarantees in the energy sector amounting to US$30.4 million..

Data on core surveillance variables are provided to the Fund regularly and with minimal lags (reporting to STA is less current, especially for foreign trade and the national accounts). Information on exchange rates, basic interest rates, and gross and net international reserves are reported on a daily basis within 2-3 weeks. Data on consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, interest rates, central government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade are provided monthly with a lag of 2-6 weeks. Final monetary survey data are available with a lag of about 2 months. GDP and balance of payments data are made available on a quarterly basis with a lag of 2-3 months. Annual data published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover all operations of the general government, including the extrabudgetary funds excluded from the monthly data. These annual data are available on a timely basis. Monthly fiscal data published in IFS cover central and local budget accounts and are available with a 2-3 month lag. All data are promptly released by the Czech authorities to news services and also published regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications as well as being posted on the internet. Information on exchange rates and basic interest rates is available daily through Reuters and Bloomberg. The quality of financial variables is high, improvements have been made in the processing of foreign trade statistics, but national accounts data suffer from a number of weaknesses. 2. In the national accounts, the value added in the small-scale private sector is likely to be underestimated as the mechanisms for collection of data on this sector are not yet fully developed. It is also believed that a large volume of unrecorded activity stems from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates based on the production method and the expenditure method are large, and are subsumed under change in stocks. The methodology for estimating deflators is not yet fi~lly developed. Consequently, data on real GDP by industrial origin are not yet available. Furthermore, the deflators for stocks appear to be problematic. 3. Quarterly estimates of national accounts are derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates are subject to bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several expenditure categories in particular quarters. Large swings in individual components of spending and the overall GDP From quarter to quarter also raise serious questions on reliability of the data. National accounts data have been rebased to1994, but disaggregated data prior to that are not yet available under the new base. Steps are also being taken to bring the accounts into line with the SNA 1993 methodology. The statistical offtce has recently announced that it expects to release revised time series for quarterly GDP covering the period 1990-1998, on June 22 this year. This revision will also contain components of GDP broken down by sector of origin. 4. Revisions in recent years to procedures for processing export data have brought external trade statistics close to the practice in the EU.

Also, there continues to be some discrepancies in the current account data published by the central bank and the statistical offrce. Progress has been made towards implementing the methodology in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payment Manual. 5. Although there are some differences with the Zniernationuf Financial Sfatisfics (7F,5J presentation, monetary survey data provided to the European I Department are generally adequate for policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float, especially at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary developments, The CNB has made a major effort to identify the causes of these variations and adjust the data. An STA mission in January-February 1999 provided recommendations regarding valuation, accrued accounting, and treatment of financial derivatives in monetary statistics. The mission also reviewed and updated the system for reporting data which will result in an improved compilation of monetary statistics published in IFS. The revised monetary statistics for 1993 and onward will be published in the August 1999 issue of IFS. 6.
