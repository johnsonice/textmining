Schadler July 17, 1995 summaly Lesotho has successfully implemented Fund-supported economic reforms over the past seven years. Economic and financial performance in 1994195 was better than programmed. Policies for the medium term will focus on dealing with the expected downturn in investment and potential revenue loss that might follow from possible changes in the customs union agreement and other interlinkages with South Africa. The program for 1995196, prepared against a background of growing wage increase demands, seeks to maintain the momentum of adjustment, protect Lesotho’s external competitiveness, and.manage effectively the regional changes. The program for 1995/96- 1997/98 targets an annual average real growth rate of GNP at nearly 6 percent; a reduction in the rate of inflation to 6-7 percent; and a further buildup in foreign exchange reserves. Fiscal policy, structural measures, and sustained external competitiveness are key to managing the transition and attaining these medium-term objectives. Given the projected loss in customs revenue, the gradual decline in the fiscal surplus will be made possible through a substantial boost in noncustoms revenue (including the introduction of a value-added tax). The structural,measures include privatization and parastatal reforms. .The program for 1995/96 targets real GDP and GNP growth at more than 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively, allows the budget surplus to decline to 2 percent of GNP, projects inflation at 8 percent, and seeks to raise foreign exchange reserves to 5.8 months of imports. The staff appraisal emphasizes the need to manage the transition in an orderly manner, by ensuring that the fiscal targets are observed, the structural reforms are carried out, and wage pressures are contained.

Introduction The discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and for a policy framework paper (PFP) covering the period 1995/96-1997/98, and the annual program for 1995/96 (April-March) were held in Maseru during the period March 12-April 4, 1995. L/ Lesotho continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, section 2, and is on the standard 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations. The last consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 23, 1994. A review under the stand-by arrangement in support of Lesotho's program for 1994/95 was concluded by the Executive Board on March 8, 1995. On both occasions, Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in reducing the macroeconomic imbalances, and urged them to implement key structural measures, particularly the parastatal and civil service reforms, in order to facilitate economic diversification and rapid but sustainable growth. In the attached letter dated July 4, 1995, the Government of Lesotho requests a 12-month stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 7.17 million (30 percent of quota). The authorities do not intend to make any purchases from the arrangement because there is no immediate balance of payments need. However, if such a need were to arise, the authorities would initiate discussions promptly with a view to replacing the stand-by arrangement with an ESAF arrangement to provide Lesotho with the financing under terms that are compatible with its circumstances. The precautionary stand-by arrangement would continue to provide assurances to donors who have required that a Fund-supported program with upper trancha conditionality be in place for disbursing their own financial assistance to Lesotho. The stand-by arrangement will provide initial support to the authorities' medium-term policies adopted in the context of a policy framework paper (PFP). Although the arrangement would be precautionary, if all disbursements were made, and taking into consideration existing repayment obligations, outstanding Fund credit to Lesotho would increase from 114.4 percent of quota at end-April 1995 to 132.4 percent of quota by end-June 1996. Lesotho has adequate financial data for surveillance and for monitoring the Fund-supported program. However, improvements in the timeliness and l/ Lesotho representatives were the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Dr. Moeketsi Pius Senaoana; the Principal Secretary for Finance, Mr. L. Mokotoane; the Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. A.M. Maruping; the Principal Secretary for Planning, Mr. E.M. Matekane; and other senior officials. The mission met with Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle and the Cabinet. The staff representatives were Mr. Ballali (head-AFR), Mr. Chiwa (AFR), Mr. Elhage (INS), Mr. Hossain (AFR), and Ms. Laidlaw (assistant-AFR).

Recent Develonments and Performance Under the 1994/95 Program The Government of Lesotho has implemented economic reforms supported by SAF, ESAF, and stand-by arrangements from .the Fund during the past seven years through March 1995. During the first six years of reforms (1988/89- 1993/94), the country substantially improved its economic and financial performance. The overall budget balance (including grants) was turned around from a large deficit to a surplus. The balance of payments improved markedly, the rate of inflation decelerated, and relatively high growth rates were attained despite an adverse internal and external environment. l/ Sahcted Pconamic and Financial Indicators, lSSO/Sl-1995/96 1990/91 1991/92 1992/ 93 1993/94 1994/95 1995/96 - - -- - Act.

I/ Lesotho again faced a difficult political situation in 1994/95. 2/ Program implementation was temporarily disrupted during the first half of the fiscal year because of a major political crisis in August-September 1994, which, although resolved before end-September, affected the observance of many of the performance criteria for end-September 1994. Subsequently, steps were taken to put the program back on track, and the performance criteria for end-December 1994 were observed. At the time of review of the program in March 1995, the Fund granted Lesotho's request for a waiver of the nonobservance of the structural performance criterion for end-September 1994. All performance criteria for end-March 1995 were observed, and the major objectives of the 1994/95 program have been achieved. Preliminary data for 1994/95 indicate that real GDP grew by about 13.5 percent, about 1.7 percentage points more than envisaged in the program, reflecting peak activity in the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (IHWP), stronger-than-anticipated growth in manufacturing, and an excellent mid-1994 harvest (Table 1). As expected, remittances rose moderately, reflecting a 9 percent increase in miners' wages, following the rise in world gold prices. As a consequence, the expansion of real GNP at 7.7 percent was as programmed. 3J The rate of inflation on an end-period basis increased to 9.5 percent, in line with inflationary pressures in South Africa and the effects of renewed drought conditions on prices of fruits and vegetables. After only a year of good weather, Lesotho faces a severe drought and a record low crop in 1995/96. Credit and monetary developments continued to be influenced by the Government's net creditor position to the banking system. As a consequence, total domestic credit declined by 21.7 percent (target, 14.7 percent) of the beginning of period broad money stock in 1994/95. Credit to the rest of the economy, mainly the private sector, rose moderately, owing primarily to the growth of manufacturing. Reflecting these developments, as well as the rise in net foreign assets, broad money grew by 13.2 percent in 1994/95. &/ I/ Program implementation in 1994/95 is presented in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the authorities' memorandum of economic policies (Appendix II). ZZ/ The political crises were intertwined with wage increase demands. Strong pressures for large salary increases in the public sector built up rapidly, partly as a demonstration effect of the salary increases for the military and police earlier in the year. 3J In Lesotho the GNP is about one third larger than the GDP because of the importance of remittances from Basotho workers in South African mines. &/ The changes in broad money should be interpreted with caution because the South African rand is legal tender in Lesotho, alongside the loti. There are no estimates of rand in circulation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- - The overall budget surplus was 3.2 percent of GNP, against a program target of 2.8 percent, as government expenditure was lower than envisaged in the program (Chart 1 and Table 2). Total expenditure was 29.1 percent of GNP (target, 31.2 percent), partly because of lower outlays on wages and salaries, but mainly on account of lower capital expenditure, reflecting delays in implementing the hydroelectric component of the LHWP. Total revenue and grants amounted to 32.4 percent of GNP (target, 34.0 percent), mainly because grants fell short of projections, owing partly to the political turbulence. The net credit position of the Government vis-A-vis the banking system increased by 6 percent of GNP, against the program target of 5.5 percent of GNP. Chart 1. Public Finances The balance of payments recorded a strong improvement in 1994/95. The current account deficit (including grants) decreased further to 1.8 percent of GNP and net official foreign exchange reserves rose by M 401.1 million or USS99.8 million, (target, M 305 million or USS57.6 million), to the equivalent of 5.4 months of regular (non-LHWP) imports. Export growth was partly responsible for the strong improvement in the balance of payments. Total, exports rose by about 16 percent in U.S. dollar terms, with exports of garments and other manufactured goods rising more rapidly than the traditional exports. Imports rose by 15.5 percent, but were lower than programmed, on account of a shortfall in 'LHWP imports because of the delay in the hydroelectric component of the project. Lesotho pegs its currency (the loti) at par to the South African currency (the rand). Accordingly, changes in the effective exchange rate of the loti reflect the movements in the rand vis-A-vis currencies of major trading partners. During 1994/95, the nominal effective exchange rate of the loti appreciated by 0.2 percent, while the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 0.7 percent (Chart 2). The loti depreciated against the lJ.S. dollar by 2.7 percent in 1994/95. The commercial and financial rand were unified on March 10, 1995. During the immediate period prior to the unification, the financial rand appreciated sharply and the commercial r-and depreciated moderately, and the two rates virtually converged. Since unification, the rand has stabilized at around US$l=R 3.60, close to where the commercial rand was before unification. In general, the pace of structural reforms has been slow. The reasons include political instability, difficulties in obtaining technical assistance, and the lack of implementation capacity, especially in earlier Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- years.

Progress in 1994/95 was interrupted by the political crisis, although subsequently all the structural performance criteria and most of the structural benchmarks under the program had been observed by the end of the fiscal year. lJ However, a substantial restructuring of the economy has taken place in the past seven years, particularly in agriculture, public sector financial management, social services, and economic diversification, mainly through manufacturing for export. III. Macroeconomic and Structural Policies, 1995/96 - 1997/98 The economic policies to be pursued during the period 1995/96-1997/98 would provide Lesotho with the financial stability and economic growth during the period of regional transition and uncertainty. At a time when the LHWP 2J is winding down, the authorities face two other risks: (i) a I/ Table 2 of the annex to the authorities' memorandum of economic policies indicates performance on the structural measures. The matrix of the PFP (EBD/95/89; 6/26/95) presents the structural reforms carried out in 1994/95. 2/ The LHWP is very large relative to the size of the economy. It has given Lesotho great benefits, including development of its domestic infrastructure and windfall government SACU revenue through higher imports. The first phase of the project is nearing completion and the impact on government revenue is already evident in 1995/96.

Lesotho could also be affected by trade liberalization under the Uruguay Round. 2/ With regard to the loss of revenue through the winding down of LHWP activity, the Fund-supported programs have addressed the problem by capping total government expenditure at 30-32 percent of GNP in order to allow a substantial part of the windfall revenue to accumulate as a budget surplus, and facilitate the buildup in foreign assets of the banking system. The possible fall of revenue stemming from changes in the SACU agreement would be partly replaced by both the broadening of tax bases and the improvement in tax administration in progress. With regard to wage pressures, the authorities have indicated their determination to contain these pressures, beginning with the firm position taken regarding teachers' salaries. The macroeconomic objectives for the period 1995/96-1997/98 covered by the PFP include: (i) achieving annual average growth rates of GDP and GNP of about 8.9 and 5.7 percent, respectively; (ii) reducing the end-period annual inflation rate to 6-7 percent (depending on inflation trends in South Africa); (iii) allowing a gradual fall in the overall fiscal surplus from 2 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to about 1 percent in 1997/98; (iv) containing the external current account deficit (including transfers) at less than 2 percent of GNP; and (v) building up further the net official foreign exchange reserves to about seven months of imports in anticipation of possible future shocks. The medium-term scenario, covering the period through 2000/01, is presented in Appendix V. Briefly, for the projection period, real GDP is projected to grow at an annual average rate of nearly 10 percent, owing mainly to continued growth in manufacturing and construction. Real GNP growth will average somewhat less than 8 percent. The overall budget surplus is projected to decline to an overall budget balance by 2000/01, with revenue falling gradually and total expenditure remaining at about 30 percent of GNP. The current account deficit will continue to decline and I/ Southern African Customs Union, whose members are Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland, 2/ The committee reviewing the SACU agreement is expected to give its preliminary report in August 1995. J/ Lesotho's preferential treatment of its exports to the United States and the European Union would be adversely affected. However, Lesotho could remain competitive if it maintained its current cost advantage. In addition, Lesotho's food import bill could rise as agricultural trade is liberalized. However, under favorable weather conditions, its effect would be limited to wheat imports, and would not affect the main food staple (maize), because South Africa is normally a surplus producer.

However, a sensitivity analysis with respect to possible changes in the SACU agreement, stagnant export growth, and a resumed rapid retrenchment of mine workers would have a devastating effect on Lesotho's economy. The fiscal and balance of payments surpluses would turn into large deficits, beginning 1996/97, and the foreign exchange reserves could disappear by the year 2000/01. 1. Fiscal volicy Fiscal policy will continue to be the main instrument of adjustment. Given the expected fall in SACU revenue, fiscal policy will focus on effecting a gradual decrease in the overall budget surplus, to an estimated 1.0 percent of GNP by 1997/98. This objective will be achieved by limiting total expenditure to 30-32 percent of GNP, a level deemed sustainable even after the completion of the current phase of the LHWP, and by continuing to enhance non-SACU revenues. The structural fiscal reforms have targeted non-SACU revenue. JJ These reforms have been completed in respect of income tax and they are still in progress with regard to the sales tax. The potential additional revenue from the broadened tax bases was deliberately not tapped, by lowering tax rates, in the case of income tax, and by maintaining a high turnover threshold for the sales tax. The possibility of lowering the threshold has been held as a contingency measure. If this contingency measure had been u+ilized, the budget surpluses would have been larger than those experienced in recent years (over 3 percent of GNP). 2J As SACU revenue begins to decline, the contingency measure will begin to be used. In 1995/96, it will involve the lowering of the threshold for sales tax. Over the medium term, substantial revenue is expected from the sales tax because of an agreement between Lesotho and South Africa to collect each other's taxes, and through the introduction of the value-added tax (VAT). A VAT technical assistance mission from the Fiscal Affairs Department of the Fund is expected to visit Lesotho soon. As SACU revenue falls from over 17 percent of GNP in 1994/95 to about 13 percent by 1997/98, non-SACU revenue will rise from about 12 percent of GNP in 1994/95 to 16 percent of GNP by 1997/98. As a consequence, total revenue will be maintained at about 29 percent of GNP over the medium term. Grants are projected to decline slightly. The overall budget surplus will drop from 3.2 percent of GNP in 1994/95 to 1.0 percent of GNP in 1997/98. I/ The structural fiscal reforms are discussed in the memorandum of economic policies and in the PFP (paragraphs 16-17). 2/ The existence of large budget surpluses has been used to justify demands for large salary and wage increases. The public servants as well as the general public in Lesotho tend to be persuaded by arguments of the Government's inability to pay, and less so by arguments of macroeconomic stability and the need to maintain external competitiveness.

Monetarv and financial sector policies Lesotho is a member of the Common Monetary Area (WA), which also includes Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa. Under the CMA, although Lesotho issues its own currency, the South African rand is also legal tender and the exchange rate is a fixed one-to-one relationship. The common monetary arrangements have facilitated investment and trade in goods and services between South Africa and Lesotho. South Africa accounts for a large share (more than 75 percent) of Lesotho's imports and exports of goods and services. These close ties have been accompanied by employment of Basotho miners in South Africa. Lesotho is compensated by South Africa for loss of seignorage, and it also receives a subsidy under the SACU arrangements. Given its relatively higher labor productivity, and lower real wages, Lesotho stands to benefit further in the future, as South Africa and other countries in the region move to liberalize their trade and enhance their integration to the world economy. In spite of the monetary union,, there are still capital controls within the CMA. It is Chart 3. Treasury Bill Rates difficult for a Basotho entity to borrow in South Africa, even though it may bank there, and Lesotho, on imposes a minimum local *Oc its part, asset requirement on its commercial 18 banks. It is essentially these restrictions which give rise to the 16 need for appropriate measures to minimize the risk of distortions in 14 the structure of interest rates and to facilitate the absorption of A treasury bill 12 excess liquidity. auction market was established in 1992/93. To supplement the supply 10 of treasury bills, which have dwindled because of rapid 8 government debt repayment, the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) +Lesotho +South Africa introduced its own securities and began monthly auctions of these securities alongside the treasury bills in December 1994. The CBL intends to phase out payment of interest on its own deposits (call and 30-day deposits) to encourage the use of the newly introduced central bank securities and other instruments. The CBL has ceased to fix the maximum spreads on commercial bank deposit rates relative to its own deposit rates. While the CBL continues to set a floor interest rate for passbook savings,, which is higher than the comparable rate in South Africa, the level of other interest rates, especially the prime rate and the treasury bill rate, is close to those in South Africa (Chart 3).

In this context, it would be appropriate for the authorities to work with the other p artners in the monetary arrangement to eliminate the capital controls within the CMA, including the minimum local asset requirement imposed on commercial banks in Lesotho. These restrictions are not uniform to the other smaller countries and are governed by separate bilateral agreements between South Africa and each of the other CMA countries. The CMA countries have not yet set a timetable for the review of the monetary agreement. The encouraging progress in bank supervision will be improved through more effective follow-up action after on-site inspections. Prudential regulations will be enhanced and will include the introduction of a risk- based capital adequacy ratio, along Basle guidelines. Both bank supervision and foreign exchange management continue to benefit from technical assistance from the Fund. The Central Bank Act and the Financial Institutions Act are expected to be revised to remove anomalies that impede the CBL from executing fully its statutory functions. 3. External policies a. Medium-term balance of navments The authorities believe that further efforts to strengthen export performance will ensure Lesotho's continued external viability. The Lesotho National Development Corporation continues to be successful in attracting direct foreign investment, especially from the Far East. Based on planned expansion by existing investors and identified new investment, 'exports are projected to increase at an annual rate of about 18 percent (in U.S. dollar terms) over the three-year period (Chart 4). The new investment will continue to be in textiles, garments, footwear, electronics, and other light manufactures. lJ Imports (excluding LHWP) are expected to Chart 4. Exports l/ The authorities' efforts to achieve the projected export growth target through foreign direct private investment are discussed in more detail in paragraph 23 of the PFP.

Imports of capital goods will grow more strongly than imports of intermediate and consumer goods. The current account deficit (including transfers and excluding LHWP-related transactions) is targeted to decline to 1.2 percent of GNP by 1997/98. Given the commitment to maintain a surplus fiscal position and an appropriately tight credit policy stance, the current account deficits are expected to be financed by the projected net inflows of official and private capital. Net official foreign exchange reserves will rise from about 5.8 months of imports at the end of 1995/96 to about 7.0 months of imports by the end of 1997/98. The debt service ratio (excluding LHWP obligations) will fall slightly from 4.9 percent in 1994/95 to 4.5 percent by 1997/98. b. Canacitv to renav the Fund Lesotho has maintained an excellent track record in meeting its financial obligations to the Fund and to its other creditors. The country's Fund-supported programs have strengthened the economy and improved substantially its balance of payments. Lesotho intends to maintain a low external debt service ratio, projected at 4-5 percent, during the period 1995/96-1997/98. With the implementation of the medium-term program, the staff believes that Lesotho's economic and financial position will remain sufficiently strong to ensure the country's ability to service its external debt, including its financial obligations to the Fund. 4. Structural reforms The structural reforms for 1995/96-1997/98 focus on a few key areas. L/ The privatization and parastatal reform program, supported by a World Bank technical assistance IDA credit, is key to the medium-term structural reform agenda. Properly managed, it is expected to provide the right signals for private investors and to develop new areas of growth and thereby facilitate economic diversification. The civil service reform, supported by the UNDP, is intended to increase efficiency and make the provision of public services more cost effective. In light of the challenges and opportunities likely to be presented by the gradual deregulation of agricultural markets in South Africa, the authorities' agricultural strategy seeks to diversify agricultural output toward high value export crops, to increase the role of the private sector, and to encourage land use practices that are environmentally sustainable. 1/ The structural reforms to be implemented during the three-year period are presented in detail in the PFP, paragraphs 30-47.

Social sectors and the environment The improvement of human resources, alleviation of poverty, and protection of the environment are important objectives in the Government's overall policy. I/ Over the years, the authorities have increased budgetary allocations for social services, mainly education and health services. Over the past four years (1991/92-1994/95), the shares of expenditure devoted to education and health have increased significantly (Chart 5). The Government has also allocated substantial resources to vocational education and job training. It has also provided emergency food assistance during the drought in conjunction with donor assistance. To ameliorate any negative impact of Lesotho's structural adjustment program on the poor, the program has also featured a safety net. It funds a large number of small projects, implemented mainly by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Chart 5. Public Expenditure 1991/92 1994/95 IV. Program for 1995/96 The program for 1995/96 was prepared against a difficult background of growing demands for large wage increases. The large salary increases awarded to the military and police in mid-1994 had an adverse demonstration effect on other public sector employees, especially teachers, who are highly unionized and politically powerful. In mid-1994 the teachers began to back their wage demands by frequent strikes, The teachers' unions strengthened their bargaining position during August-September 1994 when the Government was temporarily out of power. In January 1995, the Government awarded teachers salary increases averaging 80 percent. However, the preparation of the budget and the program for 1995/96 made it clear that the salary award would be unsustainable and would deal a catastrophic blow to the seven-year adjustment effort. The program discussions with the authorities were prolonged and difficult. The Government took the unusually bold step of rescinding the salary award. It subsequently announced a 15 percent across- the-board increase in wages and salaries for both teachers and civil L/ Social and environmental policies are discussed in detail in paragraphs 48-54 and 57-61 of the PFP.

The Government has expressed its determination to stand firm against pressures to award unsustainable salary increases. 1. Fiscal oolicv Total revenue and grants are projected at 32.1 percent of GNP in 1995/96, while total expenditure is estimated at 30.1 percent of GNP. As a consequence, the overall budget surplus will decline to 2.0 percent of GNP in 1995/96, in line with the medium-term macroeconomic framework. Total revenue is projected at 28.9 percent of GNP in 1995/96, a drop of 0.6 percentage point of GNP relative to the outturn for 1994/95, on account of a drop in SACU receipts of 1 percentage point of GNP, reflecting a fall in IHWP-related customs revenue, which peaked in 1994/95. Noncustoms revenue is projected to increase by 0.4 percentage point of GNP, to 12.7 percent of GNP in 1995/96, as a result of discretionary measures on the sales tax. In June 1995, the threshold for payment of the sales tax was lowered to include business entities with a turnover of M 200,000 (the previous threshold was M 500,000). The additional revenue yield from this measure. is estimated at about M 50 million. The authorities believe that discretionary revenue measures are necessary to replace the diminishing SACU revenue, to pay for the larger-than-envisaged general increase in salaries and for imports of food grains for emergency drought relief. Total expenditure is budgeted to rise by 1 percentage point, to 30.1 percent of GNP in 1995/96. Virtually all of the increase is in current expenditure, which is to rise to 20.8 percent of GNP. Capital expenditure will increase marginally to 9.4 percent of GNP, a level that is consistent with the absorptive capacity of the economy. 2. Monetarv and credit oolicv The monetary program for 1995/96 has targeted a decline in total domestic credit, consistent with a further buildup in the Government's net creditor position with the banking system. After taking into account the programmed rise in foreign exchange reserves, the increase in the Government's position at the banks, total net domestic credit of the banking system is programmed to decline by about 15.0 percent in 1995/96. The money stock is expecte'd to expand by about 20.0 percent. The monetary program and targets for 1995/96 are presented in paragraph 15 of the authorities' memorandum of economic policies and in its annex. 3. External sector policies In the context of the overall medium-term balance of payments objectives, the 1995/96 program aims at reducing the external current account deficit to 1.6 percent of GNP, and raising net official foreign exchange reserves by about M 231.8 million (USS53.7 million), to the equivalent of about 5.8 months of regular (non-LHWP) imports. These Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - objectives will be achieved through fiscal policy and, to some extent, through policies to promote export growth, as discussed in paragraph 25. Exports are projected to increase by about 16 percent (in U.S. dollar terms) in 1995/96. Workers' remittances, which are the main source for financing consumer imports, are expected to rise only moderately, to the equivalent of US$469 million. Consumer imports are projected to show little change, despite the food grain imports, following one of the poorest harvests on record. Total imports are projected to increase by about 7 percent (in U.S. dollar terms), with most of increase accounted for by capital goods imports. A low debt service ratio will be maintained through a cautious external borrowing policy. Limits have been placed on nonconcessional external borrowing by the public sector. There will be no net disbursements of loans with a maturity of less than 1 year (except normal import financing credits); and the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional public sector loans in the maturity range of l-15 years will be limited to SDR 7 million. Loans contracted for the financing of the LHWP will continue to be exempt from these ceilings. Given the cautious debt policy, the debt service ratio will remain at about 5 percent in 1995/96. Lesotho maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of limits on some payments to nonresidents, and on certain travel and emigrants' allowances. Lesotho no longer has a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, following South Africa's abolition of a dual exchange rate for the commercial and financial rand on March 10, 1995. The Government has expressed its intention to work toward the elimination of the restrictions maintained under Article XIV, Section 2; and to consider Lesotho's formal acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 as soon as possible. 4. Structural measures With the political situation largely stabilized, and with the availability of technical assistance, especially for privatization and parastatal reform, the pace of implementing structural reforms should accelerate. The Government is committed to privatize or reform at least four public enterprises a year. r/ The companies to be privatized or reformed in 1995/96 are presented in paragraph 20 of the memorandum of economic policies and in the PFP. The comprehensive civil service reform program will begin its first year of implementation, in 1995/96, with measures focused on developing the new structure of the civil service. In agriculture, the emphasis is on adapting to changes in South Africa, many of which are still under consideration. The new direction is toward 1/ About one fifth of all the enterprises to be dealt with, under the five-year IDA supported project.

With respect to social policies, outlays for education and health will continue to increase in real terms, and the allocation for the safety net will be M 10 million. lJ 5. Performance criteria. benchmarks. and oroeram review Performance criteria and benchmarks under the stand-by arrangement are described in paragraphs 15, 17, 20, 24, and 25 of the memorandum of economic and financial policies and specified in Table 1 annexed thereto. The authorities do not intend to make any purchases under the stand-by arrangement, which totals SDR 7.17 million. Nonetheless, the phasing of purchases is as follows: SDR 1.793 million upon Fund approval of the arrangement; SDR 1.793 million on November 15, 1995, upon observance of end- September 1995 performance criteria; SDR 1.793 million on February 15, 1995, upon observance of end-December 1995 performance criteria and the completion of Fund review of the program; SDR 1.793 million on May 15, 1996, upon observance of the end-March 1996 performance criteria. V. Staff Appraisal Lesotho successfully implemented economic reforms for six years through March 1994, supported by SAF and ESAF arrangements from the Fund. Program implementation proceeded well under the stand-by arrangement in 1994/95. As a consequence, the country has achieved high growth rates, a budget surplus, and a substantial increase in foreign reserves. However, Lesotho needs to continue to implement economic reforms in view of uncertainties and a rapidly changing regional environment. The staff has urged the authorities to adopt their policies to changing circumstances, and to develop new growth areas as LHWP investment begins to fall. In the staff's view, the authorities' medium-term program is an appropriate response to these changes. The program aims at achieving annual average growth rates of GDP and GNP of about 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively; reducing the end-period annual inflation rate to 6-7 percent (in line with projected inflation in South Africa); allowing a gradual fall in the budget surplus to about 1 percent (as the LHWP revenue windfall declines); and building up further official foreign exchange reserves to about seven months of imports. In view of the drought, the program for 1995/96 targets real GDP and GNP growth of only 7.4 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively, a budget surplus of 2 percent of GNP, and a rise in official foreign exchange reserves to 5.8 months of imports. The structural measures include the privatization and parastatal reform, the civil service reform, and agricultural liberalization and diversification to high value crops. I/ These structural policies are discussed in detail in paragraphs 20-23 of the memorandum of economic and financial policies and in the PFP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - The most significant feature of the program is the continued economic expansion and balance of payments improvement, despite the downturn in LHWP investment, mainly because of the projected growth in exports. Direct foreign investment in export manufacturing, mainly from, the Far East, continues to be attracted to Lesotho because of the productivity of the labor force and low real wages. The maintenance of these advantages is key to the attainment of the medium-term growth objectives. To address the decrease in customs (SACU) revenue from the downturn in LHWP imports as well as from possible changes in the SACU agreement, the program will begin to tap the broadened income tax base and to accelerate the ongoing reforms in consumption taxes (including the replacement of the sales tax with a VAT). Having now obtained the necessary technical assistance, especially in privatization and parastatal reform, the authorities should accelerate the pace of structural measures to improve efficiency in the economy and to send the right signals to investors. The staff encourages the authorities to secure the necessary technical assistance to improve the timeliness and coverage of real sector and balance of payments data. While the SACU agreement is currently being reviewed, no timetable has been set for the review of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) agreement. The staff urges Lesotho, in cooperation with other CMA members, to remove the remaining capital restrictions within the monetary area. The staff believes that Lesotho is entering a period that will be more difficult to manage than the recent past. With the political situation somewhat stabilized, the authorities will need to focus on another potentially troublesome area. Recent economic gains and the changes in neighboring South Africa have spurred rising expectations and wage demands that are difficult to contain. In this connection, the authorities should be commended for their recent courageous action regarding wages. However, while the staff continues to recommend an annual review of wages and salaries, it is necessary at this stage to develop a comprehensive wage policy that would maintain Lesotho's external competitiveness and macroeconomic stability over the medium term. Such a policy should, in particular, be consistent with the medium-term budgetary profile under the PFP. The full implementation of the authorities' policies should assure sustained growth and continued external viability for Lesotho. In the circumstances, the staff recommends approval of Lesotho's request for a 12-month stand-by arrangement. Lesotho maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of limits on some payments to nonresidents, and on certain travel and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - emigrants' allowances. The staff urges the authorities to eliminate these restrictions and to consider formal acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 as soon as possible. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Lesotho be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

During the period of the stand-by arrangement Lesotho shall remain in close consultation with the Fund. These consultations may include correspondence and visits of officials of the Fund to Lesotho or of repre- sentatives of Lesotho to the Fund. Lesotho shall provide the Fund, through reports at intervals or dates requested by the Fund, with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress of Lesotho in achieving the objectives and policies set forth in the attached letter and annexed memorandum. 10. In accordance with paragraph 4 of the attached letter, Lesotho, will consult with the Fund on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate at the initiative of the Government or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation because any of the performance criteria in paragraph 3 above have not been observed or because the Managing Director considers that consultation on the program is desirable. In addition, after the period of the stand-by arrangement and while Lesotho has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund arising from purchases in the upper credit tranches, Lesotho will consult with the Fund from time to time, at the initiative of the Government or at the request of the Managing Director concerning Lesotho's balance of payments policies.

The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the Government of Lesotho is based on a policy framework paper (PFP), which was prepared in collaboration with the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank. The PFP sets out the broad objectives of a medium-term program of economic and structural adjustment for the period April 1, 1995"March 31, 1998. 2. The memorandum referred to above sets out the objectives and policies to be pursued during the three-year period that is covered by the PFP, and the objectives and policies for the 1995/96 program thereunder. To provide initial support to these policies and objectives, the Government of Lesotho hereby requests a 12"month stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 7.17 million (30 percent of quota). At the same time, the Government of Lesotho requests that upon approval of the new arrangement, the existing 12"month stand-by arrangement approved by the Fund on September 23, 1994, be canceled. The requested stand-by arrangement is intended to be precaution- ary because no immediate balance of payments need is foreseen. However, in the event that balance of payments need requiring Lesotho to use Fund re- sources were to arise, the Government of Lesotho intends to request that the stand-by arrangement be canceled and replaced by an ESAF arrangement to provide Lesotho with financing under terms that are compatible with the country's circumstances. 3. The Government of Lesotho will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with Lesotho's progress in implementing the economic and financial policies to achieve the objectives of the program. 4. The Government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on the adoption of any measures that may be needed, at the initiative of the Government or the Managing Director, in accordance with the Fund's policies on such consultations. 5. In addition, Lesotho will conduct with the Fund a review of the 1995/96 program supported by the stand-by arrangement, to be completed no later than March 15, 1996. Sincerely yours, Dr. M. P.

Lesotho has made impressive adjustment and economic progress in recent years. However, it is necessary for Lesotho to persist on the adjustment path in order to avoid a reversal of these recent gains. The outstanding adjustment need is related to Lesotho's ability to sustain financial sta- bility and economic growth in the face of the expected downturn in invest,- ment, and the changes emanating from South Africa's transition. An orderly adjustment is needed in response to the expected deceleration in the rate of economic expansion following the winding down of the current phase of Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP), the likely changes in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) agreement, and the possibility of an accelerated decline in remittances from Basotho mine workers in South Africa. 2. The Government's policy objectives for the period 1995/96-1997/98 are intended to provide Lesotho with the means to manage the transition. The medium-term policies aim at a lower but more sustainable level of investment that would be geared to developing new growth areas where private investment can be attracted. These policies will also allow Lesotho to take advantage of emerging opportunities from South Africa's transition. The attainment of these objectives rests on maintenance of macroeconomic stability and on accelerated implementation of a few key structural measures. The broad objectives and strategies for the period 1995/96-1997/98 are described in the policy framework paper (PFP). 3. During the first year of the medium-term program, to be supported by the precautionary stand-by arrangement, comprehensive adjustment measures would be implemented that aim at attaining the medium-term objectives. This Memorandum presents a detailed outline of the program's macroeconomic and structural adjustment policies for 1995/96, including quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks under the proposed stand-by arrangement, intended to facilitate the monitoring of performance in key areas of economic policy. Recent develooments and oerformance under the nrogram for 1994/95 4. Lesotho has implemented major economic reforms supported by SAF, ESAF, and stand-by arrangements from the Fund during the past seven years through March 1995. During the first six years of reforms (1988/89-1993/94), the country achieved substantial improvement in its economic and financial performance. The programs were successful in effecting substantial fiscal and balance of payments adjustment and creating an environment conducive to sustained growth and economic diversification. The overall budget balance was turned around from a large deficit to a surplus. The balance of pay- ments improved substantially, the rate of inflation decelerated, and relatively high growth rates were attained, despite constraints imposed by a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - APPENDIX II severe drought, a prolonged recession in South Africa, a continued retrench- ment of Basotho mine workers in South Africa, and political uncertainties in both South Africa and Lesotho. 5. Lesotho's program for 1994/95, supported by a precautionary stand-by arrangement, aimed at consolidating past gains and maintatning momentum of policies to promote investment, exports, and sustainable rapid output growth, while ensuring a further strengthening of the external position. Preliminary data indicate that the economy expanded more strongly than envisaged in the program. Real GDP grew by about 13.5 percent, against the program's target of about 12 percent, reflecting peak activity in the LHWP, stronger-than-anticipated growth in manufacturing, and an excellent mid-1994 harvest. Remittances rose moderately in 1994/95, reflecting a 9 percent increase in miners' wages, following the rise in world gold prices. As a consequence, real GNP expanded by 7.7 percent. The rate of inflation on end-period basis increased to 9.5 percent, in line with inflationary pressures in South Africa and the effects of renewed drought conditions on prices of fruits and vegetables. The overall budget balance showed a surplus of 3.2 percent of GNP, against a program target of 2.8 percent of GNP, partly because of lower outlays on wages and salaries, but mainly on account of lower capital expenditure, reflecting delays in implementing the hydroelectric component of the WWP. The balance of payments registered a strong improvement, with net official reserves rising by M 401.1 million (USS99.0 million), against the program target of an increase of M 304.9 million (USS57.6 million), to the equivalent of 5.4 months of regular (non-LHWP) imports. Lesotho continued also to implement a broad range of structural measures. 6. The 1994/95 program faced temporary implementation problems during the first half of the fiscal year caused mainly by a major political crisis that occurred in August-September 1994, which was eventually resolved through the mediation of neighboring countries. As a consequence, many of the perfor- mance criteria for end-September 1994 were not observed. Subsequently, steps were taken to put the program back on track. As a consequence, the performance criteria for end-December 1994 were met. Steps were also taken to ensure that the structural performance criterion and benchmarks for end-September 1994 that were missed as well as those for end-December 1994 were observed. At the time of review of the program the Fund granted Lesotho's request for a waiver in respect of the missed structural perfor- mance criterion for end-September 1994. All performance criteria for end- March 1995 have also been observed. During the year, strong pressures for large salary increases in the public sector built up rapidly, partly as a demonstration effect of the salary increases for the military and police earlier in the year. In August-September 1994, teachers were on strike for higher pay. In January 1995 the Government agreed to a large salary increase for teachers, which was subsequently rescinded because it would be unsustainable. Despite these problems, the major objectives of the 1994/95 program were achieved.

Lesotho's recovery and the impressive fiscal and balance of payments adjustment are tentative, and could face a reversal unless underpinned by continued adjustment over the medium term. The greatest threat to Lesotho's short- and medium-term prospects is the current strong pressure for large salary and wage increases. To maintain external competitiveness and achieve the program's objectives, it is necessary to contain these pressures firmly. The macroeconomic policies covering the period 1995/96-1997/98 would provide needed financial stability and economic growth during the period of regional transition. The structural reforms covering the privatization and para- statal reform, the civil service reform, and specific measures in the industrial and agricultural sectors, would facilitate the transition. A properly managed privatization and parastatal reform is key to providing the right signals for private investors and to developing new areas of growth. The policies to be pursued will encourage further expansion of exports of garments, textiles, and light manufacture, which would continue to be t:he main area for direct foreign investment and employment creation. The possible decline in SACU-related revenue will partly be countered by mea- sures to generate other sources of government revenue. The civil service reform and other structural measures are intended to increase efficiency in the economy. A liberalization of agricultural pricing and marketing would facilitate a shift to high-value crops and enable rural incomes to grow, while sustaining the environment. 8. The macroeconomic objectives for the period 1995/96-1997/98 include the following: (i) achieving annual average rates of growth of GDP and GNP of about 8.9 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively; (ii) reducing the end- period annual inflation rate to 6-7 percent; 3J (iii) allowing a gradual fall in the overall fiscal surplus from 2 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to about 1 percent in 1997/98; (iv) holding down the external current account deficit (including transfers) to less than 2 percent of GNP; and (v) further strengthening the net official foreign exchange reserves in anticipation of future shocks. The trends in investment and savings during the three-year period are discussed in the PFP. Fiscal policy will continue to be the main instrument of adjustment. The Government's fiscal objective is to maintain total expenditure at no more than 30-32 percent of GNP, a level deemed sustainable even after the completion of the current phase of the LHWP. Government revenue is projected to drop steadily (in terms of GNP) beginning in 1995/96 because the next phase of the LHWP, a smaller project, will require lower imports and will, as a result, generate lower SACU revenue. Accordingly, the overall budget surplus will be allowed to decline gradually to an estimated 1.0 percent of GNP by 1997/98. This basic scenario of the fiscal program does not take into account any changes that might occur in the SACU treaty or the impact of trade liberalization by SACU members (including prospective tariff reductions, emanating from South Africa's commitments under the Uruguay Round). u Takes into account projected inflation in South Africa, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public9. The structural fiscal reforms over the medium term will involve the implementation of the new sales tax law, prepared with the technical assis- tance from the Fund. The Sales Tax Act 1995 consolidates the many amend- ments to the previous sales tax law, corrects operational deficiencies, removes loopholes, and facilitates the move to a Value-Added Tax (VAT). The move to the VAT will be facilitated by a possible agreement currently under discussion with South Africa to collect each other's consumption taxes. It is possible that such an agreement could be concluded before the end of the current fiscal year. It is expected that a VAT will be fully implemented during the three-year period, with technical assistance from the Fund. The technical assistance has been requested and a Fund staff technical assis- tance mission is expected to visit Maseru in September 1995. Over the medium term, the financial sector reforms will seek to continue to strengthen the Central Bank's monetary and foreign exchange management, and bank supervision. The Central Bank has already ceased fixing maximum spreads of commercial bank deposit rates and intends to phase out payments of interest on call and 30-day deposits to facilitate eventual development of an interbank market for short-term funds. In the external sector, the strengthening of the balance of payments will be supported by the continued pursuit of a strong export diversification and promotion effort. The objective is to increase exports, reduce the external current account deficit, and raise net official foreign exchange reserves. Exports are targeted to increase at an average annual rate of about 18 percent (in U.S. dollar terms) over the three-year period, owing to projected increases in exports of garments, textiles, footwear, electronics and light manu- facture. The policy actions for attracting direct foreign investment in the various industries to attain the projected export growth are discussed in the PFP. The current account deficit (including transfers and excluding LHWP-related transactions) is targeted to decline to about 1.6 percent of GNP in 1995/96 and to 1.2 percent by 1997/98. Net official foreign exchange reserves are targeted to rise to the equivalent of 5.8 months of imports in 1995/96 and 7 months of imports by 1997/98. The debt service ratio as a proportion of exports of goods and services will be contained in the 4-5 percent range. The low debt service ratio will be maintained'through limits on nonconcessional borrowing by the public sector during the program period. 10. The privatization and parastatal reform program, supported by a World Bank technical assistance IDA credit, is key to the medium-term structural reform agenda. The civil service reform program, supported by the UNDP, aims at strengthening the institutional and management capacity and in- creasing the efficiency of the civil service. The details of the two programs, including the phasing of the measures, are presented in detail in the PFP. The Government's agricultural policies seek to liberalize the marketing of agricultural staple food crops in order to encourage diversifi- cation to high-value export crops, and to encourage environmentally sustainable land-use practices.

The Government's program for 1995/96 seeks to advance the medium-term objectives of adjusting to the downturn in investment and to the changing regional environment, while maintaining financial stability. The Government is aware that the emerging strong spending pressures, such as the recent demands for very large increases in teachers' salaries, pose a great threat to macroeconomic stability. Unless these pressures are appropriately contained, the achievements of the past seven years could be seriously undermined. After rescinding the 80 percent increase in teachers' salaries adopted in January 1995, the Government has stood firm against pressures to award unsustainable salary increases. Consistent with the objectives of the pros--, on May 8, 1995 the Government announced a 15 percent across the board increase in wages and salaries for both teachers and civil servants effective April 1, 1995. Accordingly, the program for 1995/96 assumes that these pressures will be appropriately contained throughout the year and the current macroeconomic stability will be maintained. Fiscal policy 12. Fiscal policy for 1995/96 is consistent with the objective of maintain- ing total expenditure at about 30-32 percent of GNP, while effecting a gradual decline in the overall budget surplus. For 1995/96, total revenue and grants are projected at 32.1 percent of GNP. Total revenue is estimated at 28.9 percent of GNP, down by 0.6 percentage point of GNP from the outturn for 1994/95, on account of a one percentage point of GNP drop in SACU receipts, reflecting a fall in LHWP-related customs revenue, which peaked in 1994/95. Noncustoms revenue is projected to increase by 0.4 percentage point to 12.7 percent of GNP in 1995/96. The increase in revenue is the result of discretionary measures affecting the sales tax. Beginning in June 1995, the threshold for payment of the sales tax has been lowered from business entities with a turnover of M 500,000 to a turnover of M 200,000. The eventual revenue yield from this measure will be substantial, although in 1995/96 it is estimated at about M SO million. In addition, sales tax receipts will benefit during the latter part of 1995/96 from an agreement between South Africa and Lesotho to collect each other's tax in their respective territories. In subsequent years, this source of tax receipts will be responsible for the projected substantial increase in revenue over the medium term. These discretionary measures, the first in several years, are necessary to pay for larger-than-envisaged increases in salaries to teachers and civil servants and to provide drought relief through imports of food grain for emergency distribution. As a consequence, current expendi- ture will rise by one percentage point of GNP to 20.8 percent of GNP. Capital expenditure, at 9.4 percent of GNP, against 9.3 percent in 1994/95, is consistent with the absorptive capacity of the economy. The overall budget surplus of 2.0 percent of GNP is in line with the medium-term macro- economic framework, and will augment the Government's net creditor position with the banking system and allow a further accumulation of official net foreign exchange reserves.

The fiscal program for 1995/96 was prepared against a difficult back- ground involving strong demands for a very large increase in teachers' salaries. The teachers, who are highly unionized, had backed their demands with strikes. However, the budgetary and macroeconomic impact of the now rescinded 80 percent average salary increase for teachers would not be sustainable. Subsequently, the fiscal program outlined above was prepared consistent with the Government's decision to withdraw the award and raise teachers' salaries by the same rate as civil servants. Monetary and credit policy 14. Lesotho's credit and monetary policies are largely influenced by developments in South Africa, and by its membership in the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The latter limits the scope of monetary policy and precludes independent use of the exchange rate as an instrument of policy. Within these constraints, the monetary program for 1995/96 will target a decline in total domestic credit consistent with the continuing buildup in the Government's net creditor position with the banking system, and a reasonable expansion in domestic credit to meet the needs of the private sector. Interest rates, which are largely market determined, are expected to remain positive in real terms. 15. To ensure that the liquidity in the banking system does not lead to undue demand pressures, domestic credit expansion in 1995/96 will be limited to a rate consistent with the objectives of the program. After taking into account the net foreign reserve buildup of M 231.8 million, and an increase in the Government's net creditor position with the banking system, net domestic credit of the banking system is programmed to decline by 15.4 per- cent in 1995/96. Consequently, net domestic credit of the banking system will not exceed minus M 184.0 million at end-June 1995, minus M 214.2 mil- lion at end-September 1995, minus M 248.6 million at end-December 1995, and minus M 307.6 million at end-March 1996. Accordingly, net credit to the Government will not exceed minus M 913.0 million at end-June 1995, minus M 973.2 million at end-September 1995, minus M 1,033.7 million at end- December 1995, and minus M 1,112.2 million at end-March 1996. The quarterly targets for total net domestic credit and net credit to the Government are proposed as performance criteria. 16. To facilitate the future growth of a money market, the authorities have recently introduced central bank securities, to provide commercial banks a new investment instrument in which to hold their excess liquidity. In addition, the Central Bank is considering stopping payment of interest first on banks' call deposits, and subsequently on their 30-day deposits as well. External sector nolicies 17. The 1995/96 program aims at reducing the external current account deficit to about 1.6 percent of GNP, and increasing net official reserves by about M 231.8 million (USS53.7 million), to the equivalent of about Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - APPENDIXa 5.8 months of regular imports. These goals will be achieved through fiscal policy and export growth. Exports .are projected to grow by nearly 16 percent (in U.S. dollar terms) in 1995/96. 1.8 . A cautious external borrowing policy will continue to be pursued. A low debt service ratio will be maintained through limits on nonconcessional borrowing by the public sector. Accordingly, there will be no net disburse- ment of loans with a maturity of less than one year (excluding normal short- term import credits); and the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional public sector loans in maturity of l-15 years will be limited to SDR 7 mil- lion. Loans contracted for the financing of the LHWP will continue to be exempt from these ceilings. Given this cautious stance, the debt service ratio will remain in the range of 4-5 percent in 1995/96. IL9 . Lesotho maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of limits on some payments to nonresidents, and on certain travel and emigrants' allowances. Lesotho no longer has a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, following South Africa's abolition of a dual exchange rate for the commercial and financial rand on March 10, 1995. The Government will now work toward the elimination of the restrictions maintained under Article XIV, Section 2 and will consider formal acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 12, 3, and 4 as soon as possible. Privatization and parastatal reform 20. In the first year of the program (ending June 1996) the Government will establish a privatization unit and Parliament will pass the Privatization Bill. In 1995/96, the Government will privatize Security Lesotho and Parthenon Paints, and will privatize or reform one of the following para- ,stata:L units: Basotho Produce, Basotho Fruit and Vegetables, Lesotho Bank (completing the initial public share offering), Basotho Enterprise IDevelopment Corporation (BEDCO) (restructuring and rationalization), Lesoitho Airways (preparing the company for sale), and incorporating and commercial- izing the National Abattoir and Feedlot Complex. In addition, the following LNDC companies will be transferred to the LIH: Cashbuild, Frasers, O.K. Bazaar, and Smart Centre. Civil service reform 21. In December 1994, the Government approved a strategic and operational public management improvement plan (i.e. the medium-term civil service reform program), prepared by the Ministry of Public Service in collaboratLon with the UNDP and the relevant government ministries and agencies. In early 1995, the Government set up a Steering committee, chaired by the Government Secretary, and a number of task groups. These task groups will formulate specific measures to be carried out in 199.5/96. The reforms to be imple- mented in 1995/96 are outlined in the PFP. Briefly, the Government will complete the review of the role, objectiveo and functions of the government ministries and agencies; revise civil service laws, rules and regulations; Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicand review current job content and classify all occupational groups in the civil service in order to enhance the incentive structure, to increase efficiency. In the context of the reform program, the optimum of the civil service will be defined and it will be necessary to adopt a wage policy that will restrain the growth of the wage bill so as to avoid increasing government expenditure to unsustainable levels over the medium term. Aericultural reforms 22. In 1995/96, the Government intends to complete the necessary studies required to develop an effective pricing and,marketing liberalization of stable food crops (mainly maize, but also sorghum and wheat), in line with the agricultural sector liberalization now in progress in South Africa, and to encourage agricultural diversification to high-value crops, such as asparagus and fruit. These studies will be based on broader studies carried out in 1994 with assistance from FA0 and other external donors. In the meantime, price and marketing liberalization has been initiated in poultry products, which could be extended to cover the dairy industry. Social sector policies 23. The Government's policies for poverty alleviation will continue to be effected through higher budgetary allocation for social services--in particular, there will be real increases in expenditure for education and health. During the duration of the ESAF-supported program (1991/92- 1993/94), the share of capital budget devoted to education rose from 14.9 percent to 16.7 percent, while that devoted to health rose from 9.1 percent to 10.3 percent. Even a greater shift in outlays in favor of education and health is estimated to have occurred in the current expendi- ture. During 1995/96, outlays for education and health will continue to rise in real terms, and substantial resources have been allocated for vocational and job training programs. The safety net established to mitigate the adverse impact of adjustment on the most vulnerable groups has again received an allocation of M 10 million. The entire amount will be allocated in consultation with NGOs by December 1995. Performance criteria and benchmarks 24. The following quarterly targets would constitute performance criteria or benchmarks under the stand-by arrangement: (i) net domestic credit of the banking system, (ii) net bank credit to the Government, (iii) overall fiscal surplus, (iv) new nonconcessional borrowing, and (v) minimum cumula- tive increases in net official reserves; and the above quarterly targets for end-June 1995, end-September 1995, end-December 1995, and end-March 1996, in respect of items (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) would constitute quantitative performance criteria. The review of the program, to be completed no later than March 15, 1996, also constitutes a performance criterion. The review will examine progress in program implementation during the first half of the fiscal year, including the observance of benchmarks and performance criteria for end-September 1995. The quantitative performance criteria and bench- marks are set forth in the Annex, Table 1. With regard to benchmarks, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX II review discussions will assess progress in revising civil service laws, rules and regulations and Cabinet approval of LIPA's strategic plan, along with other benchmarks. The review discussions will also examine the recommendations of the expected September 1995 FAD technical assistance mission, with a view to reaching understandings on a timetable for the implementation of the recommendations. 25. In addition, the following structural measures, set forth in the Annex, would constitute as structural benchmarks under the stand-by arrangement: (i) the privatization of Security Lesotho by end-June 1995; (ii) the priva- tization of Parthenon Paints by end-September 1995; (iii) the privatization or reform of one other company from the list in paragraph 20 by end-December 1995; (iv) the transfer of the four companies to LIH by end-December 1995; and (v) the passage by Parliament of the Sales Tax Bill by end-June 1995. Items (i) and (ii) constitute performance criteria. 26. Lesotho will keep the Fund informed of the progress in the implementa- tion of its program. In particular, the Government will send to the Fund fiscal, money and credit, and balance of payments data on a regular basis. 27. During the program period, the Government does not intend to (i) impose or intensify any restrictions on payments and transfers for current inter- national transactions, (ii) introduce or modify multiple current practices, (iii) conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, or (iv) impose or intensify any restrictions on imports for balance of payments reasons.

Exchange Rate Arraneement Lesotho's currency, the loti (plural maloti), continues to be pegged at par to the South African currency, the rand. For the 12-month period ending March 1995 nominal effective exchange rate apperciated by 0.2 percent while the real effective exchange rate depreciated by about 0.7 percent, according to preliminary calculations. Lesotho maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current inter- national transactions in the form of limits on some payments to nonresi- dents, and on travel and emigrants' allowances. The Central Bank deals with commercial banks mainly in South African rand. As of end-June, 1995, the selling rate for the rand (maloti) was M 3.636~US$l. IX.

As of June 30, 1995 IDA has approved 22 credits amounting to USS206.73 million (original principal of US$160.53.0 million less cancellations of USS18.26 million), of which USS136.03 million had been disbursed, USS84.84 million remains und:ls- bursed, and US$161.00 million was outstanding (total disbursements less repayments adjusted for exchange rate changes). The Bank Group's first operation in Lesotho was approved in February 1966, a few months before the country (then known as Basutoland) became independent. To date, IDA has financed five projects in education; four in roads; two each in'agricul- ture/rural development, development finance, health/population, urban development, and water-supply; and one each in land management/conservation and industry. A privatization and parastatal reform credit in an amount of US$ll.O million was approved by the Bank Board during late-1994. IDA also supervised an agricultural marketing and credit project on behalf of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). IFC made one investment of US$330,000 in a quarrying operation. Approved and proposed IDA lending for the fiscal years 1992-96 totals $90 million; for the fiscal years 1992 and 1993, IDA commitments total $45 million, while an IBRD loan of $110 million was approved for the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) early in fiscal year 1992, of which USS42.76 has been disbursed and USS67.24 million remains undisbursed.

Lesotho - Medium-Term Proiections Section I provides a description of the main assumptions underlying the medium-term projections (1995/96-2000/01) embodied in the updated policy framework paper and the memorandum of economic and financial policies. Section II describes the results of the projections and some of the key economic and financial variables. Section III presents the sensitivity analysis. ' I. M& ASSUmDtiOnS bv Sector 1. Real sector a. Aggregate real GDP projections are derived from sectoral projections. The contribution of the LHWF to value added has been taken into accoun,t both directly, in the construction subsector, and indirectly, in its impact on the value added of the manufacturing subsector and the tertiary sector via iis effect on aggregate demand. Value added in agri- cultural sector is expected to resume steady growth in 1996/97, after a 12 percent decline in 1995/96, as both good weather and diversification into high value crops are assumed thereafter (Table I). b. Investment, excluding LHWP, is assumed to rise during the projec- tion period, from 36.5 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 40.8 percent in 2000/01. Private investment is assumed to increase from 27.1 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 31.7 percent of GNP in 2000/01, while public investment is assumed to decline slightly from 9.4 percent of GNP to 9.0 percent of GNP over the same period. Gross domestic inve.stment including LHWP is assumed to decline as a percentage of GNP over the forecast period from 59.6 percent in ,1995/96 to 49.7 percent in 2000/01, due mainly to reduced levels of investment associated with the LHWP project. LHWP investment is expected to decline by 14.2 percentage points of GNP during the forecast period, from 23.1 percent of-GNP in 1995/96 to 8.9 percent of GNP in 2000/01. C. Government consumption is derived from the projections of recurrent expenditure developed in the fiscal sector analysis. Government consumption is expected to increase gradually from 19.7 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 21.1 of GNP in 1998/99,.before declining during the last two years of the projection period to 20.7 percent of GNP and 19.8 percent of GNP, respectively. Private consumption as a percentage of GNP is projected to decline from 58.5 percent in 1995/96 to 56.1 percent in 1997/98 before stabilizing around 57.6 percent during the last three years of the projection period. d. On account of Lesotho's close economic links to South Africa, including its membership in the Common Monetary Area, price movements in Lesotho have generally moved roughly in accordance with price developments in that country. Consumer price inflation in Lesotho has followed a down- ward trend since 1990/91, which has brought the rate of inflation down to 7.0 percent in April 1994 over April 1993. However, the rate of consumer price inflation increased to 9.5 perc.ent in 1994/95 in line with renewed Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - inflationary pressures in South Africa and the effects of recent drought conditions on prices of fruits and vegetables. During the projection period, the rate of inflation is forecast to decline gradually to 5.5 per- cent by 2000/01, owing in part to reduced food prices resulting from antici- pa.ted changes in South African and domestic agricultural policies, and as good weather is assumed for the remainder of the projection period after 1995/96. 2. Central zovernment a. Customs revenue projections are based on the revenue sharing formula in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) that links Lesotho's share for a specific fiscal year to imports two years earlier (Table II). b. Noncustoms revenue projections reflect the revenue effect of revenue reforms. The 1993 revision of the income tax act broadened the tax base (the tax net was expanded, the rate schedule was simplified, and the rates were lowered). The sales tax act of 1995 broadens the tax base partly by lowering the threshold and more importantly, by an agreement between South Africa and Lesotho to collect each other's tax in their respective countries. Nontax revenue, fees, and administrative charges are projected to increase at a slower rate than GNP. C. The Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) for the period 1995/96-1997/98 and government estimates formed the basis for projecting grants, foreign borrowing, and capital expenditure. Grants are expected to increase nominally through 1997-98 and decline thereafter reflecting donors' aid policies. Capital expenditure is consistent with the absorptive capacity and prospective donor assistance and GOL contribution. d. With regard to current expenditure, wages and salaries are projected to stabilize at 11-12 percent of GNP. Interest payments are based on the amount payable on existing outstanding foreign debt and projections of new commitments. Expenditure on goods and services is projected to rise with nominal GNP. Socially related expenditure is projected to rise at a somewhat faster pace than GNP because of the Government's commitment under donor program to increase in real terms expenditure on education, health, and other social services. 3. External sector a. It is assumed that the Lesotho loti will remain pegged at par to the South African rand, and the rand/US$ exchange rate will depreciate slowly in real terms over the projection period. The nominal depreciation is projected to be about 4.4 percent in 1995/96. 1/ Thereafter it will depreciate at the average rate of about 3.8 percent a year. u In 1994/95, the depreciation of the rand vis-A-vis U.S. dollar in nominal terms was nearly 5 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX V b. The volume of exports, other than IHWP-related water and power sales is assumed to grow at an annual average rate of 15 percent (or by an annual average of 18 percent in U.S. dollar terms). C. Nominal values of all imports (excluding LHWP imports) have been projected to increase in line with increases in nominal GNP and the implementation schedule of the public sector investment projects (PSIP). d. All projections relating to the LHWP (e.g., LHWP imports of goods and services, grants, and long-term loans) are obtained from the Lesotho Highland Development Authority (LHDA). The projections reflect.the latest information available relating to Phases 1A and 1B of the LHWP. e. Workers' remittances have been projected to rise in line with projected trends in the number of Basotho miners employed in South Africa and their average wages. The number of miners is expected to remain constant in 1995/96, reflecting the steady prices for gold. Afterwards, the number of miners is projected to decrease by l-2 percent, reflecting a resumption of retrenchment. In 1995/96 and in 1996/97, wages are projected to grow slightly above South Africa's inflation rate (as measured by changes in CPI) reflecting the recent wage settlement between major mining companies and National Union of Miners. Thereafter, real wages are assumed to remain constant. f. Official unrequited transfers consist mainly of the SACU nonduty receipts and external grants associated with the public sector investment program (PSIP). Projected SACU revenue is based on the SACU formula, while SACU nonduty receipts are regarded as a constant proportion of total SACU receipts. For the first three years, projected grants are derived from the PSIP. For the remainder of the period, grants are assumed to grow in line with the growth in non-LHWP investment. g. Projections of long-term capital disbursements have been linked to financing of the PSIP and the LHWP investment programs. Amortization is calculated on loan commitments entered into prior to March 1995. However, it excludes LHWP loan commitments, which are to be serviced by South Africa under the agreement. Commitments entered into after March 1995 are assumed to have a grace period of at least seven years and thus do not have repayment obligations over the projection period. II. Main Results bv Sector 1. Real sector Real GDP grew by 13.5 percent in 1994/95, mainly owing to peak con- struction activity related to Phase 1A of the LHWP, expansion in manufactur- ing and an excellent mid-1994 harvest. For the projection period, real GDP is projected to grow at an average rate of 9.6 percent. Construction, manufacturing and handicraft, electricity and water, communications and transport are all expected to perform particularly well over the medium Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX V term, most tertiary sector industries are also expected to grow rapidly. After growing by 7.7 percent in 1995/96, real GNP is projected to continue to grow more slowly than GDP, as growth in miners' remittances continues to slow. Gross national savings (excluding IHWP transfers) are projected to decline over the projection period mainly on account of lower public savings, private savings are projected to stabilize around 29.8 percent of GNP during the projection period, and public savings are projected to decline gradually from 11.3 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 9.0 percent in 2000/01. Gross domestic investment is expected to decline from 59.6 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 49.7 percent of GNP in 2000/01, reflecting the imple- mentation pattern of the LHWP. Exclusive of the LHWP, gross domestic investment is targeted to rise gradually from 36.5 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 40.8 percent of GNP in 2000/01. 2. Central Government Customs revenue as a major contributor to the budget is expected to become less important beginning in 1997/98, reflecting the completion of the initial phase of the LHWP and enhancement of noncustoms revenue. Thus, cus- toms revenue will decline from 16.2 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 13.2 per- cent in 1997/98 and to about 8.5 percent in 2000/01. On the other hand, noncustoms revenue as a share of GNP is expected to rise from 12.7 percent in 1995/96 to 16.1 percent in 1997/98 and to 19.4 percent by the year 2000/01. The increase will stem from tight tax administration and broadening of the income tax and sales tax bases. Recurrent expenditure will rise from 20.8 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 21.9 percent of GNP in 1998/99, before declining during the last two years of the projection period to 21.4 percent of GNP and 20.1 percent of GNP, respectively. Capital expenditure will decline from 9.4 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 9.0 percent of GNP in 2000/01, reflecting the completion of the hydroelectric component of the LHWP. The overall budget surplus is projected to decline from 2.0 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to an overall balance in 1999/2000. An overall budget surplus of 0.5 percent of GNP is projected in 2000/01. 3. External sector The balance of payments projections indicate that the current account deficit (excluding LHWP-related transactions) will decline gradually during the period 1995/96-2000/01 (Table III). It will decline from 1.6 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to 1.2 percent of GNP in 1997/98, and to 1.0 percent of GNP by 2000/01. The trends in exports, imports, and miners' remittances will largely determine this outcome. Exports driven largely by garments, tex- tiles and leather products will grow at an average annual rate of 15 percent over the projection period. Regular imports (excluding LHWP-related imports), on the other hand, will grow at a modest average annual rate of about 5 percent during the same period and miners' remittances will fall in real terms. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V The overall balance payments will continue to generate surpluses throughout the projection period, mainly on account of export growth and a continued increase in unrequited transfers (including SACU nonduty receipts) and substantial capital flows associated with the financing of the LHWP. With the completion of Phase 1A of the LHWP capital flows will, however, go down in 1997/98 and 1998/99 before going up again in subsequent years as Phase 1B picks up. Over the projection period, the balance of payment surpluses will enable an accumulation of net official reserves to 7 months of imports by 1997/98 from the current level of about 5.2 months, and to 8.6 months of imports by 2000/01. The debt service ratio is projected to decline somewhat from about 4.8 percent of exports of goods and services (including miners' remittances) in 1995/96 to about 4.4 percent by 2000/01. III. Sensitivitv Analvsis Given Lesotho's vulnerability to exogenous shocks and the importance of the economic interlinkages with South Africa, an alternative scenario based on sensitivity analysis with respect to changes in SACU receipts, export earnings, flow of foreign investment, and workers' remittances is presented in Table IV. It is assumed that the nonduty component of the SACU receipts, which is the compensatory element in SACU revenue, would not be available to Lesotho beginning in 1996/97. Further, the growth in real exports and flow of foreign investment will be zero beyond 1995/96, owing to the loss of competitiveness that could result from hypothetical large increases in the private and public sector wages. Finally, the retrenchment of Basotho mine workers in South Africa is assumed to resume at an accelerated pace (at about 5 percent annually), dropping by 25 percent by the year 2000/01. The scenario is merely illustrative; it is not based on current staff or official thinking of what might happen. Under these assumptions, the overall budget balance would deteriorate from a surplus of about 2 percent of GNP in 1995/96 to a deficit of 5.4 per- cent by 1997/98 and to 10.7 percent by 2000/01; the external current account deficit would widen substantially from 1.6 percent of GNP in 1995.96 to 8.3 percent and to 16.6 percent during the same period; foreign exchange reserves would drop sharply during the projection years and would be almost depleted by 2000/01. In addition, the GNP would cease to grow in 1996/97 and decline substantially over the years through 2000/01. The analysis highlights the fragility of Lesotho's domestic and ex- ternal financial position and underscores the need to maintain the inter- linkages in their present form. It is apparent that the current high level of foreign exchange reserves would provide only limited relief. Under the scenario, Lesotho's economic viability would be seriously impaired, even under the assumption of strong adjustment measures.

The authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund, during missions and between consultations. However, technical assistance is required to make improvements in the timeliness and coverage of data in some specific areas, particularly national accounts (especially industrial production), prices, employment, and balance of payments statistics. 1. National accounts The Bureau of Statistics prepares historical national accounts data (annual only) based on surveys and information received from government departments and agencies. The quality of data, is satisfactory, but it is prepared with about one year's time lag. Fund missions typically make estimates of current year national accounts and projections of future years, in consultation with the relevant institutions. Sometimes, adjustments to historical data are made on the basis of available information. 2. Prices Consumer price data are prepared quarterly by the Bureau of Statistics and covers only the capital city, Maseru. The consumption weights used in the preparation of CPI are outdated and the weights are now being updated following completion of a household budget survey. Estimates for GDP/GNP deflators made by the Bureau, but sometimes, Fund missions revise them on the basis of the CPI and prices of imports and exports. 3. Government finance statistics Monthly data are provided by the Ministry of Finance on the Government revenue (and grants), current and capital expenditure, and its financing with appropriate disaggregation. The quality of data is good and the reporting lag is short. There is scope for further improvement in the reporting of capital expenditure. 4. Monetary statistics The staff is provided with the monetary survey and central bank balance sheet with a relatively short lag. The coverage of the monetary survey as well as the banking system is comprehensive. While the coverage of the quality of data is good, assessment of monetary conditions is complicated by the rand (South African currency, which is a legal tender in Lesotho), and there are no estimates of the rand in circulation. 5. Balance of oavments Detailed Balance of payments statistics are prepared by the Central Bank of Lesotho on a quarterly basis, and the time lag has been recently reduced to only about 3-6 months. The quality of the data is satisfactory, and areas where improvements are needed in developing a dependable method of estimating imports, given the porous border with South Africa, and in monitoring private foreign investment. For the remainder of the current year and future years, Fund missions usually make their own estimates and projections in consultation with the Central Bank.
