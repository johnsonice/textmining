Leipold (head), Demekas, Christofides, and Hamann, Ms. Shirai (EP), and Mr. Vargas as assistant (all EUl) held the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions in Athens during May 2-15, 1995. The mission met the Ministers of National Economy and of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, officials from the Ministries of National Economy, Finance, Industry, the Bank of Greece, and representatives of banks, employers, and trade unions. Messrs. Lanciotti and Coumbis, Executive Director and Alternate Executive Director for Greece, attended some of the meetings. At the conclusion of the last consultation on July 18, 1994, Directors had expressed grave concern at the persistence of macroeconomic imbalances and at signs of severe slippage in the 1994 budget. I. The Current Policy Setting Greece's economic performance has long been marred by the burden of a large fiscal imbalance. This imbalance has led to the accumulation of a massive public debt and, through its effect on domestic savings and investment (Box 1 and Chart l), has been the main factor behind the sluggish growth and high inflation relative to the EU. The latest effort to redress these problems began in-the early 1990s. The strategycentered on fiscal consolidation, an anti-inflationary,"hard drachma" policy (a depreciation against the ECU within the targeted inflation differential), and financial and external account liberalization. The PASOK government elected at end-1993 has maintained this strategy, distancing itself from the policies of the 1980s and placing convergence and EMU partigipation at the center of its program. Progress in 1990-94 has been inadequate on two main fronts: l Insufficent fiscal consolidation. While the primary adjustment has been substantial (10% percentage points of GDP in 1990-94; Table l), it has proved insufficient. As financial liberaltzation and the end of monetary financing raised funding costs, the overall balance barely improved and the debt ratio continued to rise. In 1994, despite early concerns, the budget targets were achieved through an intensification of the revenue collection effort and cuts in capital spending. Adjustment was thus brought back on track after the severe slippage associated with the 1993 elections.

The substantial drop in govemmem t saving during the 1980s explains most of the decrease in national saving (Chart 1, middle panel). An almost one-to-one fall in fixed capital formation has followed. l The observed crowding out of investment (clearly depicted by cl-year moving averages; Chart 1, bottom panel) has operated mostly through a reduction in the volume of saving rather than higher interest rates, as then have not heen market-determined during the period. See background paper for details of empirical research by the staff on this issue. a deficit of 13% percent of GDP and debt at 114 percent of GDP, the fiscal imbalance remains among the largest in the EU (Chart 2). h/ l Persistence of inflation. While, by early 1994, the tight stance of monetary policy had contributed to halving inflation from a peak of 20 percent in 1990, progress has since stalled, with inflation stuck at about 10 percent. The limits of tight monetary policy to secure further disinflation in the presence of lax fiscal policy are now manifest: the authorities will be hard- pressed to achieve the 1995 inflation target (7 percent by year-end). In an environment free of capital controls since mid-1994 and with a credible exchange rate target, high interest rates have attracted large private capital inflows (USs4.5 billion, or 4b percent of GDP, from July 1994 to March 1995). At the same time, two favorable developments have taken place: l ImDroved external position. The current account has strengthened, approaching balance in 1994 (Chart 3 and Table 2). The ratio of EU transfers to GDP remained stable in 1994, and the currentaccount improvement stemmed fully from a sharp increase in invisible receipts (mostly tourism). With strong capital inflows, official reserves rose to USS16.5 billion at end-June 1995. Some widening of the current account deficit is expected in 1995. l ImDrOVed short-term nrosnects. After a relatively shallow recession, a mild recovery started in 1994 (1% percent GDP growth) and is picking up in 1995 (close to 2 percent), mostly due to public and private investment growth, c I/ In a high-debt, high-inflation country such as Greece, the fiscal deficit is strongly affected by the impact.of inflation on interest payments. Corrected for inflation, the deficit in 1994 would be equal to 7 percent of GDP. The nature of the inflation impact, the-methodology of the correction, and EU country comparisons are presented in the background paper.

Unemployment has ceased to rise; nonetheless, growth performance continues to lag the EU. u While the turnaround since the last consultation was welcome, a shared tenet of the discussions was the insufficiency of the gains to date and the need for continued restraint and fiscal adjustment. The case for further adjustment rested on two grounds: first, the immediate need to balance the policy mix, given the evident limits of monetary policy alone to deliver the inflation target; and second, the need to relieve the medium-term burden on growth and investment exerted by the large fiscal imbalance. The discussions focussed on the policies required to achieve the 1995 budget and inflation targets, adhere to the authorities' convergence plan, and enhance the economy's long-term growth performance. 1. Policies for 1995 The 1995 budeet aims at reducing the central government deficit to 10% percent of GDP (including capitalized interest), with the primary surplus rising to 3.4 percent of GDP. The adjustment is to come mainly from expanding the tax base through improved tax administration and a'new presumptive tax on professionals, small businesses, and farmers. The expected 18% percent rise in revenues would more than offset the increase in capital spending due to the initiation of large infrastructure projects. The civil servant wage agreement is based OR the official inflation target. The staff endorsed the thrust of the 1995 budget and, in particular, the long-needed attempt to widen the tax base, improve enforcement, and promote greater equity of the tax system. The efforts underway in this area and the revenue performance to date (a 23b percent increase in the first five months of 1995 uver the same period of 1994) were encouraging. The staff nonetheless urged continued vigilance. There was still uncertainty about how VAT and the presumptive tax would perform (the assessments and payments for the latter would not be completed before mid-summer), as well as pressures for hiring and wage concessions, coming on top of recent court decisions with budget implications. u The authorities need to resist these pressures, monitor developments closely (especially on the wage bill), and take swift corrective measures if by mid-year the targets are in any doubt. Such measures should focus on current outlays, although there was also scope for a less ambitious investment budget. JJ The recovery may, however, be stronger than is currently estimated: staff work on a set of coincident economic indicators suggests that output <growth may have approached 2 percent already in 1994 (see background paper). 2/ These decisions mandated the re-hiring of staff (hired in the runup to the 1993 elections and then laid off) and the retroactive extension to all civil servants of a previously selective bonus. Two earthquakes since the discussions will also have a budgetary impact that remains to be quantified. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- The authorities acknowledged the expenditure pressures, but felt that the 1995 budget objectives were secure. As testimony to their commitment, they pointed to the achievement of the 1994 targets, despite initial skeptfcism, and the firmness with which the government resisted widespread protests against the presumptive tax in early 1995. Also, further efforts at strengthening tax administration were underway, with the preparation of a draft law on the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance, the strengthening of internal controls, the creation of a body of tax inspectors, and increased computerization. Although these changes would not have a large revenue impact before 1996, the authorities saw them as important qualitative signals of their intentions. In any event, they reiterated that they stood ready to act during the year if needed to safeguard the budget targets. Recently, the government announced a hiring freeze for the rest of the year, tariff increases for certain public utilities, and a phased payment of the retroactive bonuses (a total of 0.7 percent of GDP) over five years, starting in 1996. With a public debt as high as that of Greece, the authorities agreed that prudent debt maaaeernea was critical. The staff pointed to two sources of vulnerability of the fiscal accounts to swings in confidence, which could ultimately spill over to the balance of payments. First, foreign currency and foreign currency-linked debt amounted to over one-third of central government debt (or some 40 percent of GDP) at end-1994. Second, about two-thirds of drachma-denominated debt (almost 50 percent of GDP) was short-term or floating rate debt. The staff advised reducing foreign currency borrowing of all types and lengthening the debt's average maturity; it welcomed recent signs of investor interest in longer maturities. In addition, it urged the authorities to move faster in introducing auctions for government paper. The authorities agreed with some of these points. They were preparing to start government paper auctions, and the first such auction (of longer-term floating rate notes) was held at end-June. They did not, however, fully share the staff's concerns regarding the currency composition of the debt. Tf=Y pointed out that a large part of foreign currency debt was held by residents, including the Bank of Greece (bonds issued in 1994 to replace foreign exchange valuation differences). They saw potential risks arising mainly from debt held by nonresidents; but this amounted to about one-fifth of total debt, its share had not increased in 1994, and it was mostly at initial maturities of three years or more. At all events, the authorities intended to avoid net external borrowing. in 1995, but planned to implement this policy flexibly, with an eye to market conditions. They argued that recent financial market developments were reassuring: despite the downgrading by Moody's in May 1994, the Mexican crisis, and recent currency turbulence, the drachma had shown remarkable resilience and Greece enjoyed unchanged spreads in both the primary (110-150 basis points over LIBOR) and secondary markets. In conducting monetarv policy the Bank of Greece is using the exchange rate as its primary intermediate &get, while also specifying guidelines for the growth of key monetary and credit aggregates. In this setting, the liberalization of capital movements in May 1994 has left little room for the exercise of an independent monetary policy. Thus ) the Bank has implemented a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - cautious reduction in interest rates consistent with the targeted depreciation of the drachma: intervention rates declined by some 41r percentage points from end-1993 to mid-1995, allowing a commensurate fall in other key interest rates (Chart 4). The drachma depreciation against the ECU through end-1994 (5.6 percent) was on target. For 1995, the exchange rate objective has been formally announced for the first time (a 3 percent depreciation against the ECU by year-end) and developments so far are consistent with this. The growth of monetary aggregates has decelerated to within or below the announced ranges, but the significance of the aggregates has been eroded by financial innovation, tax-induced asset shifts, and measurement problems. Given the instability of the monetary aggregates and the convergence plan's objective of EMU participation, the staff viewed .the ,anchoring of monetary policy on the exchange rate as appropriate; an assessment of competitiveness also did not raise immediate concerns (Box 2 and Chart 5). Box 2. Competitiveness Xndicators and Extemal pertbrmonce , l The appreciation of the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) haa moderated in mt ym.

A detailed nssessment is included in the. background paper. The staff noted that the present situation highlighted the limits of relying exclusively on monetary policy to secure further reductions in inflation and stressed the need for supportive fiscal policy. Since mid-1994, the high level of interest rates, togefher with the enhanced credibility of the exchange rate target following the successful handling of the May 1994 currency crisis, have, attracted sizeable capital inflows. JJ The Bank has f JJ Net privafe inflows amounted to about 4h percent of GDP between mid-1994 and March 1995. Capital accpuqt data do not allow a detailed breakdown of the nature of the inflows, particularly between resident and nonresidents. An important part of the inflows nonetheless appears to be due to residents' operations, including Greek enterprise borrowing abroad.

The discussions reviewed the policy options for dealing with the inflows. Although the size of the.inflows has so far not been excessive for an economy the size of--:Greece,' cand recent interest rate reductions appear to have had a dampening effect,..it,was agreed that if these inflows persisted the Bank would be unable to control liquidity through sterilization alone. The staff stressed that the,first;best response would be a further fiscal tightening; however, .the government saw no scope for such action in the short run. Any imposition of capital controls was deemed inadvisable and viewed by the authorities as contrary 'to their EN-oriented policies. The discussions also explored the scope for a revision of the exchange rate target; but the authorities saw this as an unattractive option, wishing to maintain certainty about the‘preannouriced policy framework and safeguard the credibility it had gained. The discussions, thus focussed on the appropriate interest rate action in the near term. The staff took the view that the scope for interest rate reductions provUed.by the inflows should be used with caution, since--at least until demons.trable-gains in inflation and fiscal performance were made-- there wasa concrete risk 'of shaking market confidence. This approach was based on'the"$remiie,that;a-further moderate decline in interest rates would suffice to stem the capital inflows; if this were not the case, the conflict between the fiscal stance, the exchange rate objective, and the inflation target would become untenable, and the authorities would be forced to choose between yeining,in. fiscal policy,or an appreciation of the exchange rate. f Caution in interest rate reductions is also warranted by Greece's specific monetary.policy.zsetting: besides the usual intervention rates, other. key interest rates (e.g., money market rates), while market-related, are administratively set. In such a rigid environment, even small changes in interest-:rates, could be interpreted as being out of line with monetary conditions. 'The staff th~s'~elcomed recent moves toward greater market- determination of interest rates, such as the Bank's tenders for interbank deposits and the planned start of repo auctions; the first such auction was held in June. .In.terest rates on key government paper instruments, however, remain administratively set, and the staff urged even greater caution to the Treasury-,. wh.ich could ill-afford testing the market. The authorities were receptive to these-recommendations. .; .,_. 2. Outlook and-risks for 1996 and the medium term : Discussions on 1996 and beyond focussed on the policies that would be needed to correct domestic imbalances while allowing Greece to break out of its lackluster growth performance. The authorities' medium-term strategy is contained in the convernence D&Q for 1994-99 (Table 3). 'f!he plan's cornerstone is continuedband front-loaded fiscal consolidation to reduce the deficit to below-the Maastricht target by 1998 and attain EMU participation (the plan.is described and assessed in SM/94/151, Suppl. 1, 7/13/94).

To guard against such risk, the staff advised that the plan's fiscal targets be viewed as a minimum: if the economic environment is worse than planned, primary adjustment should be tightened to achieve the overall deficit targets; in the opposite case, the increased resources should be harnessed to improve on the plan's targets. Also, two shortcomings of the plan needed to be addressed: (a) its lack of specificity as to how the fiscal targets will be achieved, particularly in 1996, in which a further increase in revenues of lti percent of GDP is envisaged; and (b) its optimistic interest rate assumption. The 12-month Treasury bill rate (15.75 percent in mid-1995) is projected to decline to an average lOti percent in 1996 and further thereafter. Given the WE0 interest rate assumptions, this would imply a reduction in the differential with Germany from some 11 percentage points at present to 5 percentage points in 1996. Moreover, the plan's assumed privatization receipts did not materialize in 1994 and are uncertain for 1995; instead, part of the outstanding guaranteed debt (9 percent of GDP at end-1994) is likely to be taken over by the government in coming years. The staff's medium-term scenario discussed with the authorities (Table 3; and background paper) suggests that, under a more cautious interest rate assumption, the plan's primary surplus targets would not achieve the deficit and debt objectives. For this, substantial additional adjustment would be required in 1996 (when the primary surplus would need to rise to over 5 per- cent of GDP) and beyond, with a cumulative primary adjustment over the program period some lh percentage points of GDP above that envisaged in the convergence plan. The discussions were thus directed to identifying the measures that would underpin the plan's targets and, in particular, the 1996 budeet. As with the presumptive tax (which was legislated in April 1994 and took effect in 1995), the staff suggested introducing measures now that would take effect in the future. Regarding the nature of the measures, there was agreement that the reliance on expanding the tax base was appropriate, given Greece's marked weakness in this area (Chart 6). Indeed, more could be done by tightening tax controls, extending the presumptive tax, and reducing the plethora of tax exemptions. The staff also stressed the scope for expenditure cuts, noting that gains in tax administration have proved elusive; the experience of other countries (e.g., Ireland) has shown that permanent expenditure cuts strengthen the credibility of the adjustment effort; and there is room for savings in personnel, entitlements, and transfers to public entities and enterprises. Reacting to the staff's medium-term exercise, the authorities observed that interest rate assumptions are subject to large uncertainties. Successful policy implementation could allow a sizeable reduction in interest rate premia; indeed, the decline in Treasury bill rates in 1994-95 had already shaved 4 percentage points from the differential with Germany. At all events, they assured the staff that the 1996 budget would be based on a cautious interest rate assumption which--as in 1995--would likely be above that of the convergence plan. While not committing to the primary surplus target for 1996 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - indicated by the staff, they acknowledged the need for considerable further effort; in this light, budget preparations had started early this year. The authorities concurred on the need to contain spending, noting that the convergence plan envisaged an annual reduction in real government consumption of 0.5 percent; the budget preparations were also focussing on cutbacks in unnecessary public agencies. The authorities saw limits, however, to wage compression in the public sector where real incomes had fallen continuously since 1990, and a small catchup was contemplated for 1996. Overall, the main emphasis would continue to be on revenues, where the concerted effort to expand the tax base was generating a change in the public's perception of the fairness of the tax system which, in turn, would contribute to greater compliance. Beyond its immediate revenue effects, the authorities saw this qualitative change as a key achievement of their fiscal policy to date. The authorities confirmed the objective of joining the ERM. In response to staff queries about the feasibility of the tight timetable indicated in the convergence plan (mid-1996), they viewed public announcements of the precise timing as inadvisable, but reaffirmed the plan's objective of joining in time for EMU participation by 1999. The staff stressed the demanding conditions for a successful entry: notably a sizeable and permanent reduction in inflation, convincing progress in fiscal consolidation, and a sustainable competitive position. The authorities concurred, and saw these conditions as providing useful policy discipline. On legislating central bank independence, the authorities confirmed the intention of observing the Maastricht timetable, but felt that the importance of the issue justified further study. While there was agreement that macroeconomic adjustment needed to be accompanied by deep structural reforms to improve Greece's disappointing growth performance, views differed on the scope and pace of reform. The authorities' efforts were focussed on the reform of the tax system and administration, and on initiating the EU-financed infrastructure projects. They were encouraged by the resolution of outstanding issues with the EU and, aware of the importance of an efficient use of the funds, had appointed a government committee to coordinate project implementation. The government intended to sell off the few remaining state-owned industrial companies, and to carry out the planned privatization of part of DEP (petroleum) and a scaled-down version of that of OTE (telecommunications) by end-1995 (with an initial domestic sale of 10 percent of the shares of each company). No other privatization of public utilities was being planned, but--in an effort to improve the performance and services provided--a law to strengthen public enterprise control and increase management accountability was being prepared. The staff welcomed these initiatives, but called for bolder action, particularly in reforming the state enterprise sector and in privatization. On the former, there were glaring inadequacies in the accounting practices of many public entities and enterprises, which impeded a rational tariff policy and limited management accountability. The staff also urged greater ambition on privatization, starting with the delayed OTE flotation and expanding to other public companies and--importantly--banks. On labor market issues, the discussions explored the scope for supporting disinflation through greater flexibility in the wage formation process, which is characterized by a short Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8a - Chart 6 Greece Comparisons of General Government Revenues and Expenditures (In percent of GDP) 40 40 Direct Tax Revenue (1992) 30 30 20 20 10 10 0 0 ‘ip, 60 “9 60 Total Tax Revenue (1992) I/ 50 I- - sn -- 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 10 0 0 70 60 50 50 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 10 0 0 Sources: OECD data; European Economy, 1994; and staff estimates. l/ Excluding social security contributions.

Both the social partners and the authorities were, however, disinclined to consider changes in the current system, which they felt had worked well and contributed to industrial peace. Finally, the staff noted that the poor quality of some economic data (notably the balance of payments and general government accounts) hampered analysis and interpretation in certain areas (Appendix). III. Staff Aooraisal Greece is again at a familiar crossroad, at which early gains in addressing the severe macroeconomic imbalances give rise to premature calls for a relaxation of policies. The country's recent economic history is dotted with episodes where such calls have been inadvisably heeded: in the process, the initial efforts were wasted, confidence and credibility were lost, and building consensus for a new start became more difficult. Recent favorable financial market trends (lower interest rates at home, unchanged market conditions abroad, and exchange rate stability in the midst of currency turbulence) reflect the authorities' efforts in 1994 and thus far in 1995, but the maintenance of market confidence rests on the perception that such efforts will continue. Given the scale of the imbalances, any change to this perception could trigger a confidence crisis that could affect government funding and the balance of payments. This is the risk the authorities need to guard against. The authorities' assurance of their full commitment to the convergence program is thus a welcome and essential guide for future action. The implementation of the 1995 budget to date is encouraging. But there are uncertainties about the yield of the presumptive tax and VAT, and mounting expenditure pressures, while recent earthquakes will have budget implications. The pressures on the expenditure side will need to be resisted with the same determination shown vis-a-vis the protests against the new presumptive tax. If by mid-year the realization of the budget targets is in any doubt, the government should take swift corrective measures, preferably focussed on expenditures. Prudent debt management is also vital: the vulnerability inherent in the currency composition and maturity structure of the debt must be addressed by reducing reliance on foreign currency borrowing of all types and exploiting the signs of greater investor interest in longer maturities. The recent start of government paper auctions is welcome. Looking ahead, the magnitude of the country's fiscal imbalances and its track record place'an additional onus on the authorities in maintaining market confidence. This implies full adherence to the convergence plan targets: with interest rates likely to be higher than assumed, a larger primary surplus will be required. Moreover, the targets should be viewed as a minimum, seizing any opportunity to improve on them: in Greece's situation, the scope for virtuous-circle effects on confidence and investment induced by more rapid fiscal consolidation is substantial. A timely identification of the measures underlying the plan's targets would help bolster its credibility. Measures should be prepared and announced early, and designed to have an increasing impact over time. Continued emphasis on expanding the tax base is justified, but there is also room for savings in personnel, transfers, and entitlements.

The prudent stance of monetary policy has contributed importantly to disinflation. The unbalanced policy mix has, however, complicated the conduct of monetary policy, as illustrated by the strength of capital inflows and a level of sterilization that has considerable quasi-fiscal costs and eventual limits to its effectiveness. This constitutes an additional. argument for reining in fiscal policy, which remains the first-best response. Given the lack of further progress in disinflation, the Bank of Greece should continue to proceed cautiously in lowering interest rates in response to the capital inflows. If a moderate decline in interest rates were, however, not to suffice to stem the inflows, the choice between fiscal tightening and exchange rate appreciation would become inescapable. Recent moves to enhance the market-determination of key interest rates are welcome. Although there are now no perceptible competitiveness problems, the. sustainability of an exchange rate-based disinflation strategy rests on consistent wage moderation. The public sector can and should set an example, but it is the responsibility of the social partners to ensure wage settlements in line with the inflation target and the maintenance of competitiveness. Longer wage contracts based on targeted inflation and more limited use of catch-up clauses could contribute importantly towards these objectives. The prospects for eventual ERM entry depend also on the same requirements. Structural reform efforts must be strengthened if Greece is not to remain a laggard in Europe and be unprepared for the likely reduction in EU transfers after 2000. In particular, the role of the state in the economy should be reduced, with firm action in two areas: tightening,discipline and increasing management accountability of public enterprises and entities--as a first step, full audits should be conducted and accounting practices improved; and stepping up privatization and expanding its scope to include banks. Finally, efforts to address shortcomings in the quality of certain economic data, which hamper analysis and interpretation in some areas (particularly, in the present context, with respect to capital flows), need to be intensified. Recent developments are welcome, but the gains remain clearly inadequate. The period ahead involves a number of key tests: the achievement of the 1995 fiscal and inflation targets, the preparation of a 1996 budget confirming the ability to deliver the convergence plan targets, and further progress in line with the plan's cornerstone of DiIJ participation. For success on each of these fronts there is no alternative to a policy of continued firm restraint. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Greece be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The authorities have an open publication policy and are fully cooperative with the Fund. There are, however, weaknesses in the quality of some data which, while not impeding surveillance, hamper detailed analysis and interpretation in certain areas. This Appendix highlights the problem areas and the remedial action planned; Table 4 reviews the core data. 1. putstand- statistical issues National accounts have recently been revised to conform to the European System of Accounts (ESA) with assistance from EUROSTAT. This,has significantly extended coverage and enhanced.consistency and quality. But data are annual and exist only for 1988 and 1989, with estimates through 1994 (data for 1994 have not been reported for IFS publication). The authorities are working on extending the series, but there are no plans for increasing its frequency. Reliable ve m data (on both accrual and cash basis) exist for the budgetary central government, and full reconciliation with monetary data is possible. But the quality of data on several public entities, which perform functions of the central government, and on public enterprises is poor: they are available with long lags, and there are large discrepancies between accruals and cash. This affects the quality of the data for general government and impedes their full reconciliation with monetary data. The problem is caused by inadequate accounting practices (many entities do not have audited balance sheets for several years) and reporting weaknesses. The authorities have started to 'address this issue, initially by clarifying the financial relations between central government and entities. Moreover, they have carried out (or plan) full audits for some major public enterprises. Balance of Daymentg.data on a settlements.basis are available on a monthly basis relatively quickly, while customs data on trade in goods and non-factor services have longer lags (lags also exist in reporting trade volumes and unit values for IFS publication, due to the ongoing shift in data collection from customs to enterprise surveys).‘ Settlements data, however,. are increasingly less reliable because of the effects of-financial..and capital account liberalization and the surge.in drachma-.denominated trade with Balkan countries on the traditional data collection and classification methods (this issue was reviewed in detail in .Appendix IV ~to SM/94/151). Capital account data also have a number of weaknesses (lacking, for example, a distinction between resident and nonresident flows). The Bank of Greece has begun a comprehensive overhaul of the balance of payments statistics to improve them and make them consistent with the Fifth Balance of Payments Manual, in cooperation with several European central banks and EUROSTAT. 2. mica1 assistace missions kstatistics (1992-oresenti: None Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public.
