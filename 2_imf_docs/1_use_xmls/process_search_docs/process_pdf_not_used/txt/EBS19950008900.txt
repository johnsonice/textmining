Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation, the mid-term review under the first annual ESAF arrangement, and on a revised economic program for 1995 were held in Georgetown during December 6-16, 1994 and April 6-13, 1995. 1/ On July 20, 1994 the Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 53.8 million (80 percent of quota), and the first annual arrangement thereunder in an amount equivalent to SDR 17.9 million (26.7 percent of quota). On April 30, 1995 outstanding Fund credit to Guyana amounted to SDR 114.3 million, or 170.1 percent of quota (Table 1). The revised economic program for 1995 is described in the attached Memorandum on the Economic and Financial Policies of Guyana (Memorandum), transmitted to the Managing Director with a letter from the Minister of Finance (ag) and the Governor of the Bank of Guyana (also attached). On the basis of actions already taken and the policies being pursued, Guyana has requested waivers for the nonobservance of two structural performance criteria. Provided that the Executive Board grants these waivers, SDR 8.95 million (13.4 percent of quota) would become available for disbursement upon completion of the review. The 1993 Article IV consultation with Guyana, which is on the 12-month cycle, was concluded by the Executive Board on February 28, 1994 (SM/94/44 and SUR 94/19). u At that time, Directors commended the authorities on the progress made in the implementation of the economic program under the ESAF arrangement that expired December 20, 1993 but expressed disappointment at the sluggish pace of structural reform, particularly in the area of privatization. Directors also emphasized the need for further strengthening of the public finances beyond 1994 and were encouraged by the Paris Club's commitment to consider a stock-of-debt operation for Guyana by May 1996. u The staff team consisted of A. M. Jul (Head), M. Torres, J. Aziz (EP), E. Faal (all WHD), H. Cartes (INS), and B. Aitken (PDR) in the December mission, and A. M. Jul (Head), M. Torres, J. Aziz, and E. Faal (all WHD) in the April mission. 2/ Guyana maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agree- ment on December 27, 1966. Appendix II provides detailed information on the Fund's relations with Guyana. The financial relations of the World Bank Group with Guyana are detailed in Appendix III.

Recent Developments and Performance Under the ProPram Macroeconomic performance continued to be satisfactory in 1994 and was stronger than envisaged in the program. JJ Real GDP expanded by about 8 percent for the third consecutive year despite a sharp. decline in bauxite production, reflecting strong growth in rice, gold, timber, and construc- tion (Table 2). The rate of inflation doubled to 16 percent, exceeding the program target of 10 percent, reflecting developments in international commodity markets. 2J These included higher prices for imports of oil and wheat, and a strong external demand for rice, which contributed to a sharp increase in the domestic price. Guyana observed all quantitative performance criteria for end-September 1994 and financial benchmarks for end-December 1994 (Table 3). However, the performance criteria on management arrangements for the electricity company (GEC) and electricity tariffs were not met. Also, slippages have occurred regarding structural benchmarks and measures, including on the exchange system, privatization, tax reform and administration, restructuring of a public sector bank (GNCB), legislation pertaining to financial sector reform, and statistical issues (Table 4). 1. Public sector The overall deficit of the public sector narrowed by about half to 11.4 percent of GDP in 1994, compared with 18.6 percent in the program (Table 5). 2/ This improvement, however, reflected shortfalls in the exe- cution of the investment program 4J which resulted in a decline in capital outlays from 18.9 percent of GDP in 1993 to 11.4 percent in 1994, compared with little change in the program. Public savings improved by 4.8 percent- age points of GDP, in line with the program, as a smaller-than-programmed current primary surplus was offset by lower external interest obligations. Reflecting less use of local funds for investment outlays than programmed, the stock of domestic public debt declined further by 2.7 percentage points of GDP in 1994, whereas the program contemplated a small increase. The central government current primary surplus remained at about 12 percent of GDP in 1994, with a shortfall in revenues being largely offset by containment in current expenditure (Table 6). Current revenue declined from 29.1 percent of GDP in 1993 to 27.7 percent in 1994, mainly because of JJ The program for 1994 referred to in this report is described in EBS/94/136 (6/30/94). u The publication of a consumer price index which ceased in 1989 was resumed in December 1994. 2/ Nominal GDP numbers have been adjusted upwards from 1989 onwards on the basis of revised data from Guyana's Bureau of Statistics. 4J The shortfalls resulted from the need to redesign some projects, setbacks on the bidding and procurement process, and timely availability of critical equipment.

This reflected a stagnation of imports associated with the decline in public investment outlays, and the effect of tariff reductions under the Common External Tariff (GET) and on certain capital goods. In contrast, collections from personal income tax and consumption taxes on domestic goods grew significantly faster than GDP, driven by large public and private wage increases. Central government current noninterest expenditure declined from 17.1 percent of GDP in 1993 to 15.5 percent in 1994. u A reduction in transfers to international and private local organizations, and to the private sector following completion of an IDB-financed program of cash assistance to low-income groups, more than offset an increase in expenditure on goods and services other than wages. u The wage bill expanded in line with GDP in 1994, increasing by about 10 percent in real terms, reflecting increases granted under the PAP, 3J an adjustment in the minimum wage of 28.5 percent, and special salary increases for teachers and other groups. The current primary surplus of the rest of the public sector improved by half a percentage point of GDP in 1994 to 7.3 percent, reflecting a strengthening in the financial position of the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) and the Bank of Guyana (BOG), while the operating surplus of the state enterprises declined slightly (Table 7). The improvement in the NIS arose from the economy-wide higher wages and increases in the ceiling of maximum insurable incomes which more than offset the increase in benefit payments, and in the BOG, from lower minting costs. The sugar company (GUYSUCO), GEC, and the smaller companies performed in line with the program, while the bauxite companies had a current primary deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP com- pared with a surplus of 1 percent in the program because of a worsening of conditions in the international market. Electricity tariffs were adjusted by 17 percent in August 1994; however, after accounting for the increase in the international price of fuel, the net effect was 3 percent compared with a performance criteria of 20 percent. Also, further delays occurred with respect to the management arrangements for GEC which were to have been in place by September 1994. The operating deficit of GEC, however, was contained in 1994 at the level envisaged in the program by reducing expenditures on repair and maintenance, strengthening collection efforts, and limiting technical losses (paragraph I/ Military expenditure has amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP a year over 1992-94, of which 40 percent represented wages and wage-related expenses. 2/ These expenditures had borne the brunt of the adjustment, declining from 9.5 percent of GDP in 1989 to 5.9 percent in 1993. J/ The Public Administration Project (PAP), funded by IDA/ODA, included a decompression and upgrading of the salary scale, integration of special remuneration practices, rationalization of allowances, measures to eliminate labor redundancies, and incentives for repatriating skilled Guyanese to work in the public service. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 16 of the Memorandum). These improvements notwithstanding, the need for transfers to GEC was not eliminated at end-1994 as agreed under the program. Although three of the four enterprises to be privatized in 1994 were brought to the point of sale, none was sold. In addition to these enter- prises, the Government has identified 6 other companies to be privatized in 1995, and is conducting studies on the environmental impact of privatization on 11 of the 30 companies scheduled for privatization (paragraph 18 of the Memorandum). Also, the Government has been actively seeking a core investor for LINMINE, lJ and agreement was reached with international financial advis- ors to help develop a restructuring and privatization program for GUYSUCO. A one-stop shop for investors, GO-INVEST,, was established in September 1994 to speed private investors through government regulations and facili- tate investment in Guyana. 2. Financial sector The net domestic assets of the BOG (excluding valuation adjustments) contracted by G$2 billion during 1994, compared with a GS2.3 billion increase envisaged in the program, reflecting the outturn for the nonfinan- cial public sector and the placement of government securities outside the banking system (Table 8). Broad money growth decelerated to 17 percent from 28 percent in 1993, partly as a result of a sharp increase in holdings of government securities by individuals (Table 9). Growth of bank credit to the private sector slowed from 17 percent in 1993 (as a percent of broad money at the beglnnlng of the period) to 15 percent in 1994. The average interest rate on three-month treasury bills remained at about 16 percent through June 1994, rose to 20 percent in August 1994 reflecting measures to tighten liquidity, and declined to below 19 percent by December 1994, remaining at that level thereafter. Private sector holdings of financial assets have increased steadily since 1991, mainly reflecting market-determined interest rates that have been posl.tive in real terms and competitive wi.th external rates. This, together with increased competition among banks and the use of indirect instruments of monetary control by the BOG, have contributed to a reversion of the process of currency substitution against the Guyana dollar since mid- 1991, an increase in financial intermedIation, and the development of an interbank market in liquid funds. Broad money rose from 33 percent of GDP in 1991 to 48.5 percent in 1994, while private sector holdings of financial instruments (broad money, government securities, and claims on nonbanks) increased from 49 percent of GDP to about 68 percent over that period. Moreover, the proportion of broad money lent to the private sector by lJ The Privatization Unit has taken up the divestment of LINMINE because the IDA-funded Initial Restructuring Phase (IRP) project for the company was completed at end-1994, and no funds are available for hiring an investment banker for this purpose as intended originally.

To strengthen monetary management and contribute to the development of a secondary market in government securities, the BOG eliminated the remunerated Special Reserve Deposits Facility in December 1994, established a money-market division in January 1995 2/, and is refining the framework for short-term monetary programming to strengthen the linkages to the finan- cial program. Also, the draft bill of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA) was approved by Parliament in January 1995, but its enactment requires approval of reforms to other Acts which is pending. To help strengthen and modernize the regulatory and supervisory framework, the Fund has been providing technical assistance in the form of a bank supervisor and a bank inspector. The action plan for the financial and operational merger of GNCB and the development bank (GAIBANK), which was to have been adopted starting July 1994, was agreed with the IDB and IDA in March 1995. 3. External sector a. Exchange system Progress toward achieving full integration of the official and cambio exchange markets has been mixed. On the receipts side, the exchange surren- der requirements of the sugar company (GUYSUCO) and of gold exports chan- nelled through the Gold Board were reduced from 70 percent to 60 percent in November 1994, and to 50 percent in April 1995 as agreed under the program. On the payments side, the Government has been reluctant to proceed with the transfer of transactions to the cambio market for fear of exerting pressure on the exchange rate. Action on these transfers has been delayed from January 1995 to September 1995. Problems also developed with the functioning of the cambio market over the past 15 months. In early 1994, in response to government pressure to hold exchange rates, bank dealers did not adjust their rates to reflect market conditions. As a result, queuing developed for foreign exchange from the banks, the differential between the rates offered by bank and nonbank dealers increased, and a margin of about 10 percent developed between the 1/ Two new banks commenced operations in November 1994, while two of the existing banks are expanding their operations. Reflecting the increase in competition, banks reduced their lending rates and spreads in 1994, and have introduced new financial instruments and services including ATM machines. u This division has been structured along the lines recommended in a report prepared by a consultant financed by the Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - bank exchange rate and the street market rate. u Reflecting the return to a hands-off position by the Government, the cambio exchange rate depreciated by 7 percent in nominal terms during April-June 1994, queuing subsided, and the margins among exchange rates returned to normal levels. However, queuing in the bank exchange market reappeared in. October and rose steadily through February 1995. Bank dealers did not adjust their rates during this period while the nonbank exchange rates experienced fluctua- tions, with the spread between these rates and the bank rates at some points reaching the levels experienced in February-March 1994. Although reportedly no 'pressures were being exerted by the authorities on bank dealers to hold the rates, banks appear to have been acting under the presumption that the BOG would be selling foreign exchange into the cambio market to reduce the queuing and hold the exchange rate, particularly in view of the continued accumulation of official gross reserves. Queuing has declined since March partly reflecting the impact of export receipts of rice. A further problem has been the difficulties encountered in the devel- opment of an interbank market in foreign exchange. While nonbank dealers trade routinely among themselves, bank dealers appear to continue to use foreign exchange sales to attract banking business. This has been exacer- bated over the past year by the entering of new banks into the system, and because of guidelines imposed in 1994 by one of the publicly owned banks prohibiting sales of foreign exchange to other bank dealers. Reflecting these developments, the value of the Guyana dollar during 1994 declined by 8.5 percent in relation to the U.S. dollar and by 1.5 per- cent in real effective terms, for a real effective depreciation of 13 per- cent since 1989 (Chart 1). b. Balance of navments Both the trade and current accounts of the balance of payments improved mar'kedly in 1994 because of lower imports in connection with the decline in public investment outlays noted above (Table 10). The capital account turned from a large surplus into a small deficit, and the BOG experienced exchange valuation losses. u The deterioration in the capital account resulted from a decline in disbursements of project loans, higher amortiza- tion payments reflecting obligations from the May 1989 Paris Club agreement, and reduced inflows from commercial banks. The overall deficit widened to US$53 million and was more than covered by exceptional financing (including to the BOG), consisting mainly of debt relief which exceeded that envisaged u Th:Ls market is operated by unlicensed (illegal) dealers, with trans- actions effected mainly by those wishing to avoid documentation for purposes of tax evasion or because they stem from illegal activities.

Official gross international reserves increased by US$23 million to US$269 million (nine months of imports), compared with a loss of US$8 millLon targeted in the program. The public external debt increased slightly to US$2.‘1 billion in 1994, but declined relative to exports of goods and services from 483 percent in 1993 to 469 percent in 1994, with debt to multilateral agencies remaining at 45 percent of the total. Scheduled debt-service obligations remained at 38 percent of exports of goods and services in 1994, but actual debt-service payments declined from 25 percent in 1993 to 22 percent in 1994. All btlateral agreements under the 1993 Paris Club Agreed Minute have been completed. The Government has requested that the Paris Club creditors consider a stock-of-debt operation in 1995 to obtain the financing required for 1995, attain medium-term viability, and facilitate comparable agreements with non-Paris Club creditors. If such operation is not deemed feasible, Guyana has requested an extension of the consolidation period under the terms of the May 1993 Paris Club Agreed Minute to close the financing gap projected for 1995. 4. Statistical issues Guyana's system of macroeconomic statistics remains deficient despite progress made in (a) enhancing the capabilities of the Bureau of Statistics by increasing the number of statisticians, improving physical and computer facilities, and placing its wages outside the salary scale of the public service; (b) expanding the Research Department of the BOG; (c) improving the data collection and publication facilities of the BOG; and (d) resuming publication of a new consumer price index in December 1994. In contrast, the Ministry of Finance's infrastructure for data compilation has deterior- ated because of loss of personnel, lack of adequate computer facilities, and elimination of the Public Corporations Secretariat in mid-1993 which has resulted in a weakening in the monitoring of the performance of the state enterprises and of the implementation of the public sector investment program. Regarding technical assistance in this area, the Fund will finance an advisor in balance of payments statistics for six months beginning June 1995, and ODA is prepared to provide long-term assistance on national income accounts but delays have occurred in reaching agreement on the terms of reference. III. The Economic ProPram for 1995 The economic program for 1995 is based on a real GDP growth of 5.5 percent while seeking to reduce inflation to 7.5 percent. Further strong growth is projected for gold, rice, forestry, financial services, and construction, while bauxite production is expected to increase reflecting improved external market conditions. Market-determined prices, except for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - sugar and electricity tariffs, will continue to prevail and no new price controls or subsidies will be introduced during 1995. The targeted increase in public investment and related imports would partly reverse last year's gain in international reserves; however, reserves would amount to US$254 million at end-1995, or the equivalent of 7.4 months of imports. A high level of reserves is needed in view of Guyana's heavy foreign debt and large debt-service burden, and the vulnerability of its balance of payments to reductions in the preferential prices granted by the European Union for sugar and rice exports. To achieve the program's objectives, the Government will continue to pursue fiscal adjustment and prudent credit policies, while deepening struc- tural reforms. The program for 1995 also seeks to bring back on course poli- cies in areas where slIppages have occurred, and envisages further integra- tion of the exchange market, the intensification of privatization efforts, the prioritization of infrastructure outlays, continued reform of the finan- cial sector, and a prudent debt-management strategy. Particularly important will be efforts to strengthen the central institutions of economic manage- ment, namely the Ministry of Finance, the BOG, and the Bureau of Statistics to improve the authorities' ability to execute their program and monitor developments. Guyana has been receiving technical assistance in these areas and on related issues from multilateral and bilateral agencies, including the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department, the Statistics Department, and the Legal Department of the Fund. Guyana's capacity to absorb such assis- tance has been hampered by shortages of skilled labor in the public service as efforts to attract and retain the counterparts required is made difficult by the low level of wages, despite selective wage adjustments to key positions. 1. Exchanne and trade policies The Government will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy and will refrain from intervening in the cambio market, including through moral suasion to stabilize the exchange rate. u Also, in line with its objective to attain integration by end-1996 of the official and cambio exchange markets, by September 1995 the Government will define a timeta- ble for further reduction of surrender requirements and proceed to start transferring pa-ent transactions to the cambio market. In addition, the Exchange Control Act or sections thereof that are inconsistent with the current liberalized exchange regime will be abolished by December 1995. The second phase of the reduction in the CET will be implemented by June 1995, with the maximum tariff to be lowered from 30 percent to 25 percent.

The nrivatization orozram Since mid-1994 the Government has made progress in the implementation of its privatization program as described in paragraphs 18 through 21 of the Memorandum. L/ Divestment receipts are projected at 1.2 percent of GDP for 1995, which will be used to finance public investment outlays and retire domestic debt. With regard to the larger enterprises, the Government plans to bring LINMINE to the point of sale in 1995, and intends to submit to IDA the pro- posed regulatory framework for GUYSUCO by September 1995. The management contract with Booker Tate is in effect until December 1995, and a management contract for GUYSUCO on terms agreed with the World Bank will be maintained until the restructuring and privatization program is completed. 3. Fiscal oroeram The current primary surplus of the public sector is targeted to increase by 2.8 percentage points of GDP in 1995 to 22.3 percent, with the improvement stemming from the public enterprises (see Table 5). Investment outlays would rise by 6 percentage points of GDP, reflecting implementation of projects delayed from 1994. The overall deficit would widen by 2.3 per- centage points of GDP to 13.7 percent in 1995, to be covered by external project financing, larger use of resources from multilateral agencies, and further rescheduling of debt obligations while the stock of domestic public debt would increase by 0.7 percent of GDP. The central government current primary surplus is targeted to remain at 12 percent of GDP in 1995 (see Table 6). Current revenue would increase by half a percentage point of GDP reflecting tax administration measures implemented in 1994, tax measures adopted in the context of the 1995 budget, and additional strengthening in tax administration in 1995 as described in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Memorandum. Noninterest current expenditure would rise to 16.2 percent of GDP, with the wage bill rising to the equiva- lent of 6.9 percent of GDP. The annualization of wage increases granted in 1994, and an across-the-board adjustment of 16 percent effective January 1, 1995 would increase the wage bill by 15 percent in real terms in 1995. The Government will not grant additional general wage increases in 1995, with selective wage adjustments and merit increases to depend on productivity IJ The Government reached agreement with IDA and the IDB on the conditions required for Board presentation by June 1995 of the Private Sector Development Adjustment Credit (PSDAC) and a financial sector reform loan, respectively. These include conditions for the privatization of the financial and smaller commercial enterprises and on the action plan for the restructuring of GNCB.

Expenditure in goods and services other than wages would remain constant relative to GDP in 1995, while transfers to local and international organizations would decline marginally. The program seeks to increase the current primary surplus of the rest of the public sector by about 3 percentage'points of GDP to 10.2 percent of GDP in 1995. Two thirds of the improvement would come from GUYSUCO, a fourth from the bauxite companies, and the rest from GEC and Guyana Airways which would more than offset a slight deterioration in the position of other smaller enterprises, the NIS, and the BOG. The improved performance of GUYSUCO would arise from an increase in the international price of sugar, strengthening in the pound sterling and the ECU vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, an expansion of preferential markets for sugar exports, and a containment of operating expenditures. The bauxite companies also are expected to show an improvement in 1995 as the world market is experiencing some recovery and efforts to reduce operating expen- ditures continue, with their current primary deficit turning into a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP. The operating deficit of GEC would decrease to 0.2 percent of GDP in 1995, and the need for transfers will be eliminated by mid-year through the implementation of the measures described in paragraph 16 of the Memorandum. Should these measures prove to be insufficient to limit transfers to GEC to G$145 million in 1995, the Government will take compensating actions in regard to central government current expenditure during the second half of 1995. Regarding the management arrangements for GEC, one consultant on the technical side was hired in January 1995; however, the general manager, appointed in July 1994, resigned in early May 1995. The authorities have requested the IDB's assistance in identifying a replacement as well as in filling the financial and commercial manager positions (paragraph 17 of the Memorandum). The authorities expect to have a full management team in place by July 1995. Also, agreement has been reached with the IDB on the terms of reference for a power sector strategy study. 4. Financial sector oolicies The Government is committed to continue to implement monetary and credit policies commensurate with the inflation and balance of payments targets. As noted above, the loss of gross international reserves will be contained at US$15 million in 1995, while the net foreign assets of the BOG will decline by US$28 million. Broad mone:y is expected to grow in line with nominal GDP in 1995, while bank credit to the private sector would expand in real terms about twice as fast as GDP, thereby supporting growth of private investment. The proportion of broad money lent to the private sector by commercial banks is projected to increase further to 53 percent in 1995. The Government will continue its efforts to reform and modernize the financial system and, in particular, improve the capabilities of the BOG Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - to implement indirect monetary control including a flexible interest rate policy (paragraph 26 of the Memorandum). The authorities expect to commence open-market operations by June 1995. The Fund will provide short-term technical assistance to the BOG in this area and also on developing proce- dures for trading in the cambio market. The enactment of the FIA will strengthen monetary management and bank supervision. The conforming amendments required for the enactment of FIA have been presented to Parliament, and FIA is expected to be enacted in June 1995. In addition, a cost-sharing formula for supervision will be developed by September 1995. Moreover, privatization efforts regarding public financial institutions are continuing in order to reduce direct government involvement in the financial sector. The Fund will continue to provide assistance to the BOG during 1995 in the area of bank supervision and on policy matters and monetary management in the form of a policy advisor. The approval by Cabinet and enactment by Parliament of a new BOG Act to 'strengthen the Central Bank's independence have been delayed by one year to December 1995 and 1996, respectively. To eliminate the losses of the BOG, the Government is examining the possibility of assuming in 1996 the servic- ing of external loans contracted by the BOG on behalf of the Government. The adoption of the action plan for the restructuring of GNCB contem- plates the establishment of a state-owned loan-recovery institution by June 1995, to transfer to it most of the nonperforming loans of GNCB. Also, a general manager and two financial specialists for GNCB will be appointed in June 1995. 5. Social and environmental oolicies The Government will enhance its strategy to achieve sustainable prog- ress on reducing poverty by promoting the productive use of labor and pro- viding basic social services as described in paragraph 33 of the Memorandum. Also, the Government has put in place a GS1.2 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) three-year poverty-alleviation-reduction program, of which GS0.5 billion will be spent in 1995. Since its inception in March 1990, the Social Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) has financed and implemented physical infrastructure and social services projects totalling USS15 million. In the view of the Government, however, SIMAP has had limited success in achieving its goals and needs to be reorganized (paragraph 34 of the Memorandum). SIMAP'S efforts are being complemented by other agencies. A total of US$12 million has been committed by the Canadian Hunger Foundation (CHF) for the period 1991-95, while the UNDP through the World Food Program is providing food assistance to primary school children at a cost of USS2.5 million a year. Guyana's existing and potential environmental problems stem from mining activities, coastal erosion, logging operations, and the breakdown Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - of the drainage and waste disposal systems. To address the environmental impact of the development process, especially mining and logging operations, Parliament approved the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in June 1994. Under the aegis of the plan an Environmental Protection Act is being formulated to set the terms of reference for an Environmental Protection Agency, which is expected to come into existence by June 1995. The Govern- ment's efforts to address environmental issues are being supported by inter- national donor agencies and nongovernmental organizations. IV. mternal Prosnects and Canacitv to ReDav the Fund 1. Balance of navments nrosnects in 1995 The external current account deficit is projected to widen in 1995, mainly reflecting a deterioration of the trade account which would shift to a deficit of US$23 million (4 percent of GDP) from a surplus of US$l9 mil- lion (3.5 percent of GDP) in 1994. This weakening would result from an increase in imports related to the larger public investment outlays noted above, while merchandise exports would grow by about 8 percent. The capital account would remain in equilibrium in 1995, compared with large net inflows in the original program because project financing is expected to be lower, amortization payments higher, and commercial banks' accumulation of net foreign assets larger than envisaged previously. In all, the overall defi- cit of the balance of payments for 1995 would be about US$40 million higher than projected in the original program. The loss of reserves, however, would be contained at US$15 million for a net gain of US$8 million over 1994-95 (the same as programmed before). In addition to support from multi- lateral and bilateral sources, the balance of payments deficit is expected to be financed by an extension of the May 1993 Paris Club agreement. The external public debt is projected to decline further to about 440 percent of exports of goods and services in 1995, while scheduled debt-service obliga- tions would decline to 37 percent. 2. Medium-term outlook Higher exports of sugar, rice, and timber would more than offset lower bauxite exports relative to the projections presented in EBS/94/136 (6/30/94). Transfers would be larger than envisaged earlier as a result of an upward revision of private transfers by Guyana's Bureau of Statistics and reflecting higher official project grants. Flows of project financing have been revised downwards, while private sector inflows are expected to be larger than before. In all, the current account position is projected to be stronger while the overall deficit would behave as envisaged previously. Guyana's external position would remain fragile over the medium term, with the financing gap over the period 1996-2002 amounting to about US$435 million. Debt service to multilateral agencies would remain at 44 percent of scheduled obligations over the 1995-2000 period, but would decline to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - 32 percent of the total in 2001-02 as obligations to bilateral creditors from rescheduled debt come due. Exports are projected to rise at 6 percent a year during 1995-2002, while imports would increase by 7 percent a year (Table 13). The deficit in the services account is projected at US$lOO million a year through the year 2002, with the current account deficit remaining at US$80 million through 1999, and declining to US$70 million thereafter. In terms of exports of goods and services, the current account deficit would decline from 18 per- cent in 1995 to 10 percent by the year 2002. Disbursements of project loans are assumed to increase by 6 percent a year, rising from US$40 million in 1995 to US$60 million in the year 2002, while private sector capital inflows are expected to average US$40 million a year. The overall deficit is pro- jected to narrow from US$88 million in 1995 to US$16 million by the year 2002. Gross reserves are targeted to rise to USS285 million by the year 2002, but to decline to about 5.5 months from 7.4 months in 1995 over this period. Assuming balance of payments support of US$30 million a year in 1996-97 and US$20 million thereafter, there would remain a financing gap of US$50 million a year during 1996-2000, rising to over US$95 million a year during 2001-02 reflecting scheduled amortization payments to Trinidad and Tobago of debt rescheduled in 1989 and to the Caribbean Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF). In order to promote a steady improvement in the country's debt-service profile, the Government is committed to pursue a prudent debt-management strategy (paragraph 38 of the Memorandum). I/ To this end, it has sought a stock-of-debt operation from Paris Club creditors and comparable treatment from other official bilateral and commercial creditors. Table 15 presents estimates of key balance of payments indicators assuming under Scenario I continued flow reschedulings (with a 67 percent net present value reduc- tion), and an alternative Scenario II involving a stock-of-debt operation. 2/ The stock operation would lead to a broadly viable medium-term balance of payments position through a substantial reduction in Guyana's debt-servicing ratio, making servicing of the remaining debt manageable. 3. Caoacitv to reoav the Fund Financial assistance under the ESAF arrangement is projected to meet 15 percent of Guyana's gross financing needs in 1995 (Table 16). Guyana's outstanding use of Fund credit would peak at 188 percent of quota in 1996 and decline thereafter to 52 percent of quota by the year 2002. Repayment obligations would average USS24.5 million during 1995-2002, peaking at US$29 million in the year 2000, and declining to an average of US$22 million lJ See Table 14 for a detailed public sector debt-service schedule for the period 1995-2002 in the absence of a debt-restructuring operation by the Paris Club creditors. 2J Under Naples terms, pre-cutoff debt not previously rescheduled is reduced in net present value terms by two thirds beginning in 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - in the two years thereafter. Obligations to the Fund are to be fully repaid by the year 2007. In terms of exports of goods and services, repayments would average 4.4 percent during 1995-2002. Since the Executive Board approved Guyana's initial ESAF in 1989, thLe country's external position has strengthened and Guyana's capacity to repay the Fund has improved. Nevertheless, the situation continues to be fragile and, given the still heavy debt-service burden and uncertainties in export markets, requires the maintenance of a high level of reserves. In addition to a prudent debt-management strategy, adherence to policies which foster export growth, including privatization and the maintenance of a free exchange market, is vital to establishing external viability. V. gerformance Criteria and Financial and Structural Benchmarks As described in paragraph 40 of the Memorandum, financial targets and structural benchmarks have been established for June 1995, and indicative targets for September and December.1995 to help monitor progress in the implementation of the economic program for 1995 (Tables 17 and 18). VI. Staff Aooraisal Since the late 1980s Guyana has been implementing wide-ranging struc- tural reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies that have contributed to a strong economic recovery, substantially reduced inflation, and a strength- ened balance of payments. Notwithstanding progress to date, the underpin- nings of the Guyanese economy remain weak due to the deteriorated condition of its economic and social infrastructure, shortages of skilled labor, per- vasive poverty, and high,external-debt obligations. Large financial imbal- ances remain, underscoring the need for the continued pursuit of economic policies aimed at further increasing domestic savings, reducing inflation, improving the infrastructure, and developing the country's human resources. During 1994 the Guyanese economy continued to perform well. Economic growth was strong and there was a further accumulation of international reserves to a level equivalent to more than nine months of imports. Although inflation doubled in 1994 to 16 percent, this acceleration was related largely to the domestic effects of developments in international commodities markets. Guyana met all quantitative performance criteria and financial benchmarks under the program for 1994; however, there were slip- pages with respect to the implementation of some structural measures, including two that constitute performance criteria under the program. The authorities' program for 1995 seeks to consolidate the gains achieved so far and restore the thrust of policies in areas where slip- pages occurred in 1994, including government intervention in the setting of the exchange rate in the carnbio market, management arrangements for the electricity company (GEC) and the Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB), Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - a slow pace of privatization, and underexecution of public investment projects. The program is based on a rate of real GDP growth of 5.5 per- cent and seeks to reduce inflation to 7.5 percent. A loss of gross inter- national reserves has been targeted for 1995 as a result of the catching up of investment spending by the public sector and related import requirements, but reserves still would amount to more than seven months of imports by year-end. To achieve these objectives, the authorities will move toward an integrated exchange system, strengthen the public finances, continue to develop a dynamic and competitive financial system, and pursue prudent debt- management policies. The present exchange system has worked well in Guyana and remains appro- priate for the future. However, over the past few months some distortions have been introduced as a result of the authorities' efforts to influence the determination of the cambio exchange rate. It is important to allow the market to clear and that the authorities refrain from interfering with the functioning of the exchange market, other than through monetary and fiscal policies. Also, progress in moving toward an integrated exchange system has been uneven. The staff urges the authorities to avoid further delays in transferring transactions on the payments side from the official market to the cambio market, and abolish the Exchange Control Act as this would help allay private sector concerns regarding the Government's commitment to a market-determined exchange rate. The elimination of export licenses on a range of products and the implementation of the second phase of the reform of the Common External Tariff will contribute to the further liberalization of the trade system. Success in the implementation of the 1995 program hinges on a further strengthening of the public finances. The authorities' efforts in 1994 in restraining central government expenditure in the face of shortfalls in revenues prevented the emergence of larger fiscal imbalances. Additional strengthening of tax collections will be essential to relieve the con- straints on government spending, particularly on social services, infra- structure, and programs to alleviate poverty. In this regard, the staff welcomes efforts to combat tax evasion particularly in the area of Customs. It will also be critical to establish clear expenditure priorities. The authorities should refrain from granting additional across-the-board wage increases in 1995, limit those in 1996 to no more than the projected rate of inflation, and make efforts to improve remuneration of key technical and administrative positions. It is urgent to strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Finance to monitor the performance of the smaller public enter- prises and the implementation of the public investment program. An active program of privatization of public enterprises remains cen- tral to improve competitiveness in the sugar and bauxite industries, achieve fiscal viability over the medium term, and increase productivity in the economy. The authorities are moving ahead, at a faster pace than in 1994, on the privatization of the smaller commercial enterprises, the restructur- ing and privatization of the sugar company (GUYSUCO) agreed with the World Bank, and the divestment of one of the bauxite companies (LINMINE). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - With regard to GEC, and in light of slippages t.3 date, it is important that without further delay full management arrangemar:ts for the company are put in place and that the measures aimed at eliminating the nezd for trans- fers to the company are implemented, including if necessary an additional adjustment of tariffs. The authorities should follow up on their commitment to review tariffs on a six-monthly basis to ensure that the need for trans- fers to GEC does not re-emerge in 1996. Achievement of the inflation objectives of the program will require a firm and consistent monetary policy. In this regard, substantial progress has been made in reforming the financial sector, including the' adoption of indirect instruments of monetary control and increasing competition through the licensing of two new banks. Financial intermediation has deepened with the introduction of more diversified financial instruments, the interbank market is expanding, and interest rate spreads have narrowed. It is impor- tant to continue strengthening the capability of the Bank of Guyana (BOG) to implement monetary policy. In this regard, the staff welcomes the prepara- tion of the new BOG Act which will strengthen its independence, and the planned commencement of open-market operations that will promote the devel- opment of an active secondary market for treasury bills. The latter should be enhanced by the recent elimination of interest-bearing special reserve deposits and the enactment of the Financial Institutions Act, which also strengthens the BOG's supervision of the financial system. The staff welcomes the agreement reaclhed with IDA and the IDB on an action plan for GNCB to strengthen the management capabilities of the bank and improve its financial position. The restructuring of this institution should reduce rigidities in the financial system stemming from the operation of a large bank which does not always operate on market terms. The further divestment by the Government of its participation in financial institutions would contribute also to enhance competition in the financial system. Notwithstanding the debt relief granted by Paris Club and other credit- ors, Guyana's debt-servicing requirements remain high. The balance of pay- ments projections for the medium term show that a stock-of-debt operation on Naples terms would enable Guyana to exit from the process of continuous rescheduling. It is encouraging that the Paris Club has indicated its will- ingness to consider a stock-of-debt operation for Guyana by May 1996 in the context of continued strong adjustment efforts. The staff urges the author- ities to persevere in the pursuit of prudent debt-management policies to improve Guyana's debt-service profile and achieve external viability over the medium term. On the basis of the measures and actions implemented and those being proposed, the staff supports Guyana's request for waivers relating to the nonobservance of the two structural benchmarks on the electricity sector, and completion of the review. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

In accordance with the bilateral agreements with the central banks of CARICOM, the Bank of Guyana sets rates for the CARICOM currencies every Friday on the basis of the average rates of the commercial banks and the five largest nonbank cambio dealers in the week ending the preceeding Wednesday. As of end-April 1995, the official exchange rate was G$142.50 per U.S. dollar. VIII. Previous Decisions: Effective June 20, 1990 the Executive Board restored Guyana's eligibility to use Fund resources following Guyana's settlement in full of its overdue obligations to the Fund. A one-year stand-by arrangement for SDR 49.5 million, a three-year ESAF arrangement for SDR 81.5 million and the first annual arrangement under the ESAF for SDR 46.1 million were approved by the Executive Board on July 13, 1990. On April 24, 1991, the Executive Board completed the review under the stand-by arrangement and the mid-term review under the first annual ESAF arrangement, and agreed to extend the period of the stand-by arrangement through end-December 1991. On October 30, 1991, the Executive Board completed the second review under the stand-by arrangement and approved the second annual ESAF arrangement for SDR 17.7 million. On that date, the Executive Board also concluded the 1991 Article IV consultation. On June 12, 1992, the Executive Board completed the mid-term review under the second annual ESAF arrangement. On December 21, 1992, the Executive Board concluded the 1992 Article IV consultation and approved the third annual ESAF arrangement for SDR 17.7 million. On October 4, 1993, the Executive Board completed the mid-term review under the third annual ESAF arrangement and on February 28, 1994 the 1993 Article IV consulta- tion. On July 20, 1994 the Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF successor arrangement for SDR 53.76 million and the first annual arrangement thereunder of SDR 17.9 million. IX. &&&al Assistance: a.

Attached is a Memorandum on the Economic and Financial Policies of Guyana with annexed Technical Memorandum of Understanding, setting out the objectives and policies the Government intends to pursue in 1995, in the context of the arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) approved by the Executive Board of the Fund on July 20, 1994. The annual arrangement under the ESAF specified that Guyana would conduct with the Fund a review of its first annual programme no later than February 28, 1995 to reach further understandings on the financial and structural bench- marks for the remaining period of the first annual arrangement. 2. As explained in the Memorandum, some difficulties arose in the implementation of the structural reform programme and notwithstanding the Government's efforts, two of the structural performance criteria regarding the electricity sector were not observed. The programme described in the Memorandum aims at restoring the thrust of policies in areas where slippages have occurred, and on the basis of those policies the Government of Guyana requests that the Fund grant Guyana the necessary waivers for the nonobser- vance of the two performance criteria referred to above. 3. The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached Memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the programme and will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. During the period of the first annual arrangement, Guyana will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of any measures that may be appropri- ate at the initiative of the Government or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation. Moreover, after the period of the first annual arrangement and while Guyana has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund arising from loans under the arrangement, Guyana will consult with the Fund from time to time, at the initiative of the Government or whenever the Managing Director requests consultation on Guyana's economic and financial policies. 4. Guyana will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests on the progress made in policy implementation and the achievement of programme objectives. Yours sincerely, /s/ /S/ Archibald L.

Performance in 1994 saw a further consolidation of economic recovery. Real GDP growth is estimated to have been about 8.5 percent, compared with 6 percent envisaged in the programme, reflecting primarily strong perform- ance of rice, sugar, gold, forestry, and construction. Inflation, however, accelerated to 16 percent against 10 percent in the programme mainly because of higher international prices for petroleum products and wheat, and a higher domestic price of rice due to shortages in the domestic market resulting from a large increase in exports. The average interest rate on three-month treasury bills remained stable at 16 percent through mid-year, but rose,to 20 percent by end-August reflecting a tightening in monetary policy. By year-end it had declined to below 19 percent. The value of the Guyana dollar declined by 8.5 percent in relation to the U.S. dollar during 1994, and by 1.5 percent in real effective terms. After falling from G$130 per U.S. dollar at end-1993 to G$141 per U.S. dollar at end-June 1994, the exchange rate stabilized following measures to tighten liquidity, increase the supply of foreign exchange in the cambio market (consistent with the reserve target), and boost confidence in the functioning of the cambio market. 2. Guyana met all quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for end-September 1994 and end-December 1994 under the programme. Although the current primary balance of the public sector fell short of the programme targets, the overall deficit amounted to about 11.5 percent of GDP compared with 18.5 percent in the programme mainly because of underexecution of cap- ital outlays. Slippages, however, occurred Ln the implementation of the structural reforms, including two performance criteria under the programme. Implementation of the full interim management arrangements for the electri- city company (GEC), which were to have been in place by September 1994, are expected now to be completed by July 1995. The latter resulted from delays in reaching agreement with the IDB on a strategy for the electricity sector and in identifying the consultants required for the positions. Also, the adjustment of electricity tariffs fell short of that agreed under the pro- gramme, mainly because of an increase in the international price of fuel which offset about 80 percent of the tariff increase that was effected in August 1.994. 3. The programme for 1995 is based on real GDP growth of 5.5 percent, and seeks to contain inflation to 7.5 percent. The current primary surplus of the public sector will be increased from 19.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 22.3 percent in 1995, while public savings wi.11 be strengthened by 4 per- centage points of GDP. Investment outlays would rise by 6 percentage points of GDP, reflecting the implementation of projects delayed from 1994, and the overall deficit would widen by 2 percentage points of GDP to about 14 per- cent in 1995 to be largely covered by external financing on concessional terms. The increase in public sector investment and related imports would reverse part of last year‘s gain in international reserves; however, by end- 1995 reserves would amount to US$254 million, or 7.4 months of imports. Within the fiscal constraints, continued efforts will be undertaken to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - ATTACHMENT II address more efficiently the deterioration in social conditions as a key element of the adjustment programme. 4. The Government will continue to implement a comprehensive set of macroeconomic and structural policies including: (a) a freely floating exchange rate and a phased integration of the official and cambio exchange markets; (b) market-determined prices, except for sugar and electricity tariffs; (c) further efforts to strengthen the public finances, including measures to improve the managerial efficiency of the public sector and the buoyancy of the tax system; (d) increasing power generation capacity, with new generation to be privately owned or managed; (e) implementation of a public sector investment programme aimed at further rehabilitating Guyana's economic and social infrastructure; (f) the privatisation of a number of financial and nonfinancial enterprises; (g) implementation of sectoral pro- grammes to exploit the potential of the natural resource base on a sustain- able basis; (h) monetary and credit policies commensurate with the inflation and balance of payments targets; and (i) external debt management consistent with the objective of achieving a viable external position over the medium term. Also, additional measures need to be adopted to continue to address the skill shortages in the public sector, develop human capital, and con- serve the ecological balance. 5. Transactions in the cambio market will be conducted freely. The Government will refrain from intervening in the setting of the exchange rate or from establishing restrictions on the scope and size of transactions in that market, and the Exchange Control Act or those sections thereof that are inconsistent with the current liberalised exchange regime will be repealed by December 1995. The programme provides for consultations on developments in the cambio market in accordance with paragraph 19 of the Technical Memo- randum of Understanding. In line with the objective of achieving integra- tion of the exchange market by end-1996, the Government further reduced the foreign exchange surrender requirements rate for the sugar company (GUYSUCO) and for gold exports channelled through the Gold Board from 70 to 60 percent in November 1994, and to 50 percent in April 1995. Moreover, by September 1995 the Government will define a timetable for further decreases in these rates. Until the officiai and cambio markets are fully integrated, the Bank of Guyana (BOG) will be prepared to conduct transactions (buy or sell) with the cambio market in line with the gross reserVe targets. Transactions in the official exchange market will be conducted at an exchange rate based on the average quotation of the three largest bank dealers in the cambio market on the date the transaction takes place. 6. The Government remains fully committed to trade liberalisation. Import prohibitions have been largely removed and licensing requirements remain only for petroleum imports and on about 20 items affecting national security, health, safety, and the environment. Also, Cabinet has approved the removal of export licenses on live cattle, swine, and poultry; fresh, chilled, or frozen beef, pork, and poultry; rice; railway and tramway loco- motives and track fixtures and fittings; traffic signalling equipment other than electrically powered; block and watches; and optical, photographic, cineplatographic, medical, and surgical equipment. The first phase of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENTII reduction of the Common External Tariff (CET) was implemented in 1994, at tihich time the maximum tariff rate was reduced from 45 percent to 30 per- cent; the second phase will be adopted by June 1995. Export taxes are being reviewed with the view to their elimination by December 1995. 7. No new price controls will be introduced. Publication of an official consumer price index, which was discontinued in July 1989, was resumed in December 1994. 8. Fiscal policy will continue to play a major role in promoting eco- nomic growth through continued efforts to strengthen public sector savings, to upgrade the economic and social infrastructure, privatise state enter- prises, and improve the efficiency of the public sector. The increase in the current primary surplus of the public sector (including the BOG) would result from a strengthening of the posLtion of the public enterprises. The central government surplus will remain at about 12 percent of GDP with an increase in current revenues offsetting an increase in noninterest current expenditures. These efforts, together with a decline in interest obliga- tions, would help contain the overall deficit of the nonfinancial public sector to 9.5 percent of GDP in 1995, despite the sharp increase in capital. outlays which results mainly from the implementation of some large projects delayed from 1994. After a decline of about 3 percentage points of GDP in 1994, the stock of domestic public debt would increase by about 0.7 percent of GDP in 1995 under the assumption that the remaining gap in the balance of payments will be covered by a flow rescheduling under the terms of the May 1993 Paris Club agreement. 9. A major objective of the Government has been to reform the tax system to broaden the tax base, improve resource allocation, minimize disincen- tives, and integrate the informal sector into the economy. During 1994, emphasis continued to be placed on addressing the serious weaknesses in tax administration, which has been a major factor constraining the revenue per- formance of the Central Government. Additional measures were put in place to bolster the revenue collection procedures of the Customs and Excise Department; however, these measures were not as successful as anticipated for 1994 partly because of delays in implementation. Moreover, difficulties persisted regarding customs valuation procedures. In this respect, the Government has modified the Customs Law to bring it in line with WTO proce- dures and is using reference values of previ.ous transactions for valuation purposes. The Government also is exploring the possibility of introducing pre-shipment inspection. Also, efforts to strengthen tax administration fknanced by the IDB and those under the Public Administration Project (PAP) are expected to be completed by June 1995. Furthermore, it is expected that a U.N.- sponsored project to set up a computer system for processing customs entries will be completed in 1995. In addition, to provide the legal condi- tions necessary for effective tax administration and support the functioning of the tax system, the Government will set up in 1995 a separate Tax Court and a Revenue Board to coordinate the operations of all revenue-collecting agencies. The Board also will put in place effective systems of inspection and internal audit of the revenue establishments.

In the context of the 1995 budget, the Government continued to implement its tax reform programme. The measures adopted included (a) an increase in the personal income tax threshold from G$lO,OOO per month to G$12,000 per month, effective January 1, 1995; (b) extension of the 15 per- cent withholding tax to discount on treasury bills, with the amount withheld to be credited against the final tax liability, effective'March 1, 1995; (c) extension of the 15 percent withholding tax regime to interest paid on loans secured by bonds and similar instruments, effective January 1, 1995; (d) extension of the entertainment tax regime to artists from abroad, effec- tive March 1, 1995; (e) an environmental tax of G$lO on each unit of non- returnable containers of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages imported into Guyana, effective March 1, 1995; (f) a 10 percent consumption tax on over- seas telephone bills; (g) a 10 percent tax on the value of the bets taken by betting shops, effective March 1, 1995; (h) an increase in the consumption tax on fruits and vegetables to 30 percent, effective February 12, 1995; (i) a zero-consumption tax rate for machinery, equipment, and materials used in manufacturing, forestry, mining, agriculture, and construction, effective February 12, 1995; and (j) tax concessions on basic furnishings and building materials for new tourist facilities, and concessions on transport equipment and electricity generators for resorts being developed in the interior of the country. In addition, the Government has introduced user charges and cost-recovery measures for tertiary education, while at the same time establishing a student revolving-loan fund. 11. The Government will continue to restrain noninterest current expen- diture of the Central Government without further compressing spending in areas such as repairs and maintenance, and will continue to shift priorities to health care and education. Noninterest current expenditure will be increased from 15.5 percent of GDP in 1994 only to about 16 percent in 1995. The focus will continue to be on identifying areas where improved efficiency and cost savings can be achieved, while strengthening control over expen- ditures and accountability through better and more frequent expenditure monitoring. The latter will strengthen the agencies ability to organise and implement their operations. Consideration also will be given to contracting operations and maintenance activities to the private sector. 12. The scope for real wage increases necessary to attract and retain skilled labour into the public service is limited by fiscal constraints, so the Government will aim to provide incentives to fill vacancies of tech- nical positions on a priority basis. To this end, the Government began implementation of the IDA/ODA-funded PAP, which includes decompression and upgrading of the current salary scale, integration of special remuneration practices, rationalisation of allowances, measures to eliminate labour redundancies, and incentives for repatriating skilled Guyanese to work in the public service. Reflecting wage increases granted under the PAP, a 28.5 percent increase in the minimum wage as well as special adjustments to teachers and other groups, the public service wage bill rose in nominal terms by 25 percent in 1994, a 10 percent increase in real terms, but remained at the equivalent of 6 percent of GDP. For 1995, across-the-board increases will be limited to 16 percent, with the public service wage bill increased to about 7 percent of GDP. Selective and merit wage increases Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - ATTAcHMENTa will depend on productivity improvements and on the behavior of tax rev- enues, and the Government plans to grant additional increases to key posi- tions in the public sector. 13. No transfers will be granted to public enterprises in 1995, save for those to GEC. Further savings are being identified through an assessment of the costs and benefits of transfers to a broad range of international and private local institutions. Transfers to GEC will fall by about a 0.2 per- centage point of GDP in 1995 to 0.2 percent of GDP, or G$145 million, and the need for transfers to the company will be eliminated by mid-1995. Should the measures described in paragraph IL6 below prove to be-insufficient to limit transfers to GEC to G$145 million :Ln 1995, the Government will take compensating actions in regards other central government noninterest current expenditures during the second half of 1995.. Interest obligations are pro- jected to remain at about 14.5 percent of GDP in 1995, with external inter- est obligations remaining at about 9 percent of GDP. 14. The current primary surplus of the public enterprises in 1994 fell short of the programme targets by 1.3 percentage points of GDP despite a stronger outturn for the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). The improved per- formance of the NIS resulted from higher wages and increases in the ceiling of the maximum insurable income (twice in the year) which more than offset improvements in benefits. By contrast, the position of the bauxite compan- ies continued to deteriorate reflecting a further weakening in external market conditions. 15. The primary current account surplus of the public enterprises is projected to improve from 7.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to about 10.5 percent in 1995, reflecting a strengthening of the financial position of GWSUCO, the bauxite companies, and Guyana Airways. larger production and exports of sugar as well as higher average prices, on account of better worldmarket prices and more favorable exchange rates, would contribute to an increase in GWSUCO's operating surplus of 2 percentage points of GDP. In addition, Guyana will gain access to the E.U. market (Portugal) for an additional 15,000 tons at more favorable prices than those prevailing in the world market and CARICOM. 16 4, Electricity tariffs were increased on average by 19 percent in two steps between October 1993 and January 1994, and a further 17 percent increase became effective in August 1994. However, because fuel prices increased by 16 percent over the same period the increase in tariffs did not improve the financial position of the company to the extent originally envisaged. This factor notwithstanding, the operating deficit of GEC was contained to the level envisaged in the programme by increasing generation by 15 percent, reducing technical losses from 28 percent to 25.5 percent, improving the collection ratio from 65 percent to 80 percent, and collecting arrears of about 0.1 percent of GDP. Also, GEC reduced its labour force by 12.5 percent at the end of 1994 by contracting out security services. Moreover, in order to eliminate the need for transfers by mid-1995, GEC will improve billing procedures, increase the collection ratio to at least 82 percent, collect arrears of about 0.4 percentage point of GDP, while Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - ATTACHMENT II expanding generation by 13 percent and containing the wage bill through attrition and by limiting wage increases to 10 percent. Tariffs will con- tinue to be reviewed on a six-monthly basis, and adjusted if necessary to prevent the re-emergence of a deficit in 1996. 17. Regarding the management arrangements for GEC, in addition to the general manager appointed in July 1994, an expert on the technical side was hired in January 1995 and another consultant is expected to be provided by the foreign company that is refurbishing one of the power plants. The general manager, however, resigned in early May 1995 and the Government has requested the assistance of the IDB in identifying a replacement as well as in filling the positions of financial and commercial managers with a view to completing the interim management arrangements by July 1995. The Government has agreed with the IDB on the terms of reference for a power sector strategy study on a medium- to long-term expansion plan to be completed by June 1995. A regulatory framework for the electricity sector will be established under the purview of the Public Utilities Commission. Except for isolated areas, all new power generation will be privately owned or managed, and the Government will consult with the IDB prior to undertaking any commitments in regard to public investment outlays in the sector. 18. In accordance with its State Paper on Privatisation, the Government is committed to the privatisation of public enterprises as part of its efforts to increase efficiency, improve the performance of the public sector, and further expand the role of the private sector in the economy. The enter- prises scheduled for privatisation in 1994 included Guyana Stores (GSL), Guyana National Engineering Corporation (GNEC), the GUYSUCO Dairy Complex, and Guyana Glassworks. For Guyana Glassworks the bids received were deemed too low and negotiations are continuing with two parties to improve them. Some of the operations of GNEC have been leased, and the Government will offer to lease the main plot of the Dairy Complex. The smaller plots around it will be leased to farmers for a period of time sufficiently long so as to sustain dairy farming. The Government will bring GSL to the point of sale in June 1995. In February 1995, the Government announced the sale of its remaining shares in the Demerara Distillers Limited (DDL) and expects to complete the sale by June 1995, and the shares in Forte Creste will be disposed by end-1995. Moreover, the Government identified GPC, GNP, Stock- feeds, and NEOCOL as the four public enterprises that it plans to bring to the point of sale in 1995 and the technical studies on privatisation options are being prepared for these companies. Also, studies on the environmental impact of privatisation are being prepared for 11 of the 30 companies sched- uled for privatisation. Divestment proceeds (including from financial institutions) amounted to 2 percent of GDP in 1994, and are projected at 1.2 percent in 1995. The Government intends to use these proceeds to finance the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) and to retire domestic debt. A privatisation advisor is being provided by ODA to the Privatisation Unit for a period of eight to ten months since March 1995. 19. The Government has been seeking actively a core investor for LINMINE and has invited two foreign companies to examine the prospects of investing in the company. The Government plans to bring LINMINE to the point of sale Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT I;L in 1995, with the issuance of a prospectus offering a "core" 50 percent in equity to private firms. Other shares will 'be sold to strategic investors, workers, creditors, and domestic investors to reduce government ownership to no more than 20 percent. 20. Agreement was reached in February 1995 with the international finan- cial advisors that will help develop a restructuring and privatisation programme for GUYSUCO, including the review of the regulatory framework. The Government intends to submit to IDA the ,proposed regulatory framework by Septembar 1995, and establish it by April 1996. By December 1996, the Government will have taken all actions necessary or advisable to restructure and privatioc GUYSUCO. The management contract with Booker Tate is in effect until December 1995, and the Government will maintain a management contract for the company on terms agreed with the World Bank until the restructuring and privatisation programme is completed. 21. With regard to the financial sector, the Government sold its shares in the Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry (GBTI) in June 1994. In November 1994 the Government announced its decision to privatise in 1995 the Guyana Cooperative Insurance Service (GCIS) and the Guyana Cooperative Mortgage Finance Bank (GCMFB). With the sale of shares in GBTI, the Government sold 20 percent of its participation in the Combined Asset Value (CAV) of finan- cial institutions with government participation, with a further 40 percent of the CAV to be brought to the point of sale by end-1995. 22. A one-stop shop for investors, GO-INVEST, was established in September 1994 to speed private investors through government regulations and facil- itate investment in Guyana. Funding for a GO-INVEST director has been provided by a Japanese grant administered by IDA. Also, the Government plans to enact the New Companies Act (approved by Parliament in 1991) and repeal the Capital Issues Control Act by Juna 1995. 23. Implementation of the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) fell short of the budgeted outlays by about 30 percent in 1994 reflecting primarily setbacks on the bidding and procurement process, timely availa- bility of critical equipment, and the need to redesign a few projects. Capital outlays amounted to US$62 million in 1994, of which half were financed externally with 15 percent of the total covered with grants. About a fourth of the total in 1994 went to the rehabilitation of the sugar, bauxite, and electricity industries compared with about two thirds in 1993, with the rest going to improve the social and economic infrastructure. A high-level task force within the Ministry of Finance was established in 1994. to ensure speedy implementation of priority projects. The PSIP for 1995 is targeted to increase by about 70 percent, of which about half will be financed from external sources. About a fourth of the PSIP will continue to be directed to the rehabilitation of GUYSUCO, GEC, and to a lesser extent LINMINE and BERMINE. Central government outlays will be mainly directed toward education (schools), health (hospitals), roads, and sea defenses. 24. The BOG will maintain a monetary policy stance that is consistent with the targeted rate of inflation and achievement of a sustainable balance Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59 - ATTACHMENT II of payments position in the medium term. Gross international reserves increased by US$23 million in 1994 to US$269 million compared with a loss of US$8 million envisaged previously, or about nine months of imports. The increase in gross reserves stemmed mainly from larger divestment proceeds (from the sale of shares in GBTI), and balance of payments support, as well as from higher gold exports and lower fuel imports. For.1995, gross reserves are projected to decline by about US$15 million, mainly reflecting lower export proceeds in line with the decrease in the surrender require- ments for sugar and gold exports; higher imports of fuel and wheat, the latter resulting from the reduction of the PI480 assistance programme; lower divestment proceeds; and higher cash debt-service payments. These factors would more than offset a tripling in the assistance from the multilateral agencies. 25. Broad money growth decelerated from 28 percent during 1993 to 17 per- cent during 1994, while credit to the private sector slowed from 17 percent (as a percent of broad money at the beginning of the period) to 15 percent. The placement of larger amounts of government paper outside of the banking system together with the decline in interest rates on deposits, were the main factors behind the deceleration in the growth of broad money. Broad money growth is expected to decelerate further in 1995, to about 11 percent, while expansion of credit to the private sector would decline to about 11 percent of broad money at the beginning of the period. 26. The BOG will maintain its current flexible interest rate arrangements, under which administered interest rates of the BOG are adjusted in line with the average rate determined by competitive bidding in auctions of three- month treasury bills, which will continua to be held at least bi-weekly. Since April 1993 the Government has broadened the range of maturities offered in the auctions to include six-month and one-year treasury bills, and longer-dated securities will continue to be offered through the pro- gramme period. Also, a system of book entry for treasury bills will be put in place at the BOG, and the rediscount policy will be kept under review to ensure it is consistent with the policy objectives of the programme and with the development of a secondary market in government securities. To this end, and to strengthen monetary management, the BOG eliminated the remuner- ated Special Reserve Deposits (SRDs) facility in December 1994 and will move toward conducting open-market operations by June 1995. Central government deposits stemming from the BOG's efforts to sterilise liquidity will con- tinue to be held in a separate sterilisation account in the BOG. 27. The BOG will continue to shift to more flexible, indirect instruments of monetary control. In this regard, a money-market division has been established in the BOG along the lines recommended in the report on Organization and Methods for the BOG prepared with technical assistance from the Fund. This division will have under its purview all aspects of money- market operations, and will provide advice to the Governor of the BOG on these matters. The BOG is refining the framework for short-term monetary programming so as to strengthen the linkages to the quarterly financial programme. Over time, the BOG also will foster the development of the call exchange into a stock market. As an intermediate step toward complete Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - -II liberalisation of the credit market, the BOG will review its norms on cei:L- ings on borrowing by nonresidents along those prevailing in CARICOM. As part of its policy of encouraging greater competition in the financial sector, the BOG approved two applications for new commercial bank licenses, which started operations in November 1994. Also, two of the existing banks are in the process of expanding their operations. As a result of the increase in competition, banks have reduced their lending rates and spreads, introduced new financial instruments, and expanded their services, including ATM machines. 28. The Government is working to strengthen and modernize the-regulat- ory and supervisory framework for commercial banks and other financial institutions. A bank supervisor and a bank inspector are being provided to the BOG by the Fund, while the IDB is financing assistance to develop the call exchange into a stock market. Also, long-term assistance on policy matters and monetary management in the form of a policy advisor and short- term assistance to the BOG regarding the establishment of procedures to conduct open-market operations and for trading in the cambio market are being provided by the Fund. 29. The draft bill of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA) was approved by Parliament in January 1995, and the required conforming amendments to the BOG, COFA, and Dealers in Foreign Currency ILicensing Act have been presented to Parliament, with enactment expected by June 1995. The FIA will extend coverage of the legislation to all deposit-taking institutions; centralise the responsibility for financial sector regulation at the BOG; formalise new minimum capital requirements; and strengthen existing regulatory powers and penalties. In addition, a cost-sharing formula for supervision will be put in place by September 1995. 30. The Government is preparing a revised BOG Act which will strengthen central bank independence. Approval by Cabinet of a revised BOG Act is expected by December 1995 and to be enacted by December 1996. In order to eliminate the ongoing losses of the BOG, the Government is examining the possibility of assuming the servicing of the external loans contracted by the BOG on behalf of the Government in the context of the 1996 budget. 31. In September 1994, the Government appointed a coordinator to imple- ment the plan agreed with IDA and the IDB to address the financial difficul- ties of GAIBANR and GNCB. In March 1995, the Government agreed on an action plan for the financial and operational merger and a restructuring programme for GNCB. A state-owned loan recovery institution will be established by June 1995, to subsequently transfer most nonperforming loans to this institution. Moreover, to strengthen the management capabilities of GNCB, a general manager and two financial specialists will be appointed by June 1995. 32. Progress has been achieved in enhancing the capabilities of the Bureau of Statistics by increasing the number of statisticians, improving physical and computer facilities, and placing its wages outside the salary scale of the pub'lic sector. Also, the BOG has expanded its Research Department and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 61 - ATTACHMENT II has improved its data collection and publication facilities. However, the Ministry of Finance's infrastructure for data compilation and for monitoring developments of the performance of the public enterprises and implementation of the PSIP has weakened due to loss of personnel, in part reflecting stream- lining of the civil service. The Fund will provide technical assistance in the area of balance of payments statistics, and discussions are ongoing with ODA on the terms of reference for long-term assistance on national income accounts. 33. The Government will enhance its strategy to achieve sustainable progress on poverty by (1) promoting the productive use of labour through policies that create employment and (2) efficiently providing basic social services targeted to the poor such as nutrition, education (especially technical and vocational) and training, health, clean drinking water, and family planning. The strategy focuses on the rapid development of agricul- ture by providing adequate titling services, investments in drainage and irrigation and access to market roads, and expanding research and extension services. It also stresses the active promotion of small-scale manufactur- ing production. Moreover, the strategy includes focusing and prioritising public expenditures, eliminating existing disadvantages against the poor, and prioritising investments in nutrition, water, education, and health to the poorer areas, and determining strategies to address the rehabilitation of infrastructure in all social sectors. A rationalisation of education through, inter alla, curricular reform and increased training for teachers, a restructuring of the system of social security currently provided by NIS, and ensuring that the cost-recovery process in all sectors is both equitable and efficient, and not unduly burdensome on the poor, are key components of this strategy. In the context of the 1995 budget, the Government has put in place a GS1.2 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) special three-year poverty- alleviation-reduction programme, of which GS0.5 billion is to be spent in 1995. 34. The Social Impact Amelioration Programme (SIMAP) has financed and implemented physical infrastructure and social services projects totalling US$15 million. However, it has had limited success in achieving its goals and therefore needs to be reorganised. The objectives of this reorganisation are to make the agency more efficient in its operations; improve its capa- city to target projects to the poorest families and individuals; simplify the application process so that it does not prevent the poorest and less skilled from accessing the programme benefits; accelerate the implementation of the projects; and monitor and evaluate the impact of the projects. 35. In order to address the environmental impact of intensified develop- mental processes, especially mining and logging operations which remain central to the economic well-being of the country, Parliament approved the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in June 1994. Under the aegis of the plan an Environmental Protection Act is being formulated which would set the terms of reference for the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is expected that the agency will come into existence by June 1995. With the technical assistance of the World Bank and other donor grows, a workshop was organized in mid-February 1995 to discuss the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ATTACHMEN _ T 'II structure and operations of the EPA. The Government's efforts to address the environmental concerns and issues is being supported by the interna- tional donor agencies and nongovernmental organisations. 36. In May 1993, Paris Club creditors granted Guyana rescheduling of debt obligations falling due from August 1993 through December 1994 under enhanced concessions and agreed to consider a stock-of-debt operation by Maiy 1!?96. All bilateral agreements under the 1993 Paris Club Agreed Minute have been completed. The Government has requested that the Paris Club creditors. consider a stock-of-debt operation in 1995 in order to obtain the required financing for 1995 and attain medium-term viability, as well as to facili- tate comparable agreements with non-Paris Club creditors. In the event that such operation is not deemed feasible, Guyana will require an extension of the consolidation period under the terms of the May 1993 Paris Club agree- ment to December 1995 to close the financing gap projected for 1995. 37. Debt-service obligations before rescheduling declined from about 39 percent of exports of goods and services in 1993 to 38 percent in 1994, and are expected to decline to 37 percent in 1995, while debt relief from external commercial and official creditors reduced actual debt-service pay- ments to 25 percent of exports of goods and services in 1993 and to 22 per- cent in 1994. The external public debt is projected to decline from over six times exports of goods and services in 3.991 to about 4.5 times by end- 1995. Foreign financing of the public sector is projected to increase from 8.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to about 11 percent in 1995, mainly reflecting an acceleration of disbursement of project loans and larger use of resources from the multilateral agencies. 3a . To promote a steady improvement in the country's debt-service profile, in addition to seeking a stock-of-debt operation from Paris Club creditors and comparable treatment from other bilateral and commercial creditors, the Government will (a) limit the contracting and guaranteeing of nonconces- sional loans (as specified in Table 5 of the Technical Memorandum); (b) seek to eliminate in 1995 debt created under the External Payment Deposits Scheme (EPDS) along the lines of the 1992 commercial bank debt buyback; (c) continue efforts to substitute the more expensive forms of external debt, including that from multilateral organisations, with more concessional loans; and (d) seek to increase the grant element in project loans and commodity assistance, and to obtain from creditors a reduction in the requirements for local and counterpart funds. 351 . The implementation of the policies described above is expected to provide the basis for sustained economic growth; substantial external assistance, however, is required to achieve this objective and supplement Guyana's domestic savings effort and support the rehabilitation of the economy. Guyana's external financing requirements for 1995 amount to US$213 million. The assistance envisaged in the programme for 1995 includes US$52 million of project loans and grants, disbursements of US$27 million from the Fund under the ESAF arrangement, US$7 million from IDA, US$lO mil- lion from the IDB under the financial sector reform loan, and US$lO million in official bilateral commodity assistance. Another US$43 million is Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - ATTACHMENT II expected to be obtained through divestment proceeds, private transfers, and direct investment. After a loss of US$15 million envisaged in gross inter- national reserves, a gap of US$49 million would remain which is expected to be covered by additional rescheduling along the terms of the May 1993 Paris Club agreement. 40. To monitor developments under the programme, structural benchmarks and financial targets have been established for end-June 1995 and indicative targets through end-1995. These include: (i) ceilings on the borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector, with subceilings on its domestic borrowing requirement; .(ii) ceilings on the net domestic assets of the Bank of Guyana; (iii) targets for the change in the net foreign assets of the Bank of Guyana, with subtargets for the change in gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana; (iv) ceilings on the contracting of noncon- cessional public or publicly guaranteed external debt with a maturity of more than 12 years and of 12 years or less, with a subceiling on debt with a maturity of 5 years or less; (v) no accumulation of external payments arrears by the public sector; and (vi) schedules for the implementation of structural policies relating to the exchange rate policy, the exchange and trade system, pricing policy, tax reform and tax administration, public sector reform, financial sector and interest rate policy, and environmental policies as described in more detail in Table 6 of the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (attached). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 64 - ATTACHMENT I:u Technical Memorandum of Understanding This technical memorandum and attached tables define the concepts used in quantifying certain variables of the programme and specify structural benchmarks and indicative financial targets through December 31, 1995. I. Net Forefin Assets of the Bank of Guyana 1. For purposes of the programme, the net foreign assets of the Bank of Guyana (BOG) are defined as the gross international reserves of the BOG less current short- and medium-term external liabilities, rescheduled external liabilities, and external payments arrears of the BOG. Table 1 presents the net foreign assets of the BOG as of end-March 1995. 2. During the period January-December 1995, the net foreign assets of the BOG are not to decline by more than US$30 million., Consistent with these targets, the cumulative loss in the net foreign assets of the BOG will not be more than US$38 million during the period January-June 1995 and no more than US$43 million during the period January-September 1995. 3. In turn, the gross international reserves of the BOG will not decline by more than US$32 million during January-June 1995, by more than US$36 mil- lion during January-September 1995, and by more than US$17 million during January-December 1995. 4. The targets for the net foreign assets and the gross international reserves of the BOG for the periods January-June 1995, January-September 1995, and January-December 1995 will be adjusted upwards for the positive difference between the projected cumulative cash debt-service payments of the Central Government and the BOG as incorporated in the programme, which are detailed in the attached Table 2, and actual cumulative debt-service payments made by the Central Government and the BOG. 5. For purposes of the programme, non-U.S. dollar reserve assets and lia- bilities are to be converted into U.S. dollars at the cross foreign exchange rates prevailing on December 31, 1994, except for the U.S. dollar/SDR rate which is assumed at USS1.47 - SDR 1 during 1995. II. Net Domestic Assets of the Bank of Guvana 6. For purposes of the programme, changes in the net domestic assets of the BOG are defined as the difference between changes in currency held outside the banking system and changes in the net foreign assets of the BOG converted into Guyana dollars at the agreed accounting exchange rates, I/ 1/ The average accounting exchange rates are as follows: for January- March 1995 US$l-G$142.5; April-June 1995 US$l-GS144.8; July-September 1995 US$l-GS147.7; and October-December 1995 US$l-GS151.2. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - ATTACHMENT III 7. The cumulative increase in the net domestic assets so defined-will not be more than G$4,930 million in the period January-June 1995, not more than G$5,75O million in the period January-September 1995, and no more than G$4,875 million in the period January-December 1995. The limits for the periods January-June 1995, January-September 1995, and.January-December 1995 will be adjusted downward by the Guyana dollar equivalent (at the accounting exchange rates) of any upward adjustment made to the net foreign assets tar- get of the BOG in accordance with paragraph 4 above. Table 3 presents the net domestic asset position of the BOG as of March 31, 1995. III: Net Borrowine Reauirement of the Nonfinancial‘Public Sector 8. The net borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector (NBR) is defined as the net financing obtained by the nonfinancial public sector from the domestic financial system, from the nonfinancial private sector, and from foreign sources. It is calculated as the.sum of the change in the stock of the domestic debt of the nonfinancial public sector and net external financing. The nonfinancial public sector includes the Central Government, the National Insurance Scheme, the Sinking Fund, the nonfinan- cial public enterprises (governmental corporations and companies), and the Guyana National Energy Authority. The domestic financial system includes the BOG, the commercial banks, the government development banks, and the nonbank financial intermediaries (building societies, trust funds, insurance companies, and pension schemes). 9. For purposes of the programme, the stock of the domestic public debt of the nonfinancial public sector is defined to consist of net credit extended by the domestic financial system to the nonfinancial public sector (as reported by the BOG) and treasury bills, debentures, and defense bonds held by the nonfinancial private sector (as reported by the BOG). Net credit by the domestic financial system is defined as the sum of advances (net of deposits) extended by the BOG; advances and loans (net of deposits including PI480 counterpart funds) extended by commercial banks, development banks, and nonbank financial institutions; and the change in the stock of treasury bills, debentures, and defense bonds held by the domestic financial system except for special debentures issued by the Treasury to cover unreal- ized foreign exchange losses of the BOG and provisions for bad loans made by the Guyana National Cooperative Bank. In accordance with present practices, treasury bills will be recorded at face value, except for those held by the banking system which will be recorded on a purchase price basis. Table 4 presents the estimated stock of domestic public debt as of March 31, 1995. 10. Net external financing is defined as the sum of the monthly net flows in foreign currencies (as reported by the Ministry of Finance) to the non- financial public sector converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction. Net flows in foreign currencies to the nonfinan- cial public sector are defined as the sum of project loan disbursements and nonproject loan and grant disbursements (including suppliers' credits), less scheduled principal payments (including payments on suppliers' credits), plus principal and interest obligations rescheduled in the period in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT m question, plus changes in external payments arrears (including interest). The latter are to be calculated as specified in paragraph 15 below. 11. The NBR will not exceed G$3,865 million in the period January-June 1995, G$7,945 million in the period January-September 1995, and G$8,190 million in the period January-December 1995. In turn, the stock of the domestic public debt (as defined in paragraph 9 above) will increase by no more than G$3,095 million in the period January-June 1995, by no more than G$2,980 million in the period January-September 1995, and by no more than G$900 million in the period January-December 1995. The limits on the NBR and the stock of domestic public debt for January-June 1995, January- September 1995, and January-December 1995 will be adjusted downwards (upwards) by the amount by which the net clearance of expenditure arrears by the Central Government in the period January-June 1995, January-September 1995, and January-December 1995 falls short of (exceeds) the equivalent of G$200 million, G$300 million, and G$525 million, respectively. The limits on the NBR and the stock of domestic public debt for January-June 1995, January-September 1995, and January-December 1995 will be adjusted downwards by the amount by which public investment outlays fall short of GS6.5 bil- lion, G$11.4 billion, and G$lS billion, respectively. 12. The limits on the NBR and the stock of domestic public debt for January-June 1995, January-September 1995, and January-December 1995 will be adjusted downwards by the positive amount by which the divestment proceeds in the period January-June 1995, January-September 1995, and January-December 1995 exceed the equivalent of G$545 million minus the amount by which public investment outlays exceed GS6.5 billion in the period January-June 1995, G$1.06 billion minus the amount by which public invest- ment outlays exceed GS11.6 billion in the period January-September 1995, and GSl.06 billion minus the amount by which public investment outlays exceed G$15 billion in the period January-December 1995, respectively, at the corresponding accounting 'exchange rates. 13. The limits on the stock of domestic public debt through end-June 1995, end-September 1995, and end-December 1995 will be adjusted upwards by the equivalent in Guyana dollars of the amount by which the cumulative disbursements of nonproject balance of payments loans and grants fall short of US$2 million, US$19 million, and USS25.5 million, respectively. These adjustments, however, will not exceed the local currency equivalent of US$5 million at the accounting exchange rates corresponding to the period of the shortfall. The limits on the stock of domestic public debt through end-December 1995 will be adjusted downwards by the equivalent in Guyana dollars of the amount by which the combined disbursements of nonproject balance of payments assistance exceed US$26 million at the corresponding accounting exchange rates. The limits on the stock of domestic public debt through end-June 1995, end-September 1995, and end-December 1995 will be adjusted downwards by the positive difference between the cumulative debt- service payments of the nonfinancial public sector incorporated in the programme, which are detailed in the attached Table 2, and actual debt- service payments, and by any financing provided to the nonfinancial public Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - ATTACHMENT III sector by the BOG resulting from rescheduling or debt-swap operations of External Payments Deposits (EPDs). IV. External Pavments Arrears of the Public Sector 14. For the calculation of the limit on external payments arrears of the public sector, outstanding arrears to norimultilateral creditors are deemed to have been rescheduled as of the date of the 1993 Paris Club agreement. For the purpose of this limit, cash interest payments-on rescheduled debt for all categories of nonmultilateral creditors.have been calculated consis- tent with the options approach received by Guyana at the 1993 Paris Club consolidation, and the terms of that consolidation. 15. For purposes of the limits on arrears, the public sector is defined to include the nonfinancial public sector (as defined in paragraph 8 above), the BOG, and (until it has been merged with 'the GNCB) the Guyana Cooperative Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank. Changes in external payments arrears of the public sector will be defined as the difference between scheduled external debt-service obligations of the public sector that have fallen due and actual debt-service payments as reported by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Guyana less amounts programmed to be rescheduled. Scheduled debt-service obligations are defined as projected scheduled prin- cipal and interest obligations on outstanding debt including rescheduled debt and debt arrears plus projected principal and interest payments on new debt to be contracted. 16. No new external payments arrears will be incurred during the period January-June 1995, January-September 1995, and January-December 1995, or any subperiod thereof. V. Contracting of Nonconcessional Public and Publicly Guaranteed External Debt 17. The contracting of nonconcessional public and publicly guaranteed external debt will not exceed US$3 million during January-June 1995, US$5 million during January-September 1995, and US$5 million during January- December 1995, with loans with maturities of up to and including five years not to exceed US$l million, US$2 million, and US$2 million, respectively. Nonconcessional borrowing is defined for this purpose using the definition adopted by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as a loan or credit with a grant element of less than 25 percent. The limit excludes the contracting or guaranteeing of loans from official multilateral institutions as well as short-term (up to one year) import-related credits. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt is defined to include debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector as defined in paragraph 15 above.

Implementation of the structural measures set out in Table 6 will constitute benchmarks under the programme. VII. Exchanee Svstem 19. The authorities will avoid direct intervention in the cambio market, except by way of periodic auctions (buy or sell) subject to agreed reserve targets and auction guidelines, and will at all times refrain from inter- ferring in the setting of rates so that the exchange rate is fully market determined. The functioning of the exchange market will be monitored care- fully to ensure that it fully reflects market forces. Points of reference in this regard will include notably the volumes transacted in the market, the spread between the bank and nonbank cambio exchange rates, and levels of working balances, as reported weekly by the csmbio dealers to the Bank of Guyana, as well as developments on the length of queuing and on foreign exchange dealings occurring outside the cambio market. The authorities will keep the Fund fully informed of market developments, including through peri- odic consultations by the Fund staff with market participants concerning their experience of market developments.
