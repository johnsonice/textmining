Introduction Discussions with the Haitian authorities for the 1995 Article IV consultation and on an economic program for 1995 that could be supported by a stand-by arrangement from the Fund were held in Port-au-Prince during the periods December 12-22, 1994 and January 10-13, 1995. The representatives of the Haitian authorities in the discussions included the Minister of Economy and Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other senior public officials, The staff representatives who participated in the discussions were Messrs. Williams (Head), Thornton, Paris-Horvitz, and Ms. Sheybani (all WHD), Mr. Nascimento (PDR), and Ms. Jean-Baptiste (Assistant-ADM). In a letter dated February 13, 1995 (with an annexed memorandum on economic and financial policies) (Attachment, Appendix VI), the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank describe the economic policies of the Government of the Republic of Haiti for 1995 and request a 12-month stand-by arrangement for the equivalent of SDR 20 million (or 32.9 percent of quota). 1/ The last Article IV consultation with Haiti was concluded by the Executive Board on June 26, 1989. In September 1991, the staff completed negotiations with the then recently-elected Aristide Government on a program to be supported by a 12-month stand-by arrangement. However, the military coup of September 30, 1991 precluded the Executive Board's consideration of Haiti's request. At the Fund/Bank Annual Meetings in September 1992, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Fund accepted the credentials of the Government of President Aristide in exile, and on October 30, 1992 the Executive Board concluded that all relations with Haiti should be conducted with that Government. Following the coup, there was no staff visit to Haiti until September 1993 when, in anticipation of President Aristide's return in the context of the "Governor's Island Accord," a mission went to Port-au-Prince to assess the economic situation. The collapse of the Accord postponed the re-estab- lishment of a constitutional government which finally came with President Aristide's return to Haiti on October 15, 1994. In November 1994 Fund staff visited Haiti to collaborate with a multiagency mission that was reviewing an Emergency Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) aimed at the medium-term recon- struction of the Haitian economy with multilateral and bilateral support. Haiti's financial relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix I. Haiti began to accumulate arrears to the Fund in November 1991. A report and complaints under Rule K-l and Rule S-l were issued on January 21, 1992. Status reports apprising Executive Directors of developments related to u Following the clearance of Fund arrears on December 19, 1994, Haiti accepted and made the necessary payment for its new quota increase (to SDR 60.7 million) under the Ninth Review of Quotas.

Haiti settled its .overdues to the Fund (of SDR 24.8 million) on December 19, 1994 and the limitation on the use of Fund resources was terminated. Table 1 presents' the actual and projected position of Haiti with the Fund. Also on December 19, 1995 Haiti cleared its overdue obligations out- standing over 60 days with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Haiti's financial relations with the World Bank are summarized in Appendix II. II. Recent Economic Develooments Haiti has experienced a dramatic deterioration in economic and social conditions since the military coup in September 1991, accentuating the downward trend evident since the mid-1980s. Preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP may have declined by about 30 percent over 1990-94, I/ leaving per capita income at about US$260 in 1994 and making Haiti by far the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Inflation (as measured by the 12-month change in the consumer price index) rose from an average of 18 percent a year during 1990-93 to 52 percent in September 1994, reflecting widespread shortages related to the trade embargo and the depreciation of the gourde, from G 12.5 per U.S. dollar at end-September 1993 to G 21.2 at end-August 1994. With the ending of the trade embargo in October 1994, inflation declined to 43.4 percent in December 1994 and the gourde appre- ciated to around G 13 per U.S. dollar in January 1995. The current account deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (before grants) rose from 1.1 percent of GDP in 1990 to 3.8 percent of GDP in 1994 (Table 2). In the absence of foreign financing, there was virtually no capital investment over the period and the overall deficit (before grants) narrowed from 6.2 percent of GDP to 4.2 percent of GDP; the deficit was financed mainly by recourse to central bank credit and the accumulation of arrears. Reflecting sharply lower taxable imports and the continuing breakdown in tax administration (as tax revenue became increasingly diverted to private channels), central government current revenue fell from the equiv- alent of 7,.3 percent of GDP in 1990 to 5.5 percent in 1993 and further to 3.3 percent of GDP in 1994. Central government expenditure rose from 9.1 percent of GDP in 1990 to 9.6 percent in 1993, notwithstanding declines in the level of capital and maintenance expenditure; it then fell to 8.8 percent of GDP in 1994, but this appears to have reflected a general disarray in government rather than a deliberate policy of containment (the military authorities were in de facto control but public administration was I/ The discussion in this report refers to fiscal years ending September 30.

The finances of the other public enterprises weakened in the face of an estimated 30 percent increase in employment, a fall in port revenue related to the trade embargo, and the failure to adjust electricity tariffs in line with the depreciation of the gourde. The electricity company (EDH) was further affected by the accumula- tion of arrears on the part of both the private and public sectors. The poor state of the company's finances kept maintenance expenditures to a minimum and led to a major deterioration in service. Central bank net credit to the public sector rose sharply in 1991-94, mainly financed by a sizable increase in currency issue and, in 1993, by an increase in reserve requirements on demand deposits at commercial banks. Generally over 1991-94 commercial banks built up substantial net foreign assets, reflecting the strong growth of their deposit base and limited lending to the private sector. With the sharp contraction in economic activity there was a deterioration in the loan portfolios of some commercial banks. Reflecting the closing down of about two thirds of the assembly indus- tries and the effect of the trade embargo on coffee shipments, exports declined from US$266 million in 1990 to under US$60 million in 1994; total imports fell from US$443 million to US$141 million over the same period, notwithstanding the expansion of humanitarian aid programs. 2J The external current account deficit (excluding grants) fell from 10.2 percent in 1990 to 6.9 percent of GDP in 1994 and was financed largely by humanitarian aid and by the accumulation of external arrears. III. The Economic Program for 1995 1. Overview The return to constitutional government provides an opportunity to take steps to halt the economic and social decline and to begin a program of reforms as a prerequisite for sustainable development. To this end, the lJ Under these circumstances, much of government expenditure (especially after mid-May 1994 when the army took over full control) was through ministerial discretionary accounts, the precise nature of which is not clear. u Imports financed from humanitarian aid programs rose from 34.9 percent of total imports in 1990 to 80.2 percent of total imports in 1994.

The strategy is to be supported by a series of adjustment and sector loans by the World Bank and the IDB, and the Government intends to request Fund support through arrangements under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). The economic program for 1995 aims at reducing inflation to 15 percent (annual average) and increasing the level of net international reserves of the monetary authorities by US$45 million. Real GDP is projected to in- crease by around 4.5 percent, mainly on the,basis of a large increase in public investment (from 0.6 percent o,f GDP in 1994 to 7.2 percent of GDP in 1995) financed by external aid. The program also envisages a "catch-up" in private consumption after the lifting of economic sanctions, also financed by foreign savings. National savings are projected to decline in 1995 but to begin to recover soon thereafter as fiscal imbalances are reduced and private sector real incomes increase. The centerpiece of the program is a fiscal, strategy'that permits a temporary widening of the fiscal deficit.(financed by budgetary grants and concessional loans) to meet immediate reconstruction and rehabilitation needs while measures are being introduced to address the underlying fiscal imbalance. The program also provides for restrained wage and financial policies. 2. Public finances The fiscal program provides for an overall public sector deficit (before grants) of around 9.7 percent of GDP in 1995 (Table 3). This is larger than over the last three years but partly reflects some one-time expenditures related to the rehabilitation of infrastructure and the re- equipping of government services. External grants (equivalent to 5.8 per- cent of GDP) and concessional loans (6.9 percent of GDP) will contribute to financing the deficit while permitting a reduction in domestic indebtedness of 1.9 percent of GDP (after allowing for amortization). Central government expenditure is programmed to increase by about 2 percentage points of GDP in 1995 to 10.8 percent of GDP (Table 4). Spending on goods and services for supplies and basic maintenance, which were virtually ignored during the three years of military rule, will rise by 0.4 percent of GDP; l/ the wage bill is projec,ted to rise by 0.6 percent of GDP to cover personnel costs (including selective wage increases) related to the rehabilitation and decentralization-of the health and education I/ The need for the sizable expenditure is also related to the fact that several ministries were looted of equipment, furniture, and vehicles immediately prior to the return of President Aristide. On this basis, a large part of these expenditures should be-of a one-time nature.

The latter expenditures will be partly offset by a cut in military spending. lJ In addition, an amount equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP has been earmarked to cover the local counterpart costs of the capital investment program. In early October the Government dismissed some 1,200 workers who were added to the payroll immediately before the Constitutional Government took office. A voluntary separation scheme will be launched during the year aimed at further reducing central government employment. About G 125 million (0.4 percent of GDP) is included in the wage bill for severance payments and additional resources are being sought from bilateral sources. No general wage increase is included in the current fiscal program, but progress under the severance scheme will be reviewed to determine whether there have been sufficient savings for additional selected wage increases to be granted. Central government current revenue is projected to increase by about 3 percentage points of GDP to 6.3 percent in 1995. The increase will re- flect mainly: higher petroleum taxes introduced in October 1994 (estimated to yield 1.6 percent of GDP); the introduction of a 1 percent temporary import surcharge levied on all imports, (to, yield about 0.3 percent of GDP), improvements in tax administration (at least 0.5 percent of GDP) 2/ and a shift in the rate of exchange used for the valuation of imports for customs duty purposes from G 6.5 per U.S. dollar to the prevailing market exchange rate. (As discussed below, the revenue impact of this latter measure will be offset in part by a reduction in import duties.) The tax administration effort includes a program for collecting tax arrears (about G 80 million of which has been identified and arrangements made for payment), the establishment of a Large Taxpayers Unit to monitor the payment of tax obligations by the 200 largest taxpayers, and the introduction of an automated management and control system at the Customs Administration. To help implement these changes, the UNDP is discussing with the authorities the provision of technical assistance in customs administration and the Fund is to provide technical assistance in the area of internal tax administration. Several actions had been initiated to tighten budgetary control. Revenue and expenditure performance will be monitored monthly with respect to budget targets and additional fiscal measures will be adopted, if needed, to meet the fiscal objectives. Ministerial discretionary accounts at the Central Bank and other financial institutions have been virtually lJ Severance payments to military personnel are covered by external assistance for governance. 2J In 1991 a program by the Aristide Government to collect tax arrears and improve tax administration yielded additional revenues of about 0.5 percent of GDP over a six-month period.

Budget transparency has been improved by the inclusion of allocations for debt service and local counterpart funds for capital invest- ment. To prevent the further accumulation of central government arrears, the Ministry of Finance would pay the utility bills of the ministries by means of deductions from their budget allocations. In addition, it is envisaged that by March 1995 a senior revenue advisor under Fund/UNDP technical assistance will be assigned to the Ministry of Finance. Fiscal adjustment would continue over the medium term when the level c*: budgetary assistance could be expected to decline. On the revenue side, the authorities plan to reduce income tax exemptions, tax self-employed profes- sionals, and expand the value added tax to cover services. The register of property taxes is to be updated and real estate values will be reassessed; the overhaul of the property tax will be particularly important in broaden- ing the local tax base to support decentralization (80 percent of the revenues accrue to the municipalities). Central government expenditures are expected to be lower following the decentralization of health and education activities and the wage bill should be reduced gradually as civil reform progresses, supported by a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) from the World Bank. Public sector investment, which has been virtually nonexistent over the past three years, is projected to rise to 7.2 percent of GDP in 1995, largely financed by disbursements of grants and concessional loans from bilateral donors and from the multilateral lending agencies under the EERP. The EERP will focus on the rehabilitation of social and economic infrastruc- ture and will involve labor-intensive work providing temporary jobs for an estimated 60,000 people. IJ The programmed level of external assistance has been established after consultation with donors. Nevertheless, it is large with respect to the size of the economy and administrative capacity. To implement the infrastructure projects as expeditiously as possible, the IDB has financed the establishment of an Emergency Implementation Unit in the office of the Prime Minister. In addition, the UNDP is providing resources for the recruitment of local and foreign experts and for institu- tional strengthening. The Government has begun to take steps to deal with the critical finan- cial situation of the electricity company. Employment already has been reduced by about 10 percent and a 20 percent increase in the average electricity tariff will go into effect by end-March 1995. In addition, EDH will receive transfers from the Central Government of G 129 million and central bank credit of G 150 million (0.5 percent of GDP) in the current fiscal year. The bank financing would, however, be offset by the surplus to be generated by the telecommunications company. ZZ/ The Government has contracted the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to make an assessment lJ In addition to infrastructure, the EERP comprises poverty alleviation programs and financial support for the private sector. 2J The other public enterprises are expected to be in overall balance.

The range of options being considered includes a management contract with an interna- tional utility company and/or early privatization. In 1992-93 the state-owned flour mill and cement factory were closed because of serious technical and financial difficulties (though wages continued to be paid for some time after the closure). The authorities have agreed that these enterprises would be reopened only under an arrangement with private investors that would not involve any subsidies or other financial support from the public sector. 3. Monetarv nolicv The monetary program limits the growth of currency in circulation to about 19 l/2 percent (consistent with a modest decline in the income velocity of money). L/ On this basis, to help achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives of the program, the net domestic assets of the Central Bank will need to be reduced by about G 1,916 million (43.7 per- cent), after growing by G 1,261 million (40.3 percent) in 1994 (Table 5). However, with the fiscal strategy providing for net repayment to the banking system by the nonfinancial public sector of G 544 million, the program will be able to accommodate an expansion in bank credit to the private sector of about 25 percent. In the past, monetary policy has relied heavily on a high unremunerated reserve requirement (an average of 43 percent of total liabilities to the private sector) which places a heavy tax on financial savings. The lack of other monetary policy instruments and fiscal considerations made it problem- atic to program a reduction in the reserve requirement at the present time. Under the program, the Fund will provide technical assistance to modernize monetary operations (in particular, to develop market-based mechanisms) with a view to reducing the reserve requirement substantially over the medium term. The structure of the reserve requirement (which now provides for different ratios applicable to different classes of deposits) also will be unified. A statutory ceiling on commercial bank lending rates of 22 percent is to be eliminated so as to increase interest rate flexibility and the scope of financial intermediation. 2/ As noted earlier, there has been an increase in problem loans in recent years while some banks appear to have concentrated heavily on foreign exchange operations. With technical assistance from the Fund, the authori- ties are revising the banking norms on capital adequacy, loan loss u The projection for GDP reflects a strong recovery of growth during the second half of the program. 2/ Legislation to eliminate the ceiling was sent to the Parliament in January 1995 but was not passed prior to the dissolution of the Parliament on February 4, 1995. It will be reconsidered when the new Parliament convenes in April 1995.

External sector Haiti's exchange system is generally free of restrictions and since September 1991 transactions have taken place at a market-determined exchange rate. lJ The program calls for the exchange rate to continue to be deter- mined by market forces with central bank intervention only to meet the program's reserve target and to smooth out short-term fluctuations, if necessary. As noted earlier, after the sharp depreciation of the gourde during the period of the military regime, it has appreciated against the U.S. dollar since September 1994. Available indicators based on the movement in relative prices suggest an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate in the last two years (Chart). However, the legal minimum wage has remained unchanged since 1984 and as wages in the export sector are close to the minimum wage, Haiti probably continues to be competitive in terms of labor costs. 2/ The,scale of the capital inflows envisaged could put temporary upward pressure on the exchange rate. Under the program, Haiti's international reserves would remain relatively low while the assembly industries are to play a key role in achieving balance of payments viability. Accordingly, the authorities would seek to limit any appreciation of the exchange rate and tighten fiscal policy, if needed, to sterilize the monetary impact of the reserve accumulation. As part of the normalization of relations with foreign creditors, the authorities cleared arrears to multilateral creditors of USS83.3 million on December 19, 1994 with external grants of US$64 million and USS19.3 million of Haiti's reserves, which were held in blocked accounts at the Federal Reserve. At end-December 1994, remaining arrears of USS46.5 million were owed to bilateral creditors --principally to the United States, Venezuela, and Argentina--and to the IFAD and to the OPEC Fund. These remaining arrears will be eliminated through cash payments or rescheduling by end- September 1995, according to a schedule discussed with the staff. Discus- sions with Venezuela and the IFAD are underway for arrears settlement through debt relief. In addition, the authorities are taking stock of lJ There are some restrictions on capital account transactions, mainly relating to the treatment of inward direct investment. The accumulation of external payments arrears during 1992-94 reflected the difficulties of the Central Government and public entities in generating local currency funds to service their foreign loans; there was unrestricted access to foreign exchange at the market exchange rate throughout the period. L?/ A commission comprising representatives from the Government, businesses, and labor has been set up to make recommendations for a new minimum wage. The Government will seek to ensure that any increase that may be granted will be consistent with maintaining export competitiveness.

The program for 1995 envisages an increase in the current account deficit (before grants) from 6.9 percent of GDP in 1994 to 20.6 percent of GDP in 1995 (Table 6). Imports are projected to grow by about 156 percent reflecting demand for investment goods and restocking. Exports are pro- jected to grow by about 29 percent, but this reflects recovery from a very low base as investors in the assembly sector are expected to take a wait and see attitude, and because it would take time for a return to coffee cultiva- tion to be reflected in higher exports. The program's financing requirement of around US$556 million (29.3 per- cent of GDP) is projected to be covered mainly by grants (US$390 million), concessional loans (US$134 million), and disbursements under the stand-by arrangement (Table 7). The overall balance of payments is expected to shift from a deficit of US$36 million in 1994 to a surplus of US$166 million in 1995. The surplus will reflect the elimination of external arrears of US$121 million and the programmed increase in net international reserves of US$45 million. The program provides for a significant further liberalization of the trade regime by end-1995: maximum import tariffs will be lowered from 57 percent to 15 percent; the tariff regime will be simplified to four tariff rates in the range O-15 percent (the highest tariffs being applied to consumer goods and the lowest to intermediate and capital goods); tariff rates on sensitive agricultural products (maize, millet, sugar, beans, chicken parts, and pork parts) will be reduced from a range of 40-55 percent to a maximum of 10 percent (the tariff rates on rice and flour were lowered from 50 to 10 percent and from 40 to 7.5 percent, respectively in October .1994); to improve efficiency in foreign exchange allocation, the 40 percent foreign exchange surrender req,). ?ment applied to export receipts will be abolished by end-1995; lJ the c&toms valuation of imports has been shifted to the prevailing exchange rate; and quantitative restrictions which apply to seven commodities have been suspended pending passage of legislation for their elimination. 5. Structural policies The structural measures incorporated in the program include: the reform of the tariff regime described above, which would be substantially completed over the program period; a new petroleum pricing policy under which prices are adjusted automatically for changes in import costs (intro- duced in October 1994); the first phase of a public enterprise divestment lJ Foreign exchange is surrendered at the prevailing market-determined exchange rate.

In addition, with technical assistance from the Fund and from the WorlG Bank, the authorities will be working on a reform agenda to underpin a medium-term program supported by arrangements under the ESAF and a World Bank SAL. The agenda will cover reforms in the public sector (including a redefinition of the size and role of the state), in monetary policy and bank supervision, in foreign investment policy, and in business deregulation. 6. Social safetv net A wide range of humanitarian aid programs (estimated to total US$108 million) is being financed by bilateral donors and administered by non- governmental agencies. To complement these programs the Government has put together an Economic and Social Fund financed by the World bank and the IDB of about US$23 million to provide financing for small projects conceived by community organizations aimed at the rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure (schools, health facilities, sewerage and water and irriga- tion systems, and other social programs). The aim of the program is to strengthen basic services and provide income in the poorest sections of society. 7. Environmental issues The Government, with the assistance of the U.S. AID and the UNDP, is in the early stages of developing a strategy to deal with the main environ- mental problems, including deforestation, soil degradation, water and soil contamination, and solid waste management; to a large extent, these reflect inadequate land use techniques and levels of investment in infrastructure that have not kept pace with urbanization. Steps also will be taken to strengthen the institutions responsible for environmental policy, education, regulation, and enforcement. 8. Statistical issues A marked deterioration in the quality of the statistical data base for Haiti has complicated the task of formulating economic policy and monitoring an economic program. To begin to address these problems STA sent a multi- topic mission to Haiti in February 1995 to improve the statistical data base and to provide guidelines for the authorities to assist them in monitoring the program. Progress in the implementation of the recommendations made by the STA mission are to be assessed in the two reviews under the stand-by arrangement (to be completed by end-May and end-September 1995).

Performance criteria for 1995 The economic program described in the memorandum of economic and financial policies attached to the letter of intent contains the following quantitative performance criteria for the period of the stand-by arrangement (Table 8): a. targets, specified quarterly, for the minimum net international reserves of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti; ceilings, specified quarterly, on the net domestic assets of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti; C. ceilings, specified quarterly, on net domestic credit to the nonfinancial public sector; d. ceilings, specified quarterly, on the outstanding stock of external payments arrears; and e. ceilings, specified quarterly, on the stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt with maturities up to 12 years with subceilings on maturities of up to one year. A built-in contingency mechanism has been attached to the proposed stand-by arrangement to protect against deviations of external budgetary financing from the programmed level. Quarterly targets on net international reserves will be revised downwards by up to 20 percent of the cumulative shortfall in financing while the remaining 80 percent of the shortfall will be offset through a strengthened adjustment effort; the downward adjustment in net international reserves will be capped at US$lO million (equivalent to about one week of imports) on an annual basis. Conversely, quarterly targets on net international reserves will be adjusted upwards by up to 50 percent of the cumulative excess financing provided that the excess flows are allocated to once-off expenditures for restocking and rehabilitation and consist entirely of grants. IJ The partial upward adjustment of net international reserves will be triggered by excess financing flows up to US$50 million; above that cap, the adjustment will be by the full amount of excess financing. Excess financing to be allocated to expenditures related to the civil service reform are excluded from the contingency mechanism. Progress made in implementing the program will be assessed in two reviews to be completed by end-May 1995 and end-September 1995, completion of the reviews will be a condition for further purchases under the l/ The upward adjustment to the target for net international reserves would be 100 percent in the case of excess financing not in grant form and not allocated to once-off expenditures.

Medium-Term Outlook and Capacity to Benay the Fund 1. Medium-term outlook As noted, the authorities have begun work on a medium-term strategy aimed at securing sustainable economic development. In this setting, the staff prepared a scenario for Haiti's balance of payments through 1999 based on domestic policies consisting of a combination of adjustment and struc- tural reform and a gradual decline of external assistance. Such a framework should foster higher rates of economic growth, strengthen the balance of payments, and promote relative price stability. The medium-term scenario for Haiti's economy is exceptionally uncertain given the severity of the economic and social deterioration and the persis- tence of political risks. The level of domestic savings is very low, with gross national dissavings estimated at 10 percent of GDP in 1995; the tentative projection is for a recovery to 0.6 percent of GDP in 1997 and further to 8.6 percent in 1999, consistent with higher public sector savings and growing private sector real incomes, and to result in a substantial reduction in the external current account deficit. A medium-term scenario for Haiti's balance of payments consistent with this policy framework, and which takes into- account the most recent WE0 projections, is presented in Table 9. The external current account deficit (before grants) is projected to narrow from 20.6 percent of GDP in 1995 to 12 percent of GDP in 1997 and to 5.5 percent of GDP in 1999. Export receipts are projected to rise sharply from 3.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 14.6 percent of GDP in 1999, mainly reflecting the recovery of the light manufacturing assembly sector. The recovery in coffee and other traditional exports in 1995 and 1996 is projected to slow thereafter as the positive effect of the rehabilitation effort on production is partly offset by adverse price developments. Imports are projected to remain high, mainly because of inputs to the assembly sector, but to fall slightly from 19.1 percent of GDP to 18.7 per- cent of GDP over the same period. After continuing to stagnate in 1995, the lJ As noted, it is envisaged that the stand-by arrangement will be replaced by a three-year ESAF (perhaps in September 1995).

The surplus on capital account, including official grants, is projected to decline from US$558 million in 1995 to US$139 million by the end of the period, mainly reflecting sharp declines in balance of payments support. After an annual buildup of net international reserves of US$25 million, large though declining financing gaps are projected to persist resulting in a cumulative gap of US$267 million over 1996-99. At the Consultative Group meeting for Haiti held in Paris in January 1995, donors pledged-about USS1.2 billion in new commitments for external budgetary and project assistance. Assuming a sustained and reasonable level of foreign aid absorption capacity, disbursements out of new commitments should contribute substantially to closing the gaps. Haiti's public external debt (including obligations to the Fund) is projected to rise from 45.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to 52.8 percent of GDP in 1997, before declining to 49.1 percent at the end of the period (Table 10). The debt-service ratio would fall from 47.7 percent of export receipts in 1995 to 11 percent in 1999, mainly reflecting sharply higher exports. The amount of debt on concessional terms is expected to grow from 90.4 percent of total debt in 1995 to 95.4 percent in 1999, mainly reflecting the reduc- tion of obligations to the Fund. Two alternative scenarios for the balance of payments are presented in Table 11. The first variant assumes an adverse terms of trade shock due to a 20 percent decline in the international coffee price and a 20 percent increase in the international oil price in 1995. The resultant current account deficit (before grants) would rise by 1 percentage point of GDP above the annual average deficit under the baseline scenario. The cumula- tive gap for 1996-99 would be US$371 million and Haiti would need to strengthen its adjustment effort to close the financing gap. The second variant assumes a more moderate growth of light manufactured exports caused by the slower return of foreign investment and firms in the assembly sector. The current account deficit (before grants) would rise by 5 percentage points of GDP above the average annual deficit under the baseline scenario and the cumulative gap would nearly triple to US$795 million compared to the baseline scenario. Closing this gap would require a combination of substan- tial adjustment effort from Haiti and additional external financial assistance from the international community to support the medium-term economic recovery. On average during 1996-99, the total debt-service ratios under the terms of trade shock would rise by 2 percentage points above the average debt-service ratio under the baseline scenario. However, in the scenario of a more moderate recovery in the assembly sector, the debt-service ratio is 7 percentage points above that of the baseline scenario.

Canacitv to renav the Fund Since 1991 when the Constitutional Government was in exile and had no control of the country's financial resources, Haiti accumulated arrears to the Fund,which were cleared shortly after the resolution of the political crisis. Before this period Haiti had been late in its payments to the Fund, although the overdues were generally small and of limited duration. There are obvious risks involved in increasing Fund exposure in Haiti, including the uncertainties associated with the medium-term balance of payments outlook and the experience of the past six years which points to a constant and grave political risk. While there is little that the Fund can do about political risk, the medium-term uncertainties could be reduced through the Government's determined implementation of appropriate economic policies. The staff proposes to limit Haiti's access under the stand-by arrange- ment to about 33 percent of quota reflecting the expected availability of substantial external assistance on concessional terms, the relatively high cost of support provided under the stand-by arrangement, and the expectation that it will be replaced by ESAF arrangements before the end of 1995. The first purchase under the proposed arrangement would be the balance under the first credit tranche (SDR 15.2 million);. the remaining four purchases would be of SDR 1.2 million each. Purchases of all resources available under the stand-by arrangement will raise total Fund credit outstanding from an estimated 6 percent of quota at end-February 1995 to 33.9 percent of quota at end-February 1996. Under the baseline scenario, and assuming that all prospective drawings under the arrangement are made, Fund repurchases and charges would decline from 6.4 percent.of export receipts in 1995 to 1 percent in 1997 before rising again to 4 percent by 1999 as repurchases under the arrangement fall due (Table 12). The ratio of scheduled payments to the Fund to gross offi- cial-reserves is projected to show a similar pattern, declining from 3 per- cent in 1995 to zero in 1997 and rising to 8 percent in 1999. Indicators of Fund credit would show little change under the terms of trade shock sce- nario, with the debt-service ratio falling from 6.4 percent in 1995 to about 3.5 percent by the end of the period; under the scenario of a slower recov- ery in exports of manufactures, however, the debt-service ratio to the Fund falls to 1.4 percent in 1997 but rises to 6.3 percent by the end of the period.8 V. Staff Appraisal Haiti has experienced a dramatic deterioration in economic and social conditions since the military coup of September 1991, accentuating the downward trend evident since the mid-1980s. The return to constitutional government provides an opportunity to halt the economic and social decline Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - and to begin a comprehensive program of reforms as a prerequisite for sustainable economic development and a steady reduction in poverty. The program for 1995 is based on a projected recovery in real GDP growth of about 4 percent. This would appear to be feasible after the sharp decline in the economy in recent years and given the expected increase in construction activity and imports over the next year. The inflation objective also should be obtainable given the lack of price indexation mechanisms in the economy and the easing of supply shortages following the lifting of the trade embargo. The program envisages only a modest improve- ment in the overall balance of payments, but allows for a sharp increase in imports financed by considerable concessional external resources. The fiscal strategy is the core of the adjustment effort. The deficit of the nonfinancial public sector is projected to widen in 1995 to accommo- date urgently needed rehabilitation expenditures, but will be fully financed by external concessionary assistance. However, since much of the foreign assistance is likely to be nonrecurring, the authorities also are taking measures to move to a sustainable fiscal position. Beyond 1995, these measures include higher petroleum taxes and steps to collect tax arrears and to improve tax administration. The Fund staff and the UNDP are collabo- rating on a technical assistance program to improve customs and internal tax administration. The Government also is tightening expenditure control mechanisms including through the virtual abolition of ministerial discre- tionary expenditure accounts. In the public enterprise sector, the authorities are taking some needed steps to improve the finances of the electricity company, through a 20 per- cent increase in average electricity prices and a reduction in employment. Even with these measures, however, the company will require substantial recourse to financing from the Government and the Central Bank. The authorities have commissioned an IFC study to explore a more permanent solution to the company's financial difficulties including through the contracting out of the management or early privatization. The program provides for a tight monetary policy to help bring down inflation and stabilize the exchange rate, Given the underdeveloped state of the Haitian capital market, monetary policy is exercised mostly through reserve requirements. However, with technical assistance from the Fund, the authorities are working to develop instruments that could be used in open market operations. To improve the efficiency of financial intermediation, legislation has been introduced to eliminate the existing ceiling on com- mercial bank lending rates. The staff regards the floating exchange rate regime as appropriate in the present circumstances but underscores the need for prudent financial policies to support it. The present indication is that, given the decline in real wages over the last few years, Haiti continues to enjoy a high degree of external competitiveness. Adjustments to the minimum wage are presently under consideration by a tripartite commission of representatives Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - from Government, business and labor; in this regard, the authorities should make every effort to ensure that any increase granted would be consistent with maintaining competitiveness. The sizable public capital inflow envisaged during 1995 could put temporary upward pressure on the exchange rate. The staff supports the authorities' strategy of using fiscal measures to limit the appreciation of the exchange rate so as to protect the export sector, and to sterilize the monetary effects of additional reserve accumulation. The program envisages important structural reforms in the area of public enterprise restructuring, petroleum price policy, and the liberaliz- ation of the trade and payments regime. The latter involves reduced tariff rates and the elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports and the export surrender requirement. Reforms in the financial system and the tax regime are also expected to get underway this year. These would be intensified in the context of the medium-term strategy for which the authorities intend to seek Fund support through arrangements under the ESAF. The extreme poverty affecting the majority of the population of Haiti poses one of the greatest challenges to the newly restored Government. While substantial resources would seem to be available for social safety net programs this year, the authorities will need to ensure that the poverty alleviation effort contained in the EERP is properly coordinated and that the most needy groups are targeted. In the light of the measures already adopted and the policy commitments of the Government outlined in their memorandum on economic and financial policies, the staff believes that the economic program of the Government of Haiti deserves the support of the Fund in the form of a stand-by arrangement for an amount equivalent to SDR 20 million. The staff would note, however, that the situation remains vulnerable, and the authorities will need to act with determination to correct deviations from the program, particularly in the fiscal area. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - VI.

Introduction 1. Already among the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti underwent further significant economic and social deterioration in the three-year period following the military coup that deposed elected President Aristide in September 1991. The suspension of democracy and the ensuing military repression prompted an international trade embargo and the period saw a major collapse of the economy, a severe deterioration in economic and social infrastructure, and a significant decline in living standards, particularly of the most vulnerable groups. 2. The return to constitutional government provides an opportunity for the Government to take steps to halt the economic and social decline and to begin a comprehensive program of reforms as a prerequisite for sustain- able economic development anchored on social justice and a democratic order. Since the resolution of the political crisis the Government, in collabora- tion with several multilateral institutions and bilateral donors, has finalized an Emergency Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) to attend to the most pressing needs in health, nutrition, sanitation, and the rehabilitation of essential infrastructure. Simultaneously, work has been proceeding on a medium-term economic strategy. The stabilization program for the period 1994/95, in support of which a stand-by arrangement from the International Monetary Fund is being sought, is described below. As noted in the Letter accompanying this memorandum, the Government of Haiti intends to seek further assistance from the Fund in support of its program of medium-term structural reform through arrangements under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). II. Economic Backnround 1991-94 3. Preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP may have declined by about 30 percent over the three-year period 1991-94 (fiscal year ending September 30) with all economic sectors affected. The agricultural sector suffered because of shortages of critical inputs and credit and the deterioration in irrigation facilities; the assembly industry contracted by about three fourths with employment declining from 44,000 in September 1991 to 8,000 by May 1994 and the incipient tourism industry has virtually disappeared. Inflation (as measured by the average annual change in the consumer price index) was 18 percent in 1992-93 and rose to 36 percent in 1994. The gourde depreciated from G 7.5 per U.S. dollar as at September 1991 to G 21.5 per U.S. dollar as at August 1994. Following the recent improvement in the political and economic climate there has been an appre- ciation to around G 13 per U.S. dollar. 4. The current account of the nonfinancial public sector declined from balance in 1991 to 3.8 percent of GDP in 1994. In the absence of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - APPENDIX VI ANNEX foreign financing, there was virtually no capital investment over the period and the overall deficit narrowed from 4.5 percent of GDP to 4.2 percent of GDP financed by recourse to bank credit and the accumulation of payments arrears. 5. Central bank net credit to the public sector rose sharply in 1992-94,.mainly financed by a sizable increase in currency issue and in commercial banks' reserve requirements. Over the period, private sector credit demand was generally sluggish and there are indications that much of the credit expansion that took place was to finance foreign exchange speculation. With the sharp decline in economic activity over the period, there was a deterioration in the loan portfolios of a few banks. 6. Exports declined from US$200 million in 1991 to under US$60 million in 1994. Total imports also declined sharply notwithstanding the expansion of humanitarian aid programs. The external current account deficit (excluding grants) which reached 6.9 percent of GDP in 1994 was financed largely by humanitarian aid and by the accumulation of external arrears to multilateral agencies and bilateral creditors; the arrears to multilateral creditors were cleared in December 1994. III. The Reform Strateny 7. The medium-term macroeconomic program being developed aims at achieving a real GDP growth of around 6 percent a year in the period 1996-98, bringing down inflation to international levels and strengthening the balance of payments position so as to reduce reliance on special balance of payments support. The plan envisages an immediate recovery in private consumption and a steady growth in private investment mainly in the assembly sector and in agriculture. 8. The medium-term plan attaches major importance to increasing domestic resource mobilization through a major improvement in the tax effort and the establishment of.conditions conducive to an increase in private savings. Also, the Government will place emphasis on increasing the effi- ciency of expenditure and will reallocate spending towards meeting critical needs in health, education, and justice. To complement its fiscal strategy, the Government intends to facilitate private sector development through the upgrading of economic infrastructure, the reform of the external trade regime, the divestment of state enterprises, and business deregulation. IV. The Program for 1995 9. Since the return to constitutional order, several measures have been taken to demonstrate the Government's commitment to the new development strategy. In the fiscal area, these measures have included the immediate elimination of petroleum subsidies; the termination of the system of discre- tionary budgetary accounts; and the cancellation of all public sector wage contracts signed with the illegal government established after May 11, 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX VI ANNEX With the assistance of friendly donor countries and with a contribution of US$18 million from the Government's limited international reserve holdings, arrears to multilateral agencies of US$82 million were cleared on December 19, 1994 which permitted the approval of an Emergency Economic Recovery Credit by the Executive Board of the World Bank. A similar credit has been negotiated with the staff of the Inter-American Development Bank and will be presented to the Bank's Board in early January. As a manifes- tation of our commitment to a public/private sector partnership in national development, the Government has established a Presidential Mixed Commission on the Economy with representation from a wide range of private sector interests. The principal objective of this commission will be to develop a regulatory framework appropriate for attracting private investment. 10. The program for 1995 is formulated on the basis of a projected recovery in real GDP growth of 4.5 percent predicated on a pickup in public sector construction activity and a rebound in agricultural and manufacturing production. The program targets a sharp reduction in inflation (on an average annual basis) from 36 percent in 1994 to at most 15 percent during 1995 and an increase in net international reserves of US$45 million, after the elimination of arrears to multilateral agencies of US$82 million. 11. The centerpiece of the program is the fiscal strategy. To help restore basic services and meet investment and maintenance needs, the Government expects to receive US$130 million (6.9 percent of GDP) in budgetary grants and concessional loans. However, as much of this assis- tance is of a nonrecurring nature the Government has begun to take measures to move to a sustainable fiscal situation. To this end, a tax rehabilita- tion effort is being launched and measures are being introduced to strengthen the finances of the public enterprises. 12. Central government expenditures are expected to increase to 10.8 percent of GDP in 1995 compared with an average of close to 9 percent over the last three years. The increase reflects selected wage increases related to the decentralization of education and health services and the reform of the army and police, the re-equipment needs of the ministries, and the rehabilitation of the depleted health and education services. The Government has cut military spending by more than one half and has allocated the savings to the expansion and refurbishment of the new national police force. As mentioned earlier, in order to re-establish control over govern- ment expenditures, the system of discretionary ministerial accounts has been eliminated and all expenditure allocations will now be itemized in the budget. 13. The wage bill is projected to increase by 35 percent. This will be used to pay allowances to education and health workers to encourage them to move to the municipalities as part of the decentralization of these services, to provide a substantial increase in police pay from its present very low level, to clear wage arrears, to pay the 13-month salary required by the constitution but which has not been.paid in full in recent years, and to cover wages associated with the creation of four new ministries and an office of the Presidency. A voluntary separation scheme will be launched Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX VI ANNEX during the year aimed at reducing central government employment. About G 125 million is included in the budget for severance payments and addi- tional resources are being sought from bilateral sources. By June 1995, the Government will review progress under the scheme to determine whether there have been sufficient savings for additional selected wage increases. 14. Central government current revenue (excluding grants) is projected to increase,from 3.3 percent of GDP to 6.3 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting a significant increase in petroleum taxes. In January 1995, the valuation of imports for custom purposes will be shifted from the rate G 6.5 per U.S. dollar to the market rate with a reduction in the external tariff being phased in over the balance of the fiscal year. This shift will produce a small increase in customs receipts and will also raise collections from the consular tax and the value-added tax (TCA) on imports. In addition, a 1 percent temporary import surcharge will be levied on all imports, including those previously exempted. The Government has begun a review of all tax exemptions, including those given to the nongovernmental organiza- tions (NGOs). 15. The Government has begun to strengthen tax administration. Firstly, a program for collecting an estimated G 80 million in tax arrears has been launched. Secondly, the register of entrepreneurs liable for paying TCA is being updated. (It is estimated that only about 50 percent of eligible firms are currently registered.) In addition, a Large Taxpayers Unit is soon to be established to monitor the payment of tax obligations by the 200 largest taxpayers. The unit will have a computerized data base and be able to crosscheck information from the various tax collection agencies to ascertain the correct tax liability and will have the authority to impose penalties provided under the law for incorrect declarations and underpayment of taxes. During the current fiscal year, an automatic management and control system (SYDONIA) at the Customs Administration will be put in place and.local staff will be trained in its operation. To help implement these changes, a senior revenue advisor under Fund/UNDP technical assistance will be assigned to the Ministry of Finance by March 1995. 16. In 1992-93, the flour mill and the cement factory were closed because of serious financial and technical difficulties. These enterprises would be reopened only under an arrangement with private investors as part of the overal. public enterprises restructuring. The Government will ensure that the arrangements that are concluded will not involve any subsidies or other financial support from the public sector. The remaining enterprises, with the exception of Electricite d'Haiti (EDH), would be expected to operate without recourse to banking system financing and to make transfers and external debt service payments to the Central Government. To achieve these objectives, the enterprises will pursue flexible pricing setting policies, reduce employment substantially, and improve revenue collection. 17. The finances of EDH have weakened substantially in recent years because tariff adjustments have not kept pace with costs, poor maintenance, losses related .to fraud, and a deterioration in collections. The Interna- tional Finance Corporation (IFC) has been contacted to make an assessment of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDIX VI ANNEX EDH's operations with recommendations for action no later than end-June 1995. The range of options being considered includes a management perfor- mance contract with an international utility company and/or immediate divestiture. In the meantime, the corporation has embarked upon a program to collect arrears and reduce operating costs through labor retrenchment. In addition, the average electricity tariff is to be increased by 20 percent in March 1995. Nevertheless, the program provides for central government transfers of up to G 129 million and the use of central bank credit of about G 150 million in the current fiscal year. 18. The finances of the Port Authority are projected to be in approximate balance based on the existing level of port charges. A study has been commissioned to review the existing level of charges which is generally higher than those of neighboring ports. However, no reduction in such charges would take place prior to the first review of the program. In addition, in order not to weaken the finances of the Port Authority, any reduction in the future would be compensated by specific measures to reduce costs or increase collections. 19. The cash flow of the public utilities has been affected adversely by the accumulation of arrears on the part of both the private and public sectors. The utilities have embarked on a program to collect outstanding arrears from the private sector. To prevent any further accumulation of arrears by the Central Government, the Ministry of Finance will take the responsibility for paying the utility bills of other ministries by means of deductions from their respective budget allocations. 20. Public sector investment, which has been virtually nonexistent over the last three years, is programmed to rise to 7.2 percent of GDP in 1994/95 largely financed by disbursements of grants from bilateral donors and concessionary loans from multilateral agencies. The investment program will focus on the rehabilitation of economic and social infrastructure and will involve labor-intensive work providing temporary jobs for an estimated 60,000 people. In order to carry out the infrastructure works as expedi- tiously as possible, an Emergency Implementation Unit has been established in the Office of the Prime Minister. 21. On the basis of the scenario discussed above, the overall public sector deficit for 1995 could be 9.7 percent of GDP. Financing would come from the external grants and concessionary loans of about US$241 million (12.7 percent of GDP) and would allow resource sterilization at the Central Bank of 1.9 percent of GDP. Quarterly ceilings on the stock of net domestic credit to the nonfinancial public sector are set out in Table 3. 22. Additional fiscal adjustment is planned for the next few years when the level of budgetary assistance could be expected to decline sharply. In 1996, the first significant effects of the tax administration measures, announced above, are expected to be felt. In addition, the tax reform program would be continued, in particular, through further reductions in tax exemptions, the overhaul of the income and property tax regimes, and an extension of the TCA to payments for many services. A number of minor or Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - APPENDIX VI ANNEX nuisance taxes whose yields are low will be abolished and rates on some taxes whose level seems excessive, and consequently are subject to wide- spread evasion, will be lowered. Expenditures on goods and services would be lower in 1996 following the decentralization of health and education expenditures and the significant adjustment this year. Moreover, the wage bill is expected to be reduced as the civil service reform progresses supported by the World Bank Structural Adjustment Loan. 23. The credit program for 1995 is centered on a substantial reduction in the public sector's domestic financing requirement. This will help control the growth of the money supply and strengthen the Bank's net inter- national reserve position while providing adequate credit for a recovery of private sector activity. Quarterly targets for net official international reserves, quarterly limits on the net domestic assets of the Central Bank, and quarterly limits on banking system net domestic credit to the public sector are set out in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 24. In early 1990, interest rate regulations were lifted except for the ceiling on commercial bank lending rates which currently stands at 22 percent. Legislation to complete the interest rate liberalization was presented to the Parliament in January 1995. 25. The improvement in the public finances will facilitate lowering the reserve requirements on commercial bank deposits; a schedule for the reduction will be determined in the context of a financial reform program which will be undertaken during 1995 with the aid of technical assistance from the Fund. The reform program will include the unification of reserve requirements across commercial bank liabilities, the tightening of regula- tions with regard to loan classification, capital adequacy ratios and loan concentration, and steps to improve bank supervision. 26. The legal minimum wage in Haiti has remained unchanged since 1984 at G 15 per day; considering the depreciation of the gourde over the period, the minimum wage has declined from around US$3 to about US$l per day. A tripartite commission comprising representatives from government, business, and labor has been set up to make recommendations for a new minimum wage. The Government will seek to ensure that any increase that may be granted will be consistent with the objectives of maintaining export competitiveness and strengthening the public finances. 27. The Government believes that price stabilization can best be achieved through prudent fiscal and monetary policies, supported by competitive markets. Although legislation exists that would permit the Government to intervene in the setting of prices for a wide range of goods and services, this authority has been used sparingly in the past, and the Government does not believe that price controls can serve to reduce inflationary pressures. Consequently, it does not intend to rely on such controls, but may intervene on an exceptional basis as necessary to prevent short-term disruptions. Petroleum pricing policy has been modified such that petroleum product prices will be adjusted automatically for increases in import costs and movements in the value of the gourde.

The Government is committed to liberalizing the trade regime and opening the economy further. At present, tariff rates are high (up to 57 percent) on many products, there is a wide dispersion of rates and there are many exemptions, This has encouraged contraband and corruption and cultivated inefficient monopolies. During 1995, the tariff regime will be simplified and tariffs reduced to a range of O-15 percent. As noted earlier, in conjunction with the tariff reform, import valuation will be moved to the free market exchange rate and the duty free franchise system will be reviewed to eliminate abuses. The legislation to set the stage for the tariff reform program was presented to Parliament in December for approval in January 1995. Quantitative restrictions which apply to seven commodities have been suspended pending the passage of legislation to eliminate them. 29. Haiti's exchange regime is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions and, since September 1991, foreign exchange transactions have taken place at a market- determined exchange rate. Since September 1991, the gourde has depreciated by some 11 percent in real effective terms, which combined with the relative wage stability, has strengthened Haiti's export competitiveness. The exchange rate will continue to be determined by market forces with central bank intervention only to purchase foreign exchange for its operations and to smooth out short-term fluctuations as needed. There is an export surrender requirement of 40 percent, which is effected at the prevailing market exchange rate. The Government plans to eliminate this requirement by the end of the program period. 30. The external current account deficit is projected to increase to about 21 percent of GDP in 1995 as imports rise sharply for investment and restocking. Exports are projected to show only a modest increase this year as many of the firms in the assembly industry that left because of the political instability and the embargo are not expected to return immedi- ately. The higher deficit combined with the targeted increase in reserves should be covered easily by grants, concessionary loans, and debt rescheduling. 31. Concessional assistance expected to be available in 1995 is tentatively estimated at around US$524 million (27.6 percent of GDP), including grants of US$64 million for the clearance of arrears to the multilateral agencies, (which was effected on December 19, 1994) and US$184 million for budgetary support, governance, and project aid under the EERP; US$108 million is anticipated by way of humanitarian assistance channelled mostly through nongovernmental organizations and US$130 million is expected from concessional loans from the World Bank and the IDB through the special emergency credits (mentioned above) and disbursements under project loans which have been suspended since the 1991 coup. 32. In addition to the arrears to the multilateral agencies mentioned above, Haiti had accumulated arrears of USS46.5 million to bilateral creditors (mainly the United States and Venezuela) at the end of December 1994. The Government is committed to eliminating these arrears by the end Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - APPENDIX VI ANNEX of September 1995 according to the schedule set out in Table 4. The Government has also initiated an investigation into the nature of certain longstanding overdue obligations to private suppliers which are currently under dispute with a view to reaching agreement by end-April on ways to settle the issue. The Government does not intend to accumulate new arrears during the program period. 33. Haiti's balance of payments will continue to be fragile over the next few years and the public'sector financial requirements will need to be met largely by grants and concessionary loans. The nonfinancial public sector will not contract any nonconcessional foreign loans with a maturity in the range of 1-12 years or provide guarantees for similar loans to the private sector. Also, the Government of Haiti will not contract or guarantee any external debt with a maturity of one year or less that is not directly related to trade transactions. Quarterly ceilings on the stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt with maturities up to 12 years, and with subceilings on maturities of up to one year, are set out in Table 5. 34. During the period of the stand-by arrangement, the Government of Haiti does not intend to impose any restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, or to introduce multiple currency practices, or to conclude bilateral payments agreements which are inconsis- tent with the Fund's Articles of Agreement, or to impose any new or intensify any existing import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. 35. State control of substantial productive assets has resulted in mismanagement and corruption and imposed serious political economic and financial costs on Haiti's society and economy. The consolidation of the democratic order and the, desire to foster economic growth and efficiency compels the Government to dispose of these assets. The Government is drawing up a timetable for the divestment of certain state enterprises and will send to Parliament the necessary legislation to facilitate the intended divesture by end-April 1995. - 36. Even with a strong and sustained recovery, Haiti will continue to have in the foreseeable future, an overwhelming need for special health, nutrition, and other social programs to address the worst manifestations of poverty and provide a safety net for those most affected. The various humanitarian programs administered by the NGO's have played an invaluable role in delivering such services and these could be expected to continue. As indicated above, the 1994/95 budget contains a significant reallocation of expenditures towards health, education, nutrition, and other social programs. An increase in expenditures for these purposes is also envisaged in the context of the EERP. In addition, the World Bank and IDB have put together an Economic and Social Fund to provide financing for small projects conceived by community organizations and aimed at the rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure and the financing of community-based microenterprises. The Government has requested the IDA and IDB to develop a strategy to integrate the work of all the organizations involved in the poverty alleviation in Haiti.

The deterioration in the quality of the statistical data base has complicated the task of formulating economic policy and monitoring economic developments. The deficiencies are particularly marked in the area of the national accounts and the balance of payments but improvements also are needed in the statistics on the public finances and on banking. The Govern- ment plans to strengthen the statistical system by enhancing collaboration among the statistical institutions and by addressing the equipment require- ments of the main statistical units, introducing steps to ensure statistical reporting by individuals, enterprises, and government agencies as required by law and by upgrading statistical methodologies to meet international standards. The Government is seeking technical assistance from the Fund and other donors to support this effort.
