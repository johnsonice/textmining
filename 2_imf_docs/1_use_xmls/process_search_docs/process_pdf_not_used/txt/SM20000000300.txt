The pressures were exacerbated by the authorities’ heavy intervention in the foreign exchange markets and an uneven monetary policy, However, in the third quarter, the authorities adopted a consistently tight monetary policy, refrained from intervening in the foreign exchange markets to offset the downward pressures on the rand, and kept fiscal policy on course, thereby regaining market confidence. The authorities have taken advantage of the improvement in market conditions since the fourth quarter of 1998 to cautiously relax monetary policy. They have struck an appropriate balance between the need to support an economy virtually in recession and the need to avoid the reemergence of financial market pressures, reduce the net open forward position of the Reserve Bank (NOFP), and contain the potential inflationary pressures arising from the depreciation of the rand in 1998. Short-term rates are now below their precrisis levels, the NOFP is virtually back to its level before the crisis, while the rand has been relatively stable this year following a depreciation of 18 percent against the U.S. dollar. Core inflation has been contained at 8 percent, while headline inflation has declined to 1.9 percent, reflecting the impact of the fall in mortgage rates. Looking forward, the mission suggested that it would be desirable for monetary and exchange rate policy to prioritize a faster reduction of the NOFP rather than a lowering of interest rates; a faster reduction in the former would hasten a more lasting decline in interest rates by lowering the risk premium on South African assets. The substantial decline in short-term rates to below pre-crisis levels, together with the real depreciation of the rand, had begun to promote a recovery in economic growth which market observers expected to gain momentum, particularly in 2000. The authorities broadly agreed, but considered a further limited reduction in interest rates feasible without rekindling inflation pressures. The stabilization of market conditions since late 1998 was also underpinned by a strengthening of the public finances at both the national and provincial level. Mainly as a result of higher-than-projected revenue at the national level and stronger expenditure management at the provincial level, the deficit of the general government fell from 5 percent in 1997198 to 2.4 percent of GDP in 1998199. The revised medium-term outlook presented by the authorities envisages some further reduction in the overall fiscal deficit and some reallocation of spending from wage to nonwage areas in order to enhance public service delivery, especially in the social programs. While South Africa has made considerable progress in establishing a sound and stable macroeconomic environment, major challenges remain. Investment levels are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- presently too low to support the rates of growth of output and employment needed to reduce the high incidence of poverty. The key to generating sustained higher growth, while addressing the country’s pressing social issues, lies in reforming the structure of the economy to successfully tap the large pool of unemployed unskilled labor, attract capital from overseas, and raise total factor productivity. In this regard, the mission argued in favor of a faster and deeper implementation of the structural reform components of the Growth, Employment, and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, notably in the labor market, trade, and privatization areas. These reforms, complemented by improvements in education, skills enhancement, and health, and market-based land reform would help to stimulate investment-including foreign direct investment-and saving. They would also strengthen external competitiveness and generate economic growth that favored increased employment, including labor intensive activities. On the labor market, while the initiatives coming out of last year’s Job Summit should help to address the serious unemployment problem, there was also a need for more fundamental changes in some features of the labor market to encourage job creation for the unskilled. In particular, the staff cited two measures proposed in the GEAR strategy, but as yet not implemented: (i) scaling down wages for young trainees and in certain regions with high unskilled unemployment; and (ii) granting more discretion to the Minister of Labor in extending centrally negotiated wage agreements to parties not represented in those negotiations. On trade, the mission welcomed the free trade agreements with the European Union, which came into effect at the beginning of 2000, and the authorities’ willingness to unilaterally implement its trade offer to members of the Southern African Development Community, but urged the authorities to do more to reduce the number of tariff lines, reduce the dispersion of tariff rates, and lower protection to the sensitive sectors (textiles, clothing, automotive products). On privatization, the mission welcomed the partial divestiture of South African Airways in 1999 as well as the authorities’ intention to intensify the privatization program. It recommended that more importance be placed on the sale of majority interests in the respective enterprises.

INTRODUCTION 1. The Article IV consultation discussions with South Africa were held in Pretoria and Cape Town during August 25September 9,1999. The mission met with the ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Land Affairs, Labor, Trade and Industry, Provincial and Local Government, Public Enterprises, Welfare and Population Development, the Minister in the Office of the President, the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, other government officials, and representatives of the private sector, trade union movement, and academic community.’ A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission visited South Africa during October 20-November 3, 1999.’ 2. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on July 17, 1998, Directors commended the authorities on the implementation of prudent financial policies in 1997 and early 1998 during the emerging markets crisis. However, Directors expressed concern that intervention in the foreign exchange market during May-June 1998 had exacerbated currency pressures. They stressed the need to maintain a consistently tight monetary policy, avoiding further intervention in the foreign exchange market, adhering to budget targets, and accelerating implementation of structural reforms. Directors regretted the increase in the Reserve Bank’s net open forward position (NOFP), 3 and urged the authorities to revert to the strategy of reducing this position, with the aim of withdrawing Tom the forward market altogether. II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 3. South Africa experienced strong pressures in the foreign exchange and financial markets in mid-1998, related, in part, to contagion from the general turbulence in the emerging markets. The authorities responded initially by raising interest rates’ and ’ The staff team consisted of Mr. Fajgenbaum (head), Mr. Nowak, Mr. Alleyne, Mr. Jonsson, Mr. Subramanian (all AFR), and Mr. Dorsey (PDR). Prior to the discussions, members of the mission met with market analysts in London. ’ South Africa formally has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. South Atica’s relations with the Fund and World Bank are described in Appendices I and II, respectively. 3 The NOFP is defined as the Reserve Bank’s net forward foreign exchange liabilities (the “forward book”) less its net spot reserves. 4 The rise in interest rates initially was somewhat uneven, as market participants were still learning how to interpret the Reserve Bank’s signals in the context of the newly introduced repurchase system for providing overnight liquidity. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- intervening heavily in the foreign exchange markets to prevent a decline in the exchange value of the rand; the Reserve Bank’s reference overnight interest rate (the repurchase rate) was increased by 540 basis points to 20.2 percent, while the NOFP was raised by nearly US$lO billion to US$22.5 billion between end-April and end-June 1998. Notwithstanding these actions, the rand depreciated sharply, while bond and share prices fell. In the subsequent months, the Reserve Bank refrained from such foreign exchange intervention, while monetary policy was kept persistently tight. In the event, between end-April and end- August 1998 the rand depreciated by 28 percent to R 6.46 per U.S. dollar, the yield on the benchmark R 150 government bond increased by about 700 basis points to 19.8 percent, and share prices declined by 40 percent in rand terms. 4. The authorities have taken advantage of the improvement in market conditions since the fourth quarter of 1998, balancing reductions in interest rates and in the NOFP while keeping the rand relatively stable (Figures 1 and 2). The Reserve Bank gradually reduced the repurchase rate to 12 percent at end-November 1999,’ 3 percentage points below its precrisis level, and the NOFP to US$13 billion at end-1999, US$O.2 billion above the precrisis level. The tight monetary policy of the second half of 1998 and early 1999 was reflected in a slowdown of 6 percentage points in the annual rate of growth of broad money during 1999 to 9 percent by end-October (Table 2 and Figure 3), and a relatively stable rand, which remained within a range of R 6.00-R 6.20 per U.S. dollar during 1999. At the same time, inflationary pressures have been held in check and there are clear signs of a cyclical recovery in economic activity. 5. The stabilizatlon of market conditions was also underpinned by a strengthening of the public finances. The overall budget deficit of the national government was reduced from 3.9 percent of GDP in 1997/98 (April-March) to 2.6 percent in 1998/99, about 0.5 percent of GDP below the budget target (Table 3 and Figure 4), mainly as a result of higher-than-projected revenuea In addition, stronger expenditure management led to a turnaround in the financial balance of the provinces, to a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in ’ Out of concern about possible market instability associated with the Year 2000 bug, the Reserve Bank on November 24 fixed the repurchase rate at 12 percent until its next Monetary Policy Committee meeting. 6 These ratios reflect revisions to the national accounts made in June 1999 that incorporate new areas of economic activity and a change in the base year. The new GDP level at current prices is approximately 14 percent higher than previous estimates. Privatization receipts and revenue from the sale of oil stocks (R 3.0 billion or 0.4 percent of GDP in 1998/99) and losses from gold valuation changes and foreign exchange operations (R 14.4 billion or 1.9 percent of GDP) are excluded from the budget deficit. The latter is included in the calculations for the consolidated public sector borrowing requirement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- Figure 1.

As a result, the deficit of the general government fell from 5 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to 2.4 percent in 1998/99.’ The borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public enterprises shifted from -0.3 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to 0.5 percent in 1998/99, because of a substantial increase in capital expenditures by the airline and telecommunications companies. Including the realized profits and losses from the Reserve Bank’s forward market operations, the overall borrowing requirement of the consolidated nonfinancial public sector rose hrn 4.4 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to 4.8 percent in 1998/99. 6. The 1999/2000 budget (April-March) for the national government targeted a deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP but, owing to higher-than-projected revenue during the first half of the fiscal year, the government announced in October 1999 that the deficit was likely to be only 2.8 percent of GDP.* In the first half of the fiscal year, the provinces had a balanced budget, while the nonfinancial public enterprises had a suplus of R 0.8 billion (or 0.2 percent of GDP on an annualized basis). 7. The external accounts have improved significantly in 1999 (Figure 4 and Table 4). The current account deficit fell Corn 1.6 percent of GDP in 1998 to 0.1 percent (seasonally adjusted annualized basis) in the first three quarters of 1999, mainly reflecting a substantial cyclical contraction in imports, the real effective depreciation of the rand since April 1998, and the completion of import-intensive investments by the public enterprises. The financial account of the balance of payments also improved, owing to an increase in portfolio investment as investor confidence returned; the change in domicile of three large multinational corporations from Johannesburg to London (Box 1); and the government’s return to international capital markets with a number of foreign currency bond issues.’ Total external debt declined from US$39.2 billion in 1997 to US$38.8 billion in 1998 (29 percent ’ The general government also includes the local govemments, the social security fund, and the extrabudgetary institutions (e.g., universities), which together had a deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP in 1998199, unchanged from the year before. ’ During the first half of the fiscal year, national government revenue was 8.2 percent higher than in the corresponding period in the previous year (compared with a budgeted increase of 6.5 percent for the whole year), while expenditure was up by 6.8 percent (compared with a budgeted increase of 6.1 percent). 9 After being absent from the market in 1998, the government made three international bond placements during 1999: in April, a lo-year, US$SOO million “yankee” bond at a spread of 353 basis points, and a 7-year, E500 million “euro” bond at a spread of 328 basis points; and in October, a 5-year, E300 million “em-o” bond at a spread of 325 basis points. On December 23, these bonds were trading at spreads of 222,205, and 199 basis points, respectively.

Several smaller corporations have also either recently moved their legal residence to the United Kingdom or Australia or are reported to be considering such a move. Prior to their move, Anglo American and SABC were the largest and second largest corporations in terms of market capitalization in the JSE; in the case of Old Mutual, although it was not listed on the JSE prior to 1999, its current market capitalization suggests that it would have been among the top three corporations had it been listed in Johannesburg. All three companies have been included in the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 and 350 indices, with a collective market capitalization (as of November 12, 1999) of 22.56 billion pounds sterling (USS36.5 billion). Private market analysts and the companies themselves cite a number of factors behind the move. The companies expect to benefit t?om gmater freedom from South Africa’s capital controls for their non-South African operations and lower cost of capital because of the larger and more liquid London market and lower risk premia (to the extent that they are perceived as British rather than South Africa corporations). Other benefits cited include the ability to compensate employees outside South Africa with stock or stock options that could be more readily traded or realized. The South A&au authorities balanced a number of considerations in deciding to permit the “delistings”. Other things equal, it would have preferred that its major corporations remained as South African residents, but it recognized advantages for the South African economy as a whole from the delistings. To the extent that the formerly South African companies are included in major stock exchange indices (such as the FTSE indices), there will be increased demand for their shares by mutual fimds and unit trusts which follow the indices as part of their investment strategy. Because South African residents are major shareholders in these companies, the increased value of the shares will benefit not only the companies, but also South Africans. Moreover, the authorities recognize that these companies are such a large part of the South African economy that in maxh&ing their profits they will raise considerably South Atiican welfarc. Finally, the SARB has retained a large measure of control over the companies’ capital flows through prior agreements that allow the SARB to continue regulating their capital movements notwithstanding their new, nonresident status. The initial impact of the &listing upon the balance of payments and other economic flows is likely to be modest. Most of the shift will appear as a reclassification of existing assets and liabilities. The international investment position data will now show substantial portfolio claims on foreign corporations by South African residents (i.e., their shareholdings in “new” British corporations) and large direct and portfolio claims of foreign corporations on South Africa (i.e., the physical and financial assets owned by these now foreign companies). To the extent that index funds acquire stakes in the formerly South African companies through purchases of shares from South African residents, there may be additional capital inflows into South A&a if these South Africa residents do not reinvest the proceeds of their sales in foreign securities (such reinvestment may be blocked by existing capital controls). Fiscal effects should be modest as well, as these companies will continue to do most of their business and pay taxes in South Africa through their South African subsidiaries.

Reflecting these developments, there was an improvement in the various vulnerability indicators (Table 5). 8. A cyclical rebound in economic activity is under way, following the slowdown that began in late 1997. This slowdown was aggravated by the large increase in real interest rates that followed the onset of financial market pressures in May 1998, and real GDP growth fell from 2.5 percent in 1997 to 0.6 percent in 1998. Indeed, interest-sensitive expenditure, such as the consumption of durables and private fixed and inventory investment, were the most affected. In these circumstances, the trend decline in formal private sector employment continued, and the overall unemployment rate, which was 37.4 percent in 1997,” most likely increased hrther. A combination of factors, including the reestablishment of cahn in the financial markets, the improvement in external competitiveness, the decline in real interest rates, and the recent increase in the price of gold has provided the basis for a recovery in economic activity.” Real GDP grew by 3.1 percent at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the third quarter of 1999. 9. Despite pressures arising from increases in oil prices and the depreciation of the rand iu 1998, inflation has been largely contained, owing to the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and the sluggishness of aggregate demand (see Figure 3). Core inflation (i.e., excluding changes in mortgage interest costs and fi-esh food prices) rose from 7 percent in April 1998 (12-month rate) to 8 percent by end-1998, and remained at that level during 1999. In contrast, the 12-month headline inflation (i.e., including all items) rose from 5 percent in April 1998 to 9 percent by end-1998, but has since then fallen to 2 percent as of November 1999. The divergence between the core and headline rates of inflation is the result of the large swings in mortgage costs since April 1998.” After showing a downward trend in early 1998, the 12-month rate of producer price inflation has picked up to 5% percent by September 1999, driven mainly by higher oil prices and the pass-through of the depreciation of the rand in 1998. In particular, producer prices for imported goods increased by over 7 percent in the first nine months of 1999. lo This figure comes from the 1997 October Household Survey and includes discouraged workers as part of the unemployed, i.e., those that are willing to accept work but have not been actively searching. ‘I At the time of the mission, the authorities welcomed the IMF’s decision to undertake its planned sales of gold by means of off-market gold sales. ‘* Mortgages cany flexible interest rates, and the banks generally adjust their mortgage rates to changes in the repurchase rate.

Progress has been made on structural reforms: an agreement on a free trade area with the European Union (Eu) was reached in April 1999 and became effective on January 1, 2000; the Southern African Development Community (SADC) trade protocol has been agreed upon (Box 2); privatization has gained momentum with the sale of 20 percent of South African Airways in June 1999; and implementation of the measures to reduce unemployment arising from the October 1998 Jobs Summit has begun. These measures include special employment programs focusing on rural infrastructure development, mentoring and microfinancing programs for the promotion of small enterprises and labor- intensive sectors (particularly tourism), and skills development and training initiatives targeted at youth and women.” 11. Although South tica’s per capita income of US$3,164 in 1998 places it in the category of middle income countries, this indicator masks a wide disparity in economic conditions within the country. According to the World Bank, 24 percent of the population lives in absolute poverty, i.e., surviving on less than US$l per day, while South Africa’s indicators in health, education, safe water, and fertility are among the worst in the middle- income group. The government has exhibited a strong commitment to reducing poverty, beginning with the Reconstruction and Development Program, which articulated the government’s development vision and which was at the heart of the government’s policy of reorienting expenditure toward social programs. This commitment has been continued under the Growth, Employment, and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, which recognized the importance of substantially raising the rates of economic growth and employment creation as being indispensable for poverty reduction. 12. Regarding the economic outlook, the staff projections assumes that the cyclical recovery under way will continue to strengthen, buoyed by the substantial easing of monetary conditions over the past 12 months, a rebound in global metal commodity prices, improved competitiveness, and a boost to private consumption induced by the demutualization of a large insurance company earlier this year. I4 Real GDP growth is projected to increase from 1.2 percent in 1999 to 3.6 percent in 2000 (see Table 1). In this context, the external current account deficit is expected to rise from an estimated 0.3 percent of GDP in 1999 to about 1 percent in 2000, and core inflation would narrow to below 7 percent by the end of 2000. I3 Financing for the skills development initiatives will come, in part, from the Obsobomvu Fund, which was capitalized from the proceeds of a one-time tax on the shares of two demutuahzed insurance companies in 1999, and the Skills Development Levy, a YZ percent payroll tax to be implemented beginning in April 2000 (the levy will rise to 1 percent from April 2001 onwards). I4 The demutualization of Old Mutual Insurance company resulted in the distribution of common stock worth some R 7 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to policyholders.

The EU and SADC Free Trade Agreements The European Union (EU) - South Africa free trade agreement went into force on January 1,200O. The agreement embodies the principle of asymmetry in that liberalization by the EU will be faster (mostly over a three-year period compared with a twelve-year period for South Africa) and broader in coverage (encompassing 95 percent of all imports compared with 86 percent for South Africa). Regarding the liberalization of EU markets, the elimination of tariffs on 9 1 percent of all industrial imports from South Africa will take place within 3 years, and by the end of 10 years the liberalization will cover almost all industrial imports. Currently, about 78 percent of industrial imports from South Africa enters the EU duty free, indicating that the incremental liberalization by the EU will cover about 13 percent of imports. In agriculture, the EU’s liberalization will be both partial and backloaded. By the end of the transition period of 10 years, restrictions would continue to apply to about 40 percent of South Africa’s agricultural exports to the EU. South Africa will eliminate tariffs affecting 86.5 percent of the value of imports from the EU (comprising 73 percent of all tariff lines in the industrial sector) over 12 years, with about three quarters of this taking place within the first 3 years. In addition, tariffs will be reduced, but not eliminated, on an additional 3 percent of imports. It is noteworthy that the sectors that are exempted from the tariff elimination-textiles (average tariff rate of 28.7 percent, compared with an average tariff rate of 14.4 percent for industrial goods), clothing (56.9 percent), footwear (33.8 percent), and automotive products (38.5 percent) account for about a quarter of all tariff lines and are sectors with the highest tariffs. In agriculture, South Africa will eliminate its tariffs on about 8 1 percent of agricultural imports from the EU, with less than half of this liberalization taking place within the first three years of the agreement South Africa has formally ratified the Trade Protocol of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), as have six other SADC countries (8 out of the original 12 SADC member states need to ratify the agreement for it to come into force). South Africa is willing to implement the agreement unilaterally as soon as consensus can be reached on the rules of origin. However, negotiations on this issue failed to produce an agreement by the end of 1999, as had been hoped. According to statistics of the Department of Trade and Industry, 99 percent of tariff lines (97 percent of SADC imports) will qualify for duty free access to South Africa by 2005, with duties on 63 percent of tariff lines (69 percent of SADC imports) eliminated upon the implementation of the agreement.

III. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS 13. South Africa has made considerable progress in establishing the sound and stable macroeconomic environment that is necessary for sustainable growth. Major challenges, however, remain. Investment levels are presently too low to support the rates of growth of output and employment needed to reduce the high incidence of poverty (see Figure 4). Moreover, while some further fiscal adjustment is feasible and advisable, and tax reform could stimulate some rise in private saving and investment rates, a substantial increase in investment will need to be supported by higher foreign saving, preferably through long term capital inflows. 14. The key to generating sustained higher growth, while addressing the country’s pressing social issues, lies in reforming the structure of the economy to successfully tap the large pool of unemployed unskilled labor, attract capital from overseas, and raise total factor productivity. The policies necessary to deliver these goals constituted the primary focus of the consultation discussions. In particular, the staff argued in favor of a faster and deeper implementation of the structural reform components of the GEAR strategy, notably in the labor market, trade, and privatization areas, so as to achieve real GDP growth rates of about 6 percent over the medium term. These reforms will stimulate investment- including foreign direct investment-and saving, strengthen external competitiveness, and generate economic growth that favors increased employment, including labor intensive activities. Improvements in education, skills enhancement, and health, and market-based land reform should complement these efforts. In addition, the staff urged the Reserve Bank to continue reducing its still large NOFP, and to eventually withdraw from the forward foreign exchange market, in order to eliminate this source of vulnerability. A. Structural Policies 15. The existence of a large pool of unemployed and unskilled workers points to the presence of rigidities in the labor market and skill deficiencies. The initiatives coming out of last year’s Job Summit should help to address the serious problem of unemployment in South Africa, but there is also a need for more fbndamental changes in some features of the labor market to encourage job creation for the unskilled. In particular, the staff cited two measures proposed in the GEAR strategy, but as yet not implemented: (i) scaling down wages for young trainees and in certain regions with high unemployment; and (ii) granting more discretion to the Minister of Labor not to extend centrally negotiated wage agreements to parties not represented in those negotiations. The first measure would reduce the cost of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- unskilled labor and create incentives to hire and train such workers.” The second measure would reinforce the first one by facilitating the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises which are traditionally the main engines of employment creation. 16. The authorities argued that the statutes of the Labor Relations Act, which set out the procedures for the extension of bargaining council agreements, contained safeguards for small businesses and did not compromise employment creation.16 Nevertheless, they would review recent labor laws to ascertain whether they had resulted in any unintended adverse employment effects (Box 3). As part of this review, in November 1999, the Minister of Labor announced that certain provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA) regarding overtime hours and bonuses and personal leave would be varied for small and medium-sized businesses.” The mission also suggested that the authorities consider rolling back or eliminating the skills development levy, which could be a disincentive for employment creation, and instead make room in general resources to finance employee training programs. Given the seriousness of the unemployment problem, the mission noted the need for better, more frequent, and timely labor market data to strengthen labor market analysis and policy design. 17. The mission noted the substantial progress made in the area of trade liberalization in recent years, including the reduction in the average (unweighted) tariff rate from 30 percent in 1990 to 14.4 percent in 1998, a reduction in the number of tariff bands from over 200 to 72, and the virtual elimination of all quantitative restrictions on imports. Moreover, a staff study indicates that these actions had significantly increased total factor productivity growth during the 1990s and had accounted for most of the economic growth in South Africa during this decade (Box 4). Is The introduction of “learnerships,” as envisaged in the Skills Development Act, could potentially address this issue, provided the scope of the program is large and the learnership wage, which has yet to be determined by the Minister of Labor, is set at an appropriately moderate level. I6 However, exemptions to the extension of agreements are only granted on an ad hoc basis, for a limited period of time, and cover a relatively limited number of very small businesses. ” For small businesses (those with less than ten employees), the maximum number of overtime hours has been raised to 15 hours per week (compared with 10 hours in the BCEA); the minimum overtime remuneration rate has been lowered to “time and a third’ (compared with “time and a half’); and employees will not be eligible for three days of family responsibility leave (as granted by the BCEA). These changes, however, do not apply to small businesses that are covered by a bargaining council agreement or any other ministerial sectoral determination.

The LIU promotes and facilitates collective bargaining; regulates the right to strike and the recourse to lockout; outlines procedures for the resolution of labor disputes through statutory conciliation, mediation and arbitration; defines what are fair/unfair dismissals and establishes the procedures that must be followed to address this issue, as well as the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved, and bestows on the Labour Court ultimate jurisdiction over labor-related disputes. The LI&4 outlines the requirements for the registration of bargaining councils, which, in some sense, are the cornerstone institutions of the South African labor market regulatory system A bargaining council (BC) is made up of trade unions and employer organizations covering a particular economic sector and geographical area, with power shared equally by both sides. For the most part, agreements concluded by the BC on a given issue (e.g., strike procedures or leave policy) supercede any regulation on that issue contained in the LRA or the BCEA. Furthermore, if a BC covers the majority of the workers in the sector and area for which it is registered, then the Minister of Labor is obliged to extend the agreement to all employers and employees in that sectoriarea, if requested by the BC. The powers and functions of the BC include concluding and enforcing collective bargaining agreements on wages, benefits, and conditions of hours of work, determining prerequisite procedures and criteria for strikes or lock-outs; performing dispute resolution functions; and establishing and administering pension, medical, unemployment, training schemes and/or funds. As its name suggests, the BCEA prescribes basic minimum protection for workers on matters ranging from the work week, overtime remuneration premiums, annual, sick, and maternity leave, child labor, and severance pay. However, the BCEA does not set minimum wages; these are set in the various BCs or by ministerial determinations. Apart corn the stipulations on sick leave, maternity leave, and child labor, the conditions of work may be altered by a ministerial determination (as was done in November 1999 for the case of small and medium-sized enterprises) or a bargaining council agreement Compared to its predecessor, the current BCEA provides more generous worker protection by way of a shorter work week, higher overtime compensation rates, and more annual leave. The EEA aims to promote equal opportunity and fair treatment in employment, and to implement affirmative action measures to redress the disadvantages experienced by designated groups (i.e., black persons, women, and people with disabilities) in order to ensure their equitable representation in all occupational categories. The law requires designated empZoyers (i.e., employers with more than 50 employees or with an annual turnover above a given threshold) to prepare and implement employment equity plans, containing affirmative action measures with 5-year quantifiable objectives, in consultation with employees and/or their trade unions. The SDA, which replaced the Manpower Training Act (MTA), seeks to provide opportunities for new entrants to the labor market to gain work experience, and to improve the employment prospects-through training-of persons previously disadvantaged by dis crimination. It envisages the creation of a number of sector education and training authorities (SETAs), administered by representatives of organized labor and business, which will be responsible for designing and implementing apprenticeship or Zeamership programs, approving workplace skills plans, and collecting and disbursing the skills development levies (see below) in its sector. A ministerial determination has not yet been made on the conditions of work (including remuneration) that will apply to learnership contracts. Also, it is not yet clear what the scope of the learnership program will be, although the objectives of the law suggest that the scope will be broader than that of the MTA, which was geared largely to training artisans and limited to persons who already could be classified as having some skills. Financing for skills development will come, in part, from the Skills Development Levy, a payroll tax of 0.5 percent to be levied beginning in April 2000 and increased to 1 percent from April 2001 (sma.lI businesses will be exempt). Twenty percent of the levy paid by an employer will automatically go to the Skills Development Fund. The rest will be transferred to the Sector Education and Training Authority (SETA) which has jurisdiction over the employer. If a SETA does not exist, the money will go directly to the Skills Development Fund. The money in the Fund may only be used for projects identified in the national skills development strategy as national priorities.

Trade Liberalization, Productivity, and South Africa’s Pattern of Trade l/ South Africa’s substantial trade liberalization during the 1990s has led to an improvement of the dynamic efficiency of the economy without increasing capital intensity. Notwithstanding this development, South Africa is still a net exporter of capital intensive goods. The dynamic gains from trade in South Africa were empirically examined by studying the relationship between trade and total factor productivity (TFP). Two different data sets and approaches were used: (i) a time series approach where trade is defined in terms of aggregate outcomes, i.e., as the share of imports plus exports in GDP, and (ii) a cross sectional approach where trade is defined in terms of trade policy, i.e., as actual trade protection across different manufacturing sectors. The results indicate that there is a strong and robust positive relationship between trade and TFP growth. In fact, both the time series and cross sectional results show that trade liberal&ion has accounted for annual total factor productivity growth of about 2 percent during the 1990s. Moreover, the improvement in TFP growth did not result fkom shedding employment, i.e., employment did not fall relatively more in the sectors where tariffs were reduced more aggressively. Nevertheless, South Africa’s pattern of trade still exhibit an anomaly, in the sense that South Africa is a net exporter of capital intensive goods, even in trade with high income partners. Given South Africa’s relative abundance of (unskilled) labor, its comparative advantage would presumably be to export goods (on a net basis) that are labor intensive, especially in unskilled labor. The discrepancy between the relative endowment of input factors in quantitative terms and the actual pattern of trade suggests that labor is a relatively expensive production factor. The results hold after controlling for the fact that some important export industries in South At&a tend to be rich in natural resources. However, a comparison of the pattern of trade in 1990 and 1997 indicates that the pattern moved somewhat toward more labor intensive goods. l/ See accompanying Selected Issues paper for a more detailed description of these developments.

The free trade agreement (FFA) between South Africa and the EU represents a further advance towards trade liberalization and the credible opening of the South African economy.” The agreement provides for the elimination of duties on about 90 percent of trade by 2012 (see Box 2). However, the staff was concerned that the agreement did not significantly reduce the protection of certain key sectors: 27 percent of tariff lines in manufacturing, concentrated largely in the “sensitive” sectors (textiles, clothing, leather and footwear, and automotive products), are either excluded from the FTA or will be only partially liberalized, even after the 1Zyear transition period. In addition, the staff encouraged the authorities to consider further liberalization on a most-favored-nation basis in order to minimize the trade diversion costs that might be induced by the FTA. The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement unilaterally its SADC-accelerated tariff reduction offer,lg and emphasized that South Afkica’s contribution to the development of the region would be greatly enhanced if it opened its markets in those sectors where SADC partner countries could reap potential benefits. 19. The mission encouraged the authorities to press ahead in addressing the remaining issues in the area of trade liberalization. In particular, it stressed the need to (i) simplify the tariff regime by reducing the number of tariff bands and the number of specific tariffs in order to reduce the dispersion in effective protection among sectors and help improve customs administration;20 (ii) decrease the use of discretionary tariff increases; (iii) lower further the high protection for the sensitive sectors; and (iv) ensure that the FTA with the EU did not disadvantage regional trade partners. The authorities agreed on the importance of these issues and stated that the latter two would be addressed in South Africa’s trade offer to its partners in the SADC. 20. The authorities emphasized their commitment to regional development and integration, noting that they considered the SADC to be the appropriate forum for forging regional cooperation, but agreeing with the need to rationalize the proliferation ‘* The agreement, which is scheduled to come into effect on January 1,2000, has been ratified by South Africa but not yet by the EU. A controversial wine and spirits accord, which addresses the use by South A&a of the “port,” “ sherry,” and other appellations, was to have been part of the overall agreement but is still being negotiated; it will move forward on its own schedule, delinked from the agreement. lg The authorities’ willingness to unilaterally implement its SADC trade offer is contingent on an agreement by the, SADC countries of a code governing rules of origin (see Box 2). 2o See Box 6 in last year’s Article IV report for South Atica (M/98/147) for a comparison of South Africa’s trade regime with some similar economies.

In particular, and as a first step, there was scope for greater cooperation between the Cross-Border Initiative (CBI) and the SADC to avoid duplication of efforts and inconsistent policies, and to ensure commonality of objectives and strategies. Such cooperation was relevant not just in trade but also in areas such as investment facilitation, financial sector regulation and liberalization, tax harmonization, and coordination of regulation in sectors such as telecommunications, power, and transportation.22 21. The authorities agreed that the privatization program needed to be strengthened if it was to contribute to greater efficiency of the overall economy and faster growth, and if it was to stimulate foreign direct investment and technology transfer. To this end, they intend to accelerate the restructuring and privatization of the public enterprises within the framework of a detailed 5-year timetable, which will be announced by the end of the current fiscal year. The mission welcomed these intentions, and urged the authorities to place greater emphasis on divesting majority control in enterprises than had previously been the case. The authorities also stated that privatization proceeds would be used mainly to retire government debt and thereby reduce interest costs, which would free resources for more productive purposes. B. Monetary and Exchange Bate Policies 22. The conduct of monetary policy since the last Article IV consultation has been largely appropriate. Tightening monetary policy, while refraining from intervention in foreign exchange markets to offset any downward pressure on the rand, helped to restore calm to financial markets in the third quarter of 1998. As pressures began to subside in the following quarter, the authorities allowed a gradual easing of interest rates. The authorities struck an appropriate balance between the need to support an economy virtually in recession and the need to avoid the reemergence of financial market pressures, reduce the NOFP, and contain the potential inflationary pressures arising from the depreciation of the rand in 1998. In this process, the rand recovered from its low level in August 1998 (reversing a considerable overshooting) but still remains 11.4 percent lower than its precrisis level in real effective terms.23 21 See SM/99/177, “The Cross Border Initiative in Eastern and Southern Africa”. 22 South Africa’s average tariff rate is well below the CBI target; however, South Africa falls short of some of the external trade liberalization objectives of the CBI, because of the complexity of its tariff regime. 23 This figure is derived from the CPI-based real effective exchange rate index of the IMF’s Information Notice System.

Looking forward, the mission suggested that it would be desirable for monetary and exchange rate policy to priori&e a faster reduction of the NOFP than a lowering of interest rates. The substantial decline in short-term rates to below precrisis levels, together with the real depreciation of the rand, had begun to promote a recovery that market observers expected to gain momentum, particularly in 2000. The mission therefore argued that the reduction in short-term rates be slowed to avoid the risk of rekindling inflation pressures and jeopardizing the achievement of the Reserve Bank’s medium-term objective of reducing inflation to the level prevailing in partner countries. In addition, such a slowdown would help to achieve a faster reduction of the NOFP, contributing to a decline in the risk premium on South African assets, which market participants had attributed in part to the high level of the open position, and a more lasting decline in interest rates. The authorities were in general agreement with the staff but felt that there was still room in the near term for a further decline in short-term rates. The authorities took advantage of continued favorable market conditions to accelerate the decline in short-term rates during September, before markedly slowing their decline thereafter. In the event, between end-August and end-December, the repurchase rate was lowered by a further 144 basis points to 12 percent and the NOFP reduced by a further US$4 billion to US$ 13 billion. 24. Since taking offrce in August, the Governor of the Reserve Bank has publicly reaffirmed the authorities’ intention of dismantling the forward book, Moreover, he told the mission that he intended to continue to gradually reduce the NOFP and to lock in all reductions in the forward book. The mission concurred with tbis strategy, as it would preclude the reversals that had been witnessed in the past. The authorities’ strategy to reduce the NOFP consists of purchasing foreign exchange that is judged to arise from non-“hot-money” capital inflows.24 This strategy is consistent with the staffs view that the pace of reduction in the NOFP should be determined by the strength of market sentiment. The mission agreed with the authorities that setting quantitative targets for the reduction of the NOFP could exacerbate market instability during times of weak market sentiment by adding further pressures on interest rates and the exchange rate, thereby compounding the adverse effects of these pressures on economic activity. its CPI (to exclude the effects on the CPI of the recent large swings in mortgage costs), the comparable real effective depreciation is 9 percent. 24 Non hot-money flows refer mainly to foreign direct investment, foreign currency denominated government bond issues, and portfolio investments in equity securities. The authorities have been reluctant to purchase from the market the foreign exchange proceeds from portfolio investments in domestic currency debt securities, because these flows exhibited considerable volatility, especially d-uring 1998, in marked contrast to portfolio investments in equity securities, which were far more stable.

The Reserve Bank was also considering using the proceeds from additional external medium- to long-term borrowing to pay off existing forward market obligations so as to improve the maturity structure of official foreign exchange liabilities, even though it would keep total official foreign exchange exposure unchanged (Box 5)25. Both the authorities and the mission were of the view that such borrowing had to be limited and proceed at a cautious pace, and therefore would constitute one, rather than the primary element of the strategy to close the forward book. To help strengthen the credibility of this strategy in financial markets, the mission stressed the need for the Reserve Bank to declare publicly that all reductions in the NOFP would be permanently locked in. 26. The mission agreed with the authorities that exchange controls should continue to be liberalixed cautiously, and where appropriate, replaced by prudential regulations.26 While the early elimination of exchange controls could have some advantages for investor confidence, a slow pace of liberalization might need to be considered at this time in order to proceed with a faster reduction in the NOFP without adding undue pressures on the rand. A considerably lower NOFP, to the extent that it reduced the risk associated with rand-denominated investments, would, in turn, facilitate the subsequent gradual removal of remaining exchange controls. 27. The authorities have decided to adopt a formal inflation-targeting framework in order to impart greater transparency and credibility to monetary policy and the process of inflation control. In recent years, the Reserve Bank has followed an informal inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy, with the publicly stated intention of gradually bringing core inflation down to a range of 1-5 percent over the medium term. This objective is supported by informal guidelines for growth in broad money and bank credit, and supplemented by the monitoring of a range of other financial indicators. The Reserve Bank has argued, however, that, although this approach has been useful in containing inflation, it has at times created uncertainties about the objectives of the Reserve Bank, in part because the guidelines for money and credit growth have been breached. The view is that a transparent and explicit inflation-targeting framework could help to reduce these uncertainties. The Reserve Bank and the government would coordinate closely to operate the inflation targeting framework, with the former retaining its full autonomy in the use of instruments needed to meet these targets. The authorities also intend to hold discussions with parliament and the broader society, including business and labor representatives, before introducing the new monetary framework, so as to allow all parties to understand how 25 Foreign currency denominated government debt is limited. It amounted to US$3.7 billion (about 3 percent of GDP) as of September 1999. 26 South Africa maintains exchange controls en capital transactions by residents. See Appendix I for details.

External Borrowing to Reduce the Forward Book of the SARB Gradual medium- to long-term external borrowing by the government (or the SARB) could be one element of a strategy to reduce the NOFP and to ultimately withdraw from the forward foreign exchange market. The advantages of such operations would be: (i) A more baianced maturity profiie of the external debt stock. As of June 1999, South Africa’s total foreign currency debt amounted to US$25.1 billion (about 20 percent of GDP), of which about half is short-term; US% 11.4 billion had an original maturity of less than one year, and another US%2 billion was long-term but falling due within six months. Foreign currency debt of the national government amounted to US$3.6 billion. Moreover, the net forward book of the SARB (currently US$18.1 billion) is all short-term. (ii) Increased transparency. The size of the forward book of the SARB is published monthly together with the foreign reserve position, but the details of the maturity structure of the forward book is not publicly available. Therefore, real&d (quasi-)fiscal profit and losses resulting from the forward book are unknown to the market at any point in time. In comparison, external borrowing by the government is quite transparent. These advantages would have to be weighed against the uncertainties regarding the effects on the borrowing costs (both domestic and external) from shifting toward higher external debt but lower NOFP. Thus, increased external bon-owing would have to be gradual and take into account changes in investor sentiment and market conditions. Nevertheless, as external borrowing is used to reduce the forward book, three aspects deserve to be noted (see the accompanying background paper for further discussions): 0 It would not increase the foreign exchange exposure of the government. The increased vulnerability to exchange rate fluctuations due to higher external debt would be offset by less vulnerability to these shocks due to the reduction in the forward book. Thus, the fiscal costs of a nominal exchange rate depreciation would be largely unaffected by any external borrowing that is offset by reductions in the forward book. 0 It would not increase the overaii pubiic debt stock. A reduction of the forward book using the proceeds from external borrowing implies a reduction of liquidity, which would have to be sterilized by a corresponding reduction in domestic government debt. Hence, the overall public debt stock as a share of GDP would remain unchanged, although the domestic part would be substituted for external debt; as of June 1999, total public debt was 49 percent of I GDP, of which about 3 percent of GDP was denominated in foreign currencies. ~0 It would not necessarily be very costly, The interest cost of additional external debt would ~ have to be netted out against the lower interest costs resulting from the reduction in outstanding domestic government debt. In expected terms, the net effect would be positive but relatively small, assuming that uncovered interest parity holds.

As public credibility in the strategy is established, it is expected that inflationary expectations and wage demands would be revised in line with the target range. 28. In the view of the staff, an inflation-targeting regime would be a feasible and desirable framework for South Africa. The country satisfies the main prerequisites needed to adopt inflation targeting, including an absence of commitments to objectives that might conflict with low inflation, an independent central bank, and well-developed capital and money markets. Moreover, there is no apparent monetary policy conflict between inflation targeting and the authorities’ strategy to reduce the NOFP.” The Minister of Finance intends to announce the details of the inflation-targeting framework in March 2000 (at the time of the presentation of the budget), and the Reserve Bank is currently undertaking preparatory technical work, including developing its inflation-forecasting framework and deciding on both the appropriate measure of inflation (e.g., headline or core inflation) and the length of the target horizons.28 Depending on the progress in this area, the actual implementation of inflation targeting may begin later in the year. In the meantime, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank has begun holding meetings to assess policy and operational issues; the deliberations of the committee are being made public2’ 29. An FSAP mission visited South Africa in October-November 1999 to undertake a comprehensive assessment of South Africa’s financial system, including the nonbank financial institutions. That mission concluded that the financial system is sound and well regulated, reaffirming the generally positive assessment made at the time of last year’s Article IV consultation (Box 6).30 27 In the event that projected inflation is below target, the NOFP could be reduced while interest rates are lowered; if projected inflation is running above target, interest rates would be raised. 28 The Fund staff has provided inputs for the preparatory work, including a research paper requested by the authorities, and attended a roundtable discussion sponsored by the Ministry of Finance. 2g The committee, which meets every six weeks, is chaired by the governor of the Reserve Bank and includes the three Deputy Governors as voting members, and other senior reserve bank officials as nonvoting members. 3o For a detailed description of the mission’s findings and recommendations, see the accompanying Financial Sector Stability Assessment report.

Main Findings of the Financial System Stability Assessment Report The overall assessment of the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) mission is that the South African financial system is robust and generally well regulated. It is noted that the South African authorities have recognixed most of the identified weaknesses discussed below and have taken appropriate actions to address them. In particular: The quality and scope of the financial sector’s legal framework are impressive. The laws are well drafted and comprehensive in their coverage. Both the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) of the SARB and the Financial Services Board (FSB), which regulates and supervises the financial markets and nonbank financial institutions, are effective regulators and supervisors. The mission made recommendations for improving the procedures for dealing with troubled banks. As a result of the BSD’s own evaluation of the extent to which South Africa has complied with the Base1 Core Principles, it has been able to identify the major weaknesses and, in most cases, has already put in place the necessary improvements, including introducing effective single borrower limits and improving the consolidated supervision of banking groups. Regarding the FSB, it would be important to undertake a review of the FSB’s ctnrent and future resource needs to ensure that tbe effectiveness of regulation and supervision continues to improve, including through the expansion of on-site inspections, given the expanded future responsibilities under a proposed new legislation. At this stage, unifying the BSD and FSB into a single entity would not strengthen the supervisory capabilities of the financial system. The South African banks are reasonably well capitalized with a mean Base1 ratio of 11 percent for the entire system and 9.5 percent for the largest four banks, A number of stress tests were performed to evaluate bank risk. The results indicated that under the worst probabilistic scenarios, South African banks are well prepared to face large shocks and potential losses. With regard to tbe economic value of the banks accounting capital in relation to the Base1 ratio, two aspects should be noted. First, there is prevalent interlocking of shareholdings between financial institutions, which if netted out would reduce available bank capital; although the impact is difficult to quantify, there is a consensus that South African banks will remain welI capitalized even after netting out this effect. Second, in tbe aftermath of the turbulence in the financial markets in 1998, South African banks experienced an increase in their nonperforming loans from 3.2 percent in 1996 to 4.7 percent in June 1999, which is still relatively low by international standards. There has also been a marked reduction in the ratio of provisions to nonperforming loans, from 70.5 percent in December 1995 to 54.8 percent in June 1999. Institutional investors (insurance companies and retirement funds) generally have very robust balance sheets. The life insurance companies have large capital bases that exceed their policy liabilities by a wide margin, while most retirement funds operate with substantial surpluses. Both the liquidity management framework and the payment systems are sound and not vulnerable to systemic risks. South Africa has made substantial efforts to ensure transparency in its objectives and implementation of monetary policy and in the area of supervision and, with a few exceptions, its practices are in line with best international practices as set out in various principles, such as the Fund’s Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, International Association of Insurance Supervisors’ (IAIS) Principles and Standards, IOSCO’s Principles for Securities Regulation, and the CPSS Draft Core Principles for Payments Systems.

The mission commended the authorities for their continued efforts and determination to maintain fiscal discipline as outlined in their revised medium-term budget policy. To reinforce the credibility of their commitment to prudent fiscal policies, the authorities stated that they would adhere to the nominal deficit targets for 1999/2000- 2001/02 presented in the 1999 budget, rather than the ratios to GDP, which had been affected by the subsequent upward revision to GDP. In October 1999, in line with discussions during the mission and the need to increase national saving, the authorities announced a revised medium-term f&rework, which targeted a gradual decline in the budget deficit from 2.8 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to 2.4 percent in 2002/03 while allowing for a reduction in the tax burden from 24 percent of GDP to 23.5 percent. These fiscal targets may need to be revised in the event private investment increases faster than envisaged in the medium term (see Appendix V), in order to avoid an excessive widening of the external current account deficit. 31. The mission supported the authorities’ firm stance in the wage dispute with public sector unions:’ as well as their intention to have an employer-driven program to rationaiize the size of the civil service and a plan to improve the public sector wage structure. The authorities emphasized the importance of wage restraint in the public sector for achieving the government’s fiscal targets and its ability to redirect spending toward nonwage areas in order to achieve its social policy objectives (Box 7). They also recognized that their firm stance on public sector wage restraint should send a strong signal about their desire for wage moderation in the private sector, as it related to the containment of inflation pressures and external competitiveness. 32. The 1999 budget made two noteworthy modifications to the tax system: the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 30 percent, and the nonrenewal of the preferential accelerated depreciation allowance for investments in the manufacturing sector. The mission agreed that the reduction of the tax rate could stimulate domestic private saving and investment, including foreign direct investment. By not renewing the preferential depreciation allowance for the manufacturing sector, the mission agreed that the authorities were eliminating an important distortion in the tax system that might have discouraged investment in the service sector, which, in general, is relatively labor intensive. The authorities indicated that they were considering more reductions in the tax-to- GDP ratio, continuing the process of removing distortionary incentives, and broadening the 31 The government is unilaterally implementing its offer of a 6.5 percent average wage increase, compared with the 7.5 percent asked for by the unions.

Reprioritizing Government Expenditures, 1995/19961998/1999 In addition to reducing the large fiscal deficit (and thereby putting the public finances on a sustainable path), a priority of fiscal policy over the past 5 years has been to reorient the structure of government spending in order to achieve the government’s social policy goal of reducing poverty under which the majority of the population live. Both the Redistribution and Development Plan (RDP) and the Growth, Employment, and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, aimed at shifting spending toward health, education, welfare, and housing. As the table below shows, over the period 1995/1996 to 1998/1999, there was a significant redistribution of spending at the consolidated national-provincial level. Expenditure on education, health, welfare, and housing all grew in real terms, and their shares in total expenditure also increased. At the same time, reflecting concerns about the level of crime in the country, expenditure on crime prevention (police, prisons, courts) also increased in real terms. This was mainly achieved by reducing the shares of defense and general administration. l/ Functional Classification of Consolidated National and Provincial Noninterest Expenditures 19950996 1998/1999 Percent of total Percent of total Percent change noninterest spending noninterest spending in real spending General administration 8.9 6.6 -21.4 Defense 9.9 7.1 -24.0 Crime-protection 11.6 13.9 26.4 Education 27.6 28.4 8.7 Health 12.9 14.2 15.9 Social security and welfare 11.9 11.8 4.9 Housing and other social services 4.2 6.1 52.3 Economic services 13.1 11.8 -4.3 Source: Department of Finance However, the reorientation of expenditures towards social programs needs to be interpreted with caution, as it is not clear that the substantial reorientation of spending towards the social areas has been matched by a similar improvement in public service delivery in these areas. The table below indicates that almost all of the increase in provincial education and health spending (which constitutes virtually 90 percent of the total national-provincial spending in these areas) was reflected in salary increases, which, according to the authorities, has created backlogs in teaching materials, medical supplies, and capital spending. This highlights the urgent need for the government to come up with a cost efficient retrenchment instrument and reforms to the remuneration system. To better align expenditures with social policy objectives, the government has launched a program to develop performance and outcome-based indicators to determine and assess departmental budget allocations.

However, the specific tax reforms will need to await the review of the final recommendations of the Katz Commission.32 33. The authorities stated that, from a functional standpoint, they had largely achieved their desired expenditure structure in the 1999 budget and thus had not programmed major changes in relative budgetary allocations across sectors into the subsequent years of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). Spending on social programs and outlays to enhance the crime prevention effort-which was often cited by foreign companies as a major disincentive for direct investment in South Africa-would continue to be a priority. Over the medium term, expenditure on education, health, and welfare (currently accounting for about 52 percent of noninterest expenditure) and crime prevention (accounting for 13 percent) would continue to grow in real terms (see Box 7). To accommodate the recently announced defense equipment procurement program, which is expected to cost R 21-R 30 billion (constant 1999 prices) over a period of 8-14 years (or about 0.3 percent of GDP per year), the defense allocation is projected to rise from 7.1 percent of noninterest expenditure in 1998/99 (equal to 1.4 percent of GDP) to 8.5 percent in 2002103 (1.7 percent of GDP).3’ 34. With the fiscal consolidation effort now on track, the authorities planned to turn their emphasis to strengthen expenditure management and increase transparency in public service delivery. Two important initiatives were launched in that regard, which effectively supplement the MTEF. First, the Public Finance Management Act, which is designed to set standards for the management of public funds and raise the accountability of those persons charged with that responsibility, was passed in 1999. Second, along with the 1999 budget, the government published a National Expenditure Survey, which launches an effort to develop performance and outcome-based indicators to determine and assess departmental budget allocations. 35. The mission welcomed the substantial turnaround iu the provincial fmauces, which reflected a strong commitment to fiscal discipline by the provincial authorities, along with improved monitoring and consultation between the two levels of government. A j2 The Katz Commission, which has undertaken a comprehensive review of South Africa’s tax system and issued a number of interim reports in recent years, is now preparing its final report. 33 The arms procurement package follows a period of several years of decline in the share of defense outlays in total expenditures. Suppliers have pledged investments in South Africa, which the authorities expected would generate R 70 billion in economic benefits over an 1 l- year period.

The mission supported the authorities’ intention to embark on a similar program of cooperation and consultation to improve the finances of the local authorities, many of which were in severe financial difficulties. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 36. South Africa weathered the emerging markets crisis well. The pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and the presence of a relatively healthy and well supervised financial system have contributed to the resilience of the economy. Real interest rates have since fallen markedly, the NOFP of the Reserve Bank has been reduced considerably, the improvement in external competitiveness has been sustained, and the economy now appears to be in the early stages of a cyclical upturn, with real GDP growth expected to rise to about 3% percent in 2000, close to South Africa’s present long-run growth potential. 37. This growth rate, however, falls well short of what is needed to make major progress in reducing unemployment and raising living standards. A sound, stable and predictable macroeconomic environment is, of course, a necessary precondition for accelerated growth, but the authorities also need to press on forcefully with removing the structural impediments to job creation and improved competitiveness. 38. In view of the substantial easing in monetary conditions over the past year, the signs of economic recovery already under way, and the need to reduce the NOFP of the Reserve Bank and achieve further reductions in inflation, the authorities have appropriately adopted a more cautious monetary stance. The authorities’ goal of bringing inflation down to the level of South Africa’s trading partners is commendable, but success in achieving this goal smoothly will depend on the credibility of the commitment to the disinflation process. A formal inflation-targeting framework, which is planned for adoption in 2000, could be an effective vehicle for building such credibility and dampening inflationary expectations. 39. The authorities should be congratulated for the considerable reduction of the NOFP to its precrisis level. The authorities acknowledge that their intervention in the foreign exchange markets in May-June 1998 intensified the attack on the currency and led to a sharp increase in the open position, which, in turn, unsettled investor confidence. The authorities’ intention to continue reducing this position and their commitment to dismantle the forward book deserve strong support. In view of previous reversals, a public announcement by the Reserve Bank pledging to lock in any reductions of the NOFP would enhance the credibility of these policy intentions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- 40. The current strategy to reduce the NOFP, i.e., intervening in the foreign exchange market to offset upward pressure on the currency resulting from non-“hot- money” flows, is largely consistent with the staff’s recommendation. It would enable the Reserve Bank to exploit periods of positive market sentiment to reduce the forward book without placing undue pressure on interest rates and the exchange rate. In the event that this strategy were to be supplemented by medium- to long-term borrowing by the Reserve Bank or the government, the proposed pledge by the Reserve Bank would be critical to allay possible concerns of market participants of higher levels of external debt without a corresponding decline in the NOFP. Such borrowing might be one element of the Reserve Bank’s strategy to eventually withdraw from the forward foreign exchange market, but it should not be the dominant part of such a strategy; moreover, the borrowing would have to be cautious, limited in scale, and take into account market conditions. 41. The rand does not appear to be either overvalued or undervalued, although given the structural changes that have taken place in the South African economy in recent years, it is difficult to determine whether the current exchange rate of the rand is at an equilibrium level. However, with the rand now 5 percent lower than its five-year average in real effective terms, and the current account deficit relatively low, the authorities’ current flexible market- determined exchange rate regime (subject to their asymmetric intervention policy) does not appear to be the source of any macroeconomic imbalances. 42. In November 1999, the joint MAE-World Bank team that undertook a comprehensive assessment of the financial system concluded that it was robust and generally well regulated, confirming the findings of the last Article IV consultation mission. The report notes that banks are reasonably well capital&d, institutional investors (e.g., insurance companies and retirement funds) generally have very robust balance sheets, and the liquidity management framework and the payment systems are sound and not vulnerable to systemic risks. South Africa has made substantial efforts to ensure transparency in its objectives and implementation of monetary policy and in the area of supervision and its practices are broadly in line with best international practices. The banking system showed remarkable resilience during the 1998 and early 1999 global financial turmoil, withstanding a very large increase in interest rates, a significant depreciation of the rand, and a marked slowdown in economic activity. The authorities were aware of the areas in need of strengthening that were identified by the MAE-World Bank team, including the need to expand the on-site inspections of financial institutions; improve the supervision of consolidated banking groups; disentangle the interlocking of shareholdings between financial institutions; and improve the procedures for the resolution of problem banks. They are to be commended for their determination in addressing these issues without delay. 43. The government’s solid track record in budgetary management has helped South Africa weather the contagion effects of the turmoil in emerging markets mentioned above and has raised confidence in government policies. The considerable fiscal consolidation achieved in recent years, as well as the further efforts envisaged over the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - medium term and the planned easing of the tax burden, are expected to help stimulate investment and strengthen international competitiveness. In this context, the authorities should be commended for seeking to limit the increase in the wage bill in the current fiscal year and their intention to rationalize the civil service and review the structure of wages. Containing the wage bill is critical to achieving the government’s social and other policy objectives, as well as to signal the importance of wage moderation in the private sector. 44. Macroeconomic stability, while necessary, is not sufficient to raise South Africa’s growth potential to a level that would reduce unemployment and poverty. The authorities have recognlzed the need to create the conditions for higher investment, including foreign direct investment, while raising productivity. Much of the groundwork for meeting these goals has been laid, but the structural reform components of the GEAR, notably those in the labor market, trade, and privatization areas need to be implemented more quickly and more deeply than hitherto. Improvements in education, skills enhancement, and health, and market-based land reform should complement these efforts. The need to make substantive headway in satisfying the expectations of the population imparts added urgency to the process of structural reform. 45. In this vein, every effort should be made to remove from the labor market the structural rigidities and distortions that have discouraged the hiring of young and unskilled workers. To this end, legislation has already been passed, and fiscal resources earmarked, to develop training programs designed to enhance worker skills. Progress in other critical areas, however, has been slow and needs to be expedited to address the severe unemployment problem. Two key aspects can be mentioned in particular. Minimum wage rates are often too high to encourage job creation for unskilled workers, while the extension of sectoral collective bargaining agreements to nonparticipants in such agreements appears to have been detrimental to the emergence and development of small- and medium-sized enterprises, further constraining labor demand. 46. The trade liberalixatlon achieved iu recent years has removed disincentives to exporters and raised factor efficiency as it exposed the economy to greater competition. The recently signed free trade agreement with the EU represents a significant step forward in the trade reform process, and the relatively long transition period envisaged under the agreement should enable the economy to adjust relatively smoothly to the more competitive environment. It is therefore regrettable that a large part of the manufacturing sector may remain highly protected even after such a period; the authorities need to consider a unilateral reduction of this protection to increase efficiency and the growth potential of the economy. More generally, an overall reduction in most-favored-nation tariffs would minimize any possible trade diversion costs that might be induced by the FTA. In the meantime, further steps are needed to simplify South Africa’s tariff structure, particularly by reducing the number and dispersion of tariff rates, and replacing the many specific tariffs by ad valorem ones.

Exchange rate arrangement: The South A&an rand floats against other currencies, although the South African Reserve Bank intervenes in the market periodically. South Africa formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, as from September 15, 1973, On December 13,1999 the exchange rate of the rand was US$O. 1634=R 1. South Afkica has followed a strategy of progressively easing exchange controls on capital transactions since 1994, reflecting the government’s commitment to the eventual abolition of these controls and has made considerable progress in this regard in recent years. With the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were eliminated. They are free to purchase shares, bonds and other assets without restriction and to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-41- APPENDIX I . repatriate dividends, interest receipts and current and capital profits, as Well as the original investment capital. Nonresidents are also fkee,to hold rand accounts in the banking system, but they arc constrained on the amount they may borrow domestically. This constraint has also been relaxed, and only organizations with more than75 percent nonresident ownership are subject to limits on their domestic borrowing. : Since 1995, exchange controls on capital transaction by residents have also been relaxed considerably. Rather than allowing complete liberalization of a particular type of current or capital transaction, the authorities have pursued a strategy of allowing att increasing array of : transactions, with each subject to a quantitative cap that has been progressively raised over :’ time. The limit on foreign exchange holdings by authorized dealers has been ,eliminated, although they continue to be subject to prudential regulatioti. There are no controls ‘on the ‘. : transfer of funds arising fkom the import or export of goods and services, although the ’ foreign currency proceeds from exports must be repatriated to South Africa within 180 days. South African corporates are allowed to invest up to R 50 million abroad, except for h ” investments in SADC countries where the cap is R 250 million. Institutional investors in ’ South Africa (insurance companies, pension funds, and unit trusts) are.permitted to invest up to 15 percent of their assets in foreign securities via asset swap arrangements with .. nonresidents. Private individuals are allowed to invest up to R 500,000 offshore. In the 1999 budget, the following changes to capital control regulations were announced: ; l Residents were permitted to mealce credit card purchases of imports (e.g., purchases via’ . ..‘. ~ ” the Internet) of up to R 20,000 pertransaction. : ’ ., :. ” ‘. l The annual limits for a single student were raised to R 120,000 for living expenses an!

The Bank ceased lending operations to South Africa in 1966, and the loans from that earlier period have been fully repaid. Since re-engaging in South Africa in the early 199Os, the Bank has played an active role, and South Africa has provided ample opportunities to pilot the Bank’s evolving role as a knowledge Bank. Between 1990 and 1994, the Bank resumed activities in South Afi-ica through a comprehensive program of economic policy advice and capacity building marked by open participation between the Bank and relevant sectors of the South African society, such as government, the Reserve Bank, (then) opposition parties, universities, labor unions, industrialists, and nongovernmental organizations. Several discussion papers and reports resulted on all the key sectors: the macroeconomy, education, health, agriculture, fiscal decentralization, labor markets, trade policy, and microfinance. Since 1994, the emphasis has shifted slightly toward the provision of policy advice to government, particularly in the areas of municipal services and welfare financing, macroeconomic strategy, poverty, and a medium-term expenditure framework. In addition, a US$46 million loan (since reduced to US$24 million) was approved for an Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation Project in May 1997. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been operating in South Africa for only the last four years. A total of US$84 million has been committed (US$32 million disbursed), and a further US$l 1 million approved but not yet signed. The IFC’s strategy focuses on efforts to benefit previously disadvantaged groups directly with SME project funding and indirectly through job creation, financing of infrastructure, and diversification of business ownership. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has issued three guarantees for US$13 million in the banking and manufacturing sectors.

Real sector In June 1999, Statistics South Africa released a major revision of the national income accounts based on the United Nations System of National Accounts (1993). The revision raised nominal GDP by some 13 percent for the 1993-98 period and raised the average annual rate of growth of real GDP from 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent for the period 1994-98. Reporting of real sector data for International Financial Statistics (IFS) is timely. Data from Direction Trade Statistics (DOTS) show substantial inconsistencies among South Africa and its trading partners. The difference in exports reported by South Africa versus imports reported by trading partners has been much too large (over 30 percent) to be explained by differences in f.o.b. and c.i.f. reporting and the small amount of trade due to other members of the Southern African Customs Union. Labor market statistics are published with long lags (usually six months), and unemployment data are only available at an annual frequency. Given the seriousness of the unemployment problem, labor market analysis and policy design needs to be based on better, more frequent, and timely labor market data. 2. Government finance South tica currently reports data for the consolidated central government and for regional and local governments for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also reports monthly data covering the operations of the budgetary central government for publication in IFS. 3. Balance of payments South Africa is a regular reporter of balance of payments data. It has recently revised its balance of payments data to be fully consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Revisions were made to historical data on gold exports for 1992-96 during 1996 in light of new information on forward gold sales. 4.

Specifically, the scenario assumes (i) the execution of the authorities’ medium-term budget policy, in which the national budget deficit falls to 2.4 percent of GDP; (ii) the adoption of an inflation targeting framework and the implementation of monetary and exchange rate policies which achieve a reduction of CPI inflation to 4.0 percent and the elimination of the net open forward position of the Reserve Bank; (iii) continued trade liberalization under the commitments made to the WTO and in the free trade agreements with the European Union and the Southern Africa Development Community; (iv) the restructuring of public enterprises based largely on finding minority private sector partners instead of majority divestiture; and (v) slow progress in removing rigidities in the labor market. Under this scenario, real GDP growth would be expected to increase to a potential rate of 4 percent, supported by stronger rates of growth in private fixed investment and exports compared to those of recent years. The higher rate of economic growth, together with some moderation of wage settlements (the result of the high structural unemployment rate and the growing credibility of the inflation target) would begin to reverse the trend decline of employment witnessed during the 1990s. However, the projected growth of employment would be insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate, which would stabilize at around 42 percent. The government’s medium-term fiscal program is consistent with a declining ratio of debt to GDP, even under the scenario’s assumption that the receipts from the sale of state assets will not offset the increase in government debt arising from the authorities’ possible takeover of some liabilities of the restructured state enterprises (e.g., the debt of Transnet’s pension fund). The general government deficit and the public sector borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector also decline in terms of GDP (dissaving at the general government level is eliminated in 2000), facilitating lower real interest rates. The gains in competitiveness achieved following the real depreciation of the rand in 1998 are expected to be largely maintained in the medium term, bolstered mainly by the sound macroeconomic environment. As such, the share of South Africa’s exports in trading partner markets stabilizes, ending the declining path of recent years. The current account deficit grows to a little over 2 percent of GDP, while capital inflows are sufficient to cover this deficit and to increase the import cover of net reserves from 1.9 months in 1999 to 3 months in 2004.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with South Africa,’ ‘. : . . On January ,, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with South Africa.’ - Background Financial market conditions have improved considerably since the last Article IV .’ consultation. At that time, South Africa was experiencing serious foreign exchange market . . pressures, largely as a result of contagion from other emerging market economies, but also .’ because of an adverse reaction by investors to the Reserve Bank’s heavy intervention in the foreign exchange markets during May-June 1998. Starting in July, the authorities kept monetary policy consistently tight, refrained from .such intervention in these.markets, and maintained fiscal policy on course. As a result of these policies and an ,improv&d global environment, the authorities regained ,investors’ confidence,,which led to a resumption of capital flows. ‘. . . ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with ‘_, members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s econom,ic,developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the ._. : Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as’chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the ” ‘:’ country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described. ,, ‘. . : ‘. ‘. k ,. .’ ‘I, , a _‘. . ‘.

Following a depreciation of 18 percent against the U.S. dollar, the rand has remained within a range of R 6.00-R 6.20 during 1999. While headline inflation has fallen to from 9.4 percent in November 1998 to 1 .Q percent in November 1999, core inflation has remained at around 8 percent for most of this year. There are clear signs of a cyclical recovery in economic activity, as quarterly rates of real GDP growth have risen continuously during 1999, reaching 3.1 percent (annualized, seasonally adjusted) in the third quarter. However, the trend decline in formal private sector employment continued in 1998 and 1999, and the overall unemployment rate, which was 37.4 percent in 1997, most likely increased further. The stabilization of market conditions was also underpinned by a strengthening of the public finances. The overall budget deficit of the national government was reduced from 3.9 percent of GDP in 1997/98 (April-March) to 2.6 percent in 1998/99, about 0.5 percent of GDP below the original budget targets, mainly as a result of higher-than-projected revenue. In addition, stronger expenditure management led to a turnaround in the overall balance of the provinces from a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 1998/99. Thus, the overall deficit for the general government, declined from 5 percent of GDP to 2.4 percent.
