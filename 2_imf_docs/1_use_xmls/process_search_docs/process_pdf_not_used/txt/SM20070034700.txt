Further, any judgment regarding the appropriateness of the exchange rate is subject to great uncertainty given the distortions arising from the exchange rate system and restrictions on current and capital account transactions. Still, given strong export growth (gas but also in agriculture products), the real exchange rate would be expected to appreciate. Consistent with this, the weighted average exchange rate has appreciated by 15–20 percent in the past year.   10.      The financial sector has recovered but still cannot fully carry out intermediation. The banks have recovered from the crisis of 2003/04, and financial stability indicators are generally very strong. At the same time, fundamental structural problems in the banking system remain. As a result, the banks continue to be constrained in carrying out their intermediation function (Box 5).                                                   7 Formally, the official exchange rate applies only to transactions undertaken by the government and SEEs. In practice, the government and SEEs use the official exchange rate for accounting purposes, but its use in transactions is limited. The authorities also issue Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) for external transactions: this exchange rate is market determined. There is also an “illegal” but large and tolerated informal market that exchanges dollars with kyats at a small premium over the FEC rate.

Myanmar: Banking Sector Developments  The banking sector has largely recovered from the 2003/04 banking crisis, public confidence has been restored and no major problem banks have been identified. Reported financial soundness indicators are generally very strong. For example, reported NPL data for the private banks are a manageable 2 percent. Nevertheless, levels in state banks continue to be high at over 20 percent, despite improvement in some state banks.¹ Administrative measures put in place during the crisis have been relaxed. The CBM has allowed six private banks to open new branches since 2006/07. The cap on deposit to capital ratio was increased from 7 to 10 in 2006/07. Prudential regulations and supervision have been strengthened. All banks are now required to maintain 10 percent of total deposits as minimum reserves, maintain capital adequacy ratios, and raise paid-up capital. The CBM has been monitoring private banks’ financial position on a daily basis and is upgrading on- and off-site examinations. In October 2007, the FATF decided to end formal monitoring of Myanmar. An evaluation of Myanmar’s AML/CFT framework by the Asia Pacific Group is expected in November. Over the past year, progress has been made, although efforts to establish and strengthen the AML/CFL regime need to continue. Despite these improvements, the sector faces structural problems which impede its development and financial intermediation. First, the banking sector as a whole is heavily segmented and subject to very limited market-based competition. Second, private banks suffer from excessive regulation with the CBM determining, for example, minimum interest rates on deposits, maximum interest rates on different types of bank lending, and maximum levels on fees and commissions charged by banks. These regulations exist in part because the CBM is concerned about banks’ financial stability and liquidity, but they constrain the sector’s development. Third, state banks continue to carry large NPLs and are not run as banks.  _______ ¹/ See also Selected Issues Paper on the banking system.

Myanmar: Exchange Rate Unification1  An accounting analysis of the impact of unification on public finances, banking sector soundness and inflation suggest that the short-run impact of unification is manageable.  Overall, the results point to a much healthier fiscal balance, although there may be a temporary hike in inflation. Fiscal BalanceImprovement in the overall balance of the public sector1-3 percent of GDPIncease in custom revenues0.2 percent of GDPBanking SectorFiscal cost to recapitalize a state-owned bank with large - 0.1 percent of GDPequity lossess due to net exposure to foreign liabilities.Inflation Temporary price hike due to a sudden withdrawal of 6 percentage pointimplicit subsidies to importing SEEsEstimated Impact of Exchange Rate Unification  At the same time, the long-term benefits to the economy will be substantial. Exchange rate unification will remove the large welfare losses under the current exchange rate regime, which are estimated to be as high as 5–10 percent of GDP.  This result is consistent with other countries’ experiences in successful unification. Analysis on more than 20 episodes of multiple exchange rate unification with large premiums suggests that two-thirds of these cases were successful in keeping the exchange rate premium below 10 percent for at least 5 years after unification. These cases also showed that in successful unification, short-run adverse effects such as temporary growth slowdown and inflation acceleration are manageable. In the medium to long run, improved performance by way of higher growth, lower inflation, lower fiscal deficits and improvements in current account balance are in most cases supported by relatively tight fiscal and monetary polices.  __________________ 1 See also Selected Issues Paper on exchange rate unification.    19. The authorities agreed with the economic benefits of unification but expressed concerns over possible risks. In particular, they remained worried about the impact on inflation. Moreover, the decision to unify the rate would require approval from the highest levels of the SPDC and would also need to be supported by substantial technical preparation.  Further liberalizing agriculture 20. The authorities have taken several measures to liberalize the agricultural sector, resulting in major benefit to farmers, but more needs to be done (Box 7). The measures  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  18already implemented include the removal of production and marketing controls, such as the recently announced relaxation of export restrictions on rice and other commodities. Staff further recommended: • Ensuing that local implementation is consistent with national policies, especially with regard to freedom of choice in agricultural production. Some local officials continue to apply ad hoc production or marketing controls in order to achieve perceived production targets.  • Increasing capacity to carry out careful analysis to anticipate the economic and social impact of policy reforms in rice, land, and other critical areas. Policies should also be more transparent and predictable. • Paying attention to other areas such as water resource management, marketing, financing, land tenure, and reforms of SEEs involved in agriculture.  Box 7. Myanmar: Agriculture Sector Issues  National policy emphasizes the transition toward a market economy in the agricultural sector, including “freedom of choice in agricultural production” and “encouraging the participation of the private sector.” For example, several agricultural SEEs have been privatized or reoriented toward seed production, research, and extension activities, and the role of the private sector has increased in the production, import, and distribution of key inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, and equipment. The government has also announced that it will no longer restrict rice exports to rice grown on the newly developed fallow lands and has encouraged the private sector to form a public company to raise capital for the financing of larger export shipments.   The sector has responded quickly to opportunities arising from liberalization. The most obvious examples are pulses and beans for which there is little state intervention in production and domestic and international marketing. Pulse production increased threefold over the past 10 years and exports increased from six metric tons to over 1,000 metric tons over the same period. In fact, Myanmar is now the second largest exporter of pulses by volume worldwide. Similarly, production of fish products, particularly prawns, has more than doubled in just the past five years and export volume has tripled.    At the same time, however, significant state intervention remains in the market for strategic crops and agricultural inputs. Issues of food security are still a central consideration in the policy process, resulting in the establishment of production “goals” for a number of strategic crops. Policy priorities are also subject to interpretation by the local administrators; these may focus on measures to achieve production “targets” and “self-sufficiency,” which are at odds with the stated market-oriented objectives. Strategic commodities include those considered critical to self-sufficiency such as rice, onions, and oilseeds, and those which are required by SEEs, such as sugar cane, cotton, and rubber.  While mandatory procurement has largely been eliminated since 2003, export restrictions, production requirements and sale of inputs to SEEs at below market prices remain in place. Land ownership remains with the state, with individuals eligible for 30–year inheritable but otherwise nontransferable use rights. Seed, machinery, and fertilizer production remains primarily with SEEs and local administrations.

Allocation of adequate resources to statistical agencies and adoption of best practices would increase the quality and coverage of data, especially of the growing private sector. Although most data are timely for internal purposes, they are publicly released with very long lags. Timely publication of economic data would increase their usefulness and credibility. The mission also encouraged the authorities to subscribe to the IMF General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), to facilitate the development of the statistical system and improve the dissemination of information on statistical practices and development plans. 28. Trade restrictions are gradually being relaxed. The authorities noted that Myanmar is following the implementation process for gradual elimination of tariffs under the ASEAN Common Effective Preferential Scheme. In addition, the priority items system for imports has been phased out, and the goal is to speed up approvals of export and import licenses to seven working days.  29. There are no plans to deal with external arrears. The authorities have signaled a willingness to repay these arrears, especially to the multilaterals, if they would be given access to future financing. However, without such assurances, they will continue to accumulate arrears. V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 30. Myanmar is taking steps to transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. Nevertheless, despite rich resources and vast potential, the economy suffers from continued high inflation, structural impediments that discourage investment, and low living standards. 31. Staff welcomes progress in improving revenue collection, although further steps are still necessary to reduce the budget deficit in order to control inflation. Most important would be better control over capital expenditure. Cost-benefit based expenditure reduction would eventually provide room for an increase in social spending, especially on health and education which has declined in relative terms. In addition, targeted subsidies will be necessary to mitigate the impact of administrative price hikes.   32. Improvements in monetary policy and operations are also needed to keep inflation under control. Deficits could be financed through treasury bonds rather than money creation, thus mitigating inflation pressures. Over the longer term, it is necessary to deregulate interest rates and provide the CBM with greater independence to control money supply.  33. The current multiple exchange rate system is a major obstacle to economic development and should be unified. While the market rate is widely used, the current  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public  22  Corrected: 11/26/07    system is not transparent, imposes high costs on participants, creates incentives for corruption, distorts economic activity, and reduces fiscal revenue.  34. The official exchange rate is clearly over valued, while the weighted average exchange rate has appreciated and is consistent with current account developments. Nevertheless, it is difficult to judge the appropriateness of the weighted exchange rate given the exchange rate system and restrictions on international transactions.  35. Staff does not recommend approval of the exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice identified on page 1 as there is no timetable for their removal.  36. Market-oriented reforms of the agricultural sector are welcome. Liberalization of agriculture should be deepened, including elimination of any production or marketing restrictions. 37. Banking sector measures must address remaining systemic weaknesses and gaps in prudential regulation and supervision to strengthen financial intermediation. Moving toward a prudential and regulatory framework that is consistent with international best practices can safeguard banking sector health and strengthen the sector’s ability to support economic growth. 38. Staff welcomes the end of the formal monitoring of Myanmar by FATF, and progress in relaxing trade restrictions. Nevertheless, significant weaknesses remain on the AML/CFT framework so efforts to strengthen the framework should continue. On trade, staff urges consistent implementation of the new licensing scheme for imports and exports with the goal of the removing all nontariff barriers to trade.  39. Myanmar’s statistical base is inadequate for effective surveillance. Data shortcomings and lack of timeliness continue to hamper surveillance. Staff welcomes efforts to publish selected economic data on the web and looks to further improvements. However, greater efforts to improve the quality, coverage, and dissemination of data would increase its usefulness and credibility. 40. Staff encourages the authorities to deal with arrears to bilateral and multilateral creditors. 41. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Myanmar be held on the standard 12-month cycle.
