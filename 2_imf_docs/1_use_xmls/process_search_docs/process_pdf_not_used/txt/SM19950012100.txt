Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Majuro during March 14-22.’ The staff team met with Finance Minister Zachras, other ministers, senior officials, public enterprise managers, commercial bankers, businessmen, and donor representatives. The Marshall Islands is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle; the last Article IV consultation was concluded on May 20, 1994. The Marshall Islands has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Republic of the Marshall Islands, situated more than 2,000 miles to the west of Hawaii, has a population of 50,000, of whom 45 percent live on Majuro atoll, the government and business center of the country, and 20 percent live on Kwajalein atoll, where a U.S. missile testing facility is located. The productive base is narrow, consisting primarily of coconut harvesting and processing, deep-sea fishing, and subsistence farming. Shortages of skilled labor, high wage rates, and remoteness from markets are major constraints to economic growth. The government sector dominates the economy, accounting for almost one half of formal employment. The economy relies heavily on external assistance from the United States under the 15-year Compact of Free Association, which became effective in 1986. Although support is declining under this agreement, annual U.S. grant receipts still amount to $50 million (55 percent of GDP), including non-Compact assistance, mainly for health, education, and environment protection, which represents one fifth of the total. In concluding the last consultation, Executive Directors noted that grant assistance from the United States is scheduled to end in the year 2001 and observed that the magnitude of the task in achieving a reasonably smooth transition to the post-Compact era underscored the urgency of a sustained effort to generate fiscal surpluses and promote external viability. They stressed the need to reduce the fiscal deficit through a restructuring of government services, the elimination of subsidies to public enterprises, revenue-raising measures, and improved tax administration. They expressed concern about the authorities’ continuing resort to external commercial borrowing against future Compact funds. Directors also emphasized that major structural reforms are required to promote private sector activity and expand the productive base, including reform ofthe land tenure system, the development of infrastructure, and an efficient financial system. ‘The staff team comprised Mr. Browne (Head), Mr. Parasuk, Ms. Duprat, Mrs. Dayal-Gulati, and Mrs. Eulate, Administrative Assistant (all SEA). Mr. Petrie, Advisor to the Executive Director for the Marshall Islands, participated in the meetings. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 11. Recent Economic Developments and Present Situation The analysis of economic developments in the Marshall Islands is hampered by the absence of comprehensive fiscal accounts, monetary survey data, or balance of payments statistics. An estimate of the overall budgetary position can be derived from the amount of borrowing in combination with the change in financial holdings of the Government (liquid assets primarily held in commercial banks abroad), but data on public enterprise finances are incomplete. With the U.S. dollar as the sole legal tender and in the absence of restrictions on capital flows, the amount of currency in circulation is not known and developments in the monetary system are diff’cult to assess. Estimates of external capital transactions are subject to uncertainty and the concept of official international reserves cannot be easily applied. Despite these limitations, the available data clearly show a disappointing economic performance in recent years. A. Economic Developments in 1993-94 During 1993-94, growth in real GDP was less than 1 percent annually, well below the estimated rate of population growth of 3 percent annually (Table 1 and Chart 1). While the basing of 70 Chinese fishing boats in Majuro provided a stimulus to economic activity, most other sectors exhibited stagnant or declining output. Copra production showed a minimal response to the higher procurement prices offered from 1992; the manufacturing base remained small; the expansion of government services slowed; and the private services sector was consequently depressed. This picture of stagnation was confirmed by data on imports which showed no increase in dollar terms, except for higher petroleum product imports to service the Chinese fishing fleet and for re-export to the Federated States of Micronesia. Notwithstanding weak overall demand, consumer prices increased by 5 percent annually in 1993-94, higher than in major trading partner countries. The central government budget deficit remained substantial2 The overall deficit of 13 percent of GDP in 1992193 was above the budget projection, primarily because of overruns in current expenditure, including subsidies to public enterprises (Table 2). The overall deficit of 9 percent of GDP in 1993194 was constrained within the budget limit primarily by curbing capital expenditure, which was held well below levels recorded in previous years. The growth in receipts from fishing rights and passport sales was offset by shortfalls in revenue from income taxes and import duties. Cutbacks in the wages and salaries bill were not achieved, purchases of goods and services were above projections, partly because of cyclone rehabilitation, and continued subsidies were provided to the copra crushing mill and the national airline. Public sector bond issues were made in both years on commercial terms in the U.S market, to help finance budgetary expenditure, partly as a result of which financial holdings of the Government increased temporarily to the equivalent of 38 percent of GDP at 2The fiscal year is October l-September 30 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- the end of 1993/94. The bonds are fully collateralized against future Compact funds and are to be fully repaid by 2000/2001. Commercial banks generally cut back on their lending activities, reduced the average length of maturity on new loans, and raised the rate of interest to an average of 16.5 percent for consumer loans. In particular, the banks became more cautious about providing credit to public servants--which was traditionally the largest and most profitable form of business--because of their expectations of future cutbacks in government spending and employment. There continued to be negligible longer-term lending for development purposes, especially because of the difficulties of identifying suitable projects. Although total deposits scarcely rose over the past two years, the banks’ tight lending policies resulted in the transfer abroad of considerable funds, with the authorities declining to enforce the requirement that 75 percent of deposits be invested locally. The external payments position remained a matter of concern, although the overall balance of payments moved from an approximate balance in 1992/93 to a surplus of 8 percent of GDP in 1993/94 (Table 3). The merchandise trade deficit remained very large in relation to GDP, but this was broadly offset by a small net surplus on the services account and the sizable receipts of official grants, A surplus on capital account was secured in both years as a result of the continued large public sector external commercial borrowing. These loans raised outstanding external debt to 190 percent of GDP and external debt service to 44 percent of exports of goods and services, both high and unsustainable levels. The real effective exchange rate index appreciated slightly. B. Economic Situation in 1995 Real GDP growth is projected at only 1.5 percent in 1995. The envisaged increase in copra output is moderate; the authorities expressed disappointment at the limited response of producers to procurement prices that are well in excess of world prices, despite the availability of subsidized interisland shipping services. The prospective fish catch is expected to be slightly above last year’s, but the authorities are not permitting a further expansion in the size of the Chinese fishing fleet until more effective controls are put in place to limit pollution of the Majuro harbor. Some growth in manufacturing output should occur following the completion late this year of an export-oriented garment factory that is being constructed as a joint venture with foreign investors, although little expansion is in prospect in the government and private services sectors. In these circumstances, the rate of price increase is expected to slow to 4 percent. With the present stance of fiscal policy, the staff estimates that the overall central government budget deficit will rise sharply to 20 percent of GDP in 1994/95, 12 percent of GDP higher than in 1993/94 and much more than budgeted. Revenue and grants are estimated at 74 percent of GDP, 6 percentage points less than in the last fiscal year, while expenditure is estimated at 92 percent of GDP, 3 percentage points higher than in the last fiscal year. The authorities had indicated during the last consultation that the budget would Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- in:orporate substantial adjustment in the form of new revenue measures, cuts in current spending including the elimination of subsidies to public enterprises, and a fk-ther reduction in cz;Jital expenditure. However, these actions were not taken because the authorities decided that funds existed to maintain an expansionary budgetary policy, following the success of the bond issue in 1993194. Revenue is projected to be slightly higher than budgeted because of additional U.S. non-Compact support; these receipts are earmarked for investment projects to be undertaken this year. Action to secure a cut of more than 10 percent in the wage and salary bill, which was to have been achieved by the publicly announced cut in the paid working week from 5 days to 4 ‘/? days, has been postponed indefinitely. The copra processing plant is still being subsidized; the national airline continues to receive substantial funds, including subsidies for domestic operations, despite higher receipts from fish exports. The rise in capital expenditure partly reflects the Government’s intention to provide financial assistance for the purchase of a new aircraft by Air Marshall Islands and to begin construction of a fully government-owned hotel of 100-150 rooms. Without immediate measures of fiscal restraint, the staff projects that the financial holdings of the Government will be exhausted by the end of the fiscal year. In the absence of corrective fiscal action, the external payments position is projected to record a deficit of more than 30 percent of GDP in 1994/95, in contrast to the surplus recorded last year. The merchandise trade deficit is again estimated to exceed 50 percent of GDP, although with a small net surplus on the services account and official transfers estimated at 58 percent of GDP, a surplus should be recorded on the external current account including transfers. The major change in the structure of the balance of payments is in the capital account, which is projected to show a substantial net outflow as a result of government debt repayment. Without further commercial borrowing, outstanding external debt is expected to decline to 165 percent of GDP, but the debt-service ratio would still amount to 43 percent of exports of goods and services. III. Report on the Discussions The Marshall Islands is far from reaching a sustained path toward greater self- sufficiency. The discussions focused on the nature and extent of the medium-term adjustment needed to offset the impact of the scheduled decline in U.S. assistance, foster economic independence, and secure a relatively smooth transition to the reduced external support that is in prospect when the Compact ends. The magnitude of the effort required will be extraordinarily large if the Compact grants are reduced as planned without compensatory assistance, in light of the present financial imbalances prevailing in the economy. While renewal of the Compact agreement is not out of the question, any future grants would most likely be smaller than in past years and the need for far-reaching adjustment remains. Taking into account the greatly circumscribed role of monetary and exchange rate policies in the Marshall Islands, the authorities agreed that the burden of macroeconomic adjustment will have to be borne mainly by the fiscal sector. In addition, it was acknowledged that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- tindamental structural changes will have to be implemented to promote growth and en~ploymc!3t i!l tl?c i3:iVrtiCf S+.Xti\T’. Discussions were held on an updated medium-term adjustment scenario that would facilitate sustainable development and progress toward external viability. An attempt was made to quantify the extent of the policy measures required to generate fiscal surpluses through domestic resource mobilization and a downsizing of government !?.mctions. Attention was also directed toward the need for a public investment program that would support productive acti\Tity. The staff team stressed the importance of preparing a coherent strategy at an early stage in order to attract donor support from bilateral and multilateral sources. In this regard, the authorities said that a clear statement of objectives and policies would be prepared for the first Consultative Group meeting, which the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has promised to organize later this year. A. Expansion of the Productive Base The Government has identified fishing, food production, and tourism as sectors with medium-term growth potential. The authorities recognize the importance of a well-focused infrastructure program to encourage private domestic and foreign investment. A sizable part of U.S. economic assistance programs is aimed specifically at institution building and infrastructure projects to foster self-sufficiency. The AsDB is finalizing a ten-year transportation master plan for air tratlic, port and interisland shipping facilities, and the road network. The publicly owned electricity, water, and sewerage concerns have recently strengthened their management and enhanced the commercial orientation of their operations. Expansion of the fisheries sector is planned to involve both foreign and locally owned vessels with the primary focus on supplying high-quality tuna to the Japanese market from the rich resources of the Marshall Islands’ vast marine economic zone. The Majuro fish base was privatized in late 1994 and its operations are now conducted by a foreign-owned corporation. A similar facility is under construc!ion on Ebeye atoll and the possibility of a third base in another island is being explored. The AsDB is supporting the building of a small fleet of long- line locally owned fishing vessels and helping to improve skills through the recently established fisheries training school. A cold storage facility has been built with Japanese assistance in Majuro to ease the problem of marketing fish that is caught in the surrounding islands. The authorities are devoting considerable effort to the promotion of small-scale agricultural and food processing activities, with a view to reducing food imports that presently account for about one third of total imports. Encouraging progress has been made in growing fruit and vegetables in the national capital area, with technical assistance from China, and the Government is sponsoring pilot projects in poultry and horticulture in several atolls. Diversification in the agricultural sector is being given priority over increased copra production, which the authorities had earlier seen as a means of reversing urban migration; longer-term prospcc~s are now considcrcd 1.0 be less promising because of expectations of low Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- world prices and declining productivity associated with the old age of trees. HoweTJer, valu added from the sector should be stimulated by the opening shortly of a new plant that will permit the export of refined coconut oil. Prospects for the development of tourism are hindered by inadequate hotel accommodation, limited flight schedules, and distances from major potential markets. However, possibilities exist to promote specialized activities, including diving and snorkeling for which several atolls offer unusually fine opportunities. High-level political discussions are taking place with the Governments of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu with a view to assessing the feasibility ofjoint air services to help exploit regional tourist attractions. In addition, a joint venture with U.S. private investors to construct dry dock facilities in Majuro has commenced and the possibility of creating a regional transshipment center is under examination. Foreign investment incentives are generous, including exemptions from gross revenue tax and import duties, although the staff team felt that approval procedures for new proposals could be streamlined. However, land tenure difficulties are a well-recognized impediment to foreign investment. A referendum is being held shortly on a constitutional amendment that would ease restrictions on land use by foreigners and the authorities are developing an industrial estate in Majuro where investors could sublease land from the Government. The importance of attracting foreign direct investment is underscored by the limited number of experienced local entrepreneurs and the shortage of technical skills in the labor force. The staff stressed that it was essential for market forces to play a leading role in wage setting in order to stimulate employment in the private sector and help absorb the workers that will be released from the public sector. The authorities expected that, with diminishing prospects for public employment, the functioning of the labor market would improve and greater flexibility would evolve in wage determination, including indexation of rates to public sector rates, notwithstanding the recent increase in the minimum wage rate from $1.50 per hour to $2.00 per hour. The provision of improved financial services is seen as vital to promote private savings and support enlarged private sector activity. The authorities are encouraging the provision of banking facilities outside the national capital and one bank is opening a branch in Ebeye atoll in the near future. The full-time Banking Commissioner, who has been assigned under the IMF technical assistance program since late 1994, has compiled banking statistics on a regular basis, promoted greater understanding by banks of credit risk appraisal, and prepared policy directives and regulations on bank supervision. The authorities would like to encourage longer-term bank lending for development purposes, consistent with the observance of prudential banking rules and the preservation of the quality of their assets, although this will require changes in land policy to permit its use as loan collateral. Long-term private sector credit on market-related terms is again expected to be made available by the Marshall Islands Development Bank once the AsDB completes the former’s reorganization and puts in place new procedures to avoid the recurrence of nonperforming loans which plagued its past operations. The authorities indicated that future lending would be made only on market-related terms. The staff team urged the abolition of regulations limiting transfers of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- funds abroad by commercial banks which, while not presently effective, could hinder their operations in the future. B. Fiscal Consolidation in 1994/95 and 1995/96 The degree of fiscal adjustment undertaken in recent years has been modest, with little attention given to tax reform and government current expenditure still equivalent to 62 percent of GDP. The staff team stressed the need for urgent fiscal action to curb consumption and lessen dependence on imports. Specific proposals were made for immediate implementation in order to prevent the complete exhaustion of the financial holdings of the Government by the end of this fiscal year. Detailed suggestions were made for inclusion in the budget for 1995/96, the preparation of which is due to begin shortly for presentation to Parliament in August. The required fiscal consolidation is much greater than envisaged at the time of the last consultation because progress to date has fallen well short of earlier expectations and debt-service obligations have increased because of further commercial borrowing. While fully acknowledging the need for action, the authorities remarked that political consensus for all the desirable measures would be difficult to secure prior to the November 1995 general election. Immediate actions were suggested to hold the overall budget deficit within the original limit of 13 percent of GDP in this fiscal year, which would require savings of 8 percent of GDP compared with the presently projected outcome. The staff team considered that current expenditure should be reduced by 5 percent of GDP and the budgetary control mechanism should be strengthened to ensure that all spending limits were observed. The wage and salary bill should be contained within the budgeted amount of 18.5 percent of GDP, 3 percent of GDP less than envisaged at present, by introducing the shorter working week and enforcing a strict hiring freeze. Subsidies to public enterprises should be held within the budget limit of 6 percent of GDP, 2 percent of GDP less than envisaged at present, by reducing procurement prices for copra that are presently one third higher than world market levels and increasing domestic airfares by at least 25 percent to cover the debt-servicing costs of aircraft that are operated on domestic routes. Consideration might also be given to raising water tariffs to better reflect the cost of providing this service. Action could be taken to reduce capita1 expenditure by 3 percent of GDP in this fiscal year. This could be achieved by cancellation of the hotel construction project, which seems inappropriate in view of the Government’s commitment not to engage in new commercial enterprises, and the need to reduce the size of the public sector. Capita1 expenditure would still reach 25 percent of GDP, much higher than in previous years, of which one half would be accounted for by a new aircraft purchase. Even with the proposed savings, the financial holdings of the Government would fall to only 7.5 percent of GDP at the end of the fiscal year which appears inadequate especially in view of the downward trend in external grant assistance. The authorities said that, while they were concerned about the rundown in cash balances, no firm decisions had yet been taken on the possible introduction of new restrictive fiscal measures this year. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- IO- The pace of fiscal adjustment would have to be accelerated greatly in 1995/96, because of the depletion of financial holdings and the absence of possibilities for further commercial borrowing against future Compact funds. The staff team estimated that an overall budgetary surplus of 15 percent of GDP would be needed to provide funds for scheduled amortization payments, even assuming no buildup in the financial holdings of the Government. The necessary adjustment effort is equivalent to 26 percent of GDP which requires decisive revenue-raising measures in combination with substantial cuts in both current and capital expenditure. The tight financial constraint could be eased only by the provision of additional external grant assistance, but the prospects of obtaining such funds either from the United States or nontraditional sources are limited. The authorities stated that, while they would continue to seek additional help, budgetary policy would be framed on the basis of firm financing assurances. On the revenue side, the recommendations of the 1992 IMP technical assistance mission have so far only been introduced partially and the staff team proposed their full implementation in the context of the forthcoming budget, which could raise tax revenue by 3 percent of GDP. Measures should include higher personal income tax rates, an increase in import duties on most noncapital goods, and the elimination of the duty exemptions for public enterprise imports. Consideration could be given to the introduction of an international travel tax and higher import duties on petroleum products. Improvements are needed in tax administration through a strengthening of the collection capabilities of both the tax revenue and customs services. Over the longer term, it is hoped that administrative procedures will become sufficiently well organized to permit the introduction of a sales tax or value-added tax with the aim of containing the growth in consumption. The authorities indicated their intention to seek IMP follow-up technical assistance to help implement new revenue measures. On the expenditure side, the mission recommended that current expenditure be reduced by 9 percent of GDP. This could be done by making further cuts in the wage and salary bill by reducing the number of exemptions from the hiring freeze for personnel with special skills, abolishing positions that become vacant, and encouraging early retirement; the amalgamation of ministries to reduce administrative costs, taking account of recommendations made by the World Bank; and the acceleration of policies of commercialization and privatization. The procurement and supply facilities of the Ministry of Public Works and the construction activities of the Ministry of Resources and Development are functions that could be contracted out to the private sector. The present highly subsidized interisland shipping services of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications should be operated by a state- owned corporation on a commercial basis, which implies higher freight charges and the disposal of one or possibly two vessels, with the subsequent sale of the business to the private sector. Proposals should be implemented to establish a national ports authority and promote the independence of the airport authority, which should increase revenue. Prospects for the privatization of the energy, water, and sewerage concerns have been enhanced by the recent improvement in management performance and the sale of additional shares in the telecommunications authority appears feasible. , Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- Given the Marshall Islands’ limited debt-servicing capacity, it is important that capital expenditure in 1995!96 be undertaken without recourse to commercial borrowing. On the basis of present financing availabilities, this would mean holding development spending to 11 percent of GDP, 14 percent of GDP less than in this fiscal year. A program of this size would not permit the purchase of a second aircraft for Air Marshall Islands, which has been ordered for delivery in this period, or investment in hotel construction. Apart from the lack of financing for these projects, the staff team considered that their projected profitability was based on optimistic assumptions; in the event that they are undertaken, budgetary support would probably be required for their operations, contrary to the Government’s commitment to eliminate subsidies to public enterprises. C. Medium-Term Fiscal and Balance of Payments Scenario The discussions of the baseline medium-term scenario for the remaining years of the Compact were based on the assumptions of no further commercial borrowing by the public sector, relatively small but increasing concessional assistance from non-U.S. sources, full servicing of existing debt, and the gradual buildup of financial holdings of the central government. The most important finding is the need for persistent overall budgetary surpluses throughout the period from 1995/96 to 2000/2001. A credible fiscal adjustment program would need to mobilize additional domestic budgetary resources to fully offset the prospective decline in external grants, while lowering spending by about 35 percent of GDP during this period. Domestic savings would rise substantially as a result of higher public savings, although the prospective decline in living standards would probably constrain the growth of private savings. With this strategy, it should be possible to progressively raise the external current account surplus, including official transfers, and ensure that overall balance of payments surpluses are recorded. The AsDB is recruiting a Policy Advisory Team that will be resident in the Marshall Islands for the next three years to assist the authorities in implementing accompanying structural reforms, with special reference to the trading regime, the promotion of productive investment, wage and labor policies, public sector management, the social safety net, and environmental protection. Following the abrupt and drastic fiscal contraction that is inevitable in 1995/96, the staff calculations indicate that continued budgetary adjustment equivalent to 3 percent of GDP annually will be required for the remaining five years of the Compact. With the tax system that should be put in place in the next budget, domestic revenue could increase by almost 1 percent of GDP annually, with the bulk of the increase deriving from higher income tax, import duties, and fishing receipts tax, and this would broadly offset the decline in external grants. The bulk of the adjustment would need to be achieved by reducing current expenditure by nearly 3 percent of GDP annually through cuts in the wage and salary bill, lower purchases of goods and services, and the elimination of subsidies to public enterprises. Following the curtailment of the investment program next year, capital expenditure is envisaged to rise gradually, focused on strengthening infrastructure and supporting private sector activity. Under these assumptions, the financial holdings of the Government could be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- rebuilt to 30 percent of GDP by 2000/200 1, which represents the minimum cushion necessary to deal with contingencies in the post-Compact era. Mirroring developments in the budgetary accounts, the external current accou :rt including offtcial transfers is expected to record surpluses that increase by about 4 perGent annually between 1995/96 and 2000/2001. The merchandise trade deficit is projected to fall from 42 percent of GDP in 1995/96 to 27 percent of GDP in 2000/2001 as a result of the growth of fish and other exports and cuts in imports associated with lower public rnnd private consumption and progress in import substitution. The net surplus on services is f:xpected to increase modestly, partly associated with the provision of facilities for foreign fshing vessels. The capital account would show deficits averaging about 15 percent of GDP, in view of the need to repay all outstanding bond issues by the end of the Compact period. The overall balance of payments would remain in surplus and outstanding external debt would decline to the equivalent of 53 percent of GDP and external debt service would represent only 9 percent of exports of goods and services in 200 l/2002. The authorities recognized that, despite the daunting nature of the proposed adjustment path, there was little scope for a more gradual approach. While they were hopeful that external financing would be larger than assumed by the staff, there was no question that the total inflow of funds would be substantially smaller than in the past and, in these circumstances, policy slippages would have to be prevented at all costs. It was hoped that the United States would continue to provide concessionary assistance beyond the end of the Compact, although no commitments to this effect had yet been given. It was well understood that nontraditional donors could not fully replace declining U.S. assistance, although the authorities would actively seek their increased support. IV. Staff Appraisal The Marshall Islands economy has not performed well in recent years. Real GDP growth has been very low and, in the face of rapid population growth, per capita income has been falling. The private sector remains underdeveloped and the productive base is narrow, concentrated in deep-sea fishing and coconut processing. The public sector continues to dominate economic activity, accounting for about one half of formal employment and central government budget deficits are substantial. Grant assistance from the United States presently sustains a high level of consumption of mainly imported goods and the Compact of Free Association ensures that large financial support will continue to be available until 2000/2001. However, the authorities face the enormous tasks of eliminating the pronounced financial imbalances, overcoming deep-seated structural problems, and establishing a sustainable path toward external viability in the post-Compact era. While acknowledging the need for large- scale adjustment, they are still in the early stages of developing a comprehensive strategy to address these issues. Fiscal policy is the cornerstone of the adjustment strategy, particularly in view of the limited scope for the use of monetary and exchange rate policies owing to the use of the U.S. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - dollar as the domestic currency and the absence of restrictions on capital flows. In this regard, urgent action is needed to mobilize domestic revenue, sharply curb current expenditure, and better prioritize capital expenditure. The magnitude of the required effort has been enhanced greatly by the expansionary fiscal policies of recent years, which have been financed by heavy external commercial borrowing and by the running down of the financial holdings of the Government. Outstanding external debt and debt-service payments have risen to high and unsustainable levels. The staff would emphasize the crucial importance of avoiding further commercial borrowing and rebuilding the financial holdings of the Government. The process of fiscal consolidation should be initiated now in order to hold the overall central government deficit for 1994/95 within the budgeted limit. Without additional measures, there would be sizable overruns of expenditure on wages and salaries, subsidies to public enterprises, and the public investment program. The staff would suggest the immediate introduction of the shorter working week for civil servants, which was scheduled to become effective earlier in this fiscal year, and tighter restrictions on public sector recruitment, Copra procurement prices should be reduced to better reflect world market conditions, which would strengthen the finances of the copra processing plant. Domestic airfares should be raised by at least 25 percent to eliminate the subsidy on local routes. The Government should abandon its intention to begin construction of a large filly owned hotel, which is inconsistent with the stated policy of avoiding new entrepreneurial activities that can be carried out by the private sector. A more forceful approach is also required to ensure that budgetary control mechanisms are fully effective. The pace of fiscal adjustment will have to be accelerated greatly in the 1995/96 budget and beyond in order to secure persistent overall budget surpluses and allow the scheduled repayment of bond issues by the end of the Compact period. For this purpose, the staff would stress the desirability of implementing the revenue measures proposed by an earlier IMFtechnical assistance mission, including higher personal income tax rates, the elimination of exemptions, and increased duties on imports. Consideration could also be given to raising excise duties on petroleum products and instituting an international travel tax. The collection capabilities of the revenue and customs administration should be strengthened, so that a comprehensive sales tax or value-added tax could be initiated in due course, If requested, IMF follow-up technical assistance could be made available to help implement new revenue measures. With regard to current expenditure, a large reduction in public sector employment is imperative, which would be assisted by promoting early retirement, as well as other actions to cut administrative costs, including lower purchases of goods and services. The share of Government in employment is extremely high relative to other small island economies. Past staff reports have drawn attention to the fact that wages in the public sector are higher than in the private sector and this continues to be the case. Given these characteristics, in the absence of a substantial adjustment in government en~ployn~nt and wages, the required relative price shifts to move resources into the private ti-adabie goods sector is weak and the adjustment is likely to be long and protracted.

Subsidies and transfers to the public enterprises continue to create a large strain on the fiscal position. Commitments to phase out these payments have fallen well short of earlier expectations, notwithstanding improvements in the management of the energy corporation and the further rise in the profitability of the national telecommunications authority. A comprehensive program is needed, including tariff adjustments and stronger efforts to collect outstanding accounts from customers, to ensure the early elimination of remaining subsidies to the copra processing plant, the interisland shipping service, the water and sewerage systems, and the national airline. Prospective investment plans, especially with regard to aircraft purchases, must be subjected to rigorous cost-benefit analysis before commitments are finalized. Firm plans should also be formulated to commercialize government-owned operations and privatize enterprises where feasible, including the sale of further shares in the telecommunications authority. The creation of a more dynamic private sector is vital to absorb redundant labor from the public sector and ameliorate the economic impact of declining external support, although this is unlikely to prevent a decline in real GDP in the next few years or to permit more than a modest recovery in the remainder of the Compact period. The Government has identified fishing, small-scale agriculture, and tourism as the best prospects for the medium term and this seems appropriate. The public investment program should concentrate on providing the necessary infrastructure to support private sector activities. Enhanced efforts should be made to simplify foreign investment approval procedures, facilitate foreign ownership and leasing of land, promote flexibility in the wage determination process, and encourage longer-term development lending by commercial banks, consistent with the observance of prudential banking rules and the preservation of asset quality. The staff welcomes the recent action by banks to restrict consumer lending, which should contribute to raising private savings. Economic decision making in the Marshall Islands would benefit from a strengthening of the statistical base. There has been encouraging progress with respect to the compilation of national income accounts, through the adoption of recommendations made by an earlier IMF statistical missjon, and of commercial bank statistics, through the efforts of the resident &IF-sponsored Banking Commissioner. However, the budgetary accounts do not contain complete details of capital spending and material on public enterprise finances is deficient. Monetary survey data cannot be presented because of the incomplete information on the monetary authorities account, including the absence of data on currency in circulation. There are no official balance of payments statistics and estimates of capital account transactions are subject to a wide margin of error. The staff urges the authorities to press ahead with improvements in the statistical base, for which purpose the services of the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre can be utilized. The staff would also reiterate the importance of transmitting data to the Fund on a regular and timely basis.

With the assistance of the Policy Advisory Team that is expected shortly to take up residence in the country, the preparation of a comprehensive medium-term development strategy should be finalized at an early date. Such a document should help to encourage support from bilateral and multilateral donors and help to lay the groundwork for a successful meeting of the prospective Consultative Group that the Asian Development Bank has expressed willingness to organize. The Fund will continue to provide technical assistance in the fiscal, monetary, and statistical areas through headquarters and the Suva Center. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Marshall Islands be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

However, quarterly and monthly statistical data are not published or transmitted to the Fund. A. Real Sector National income accounts have been prepared on a production basis for the years from 1991 onwards, in line with the recommendations of the August 1992 STA multitopic mission. The Majuro consumer price index, the only available aggregate price index, could be improved through an updating of weights, reclassification of baskets, larger samples, and the elimination of inconsistent treatment of taxes at the price reporting stage. B. Government Finance Government finance statistics are regularly collected and compiled for budget control but they have not been consolidated into a format usable for analysis. Training was provided to the authorities in GFS methodology for publication of data in International Financial Statistics (IFS), as well as for analytical purposes; however, no reporting of GFS data has been initiated. The authorities also received technical assistance from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre on budgetary accounting in September 1994. C. Monetary Accounts Regular reporting has been established for all domestic banking institutions (except for a credit union on Ebeye) on the basis of monthly reporting forms and guidelines developed during the April 1993 STA mission. This is an important step toward the titure development of an IFS page for the Marshall Islands. Banking data have become reasonably current and consistent, with the assistance of the Banking Commissioner. The compilation of data for the monetary authority accounts (which are related to the monetary authority tinctions undertaken by the Government) requires improvement in coverage and timeliness. D. Balance of Payments Apart from trade statistics, balance of payments data are not compiled. Despite the recent computerization of trade data, their compilation has not substantially improved in terms of timeliness and accuracy, mainly because of inappropriate classification and coding. Only limited data are available on services, factor income, and private transfers and there are no data on private capital flows. The magnitude of these items is sizable and their compilation deserves priority, as recommended by the STA multitopic mission of August 1992.

The AsDB’s strategy includes policy advice with special emphasis on donor coordination, support for structural adjustment, project financing, and technical assistance. The AsDB will help the Government in utilizing the country’s productive potential, particularly in marine resources and tourism; developing human resources through education, training, and health and family planning; creating a vigorous private sector to become the main engine of economic growth; and strengthening institutions to foster the development process. Assistance for infrastructure to support the productive sectors and for protecting the environment is also integral to the AsDB’s strategy. Since joining the AsDB, five loans totaling $21.85 million have been approved (fisheries, $6.95 million; emergency assistance, $0.5 million; basic education, $8.0 million; water supply engineering, $0.7 million; and health and population, $5.7 million). Project loans for water supply and transportation infrastructure development may be approved in 1995. Five technical assistance grants were approved in 1994 (environmental education, transportation infrastructure development, health management information system and health planning, strengthening of the Development Bank - Phase II, and small enterprise development). One grant was approved in early 1995 and four grants are expected to be approved in the rest of the year to cover power expansion, national skills development, the tourism development strategy, and the national fisheries development plan. Over the next three years, annual lending is projected to be about $9 million, with technical assistance grants at about $2.5 million per year. ‘Prepared by AsDB staff.
