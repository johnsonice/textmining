Large budgetary and external current account surpluses were recorded and official foreign reserves reached the equivalent of seven months of imports. l Real GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 7.5 percent in 1995, mainly because of weaker export markets, although the economy is still operating at or above capacity. To counter pressures on unit labor costs and prevent an upturn in inflation, the authorities have continued to allow appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. l Singapore has experienced a resurgence of large capital intlows in recent months, which has expanded domestic liquidity and caused a decline in domestic interest rates. Since an early reversal seems unlikely, the staff suggested that the appropriate response would be to allow further appreciation of the Singapore dollar. l The 1995 budget envisaged a smaller surplus, mainly because of higher public investment. The staE commented that, while consistent with the longer-term objective of achieving overall fiscal balance, this might necessitate modifications in other policies to prevent overheating, especially exchange rate policy. l Real GDP growth is estimated at 7-8 percent over the medium term, in line with potential. Further sizable external current account surpluses are expected, although some decline will result from a pickup in private consumption and the planned lower public savings. The fundamentals imply that the Singapore dollar will keep appreciating but, with upgrading to high-technology production, the external position should not be threatened.

Introduction’ The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Singapore were held during June 28-July 10, 1995.’ The Singapore delegation was led by Dr. Teh Kok Peng, Deputy Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The mission met with Dr. Richard Hu Tsu Tau, Minister of Finance; Mr. Lee Ek Tieng, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore; Mr. Khaw Boon Wan, Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Trade and Industry; and members of the financial and business community. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on March 11, 1994, Directors expressed admiration for Singapore’s long record of rapid economic development. They observed that preventing domestic overheating would remain a policy challenge and believed that the authorities should stand ready to permit further appreciation of the Singapore dollar if demand continued to strengthen. Directors noted that Singapore benefited f?om substantial foreign direct investment, stimulated by sound economic management, political stability, flexible labor markets, and excellent infrastructure. They encouraged the authorities to scale back the use of tax incentives to promote investment. With regard to the country’s exceptional saving performance, several Directors indicated that it was, at least in part, related to mandatory contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF). Singapore publishes high-quality economic statistics and the staff receives core data in a timely manner. Official international reserves are published with a lag of two-three months, because of extensive checking to ensure that all data are correct. The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) is also a substantial holder of foreign assets in Singapore, but its assets are not included in official international reserves; the staff does not have access to the balance sheet of the GIC (see Box 1) but, taking into account other available information on its activities, this has not hampered surveillance procedures. The authorities have provided assurances of full compliance with data requirements that may be adopted by the Executive Board in connection with the strengthening of Fund surveillance. Singapore has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an ‘The term “country,” as used in this paper, does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice; the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states, but for which statistical data are maintained and provided internationally on a separate and independent basis. *The staff team consisted of Messrs. Browne (Head), Ostry, Oestreicher, Canetti, and Ms. Cormier (Staff Assistant), all SEA. Mr. Zubir bin Abdullah, Office of the Executive Director for Singapore, participated in the meetings. A mission scheduled for early 1995 was postponed at the request of the authorities because of their staffing constraints.

Government of Singapore Investment Corporation l The corporation is responsible for the management of government-owned long-term assets, virtually all of which are invested abroad. Its creation in 1981 was motivated by the view that the stock of foreign reserves held by the Monetary Authority of Singapore was greater than needed for central banking functions and excess amounts could be handled more effectively by a separate fund manager. l Assets of the corporation originate with the budget surplus and government borrowing from the Central Provident Fund and are subsequently used to purchase foreign exchange from official holdings. In addition to budget data, the authorities publish the balance sheet of the Central Provident Fund. l The Board of Directors is chaired by the Prime Minister and its upper-level managers till positions concurrently at the Monetary Authority of Singapore. l Investment strategy is conservative, with most funds invested in government bonds and high-quality stocks in the United States and other industrial countries, with currency risk hedged as much as possible. In recent years, a small but increasing part of the portfolio has been used for real estate and direct equity stakes, including minority participation in regional infrastructure projects. l Data on the size and distribution of assets are not published but the total portfolio could be of the or&r of US% 100 billion. In addition to maintaining its own offices and advisors in Japan, North America, and Europe, some assets are managed by Singapore-based private financial institutions. II. Background A. Longer-Term Trends Over the three decades following independence in 1965, Singapore’s annual average real GDP growth exceeded 8 percent, which helped to raise GDP per capita to well over US$20,000. Apart from the periods of rising international oil prices in 1973-74 and 1979-8 1, the rate of inflation was kept within the range of 2-3 percent. Growth was led by manufactured goods, especially electronics and the financial services sector. Despite the steadily appreciating exchange rate, Singapore remained highly competitive with modest rises in unit labor costs. The ratio of gross fixed investment increased to more than 3 5 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the expansion of capital accumulation in the private sector, assisted by tax incentives and strong inflows of advanced technology foreign-direct investment. Public investment in high-quality infrastructure also facilitated private sector growth. ‘Singapore maintains restrictions on payments and transfers against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SerbiaMontenegro), Iraq, and Libya in compliance with U.N.

Singapore recorded a remarkable savings. performance during this period. The national savings rate rose from less than 20 percent of GDP in the 1960s to 50 percent by 1994, with private savings rising to 36 percent of GDP. The most important factor was the pronounced increase in the ratio of the working age population to the total population from 55 percent to over 70 percent. Other factors were the rapid growth in real private disposable income, in combination with constraints on housing purchases because of land shortages and motor vehicle purchases for environmental reasons, and the large compulsory payments into the CPF. The high level of public savings, which reached 14 percent of GDP, reflected persistent budgetary surpluses designed mainly to prevent overheating of the economy. Box 2. Central Provident Fund l The scheme was established in 1955 to encourage retirement savings, with equal employer and employee contributions. Combined rates are presently equivalent to 40 percent of wages for most members. l Membership of the scheme covers the entire labor force, including more than 1 million full-time employers and part-time employees working more than 14 hours per week, and over 100,000 self-employed persons. Foreign workers who pay the work permit levy are exempt from the scheme. l Accounts are held in each employee’s name and contributions are untaxed at both entry and exit. Most contributions may be withdrawn at age 55, although a specitied minimum must be retained until age 60. A share of contributions is earmarked to cover medical expenses. l Withdrawal criteria have been liberal&d progressively since 1968 to permit members to purchase real estate; invest in financial assets, including shares of privatized enterprises; obtain insurance policies; and pay for children’s education. These measures have improved the substitutability of contributions for other private savings, although restrictions remain for consumption purposes. l Assets are invested solely in government bonds, which gives members a secure rate of return on their balances. The scheme introduces no constraints on labor mobility, as benefits are portable, and is instrumental in holding down government social spending. As a result of these trends, the external current account, in deficit until 1980, has since been in large surplus. In view of the strong fundamentals of the economy and the welcoming policy toward foreign investors, high net capital inflows were recorded. While the authorities promoted outward capital flows and allowed the exchange rate to appreciate against a trade- weighted basket of currencies, large official holdings of foreign assets were also accumulated. This partly reflected official sales of Singapore dollars in the foreign exchange market to counter the drain on domestic liquidity caused by the fiscal surpluses. Such intervention worked to moderate the strengthening of the currency.

Developments in 1993 and 1994 Real GDP rose by 10 percent in both 1993 and 1994, in excess of the long-term trend (Table 1). Domestic demand, especially fixed investment, was the main factor driving growth in 1993, as producers moved to augment capacity and imports of capital goods surged. In contrast, the foreign sector accounted ,for most of the increase in output in 1994, as exports rose rapidly, aided by better economic performance in the United States and Europe and strong growth in Asia. Labor market conditions tightened, the unemployment rate fell to 2 percent, and nominal wage earnings increased by 9 percent in 1994.’ Consumer prices rose by 3 percent in 1994, 1 percentage point more than in 1993, although after adjusting for the introduction of the 3 per- cent goods and services tax, inflation was little changed between the two years. Exchange rate policy continued to be geared toward the objective of containing inflation. The appreciation of the Singapore dollar by 4 percent in nominal effective terms in 1994 helped to contain price increases; the authorities had maintained a more stable exchange rate in 1993, when domestic cost pressures were less severe. Lags with which exchange rate changes bear on inflation are very m 1. Red GDP 11 (h-l paccntsee chsnec) 10 9 8 7 6 5 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 Fmj. 30 . Fii2.

While the magnitude of the surplus reflected the moderation of fixed investment following the earlier large additions to capacity and some destocking, it also was the product of the &-ther increase in the national saving rate. The overall balance of payments surplus moderated to 7 percent of GDP in 1994. Portfolio and bank inflows, which in 1993 had been boosted by rising asset markets and a narrowing interest rate differential with the United States, fell back, while foreign direct investment outflows rose substantially, Figure 3.

Gross official reserves reached US$58 billion (seven months of imports). With the exchange rate targeted toward the inflation objective, monetary policy played a passive role. Interest rates tended to remain below those in major financial centers in the expectation that the trend appreciation of the Singapore dollar would continue but, in response to higher U.S. interest rates, domestic rates rose in 1994. Narrow money (Ml) growth fell, while broad money (M2) growth increased, reflecting a shift from demand to time deposits associated with the rise in domestic interest rates (Table 3). Private sector credit demand was strong, mainly to finance motor vehicle and stock market purchases. The overall budget surplus was 13 per- cent of GDP in 1994/95,4 percent of GDP higher than projected at budget time (Table 4).‘j Revenue collections were boosted by faster output growth than initially forecast and higher prices at the monthly auctions for the entitlement certificates to purchase motor vehicles, while shortfalls occurred in operating and especially development expenditure, consistent with experience in previous years. Increases in land prices added to capital receipts, although government lending increased to the Housing Development Board, with little net effect on the budget.

Developments and Prospects in 1995 Real GDP growth is officially projected to moderate to 7-8 percent in 1995. Growth was Figure 5.

The rate of inflation was below 2 percent in the 12 months to June and the official target of 3 percent for the year is expected to be achieved. The external current account surplus is projected at 15 percent of GDP in 1995, slightly lower than last year. Another large overall balance of payments surplus is in prospect following the resurgence of capital inflows; in any event, Singapore did not experience net capital outflows in the wake of the Mexican crisis. The collapse of Barings Bank in February also did not have any lasting impact, because the market saw weak internal management as the primary cause of the failure-and-no financial institution or investor suffered losses on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. Gross official reserves rose further to US$65 billion in May. The Singapore dollar continued to appreciate in the first half year against most major currencies, except the Japanese yen. 7 Figure 6.

Broad money (M2) continued to grow at 15 percent in the year to May. Given the priority attached to the exchange rate, the authorities hold no views on the appropriate or likely growth rates of monetary aggregates and have made no projections for 1995. The overall budget surplus is officially projected at 9 percent of GDP in 1995/96. Operating revenue and expenditure are envisaged to grow in line with GDP, with development spending and net lending each budgeted to rise by almost 2 percent of GDP and the surplus declining by a corresponding amount. This outcome would be consistent with the long-term policy objective of eliminating the budgetary surplus. There is less risk that revenue would exceed the budget forecast this year because of the slower projected rate of economic growth. Regarding development expenditure, the Ministry of Finance has scaled down the requests of individual ministries by much larger amounts than in the past, with a view to minirnizing the shortfall in spending. III. Report on the Discussions The discussions covered near-term policy issues, including the risk of domestic overheating, the role of exchange rate policy, the implications of continued large capital inflows, and the appropriate stance of fiscal policy. The St&team also sought the authorities’ views on their medium-term development strategy, including the potential growth of output and the causes and consequences of the high savings rate. A. Near-Term Policy Stance The discussion of the near-term policy stance--oriented to maintaining inflation in the 2-3 percent range--turned on the assessment of the risks of overheating. The staff team asked how available indicators were analyzed to assess these risks. The authorities stated that attention focussed primarily on trends in consumer prices and unit labor costs. They observed that, although real GDP growth had been clearly above potential for the past two years and factor markets had tightened, the rise in consumer prices in this period had remained extremely modest. Higher increases in nominal wages had been mitigated largely by gains in productivity. At the end of this process, it was difficult to judge whether key sectors of the economy were operating above capacity. Reliable capacity utilization data could not be collected, especially because modem production methods in electronics and other export sectors could change output potential rapidly. The authorities believed that weaker export demand had reduced the risk of domestic overheating in 1995. An additional intake of foreign workers had been allowed earlier this year and regulations would be eased again, if required by conditions in the labor market. Nevertheless, they did not consider that labor costs pressures were likely to diminish. The long-standing policy of gradual but steady appreciation of the Singapore dollar would continue to play an important role in moderating wage demands and keeping underlying Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- inflation in check. However, they pointed out that unduly rapid upward movement of the exchange rate could undermine export profitability, especially for those exporters to the United States whose inputs were imported from Japan. The staff team took the position that the level of output presently stood somewhat above that required to ensure the maintenance of price stability. While agreeing that the precise relationship between current and potential output was difficult to judge, the tightness of the labor markets appeared to justify this assessment. Moreover, export demand might not slow as much as anticipated in the second half year, particularly if the U.S. economy recovered and Singapore was able to penetrate further into fast-growing Asian markets for electronic products. Therefore, the balance of risks suggested that policy needed to show restraint in the period ahead to prevent overheating and an upturn in inflation. The statfteam asked the authorities’ views on the possible instruments to curb overheating in the event that the risks perceived by the staff were to materialize. The authorities responded that fiscal policy had only a limited role as an instrument of short-term demand management. There was a degree of automatic stabilization in the budget in the sense that revenue grew more rapidly in boom periods, as evident in the past two years, particularly if prices of car purchase certificates and land for housing were also rising. It was recognized that some scope existed to hold back projects if it was desired to reduce overall demand. However, fiscal policy was only moderately flexible for that purpose and greater emphasis was placed on longer-term considerations (discussed in the next section). Monetary policy’s role in restraining demand was also seen to be extremely limited, particularly in view of the effective targeting of the exchange rate through intervention policy. The tightening of regulations on consumer borrowing earlier this year would help to contain asset price increases and inflationary expectations. However, the task of demand management had become more complicated with the resurgence of capital inflows. Although a detailed breakdown of recent capital flows was not available, the authorities expected strong net capital inflows to continue, since most of the recent flows appeared to be in the form of long- term direct investment and the prospects for the Singapore economy remained very positive. While market forces would push up the exchange rate, they cautioned that appreciation by itself would not necessarily contribute to either lower inflows or higher interest rates, as experience earlier this year had shown. The staff team agreed with the authorities about the constraints on fiscal and monetary policies. There was, therefore, a consensus that exchange rate policy had to assume the principal burden of restraining overheating and maintaining low inflation. An appreciation of the Singapore dollar would help to switch demand from domestic to foreign sources, lower inflation by depressing the foreign component, and moderate inflationary expectations and wage growth. However, there was a difference of view on the extent of appreciation that would be appropriate in the near term, with the staff suggesting that a faster rate of appreciation would help to stem pressures on unit labor costs and capital inflows. This implied an appreciation in nominal effective terms in 1995 in excess of the 4 percent rise that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- was recorded last year and more than had occurred in the first half year. The authorities were inclined to the view that appreciation at the recent rate remained sufficient in view of demand prospects and that greater weight should be given to the potential impact of faster appreciation on competitiveness. B. Medium-Term Issues The authorities considered that the medium-term potential growth rate had been revised upward to 7-8 percent per year, 1 percentage point more than previously (Table 5). This reflected a more liberal policy vis-Ms the intake of foreign workers and an assessment that trend productivity growth was higher than earlier assumed. Human capital development would continue to enhance the economy’s potential, with the Government committed to raising the share of students who received higher education. Although some decline in the savings rate would result from a pickup in private consumption and the move toward budgetary balance, this would be a gradual process. External current account surpluses would likely remain substantial over the medium term. While the strong fundamentals implied that the Singapore dollar would keep appreciating, the resilience of the export sector and Singapore’s record of continually restructuring toward higher value-added and capital- intensive production techniques indicated that competitiveness would not be compromised. The staff team broadly agreed with this assessment (see Annex IV). Demographic factors will continue to hold up the private savings rate for some years, with the share of both children and retired persons in the population not expected to rise substantially until well into the next century. In these circumstances, the staff suggested that withdrawal criteria from the CPF might be eased further so that contributors were not inhibited from achieving their preferred consumption pattern, after allowance for retirement needs. The authorities said that, with the broadening of the range of withdrawal provisions in recent years, CPF contributions had become increasingly substitutable for other forms of savings. The Government had fostered a culture of high saving, non-CPF private saving was substantial, and it was therefore unlikely that there was an element of forced savings in the scheme, except for low-income earners. With regard to public savings, the authorities had not established a precise timetable for the achievement of overall budgetary balance. The pace at which this could be achieved would be constrained by the desire to maintain the record of low inflation, which could be compromised by overly stimulative fiscal policy. To the extent that cyclical conditions permitted, priority would be given to reducing the revenue burden, primarily by lowering corporate income and property tax rates, rather than by boosting public expenditure. To the extent that the macroeconomic situation inhibited the use of fiscal policy to reduce the external current surplus, the authorities recognized that other policies would need to be modified and, in this regard, additional exchange rate appreciation could be appropriate. The authorities saw considerable potential for the further development of Singapore as a regional financial center, especially with regard to capabilities in fund management and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- investment banking. To this end, account holders were being permitted to invest part of their CPF balances in foreign stocks, and the GIC would allocate more funds for management by locally based financial institutions. While welcoming these measures, the staff team suggested that fiscal incentives for the financial sector, as introduced in this year’s budget were not necessary, given the efficiency of existing services and the quality of the country’s infrastructure. The authorities replied that they were intended to serve only as a signal to attract new operators to Singapore, and infrastructure, skilled labor, and other amenities were more important factors. The authorities reiterated that the use of fiscal incentives for the manufacturing sector, including tax holidays, preferential income tax rates, and accelerated depreciation allowances, is being reduced, as indicated during the previous consultation. The range of concessions has not been changed, but the Economic Development Board is applying more stringent criteria in considering requests for support, all of which are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The staff team concurred that the potential costs, both in terms of fiscal revenue forgone and losses in economic efficiency, would be curbed by moving toward a more neutral tax regime, especially since the benefits to encouraging inward investment have declined as Singapore has moved close to the technological frontier. The authorities underscored the importance that they attach to the liberalization of trade and investment flows on a multilateral and regional basis. Singapore has permitted 99 percent of imports to enter the country duty-free, promoted the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round and the removal of restrictions on trade in services at the World Trade Organization, and strongly supported regional free trade initiatives in the context of ASEAN discussions and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Progress is being made in developing the growth triangle with Indonesia and Malaysia to relocate labor- intensive activities that cannot be upgraded in Singapore. The authorities recently introduced modest concessional tax measures to encourage domestic capital to invest abroad, on the view that the growth of national income would be enhanced by this strategy. While welcoming the liberal policies, which are helping to generate employment in neighboring countries, the staff team said that tax concessions may not be necessary at all, given the regional growth prospects and the absence of restrictions on outward investment. IV. Staff Appraisal Singapore’s record of rapid economic growth with low inflation and a sustainable external position dates back over many years. In addition to an unfailing commitment to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, this achievement reflects an effective set of structural policies including an extremely liberal foreign trade and investment regime, flexible labor markets, and persistent efforts to upgrade production techniques and the country’s human capital. Policies have also been remarkably effective in promoting high levels of public and private savings and channeling them to sectors possessing the greatest growth potential. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - Not surprisingly, with these successes have come some concerns about overheating. Thus, real GDP growth accelerated to double-digit annual rates in 1993-94, well in excess of the longer-term potential of the economy. As the remaining slack in factor markets was absorbed and some domestic cost pressures emerged, the authorities have increasingly been concerned with restraining growth to more sustainable levels. With fiscal policy largely inflexible to short-term demand management considerations and monetary policy constrained both by the openness of the economy and exchange rate policy, the authorities have allowed the exchange rate to appreciate against a basket of currencies in nominal effective terms. This response was well considered and has contributed to reducing the risk of overheating. Near-term prospects are favorable, but risks of overheating remain. Although output should expand at a more sustainable rate in 1995--partly because of weaker export demand--key sectors continue to operate at or above capacity and unit labor cost pressures could intensify. Fiscal policy is also stimulatory, in accordance with the medium-term objective of reducing the budgetary surplus from its unusually high level. Continued appreciation of the Singapore dollar--perhaps faster than thus far in 1995--remains essential to help switch demand from domestic to foreign sources, moderate wage pressures, and contain inflationary expectations. There is room for this, as for market forces to play a more dominant role in exchange rate determination. In recent years, it has been intervention on the foreign exchange market-as indicated by the rapid accumulation of official reserves--rather than the exchange rate that has adjusted to the strong competitiveness of Singapore’s export sector and the large and steady capital inflows. The staff would suggest some change in this balance and a readiness to accept greater appreciation as part of the strategy to promote further diversification of the economy in conditions of financial stability. In the years ahead, there are good prospects that output will continue growing strongly in line with potential, led by exports of high-technology manufactured goods and business and financial services. Further sizable external current account surpluses are probable, especially given the expectation that the private savings performance will remain strong. In these circumstances, the staff would urge the early achievement of the government objective of budgetary balance. Greater emphasis should be given to reducing the revenue burden rather than to raising expenditure, especially through the lowering of corporate taxes, which would help to improve efficiency and strengthen competitiveness. If the scope for more stimulatory fiscal policy is constrained by the need to prevent overheating, the staff would underscore the need to stand ready to modify other policies, especially the exchange rate. It is difficult to define an optimum savings rate for Singapore but there does not seem to be a case for government intervention to raise private savings above what they would be otherwise. The staff therefore believes that additional relaxation in withdrawal conditions from the CPF would be desirable. Withdrawal criteria from the scheme have been liberalized, but remaining restrictions still do not allow some individuals to achieve their preferred level of consumption or choice of investment.

In addition, Singapore has consistently maintained a highly positive attitude to regional and international trade liberalization questions. This approach can be expected not only to enhance the future growth of national income but also to make an important contribution to the creation of employment opportunities, especially in the Asian region. The Fund receives a comprehensive flow of economic and financial data from Singapore. While recognizing the importance attached by the authorities to checking the accuracy of material before it is transmitted, the staff would urge a shortening of reporting lags for official international reserves. In view of the growing importance of international capital flows for surveillance, the staff would also welcome the availability of additional information on the official long-term foreign asset portfolio of Singapore. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard K&month cycle.

Comprehensive economic statistics are also made available through an on-line official database and the regular publications of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Department of Statistics (DOS), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). National accounts on an output and expenditure basis, details of fiscal revenue, and operating and development expenditure data are published on a quarterly basis with a lag of about six weeks in the MTI’s Economic Survey of Singapore. The 1985 base year for the constant price GDP estimates is somewhat outdated. The surveys also contain timely data on productivity, unit labor costs, and prices, as well as a wide range of material on general business conditions, including surveys of expectations and a composite index of leading indicators. Historically, these data have typically been subject to only relatively small revisions. The MOF’s Budgetfor the Fiscal Year provides extremely detailed information on both the forthcoming budget and the outturn for previous years. However, the fiscal data published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are usually reported to the Fund with a lag of twelve to eighteen months. Trade data are published monthly with a lag of about two months in the DOS MonlhZy Digest of Statistics, with import and export data disaggregated by commodity and trading partner countries. The data provided for official merchandise trade statistics and for publication in Direction of Traa’e Statistics and International Finance Statistics (IFS) exclude Indonesia, although these data are included in the services account of the balance of payments. Balance of payments data are reported to STA on an annual basis only, although the MT1 publishes highly aggregated quarterly data in Economic Survey of Singapore. Monetary and financial data are published in the MAS’ Monthly Statistical Bulletins and Annual Reports, as well as being provided directly to the Fund for publication in IFS, although not in a fblly disaggregated fashion. Data on official international reserves are transmitted to the Fund with a lag of two-three months and the currency composition is not given. No information is made available publicly or to the Fund on the balance sheet of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, which is responsibfe for the long-term investment of official foreign assets.

The projections are based on annual productivity growth of 4-5 percent, estimates of which have recently been revised upward, in view of experience in recent years. Labor force growth is estimated at 2-3 percent, with continued rises in female participation and the intake of foreign workers, although the scope for the latter remains limited because of the social consequences. It is assumed that monetary and exchange rate policy will continue to ensure that inflation remains at a low and stable rate. Domestic demand growth is expected to be paced by continued high investment and a gradual upturn in private consumption. New high-technology manufacturing to be established in Singapore is capital intensive, as are many prospective financial and other services, given the requirements for new buildings and automated equipment. Public investment is likely to include large transportation and public housing projects; education and training programs to upgrade labor-market skills; and improvements in health facilities in anticipation of an increased proportion of elderly persons in Singapore’s population. Private consumption growth is projected to more closely match income growth in the coming years. External demand is also predicted to remain buoyant, reflecting the robust economic activity in the Asian region and further penetration of industrial country markets, especially for electronics. The national savings rate is expected to decline only slightly in relation to GDP in the period to the year 2000. Demographic factors would have limited impact on private saving until well into the next century, when the ratio of children and retired persons in the population would rise, but would then contribute markedly to lowering savings, especially through the withdrawal of contributions from the CPF. As discussed in the text, the authorities have not established a timetable for the achievement of overall budgetary balance. In the scenario, public saving is assumed to fall because of the narrowing of the budget surplus, although demand conditions would probably not permit the achievement of balance within the projection period. While revenue cuts and expenditure growth would contribute to this process, greater emphasis is expected to be placed on the revenue side, especially through lower corporate income and property tax rates, to improve the functioning of the supply side of the economy. The external payments position is expected to remain strong, although the current surplus and net capital inflows would fall. Despite continued export growth, the trade surplus would be reduced because of higher imports of consumer goods. Net investment income would increase but this would be more than offset by lower net travel receipts, owing to Singapore’s loss of competitiveness as a tourist and shopping destination and increased travel abroad by citizens, and smaller transportation receipts, in view of increased regional competition. Net transfers would remain negative as a result of remittances by foreign workers. Direct investment inflows would continue to be substantial, although outward investment would grow faster, as private investors seek opportunities abroad. Singapore would maintain large official international reserves, in view of the openness of the economy, although they would probably decline in relation to imports.
