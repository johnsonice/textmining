Introduction and Summaw of Issues The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with the United Kingdom were held in London during July 7-17. The staff representatives u met Chancellor Clarke, Governor George, Permanent Secretary Sir Terence Burns, Chief Economic Advisor Budd, other senior officials of H.M. Treasury and the Bank of England, and members of the Treasury panel of independent forecasters. Mr. Evans (Executive Director) attended as an observer. The United Kingdom has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. At the last consultation, concluded on October 17, 1994, Directors welcomed steps to recast fiscal and monetary policies within a stability- oriented medium-term framework. Directors observed that the continued implementation of the fiscal strategy would depend importantly on expenditure restraint and they strongly advised against tax cuts. l-hey endorsed the September 1994 increase in interest rates and agreed that the authorities should remain prepared to act promptly to ensure observance of their inflation objectives. Directors also encouraged further labor market measures geared td reducing structural unemployment. Policy implementation since the. last consultation has been in line with Directors' advice, and the economy has maintained a broadly favorable track. With the recovery entering a more mature phase, the challenge for policies is to sustain expansion while keeping inflation in check in the face of external cost increases and rising resource utilization. Specifically, the key macroeconomic policy issues are: (i) whether and when further monetary tightening is needed to achieve inflation objectives; and (ii) ensuring that the upcoming budget maintains the announced path of medium-term fiscal consolidation. With general elections to be held by May 1997, the Government continues to trail the opposition Labour Party by a wide margin in opinion polls. Prime Minister Major was re-elected as Conservative leader in July, after calling a party election to challenge internal critics opposed to further integration with Europe. The periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of the United Kingdom's economic data are adequate for effective surveillance (Appendix I). u Messrs.

Backeround 1. Policv context Three years ago, in the wake of sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), the United Kingdom's macroeconomic policies were in some disarray. Monetary policy was adrift from its previous EP.M anchor, and the fiscal deficit, bloated by the effects of recession and of discretionary actions ahead of the 1992 election, was escalating rapidly toward 8 percent of GDP. Economic prospects were uncertain, with emergence from deep recession only just underway. Over the subsequent year the authorities moved to establish the present medium-term cast of policies. Monetarv uolicu was re-oriented to a quantified target for underlying inflation (RPIX)--1-4 percent, with the goal of being in the lower half of the range by the end of the current Parliament (by spring 1997). Following a period of easing in the wake of ERM departure, short-term interest rates were raised by 150 basis points in three equal steps between September 1994 and February 1995, to the current 6 3/4 percent. The new framework also features enhanced transparency of policy decisions. In June 1995, the Chancellor reaffirmed the inflation objective for the end of Parliament and announced that he would continue to aim beyond that point at achieving underlying RPIX inflation of 2 l/2 percent or less. Setting interest rates with this objective, he observed, should ensure that actual inflation remains in the range of l-4 percent most of the time. Fiscal policy was shifted in 1993 to a course of substantial medium- term consolidation. Through phased (and pre-announced) tax increases over the initial two years and continuing expenditure restraint over the medium term, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) was to be brought to below 3 percent of GDP by 1996/97 u and to balance when the economy was on trend (by the end of the decade). Having peaked at 8 percent of GDP in 1993/94, the fiscal deficit 2J is slated at about half that level in the current fiscal year (1995/96). While the cyclical upswing is playing its part, the staff estimates that 2 l/2 percentage points of this improvement represents a reduction in the structural deficit (Table 1 and Chart 1). 2. Economic develouments Disciplined implementation of this strategy has delivered favorable results. In 1994, the recovery strengthened markedly, inflation was at its lowest level since the 19606, unemployment fell considerably, and the external current account moved to near balance.

This year, the recovery has entered a more mature, and challenging, phase. Growth of output--and especially domestic demand--has slackened and the rate of decline in unemployment has also slowed, At the same time, inflation has turned up following commodity price rises and a depreciation of sterling. Growth of activity has moderated over the past year (Chart 4), at least in part because of policy tightening. Real GDP growth slowed to just cwer 2 percent in the first half of 1995, implying a pause in the absorption of economic slack. 1/ Job growth also slowed and unemplovment levelled out at 8.3 percent of the labor force. Private consumution growth (Chart 5) has been moderated by the significant tax increases--equivalent to 4 percent of disposable income--of the past two years; continued housing market weakness and concerns over job security have also played a role. Fixed investment has so far picked up only moderately in the current.cycle, with firms using profits instead to correct the debt buildup associated with ova-investment in the late 1980s boom (Chart 6). wg has continued, but may be partly involuntary in the face of slackening domestic demand. The external current account moved close to balance in 1994 (Chart 7), reflecting the strong export performance and a surge in net investment income. Although export growth levelled off in early 1995 in response to slower demand growth in some key markets such as the United States, sectors producing tradable goods and services have been facing stronger demand conditions than others (such as housing), where conditions have been much more subdued. Reflecting the current account position, net capital inflows have declined: within the total, a decline in outward portfolio investment was offset by increased lending by United Kingdom banks and other nonbank flows. Inflows of foreign direct investment, which had risen sharply in the late 1980s in anticipation of the EU single market, have since fallen back. 2/ 1/ Staff estimates of potential GDP and of the output gap are derived from a production function for non-oil output. Growth of potential non-oil output is estimated at 2-2 l/4 percent, rising slightly over the medium term as higher investment feeds into the capital stock. The Treasury estimates potential output growth at 2-2 l/2 percent, based on calculations of the average rate of actual output growth between points when the economy was judged, on the basis of examination of cyclical indicators, to have been on trend. T!/ Non-oil flows, which peaked at almost 3 percent of GDP in 1989, were about l/2 percent of GDP in 1994.

With cyclical productivity gains slowing down, unit labor costs have begun rising, but only modestly after being flat or declining for most of 1994. The upturn in inflation this year has thus been largely driven by external factors. Com&dity prices rose sharply during 1994 and the impact of their subsequent decline this year was offset by a depreciation of sterling (see below). The officially-targeted measure of inflation--retail price increases excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX)--rose to 2.9 percent during the year ending in August 1995, up from a low of 2 percent in October 1994. Until the beginning of 1995, the effective exchanse rate for sterling had been relatively stable after the 12 percent depreciation that followed departure from the ERM. In the first half of this year, however, sterling depreciated by 6 percent, mainly in the context of the broad currency turmoil during February/March, offsetting part of the impact on overall monetary conditions of higher interest rates. 2/ The depreciation was particularly pronounced against the deutsche mark (9 percent). Since end- June sterling has recovered somewhat (about 2 percent in effective terms, and against the deutsche mark by about 3 percent to DM 2.27). Against the U.S. dollar, in contrast, sterling firmed by 2 percent in the first half and subsequently fell by about 1 percent (to $1.58). In real effective terms, the exchange rate fell close to post-ERM lows at mid-year (Chart 9). Most indicators of domestic monetary conditions have tightened over the past year (Charts 9 and 10). The monetary tightening was favorably received by the gilt market and the differential between short and long-term interest rates has narrowed from over 350 basis points,to- about 120 basis points. Real short-term interest rates (measured relative to actual inflation) have risen by about 100 basis points, to 4 percent. Growth of narrow money (MO) has declined to less than 6 percent, although it remains above its O-4 percent monitoring range. However, broad money (M4) growth, while L/ The staff currently estimates the NAIRU at 7 3/4 percent, about Z/3 percentage point below the actual rate of unemployment. The NAIRU in the late 1980s is estimated to have been at about 9 percent. Academic estimates of the present level of the NAIRU have an extremely wide range (3-9 percent). 2/ A four percent effective exchange rate depreciation is estimated as roughly equivalent, in terms of its effects on monetary conditions, to a one percentage point cut in the base rate.

Expected long-term inflation, as measured both by surveys and by the difference between nominal and index-linked bond yields, is about 4 percent over the next 2-3 years and is thus above the Government's medium-term inflation objective (2 l/2 percent or less). 3. Outlook The recent moderation in the pace of growth may persist for a quarter or two, particularly if recent involuntary stockbuilding is followed by inventory correction. Beyond this, however, the prospect is for a resumption of growth at a rate above potential. Now that tax increases are no longer in the pipeline, rising disposable income and the improved financial situation of households (see Chart 5) should sustain consumption growth, and a significant pickup in fixed investment appears only a matter of time given the strength of corporate finaxiaL positions and high levels of capacity utilization in manufacturing. Aided by depreciation of sterling this year, robust export growth is also in prospect barring a significant downturn in partner country demand. The staff's WE0 projections assume current fiscal policies and one further increase in official interest rates later this year. This tightening notwithstanding, the pace of activity picks up by end-1995, with growth of 2 3/4 percent for the year as a whole (Table 2) compared with the latest official forecast lJ of 3 percent. For 1996, both the staff and authorities foresee growth at about 2 3/4 percent, largely based on domestic demand. Over the medium term, GDP growth is projected to average 2 l/2 percent (Table 3), with the output gap being eliminated by the end of the decade from about 2 percent at mid-1995. The external current account is expected to remain close to balance. Although domestic cost pressures have been subdued, inflation is set to rise further in the near term as external cost increases continudworking through. Key issues are the magnitude of passthrough to retail prices from the depreciation of sterling, and the extent of further policy tightening needed to keep domestic cast pressures in check as resource utilization rises and to bring inflation down to the authorities' medium-term objective. In its August Inflation Reuort, the Bank of England projected that under current interest rate policies, the 12-month rate of underlying inflation would peak at 3 l/2 percent in mid-1996, declining to 3 percent by early 1997, but still exceeding the authorities' 2 l/2 percent target for the end of Parliament.

III. Reuort on the Discussions The discussions focused on the policy requirements for maintaining and building on the recent good performance. The staff emphasized the need to hold fast to the established policy course that has served well so far, and to resist pressures--widely expected in the run-up to elections--for policy relaxation. 1. Monetary and exchanee rate uolicies The authorities stressed their continued commitment to low inflation as the goal of monetary policy. The objective, articulated most recently in the Chancellor's June policy statement, was to achieve inflation rates of 2 l/2 percent or less two years ahead, and both the Bank of England's advice and the Chancellor's decisions on interest rate policy were geared to that end. The authorities agreed that their follow-up statements regarding the range of inflation outcomes (l-4 percent, most of the time) that would likely be consistent with steadfast pursuit of that target had led to some public misunderstanding as to whether policy objectives had been loosened (for example, from a goal of 2 l/2 percent by early 1997 to a "band" of l-4 percent thereafter) (Box 1). This was not the case; rather it had been felt necessary to spell out the range of likely outturns in the interest of realism, given that deviations from 2 l/2 percent were likely in the short run because of exogenous shocks that policy would not systematically seek to offset. It was also felt that, unlike the Bundesbank, the monetary authorities in the United Kingdom had not yet established the degree of credibility needed to announce the policy objective alone. The authorities emphasized the forward-looking character of the framework, under which decisions are taken in light of the outlook for inflation two years ahead. This approach had delivered pre-emptive steps to tighten monetary policy in advance of increases in actual inflation--indeed, tightening was initiated while inflation was still declining. They pointed to the pace of economic expansion as of mid-1994 as a key trigger factor: while their estimates indicated a significant output gap at that time, they had to be mindful in formulating policy both of the uncertainty attached to these estimates and of the certain fact that, whatever the true level of the gap, it had been narrowing rapidly. The staff concurred, noting that economic expansion had been close to the "speed limit" beyond which the disinflationary effects of the gap itself would be more than offset by dynamic effects from the speed with which it was being narrowed, with the risk that domestic inflationary pressures would begin to build.

Monetary Policy Objectives Since shtl~ after sterling’s deparhtre from the ERM in 1992, monetary policy in the United Kingdom has been geared to a quantified inflation target. In October 1992, the authorities announced that their objective was to keep underlying inflation (retail prices excluding mortgage. interest, RPIX) within the range of 14 percent, with the goal of being in the lower half of that range by the end of the current Parliament (which at the latest would be in the second quarter of 1997). AS shown in the Chart, inflation was close to the upper end of the 14 percent range at the inception of this framework, and has remained well within the range. In June. 1995, the Chancellor reaffirmed the objective of bringing inflation to the lower half of the. 14 percent range by the end of Parliament. He announced that he would continue to aim beyond that point at achieving underlying inflation of 2 l/2 percent or less two years ahead. With policies geared to this objective, actual inflation outcomes were likely ta be between 1 and 4 percent most of the time. The status of the 14 percent range has thus been changed from the. obiective of policy (in the O&her 1992 formulation) to the. likelv nmpe of outcomes associated with pursuit of the objective of 2 l/2 percent or less.

Inflation was set to rise in the near term as earlier external cost increases work through, and growth of monetary aggregates had picked up; but evidence of a pause in the upswing had increased in recent months, diminishing the risk of demand- side pressures, and both house and commodity prices had recently been falling. The authorities observed some similarities between the present conjuncture and the mid-1980s pause in the upswing, and recalled that at that time policies had been mistakenly eased, amplifying the subsequent boom and bust--an experience that they had no wish to repeat. On balance, it was unlikely that the interest rate peak in the current cycle had been reached, although--perhaps thanks to the pre-emptive tightening--Treasury officials considered that the peak was not far away and considerably below the 8 percent or more anticipated not long ago. For its part, the Bank of England initially continued to press for policy tightening, and the August Inflation Report observed that delay in taking action could ultimately result in interest rates going higher than otherwise. More recently, the Bank has said that prospects for observing the 2 l/2 percent inflation target had improved and the case for an immediate tightening had become progressively less pressing. The authorities observed that the weakness of sterling in the first half of 1995 was an important factor in the near term inflation outlook. They did not feel that the depreciation was warranted by economic fundamentals, and would be happy to see sterling's effective rate return to its early 1995 level. At the same time, they agreed with the staff that it would not be prudent to formulate monetary policy on the basis of inflation prospects implied by an assumed appreciation. The authorities expressed continued satisfaction with the operation of the monetary policy framework. Both Treasury and Bank of England representatives emphasized that the opening of the policy process to public scrutiny (see Box 2) had enhanced accountability and the effectiveness of decision-making. Moreover, the process made clear the technical economic basis for interest rate decisions and, by doing so, had gone some way toward depoliticizing monetary policy--as was clear from the public reception of the three interest rate increases of the past year. The authorities felt that the revelation in the published minutes (Appendix II) of disagreement between the Chancellor and the Governor was a strength rather than a weakness, and they noted that markets had reacted calmly. They also made clear that moves toward central bank independence, including operational autonomy for the Bank of England in setting interest rates, would not be contemplated at least during the current Parliament. Regarding European monetarv union (EMU), the authorities noted that the decision time as to whether to exercise the United Kingdom's opt-out provision in the Maastricht Treaty would not be until late 1997. The economic debate on United Kingdom participation was well exemplified by the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - Box 2. Monetary Policy--Procedures and Transparency Features Since the adoption of an inflation targeting framework in October 1992, the United Kingdom authorities have introduced new procedures designed to enhance the transparency of monetary policy. In particular. from early 1994 they have published the minutes of the regular meetings at which the Chancellor makes decisions on monetary policy. Each month the stance of monetary policy is reviewed in a process that culmiaatcs in a meeting behveen the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England. The Bank of England’s mandate is to advise on the stance of interest rates required to observe the official tug& for inflation two years ahead (allowing for transmission lags). To this end, the Bank publishes each quarter an Inflation Report which features an ab initio assessment of inflation prospects--feahwing a central inflation forecast and an evaluation of risks--and provides the framework for updates of the Bank’s assessment at the monthly meetings in the interim. (The Bank does not, however, publish the macroeconomic forecast that underpins its assessment of the inflation outlook.) The Treasury’s monthly assessment is cast in terms of a detailed analysis of B broad range of real and financial indicators of inflation, on which factual information is published in the Monthly Monetary Report. These aescssments are compared and reviewed at a meeting of Treasury and Bank senior staff, ahead of the meeting behveen the Chancellor end Governor. Minutes of the policy meeting are published hvo weeks after the subsequent meeting, i.e., with a lag of about six w&s. The minutes describe: the staff-level discussions; the Governor’s presentation, including his policy recommendation, in the meeting with the Chancellor; the Chancellor’s assessment; points made by others in discussion; and the Chancellor’s decision. The published documents--the Inflation Report, the Monthly Monetaty Report, and the minutes--show the economic basis underlying the Governor’s advice and the Chancellor’s ultimate decision. Instances of disagreement are also transparent, as shown by the minutes of the May meeting in which the Chancellor chose. not ta follow the Governor’s advice to tighten policy (Appendii II).

The authorities said that it was too early to say how the opt-out decision might turn out, but in the meantime policies would continue to be geared to ensuring observance of the convergence criteria. Whether in or out, the United Kingdom had a large stake in ensuring the success of EMU and hence favorable economic conditions in Europe. In this regard, the authorities emphasized the importance of proper convergence--both before and after the start of EMU--and expressed concern that the Treaty's provisions lack sufficient teeth to ensure this. 2. Fiscal policy The staff observed that considerable progress had been made toward putting the public finances back on a solid footing. There was, however, still a considerable way to go. Indeed, the authorities were only about halfway toward their objectives for both the actual and structural deficits, and in the first few months of 1995/96 public borrowing was running somewhat ahead of the budgeted pace. Thus, with political pressure for tax cuts mounting, the November 1995 budget, detailing plans for 1996/97 and beyond, would be critical to demonstrating the authorities' continued commitment to sound policies. With the recovery set to continue at a slack-absorbing pace and inflation subject to upside risks over the next several years, there did not seem to be an economic case for deviating from the objectives set out in the fiscal strategy (see tabulation).

As evidence of their commitment, they cited the rapid announcement of compensating measures to replace revenues lost when the scheduled increase in VAT on domestic fuels was voted down by Parliament, I/ and the reductions in medium-term cash expenditure ceilings in the November 1994 budget, which went somewhat beyond what had been required to offset lower-than-expected inflation. Further progress towards medium-term fiscal goals hinges on successful exuenditure restraint. The authorities' strategy features a nominal "control total" on noncyclical, noninterest spending set in the November budget for the following three fiscal years. On the authorities' current inflation projections, the spending plans announced in November 1994-- recently reconfirmed by Cabinet in preparation for the upcoming budget-- imply real growth in control total spending of only about l/4 percent per annum during 1995/96-1997/98. Beyond this, the goal was to hold real spending growth to 1 percent per annum. These rates would be below the 2 percent average of the past three years. The authorities have taken significant steps to help contain spending within the announced limits. Departments have been subject since 1994 to a freeze on their running costs. Cuts in staffing levels (8 percent over two years) have contained personnel costs both directly and indirectly, through the moderating impact of lesser job security on civil service wage settlements. In 1993, the Government initiated "fundamental expenditure reviews" to be conducted in each department within five years. In most cases completed to date, these reviews have assessed departmental spending from a.zero-based budgeting perspective and have identified measures that have begun to generate savings. However, the authorities also pointed to a number of area where spending pressures could develop. Social security spending, which accounts for more than a quarter of the total, is dominated by demand-led entitlements and had persistently been underestimated. Measures had been taken to limit take-up of the fastest growing benefits, by reforming housing benefits, tightening medical eligibility for long-term disability benefits, and replacing unemployment benefits (from October 1996) with a Jobseeker's Allowance (see below). While savings from these measures would build over time, the underlying real growth of social security spending was projected at about 1 l/2 percent per annum over the medium term. This reflected both demographic factors and the political difficulty of tackling "middle-class" entitlements--such as child benefits--that are available regardless of income Also, the Government had committed itself to higher spending on schools, in response to public concern over rising class sizes, and health I/ As part of the 1993 consolidation plan, VAT was to be levied on domestic fuels, initially at 8 percent and from April 1995 at the standard VAT rate of 17.5 percent. The second stage was voted down in December 1994 and the revenue loss recouped through higher excises on other goods.

Despite these pressures, the authorities were nonetheless confident that they could meet their announced spending commitments. There was still scope for substantial efficiency gains to be reaped from the ongoing decentralization of financial responsibility to individual agencies (soon to cover public service wage bargaining), and from use of contracting out and market-testing procedures. They noted also that the private finance initiative, launched in 1992 with the objective of increasing the efficiency of publicly-sponsored investment, had increasingly come to be viewed also as a means to reduce public sector outlays. The authorities acknowledged, however, that there was little if any scope for cutting spending below targeted levels. On the tax side, the discussions focused on the Government's intentions regarding possible income tax cuts and the scope for offsetting measures. The United Kingdom representatives explained that tax policy is geared to further reducing distortions and that recent measures to raise revenue had accordingly focused on broadening the tax base lJ rather than raising tax rates. In the same spirit, the Government was committed to reducing the standard rate of income tax (presently 25 percent) in due course to 20 percent, which would cost about 1 l/2 percent of GDP. The VAT base remains relatively narrow, but the parliamentary defeat over domestic fuels suggested that further efforts to broaden it would encounter strong political opposition. They also observed that there had recently been a tendency to overestimate the effective yield of VAT for what appeared to be structural, rather than cyclical reasons (namely, shifts in the composition of spending and underestimation of the cost of certain VAT-related reliefs). It is too early to say whether these factors have also contributed to the weakness of revenues early in 1995/96. Given the outlook for expenditure and the uncertain prospects for indirect taxes, the staff questioned whether there was room to cut income taxes without compromising objectives for the PSBR. The authorities indicated that there would be no tax cuts in the forthcoming budget unless these could be afforded in terms of public borrowing'being on a downward profile, below the Maastricht ceiling, and headed toward balance. The authorities also observed that fiscal easing would (other things being equal) imply a need to tighten monetary policy if inflation objectives were to be observed. The rebalancing of fiscal and monetary policies undertaken in the aftermath of departure from the ERM had been appropriate, however, and there was no intention to reverse it, IJ New taxes were introduced on air travel and insurance, and the rate at which mortgage interest relief is granted against income tax was further reduced to 15 percent. As noted above, the VAT base was extended to domestic fuels. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 Regarding medium term fiscal objectives, the staff noted that while the authorities' formulation had remained unchanged--reverting "toward balance" as the economy returned to trend--the emphasis seemed to have evolved. The emphasis through last year had been on "balance," an emphasis that was echoed by figures showing a balanced PSBR once the economy was back at potential. More recently, however, more weight seemed to be placed on the "toward" in the phrase "toward balance" and on the achievements of "milestones"--the Maastricht criterion and the "golden rule" of no net public dissaving--on the way toward balance. In the staff's view, reasons of policy credibility together with the traditional ones of simplicity and transparency argued strongly for sticking to the announced objectives until they were achieved (or at least much more nearly so than they were today)-- all the more so given the widespread skepticism as to whether those objectives would weather the political cycle. From a medium term perspective, balance was admittedly more than was needed to assure sustainability of the public finances (in terms of a stable debt ratio). L/ This did not, however, in and of itself make the case (as presumed by many observers) for tax cuts. Rather, the economic benefits stemming from tax cuts needed to be weighed against those flowing from the higher rate of national saving likely to be associated with maintaining fiscal balance over the medium term. Given the relatively low rates of national saving 2J and long-term growth in the United Kingdom J/, the return to such a strategy might be substantial and argued against deviating from the fiscal objectives already in place. The authorities agreed that a clearer articulation of economic objectives would be needed as the PSBR was brought down to low levels along the announced path, but emphasized that their objective remained that of bringing the PSBR back toward balance as the economy reverted to trend. lJ On present plans, the debt ratio would peak at just below 50 percent in 1995/96 (see Chart 1). With a zero PSBR, the debt ratio would decline by about 2 percentage points per annum. 2/ As shown in Chart 3, national saving is currently about 15 percent of GDP in the United Kingdom, about three percentage points below other EU countries and some five percentage points less than in the rest of the G-7. As indicated in Chapter V of the May 1995 World Economic Outlook (Chart 28), higher rates of saving in individual countries have typically been associated with higher rate.s of long-term per capita income growth. J/ OECD per capita income estimates show the United Kingdom in sixteenth place amongst the OECD membership as of 1993, down from eleventh place in 1970. Looking forward, WE0 projections show the United Kingdom's growth of potential output per worker remaining slightly below that of other G-7 countries in Europe, partly reflecting a relatively lower rate of capital accumulation. Fixed capital formation averaged 16 l/2 percent of GDP in the United Kingdom during 1990-94, compared with 18 l/2 percent in Italy, 20 percent in France, and 22 percent in Germany.

Other issues u The authorities' approach to labor market reform has focused on removing restrictions, increasing the ability of the unemployed to compete in the labor market, encouraging investment in skills, and reducing non wage labor costs. The reforms were spearheaded by legislation in the early 1980s that reduced union power and encouraged decentralized wage determination. 2/ The authorities pointed to a number of indicators of improved performance following the reforms: manufacturing productivity growth had accelerated; employment now responded more flexibly to changes in output; and both unemployment and the share of long-term unemployment in the total had peaked at lower levels in the recent recession than in the previous one. Long-term unemployment (currently just over one third of the total) was nevertheless still too high. Recent initiatives had therefore focused on improvements in education and training and on enhancing labor market prospects for the long-term unemployed. 3J Labor market measures in the November 1994 budget included extension of job search and work experience schemes and new pilot schemes to reduce the cost of hiring the long-term unemployed; steps were being taken to reduce high marginal rates of benefit withdrawal (for families with children), and the jobseeker's allowance to be introduced in 1996 (replacing unemployment benefit) would shorten the period of income-related benefit from 12 to 6 months. The staff representatives inquired about steps to strengthen && suuervision in the wake of the collapse of Barings in early 1995. The Bank of England representatives stressed that no system of supervision could be expected to prevent all bank failures--especially where malfeasance was involved--but clearly there was always scope for improvement. Subsequent to the discussions, the Bank's Board of Banking Supervision released its report on the Barings episode. This report concluded that while no fundamental changes in the framework of regulation was required, there was scope for improving the Bank of England's conduct of consolidated supervision of banking groups so that it will be better able to identify activities capable of posing material risks to the bank and its depositors, and for strengthening enforcement of exposure limits. Official develoument assistance (ODA) has been equivalent to 0.3 percent of GNP in recent years, compared with an average of over 0.5 percent for other major DAC donors in Europe.

Staff Appraisal Over the past year, the United Kingdom economy has maintained a favorable course. The upswing has continued, unemployment has declined further, and domestic inflationary pressures have remained modest. Domestic demand has recently become subdued in response to policy tightening, and exports have mirrored the slowing of some foreign markets. The resulting pause in above-trend expansion should, however, prove temporary. The fundamentals are in place both for a strengthening of domestic demand as policies exert less braking force and for a resumption of robust export growth. External demand conditions have been supportive, and the economy has been going through a favorable phase of the cycle. Nonetheless, a sound policy framework should be given due credit for the performance of the economy. Indeed, the recent conduct of policies by the United Kingdom-pre- emptive monetary tightening, using the recovery to strengthen the public finances, and further structural reform--has been fully consistent with the principles underlying the Madrid Declaration, and an example for others to follow. This strategy should be maintained, with policies holding fast to the established medium-term course and pre-election pressures resisted. To do otherwise would jeopardize the considerable but fragile gains in reputation made to date. Following the announced course will also support observance of the Maastricht convergence criteria and the authorities' goal of being in a position to exercise their option regarding participation in EMU. The November budget is crucial to the demonstration of firm adherence to the medium-term strategy. Public borrowing has been reduced significantly, but the starting point was highly unfavorable and there is still a considerable way to go before medium-term fiscal goals are achieved. Moreover, recent data suggest that the decline in public borrowing may have faltered. Against this background, any slippage in the budget from announced commitments for reducing the structural component of the PSBR would be costly to policy credibility. Tax cuts that increase the PSBR would kindle concerns in financial markets of a return to the boom-and-bust cycles of the past, as they would boost demand just as the upswing is likely to be strengthening. To meet inflation objectives, fiscal easing would imply a need for a tighter monetary policy than otherwise, with undesirable implications for investment. Moreover, tax cuts once in place would be perceived as permanent, with lasting implications for the public finances. The staff would therefore advise against cuts in direct taxes in the November budget unless their impact on the envisaged path for the PSBR can Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - be fully offset by other measures--additional spending restraint or higher indirect taxation. The feasibility of these offsetting measures, however, is not apparent. On the spending side, commendable progress has been made in curtailing running costs, raising efficiency, and putting in place measures to curb growth of social security transfers. Despite the likely further contributions af the fundamental reviews and the prospects for reducing capital spending offered by the private finance initiative, upward pressures will continue. Observing the control total for 1995/96 will be a significant challenge, as will keeping to the announced tight limits for the following years. The scope for holding spending down further in the coming budget, to make room for tax cuts, thus appears minimal. On the tax side, there is in principle scope for broadening the base of VAT to compensate for revenue losses that would be associated with cuts in direct taxes. The priority area, in terms of reducing tax-induced economic distortions, would be further reductions in marginal effective rates for low-income taxpayers. Lowering marginal rates of income tax across the spectrum should also have some beneficial incentive effects. In any event, steps to reduce taxes should not be at the cost of announced objectives for the PSBR. As the PSBR is reduced, public attention will increasingly focus on the appropriate medium-term goal of fiscal policy. There will be a need to articulate more fully the economic basis of medium-term fiscal goals-- notably the benefits of raising the public sector's contribution to the relatively low rate of national saving. In this connection, use of the "golden rule" in the formulation and assessment of policy is to be discouraged. As returns on public assets do not necessarily accrue to the Government, this rule does not assure sustainability of the public finances; moreover, experience elsewhere shows that it can be vulnerable to misuse by reclassifying current outlays as investment. The pre-emptive tightening of monetary policy over the past year was well-judged, and a testament to the effectiveness of the new policy framework. Current indicators are mixed, and a clearer picture is needed before taking action; but if, as expected, the recovery strengthens anew, a bias toward further tightening remains appropriate. In particular, it will be critical to the achievement of inflation objectives to ensure that external cost increases do not trigger domestic cost pressures. Given these considerations and the comfortable external and competitive positions, a reversion of sterling's effective rate toward early 1995 levels would not be unwelcome. The authorities' commitment to aim on a continuing basis at inflation of 2 l/2 percent or less, two years ahead, and to set interest rates accordingly, is welcome. To avoid any risk of misperception of this Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - commitment, it would be desirable in describing the framework to maintain the focus on this policy goal rather than on the range of possible outturns. Within the current institutional structure in the United Kingdom, the transparency of the monetary framework has been a considerable success. The publication of minutes, in particular, has enhanced accountability and honed policy formation. Should responsibility for monetary policy decisions be transferred, in line with Fund advice, to the central bank--with the goal of institutionally delinking policy from possible political influence--it would be desirable to retain the emphasis on transparency. It would also be desirable to explore other policy areas where additional transparency measures could prove beneficial; examples include publication of structural measures of the fiscal position and of the macroeconomic forecast underlying the Bank of England's Inflation Report. The United Kingdom has given a lead in structural reforms of the labor market. Evidence of the positive impact of these reforms is accumulating, and the absence of wage acceleration in the current upswing is encouraging. The labor market initiatives of the last budget are welcome, and should be extended with a view to further improving the labor market prospects of the long-term unemployed and raising the level of potential future output. The manner in which the Barings crisis was resolved, without the aid of public funds, should reinforce market discipline for United Kingdom financial institutions. That a failure of this size caught supervisors by surprise suggests that the authorities should now move quickly to remedy weaknesses in the implementation of bank supervision related to the Barings episode. Specific measures should include improved internal risk-management in major financial institutions, improved accounting and disclosure standards, greater use of on-site supervision, and improved international coordination among regulators. The authorities' continued commitment to liberal trade policies is WelCOlllL?. The authorities are encouraged to increase their ODA toward the UN target of 0.7 percent of GNP.

The authorities publish a full range of economic and financial data. Recent data issues have concerned trade statistics--in common with other EU countries, the United Kingdom experienced transitional difficulties associated with the adoption of the Intrastat system--and employment data, where separate surveys have been giving occasLonally conflicting information about trends in employment and its composition. Following a recent Cabinet reorganisation, responsibility for employment data previously with the Department of Employment is being transferred to the Central Statistical Office.

Mav 5. 1995 The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England met, together with officials, on 5 May 1995 to review monetary developments. Monetarv and economic develouments The latest monetary and economic information (reviewed by officials before the meeting) provided further signs that growth was slowing to a more sustainable rate. Inflation remained subdued at the retail level, despite continuing cost pressures. Summarv of discussion The Governor thought that, as in the previous month, there were three aspects of the current situation that needed to be concentrated on: - the shorter-term cost and price pressures; - the pace of, and prospect for, the growth of activity, and the implications that this might have for inflation over the next two years; and - the continued softness of the exchange rate. . . Given everything else known about the economy, the persistence of the exchange rate at the current level had caused the Bank to revise upwards their expectation for inflation over the next two years. On their best guess, and on the conventional assumption of unchanged interest rates, RPIX inflation was expected to peak at 3-4 per cent by next summer, although moderating thereafter, but still in the upper half of the target range by the spring of 1997. The Inflation Report would be published on Thursday of the next week. The policy decision was always of course a matter of balancing risks, and there were three dimensions of risk to consider. First, there was the risk of higher inflation on the one hand or economic overkill on the other. In the Bank's view--reflected in their inflation forecast--the balance of these risks in the present situation was clear. A point might well be reached in the course of the year when the question became--as in the U.S.--whether policy had been tightened sufficiently; but that point had not been reached yet. The inflationary risk was substantial, and considerably greater in his view than the risk that the expansion would be cut off, and the potential damage from accelerating inflation was likely in the end to be greater because it would simply halt the expansion a bit further down the road.

Given this country's history, inflation expectations and inflation itself were likely to accelerate because of that. This would risk undermining the best prospect of sustained, non-inflationary growth for ages. And there would be a price to pay for that too in the longer-term in terms of a higher uncertainty premium on interest rates. Third, there was an immediate market risk that the exchange rate would fall, perhaps sharply, if the expected interest rate rise was not forthcoming. Market expectations did not always have to be responded to. In fact since policy started to be tightened last September, market expectations about the future course of interest rates had been reduced (from 9 per cent to below 8 per cent for the 3-month interbank rate at end- December 1995, for example). But, in the present situation, if the exchange rate were to fall sharply in the wake of a failure to move interest rates, there could well be significant upward pressure on rates which in the end would be difficult to resist. The danger was that the authorities would be obliged to move more abruptly--as they had typically had to do in the past-- and that the peak in rates would, as a result, be higher than would otherwise have been necessary. The Governor concluded that the Bank's view on all this was quite clear. On the balance of risks he was bound to advise that interest rates be increased by b per cent now. If this did not happen, the authorities could be faced very quickly with a loss of credibility and a very difficult market situation. While it was never possible to be sure about the market reaction, that was not a risk he could advise the Chancellor to take. The Chancellor thought that the decision was finely balanced, perhaps more so than the Governor had suggested. The data over the previous month had shown a particularly unclear and sometimes inconsistent picture of developments in the economy. It was possible to present a credible case for either an increase in interest rates or no change at all. In the Chancellor's view, there was clear evidence that growth had been slowing down to a more sustainable rate. Previous meetings had identified the manufacturing sector as a major source of inflationary pressure, but the latest evidence showed a slowdown in manufacturing growth. Indeed, manufacturing output had shown little growth since last September. It was possible that these figures could be revised up, but even if they were, it was unlikely to change the overall picture to any great extent. Although some survey data pointed to more buoyant activity in manufacturing, it was not clear cut. There were also signs that retail sales growth had been very restrained over the past previous six months. Retail sales were now just 1.5 per cent higher than a year ago. Furthermore, the housing market remained subdued. There was little sign of demand-led inflation pressures.

Indeed in some areas the pressures had abated slightly. World commodity prices had fallen back slightly in recent months, and the expectations of price increases shown in the CBI survey had also fallen. Furthermore, average earnings growth remained unchanged. Against this, there were some worrying signs of continued cost pressure, particularly the ongoing growth of input prices. The effect of a weaker exchange rate also had to be taken into account, although sterling was now about the same level as a month ago. Expectations in financial markets of an increase in interest rates appeared to have derived from the surprising strength of GDP growth in the first quarter of the year. With manufacturing subdued, this growth was mainly due to the performance of the service sector. In the Chancellor's view, care should be taken not to place too much emphasis on this single figure. Anecdotal evidence did not suggest that the service sector was growing as rapidly as the statistics suggested. Furthermore, 0.1 per cent of the quarterly growth could be accounted for by the National Lottery. Abstracting from this, the quarterly growth rate in Ql was equivalent to an annual rate of around 2.8 per cent. In the Chancellor's view, it was not clear that such a rate of growth was unsustainable. There were also a number of temporary factors that should be taken into eccount, in particular the boost to agricultural production from the unexpectedly good weather in the first quarter of the year. In addition, interest rates had already been raised three times since last September and further tax increases had taken effect in April. It was unlikely that all the effects of these policy measures would have been felt yet, so they would continue to influence the outlook for some time yet. Taking all of this together, the Chancellor was not convinced that interest rates should be raised that month. His judgement was based on a broad assessment of all the economic data, rather than market expectations. The financial markets had shown a tendency to over-estimate the level of interest rates required to meet the Government's inflation target. If interest rates were to be raised simply to match market expectation, then they could rise above the level required to meet the policy objective. In his judgement, with the data so unclear at the moment, the balance of risks was that an interest rate increase now would result in a tighter policy stance than was necessary to meet the inflation objective, and depress activity further when it was already slowing, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - APPENDIX III Privatization and External Trade Policies 1. Privatization The United Kingdom has taken a lead in privatization since the early 198Os, and most major former public corporations and utilities are now in the private sector. Privatization of the railway infrastructure is planned for spring 1996, at which time the complex process of privatizing regional operating franchises is to be initiated. Recently the Government decided to privatize nuclear power generation, which is the only remaining sector of the power industry still in public hands. 2. External trade Dolicies Trade policies are conducted within the framework of the European Union. The United Kingdom ratified the Treaty establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 1994, and fully supports its principles and objectives. The Government was active in seeking a successful conclusion to the negotiations on financial services (where interim agreement was reached in July 1995). Particular attention is being paid to reducing remaining barriers to trade through use of WTO dispute settlement procedures and pressing for the WTO to continue negotiating disciplines on barriers not yet outlawed by its rules. In Europe, the United Kingdom is working to ensure that Europe Agreements with countries to the east set the pace toward free trade, particularly for those that are candidates for accession to the EU. The authorities noted that the pace of EU enlargement would depend on the speed with which the accession candidates could move toward compatibility with the requirements of the single market and the existing members could reform the system of Structural and Cohesion Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). On the CAP, the United Kingdom would continue to press for reforms oriented towards meeting its objectives through targeted programs rather than high support prices.
