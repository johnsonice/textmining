Artus and Jan van Houten March 22, 1995 I. Introduction A staff team consisting of Messrs. Vittas, Corker and Griffiths, Ms. Meehan (all EUl) and Ms. Emerson (EUl, assistant) visited Copenhagen during January 20-30, 1995 to conduct the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions. Meetings were held with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank, senior officials of these institutions, the Ministry of Finance and other agencies, and representatives of the trade unions, employers' federation and banking sector. Mr. Andersen, Executive Director's Office, attended most of the meetings. Denmark has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The last consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 7, 1994 (EBM/94/9). On that occasion, Directors shared staff doubts that the budding economic recovery would be strong enough to reduce unemployment significantly. In this context, several Directors thought that monetary conditions remained relatively tight and were concerned that the unduly large fiscal stimulus planned for 1994 might limit the scope for interest rate cuts. Since the Board meeting, it has become apparent that the pace of recovery is much stronger than earlier expected. A coalition Government led by the Social Democrats remained in power after elections on September 21, 1994, although it no longer enjoys a majority in Parliament. II. Background and Prospects For much of the period since the early-1980s, policies have been oriented toward eliminating large domestic and external financial imbalances in the economy. A cornerstone of the strategy has been a hard currency policy in the context of the ERM, but support in the early years from an ambitious program of fiscal consolidation and, later, from tax measures to moderate private borrowing also played an important role. The policy approach has transformed Denmark from a high-inflation to a low-inflation country and has contributed to an easing of private sector debt burdens and a turnaround in the external accounts to sizable current account surpluses, following 30 years of persistent deficits. Moreover, the public finances strengthened markedly during the 198Os, although large deficits have been allowed to re-emerge in recent years.

Nevertheless, in the period 1987-93, growth fell well short of potential (estimated at around 2 percent a year) as a strong export performance was counter'balanced by stagnant domestic demand (Chart 2). As a result, unemployment rose to over 12 percent of the labor force by 1993. The prolonged period of slow growth came to an end in the second half of 1993 and Denmark has since been enjoying a robust upswing. In 1994, real GDP is estimated to have grown by about 4 l/2 percent, led by consumer spending, which rose by nearly 7 percent. lJ There was also a pick up in plant and machinery investment during 1994 and, partly reflecting improving conditions in European markets, a firming of export growth. Nevertheless, the external sector made a negative ccntrihution to GDP growth as the revival of domestic demand led to a steep rise in imports. By December 1994, the unemployment rate had fallen to 10.9 percent and capacity utilization in manufacturing was above its medium-term average. 2/ Inflation, however, remained at a low level: although it picked LQJ to just over 2 percent on a 12-month basis in late 1994, from 1 l/4 percent on average in 1993, much of the increase reflected higher indirect taxes rather than an increase in the underlying inflation rate. The current account surplus declined to about 2 l/2 percent .of GDP in 1994, from 3 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993, as imports responded strongly to buoyant domestic demand (Table 1 and Chart 3). At the same time, net private capital outflows largely dried up, after having greatly exceeded the current account surplus in 1993, and the Government repaid some of the foreign borrowing which it had earlier used to bolster the external reserves position. Fiscal policy was assigned an active demand management role in the past two years. In addition to the operation of the automatic stabilizers, several measures were ta&n to stimulate demand during 1993. With growth prospects remaining uncert,ain when the 1994 budget was finalized, this policy was continued in 19'94. s/ As a consequence, the structural deficit of the general government is estimated to have risen by over 1 percent of GDP. However, because of favorable cyclical effects, ~1:~: aLzual deficit remained broadly unchanged at 4 l/4 percent of GDP (Chart 4). I/ Note 1 in Appendix I discusses the main factors behind the turnaround in consumer spending. 2/ Due to the initial perverse effects of new labor market programs in 1994, unemployment remained stuck at 12 l/4 percent until late summer 1994 before subsequently falling sharply. See Appendix I, Note 2 for details. J/ In particular, an income tax CU:, which formed part of a medium-term tax reform entailing a shift from direct to indirect taxation, was deliberately underfunded in an effort to boost consumer and business confidence.

After the speculative currency attack of August 1993, official short-term interest rates were reduced considerably during the remainder of 1993 and, more slowly, in the first half of 1994. However, in line with unchanged official interest rates in Germany, the National Bank's rate on repurchase agreements (the repo rate) was fixed at 5.5 percent during the second half of 1994 and 3-month market interest rates settled at about 6 percent. Throughout most of 1994, the krone remained just outside its previous 2 l/4 percent lower intervention level against the deutsche mark, but since late 1994 it weakened in the face of overall deutsche mark strength (Chart 5) promptin? a rise in official interest rates in March 1995. Danish long-term bond yields rose steeply during 1994. to about 9 percent after beginning the year at a historical low (Chart 6). While mirroring global developments, the rise in Danish bond yields exceeded that in Germany. The spread-- though still low by historical standards- -stood at 175 basis points in early March 1995 after having been below 50 basis points in January 1994. The official forecast calls for real GDP to rise by 3.7 percent in 1995 after an estimated 4.6 percent increase in 1994. Although economic growth would slow to 3 percent in 1996, by then it would have exceeded potential for three years and the unemployment rate would have fallen below 10 per- cent. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to remain subdued as it is assumed that ongoing labor market reforms will gradually reduce the rate of structural unemployment (estimated to be 9-10 percent at present). u For the medium term, the authorities assume that the structural unemployment rate will fall further to 7 l/2 percent by the year 2000. Together with high productivity growth, this would allow medium-term growth to average 2 3/4 percent a year without fueling inflation. The current account would remain in comfortable surplus. The official short-term projection, which is broadly in line with recent private sector forecasts and those of the Danish Economic Council, appears realistic in light of the current high level of consumer and business confidence and the strengthening of the recovery in continental Europe. The main risk is that continued rapid growth may contribute to an escalation of wage inflation and/or the re-emergence of supply bottlenecks which, in turn, could lead to a pick-up in inflation. In this regard, the staff is inclined to be less sanguine than the authorities partly because it believes that hysteresis effects during the long period of weak growth may have raised structural unemployment and partly because it is concerned that the speed with which slack is being absorbed may contribute to cost and l/ Consumer price inflation is projected to rise to 2.4 percent in 1995 and 1996, but mainly because of increases in indirect taxes and import prices.

Accordingly, it projects average growth over the 1996-2000 period to be roughly in line with potential at about 2 percent per year (see Note 3 to Appendix I). III. Policv Discussions With Denmark enjoying one of the strongest recoveries in continental Europe, the discussions focused on two complementary issues: the role demand management policies should play in ensuring the sustainability of robust economic growth and the scope for labor market reforms to alleviate supply constraints.. 1. Fiscal policy The authorities recalled that the medium-term strategy adopted in 1993 entailed a large fiscal stimulus in 1994, which was to be gradually but fully reversed over the subsequent few years. In combination with the favorable outcome of the second referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and the steep fall in interest rates in 1993, the strategy had succeeded in boosting confidence, and growth had accelerated well beyond expectations. The focus of fiscal policy had now switched back to consolidation. Thus, in accordance with the original intentions of the strategy, a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP had been targeted for 1995. This was to be obtained mainly through increases in indirect taxes and social security contributions and a reduction in public investment. As a result of‘these measures and the operation of automatic stabilizers, the general government deficit was projected to fall to 2.5 percent of GDP, implying that the deficit criterion of the Maastricht Treaty would comfortably be met (see tabulation below). 1/ Early settlements in the 1995-96 wage round appear reasonably moderate as they,imply increases in basic wage rates averaging about 3 percent per year/ However, wage bargaining has become increasingly decentralized in recent years and the potential for wage drift is high.

While the strategy had so far paid good dividends, the staff observed that, with hindsight, the stimulus in 1994 had been excessive. In light of the sharp increase in the structural deficit, the staff welcomed the shift in the policy stance in 1995 but wondered whether the envisaged modest withdrawal of stimulus would prove adequate to moderate the growth of demand to a sustainable pace. It enquired, therefore, whether there would be scope to adjust further the fiscal stance should evidence of pressures on resources become widespread or, more generally, should economic growth continue to exceed prudent "speed limits". The authorities conceded that the opportunity to achieve a substantial improvement in the fiscal accounts in 1994 had been missed, but noted that this was largely because clear evidence that unemployment had begun to fall emerged only late in the year. As regards 1995, the authorities believed that the stance adopted was appropriate. There was still significant slack in the economy, as indicated by the fact that unemployment remained above its estimated structural level, and only a few isolated instances of bottlenecks had so far emerged (notably in the building and construction sectors). lJ Nevertheless, the Government was determined to avoid a repetition of the experience of the mid-1980s when the previous economic boom had collapsed with the onset of inflation and balance of payments pressures. Accordingly, the authorities would not hesitate to tighten I/ In order to help address these bottlenecks the 1995 budget had discontinued a scheme that provided subsidies for house maintenance and repair work. In addition, some measure,s were being considered to delay the execution of local authority projects. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - policy further should the wage round turn out to be less favorable than expected or bottlenecks become widespread. Officials explained that the scope for cutbacks in expenditure in 1995 would be limited but measures on the revenue side could be taken, if needed, even though parliamentary approval would be required. In particular, it should prove possible to bring forward the implementation of planned increases in indirect taxes. The authorities added that the attention of fiscal planners had already begun to turn to the 1996 budget. In light of the strength of the economic expansion there was some concern that capacity limits could by then be reached. Accordingly, current thinking favored a policy stance entailing a withdrawal of stimulus equivalent to about l/2 percent of GDP, somewhat higher than originally planned. The authorities did not believe that it would be helpful to announce at this stage their 1996 fiscal intentions, but had repeatedly stressed that there was a trade off between fiscal policy and developments in the wage round. Of course, since the budget would not be proposed to Parliament until August 1995, there would be plenty of time to take stock of the evolving economic situation. The staff recognized that it was too early to decide on the precise stance of fiscal policy for 1996, especially since major uncertainties still remained regarding the 1995-96 wage round and the degree of economic slack. However, it noted that the balance of probability was that capacity constraints would intensify. It was therefore crucial for the authorities to be prepared to accelerate the pace of fiscal retrenchment in 1996, even beyond what was currently regarded as desirable. The authorities' medium-term fiscal objective, as articulated in Denmark's EMU Convergence Plan, is to achieve a small surplus in the general government accounts over the course of the business cycle. This would allow the public debt burden to fall markedly over the next 15 years (when demographic factors will be favorable) and would imply that Denmark would be well placed to meet budgetary pressures stemming from the subsequent ageing of the population. lJ The official budgetary projections hinge critically on ,the assumption that structural unemployment would fall gradually to 7 l/2 percent by the end of the decade and that real GDP would grow at an average annual rate of close to 3 percent per year. In conjunction with restraint on real public consumption growth (assumed to average 0.8 percent a year) and the implementation of the remainder of the 1994 tax reform package, these assumptions would ensure that the fiscal accounts would move into surplus by 1998. The staff expressed support for the authorities' medium-term objectives but questioned the underlying assumptions. It therefore inquired whether the authorities would be prepared to take additional measures in pursuit of their objectives if structural unemployment failed to fall as markedly as assumed or if growth fell short of expectations. The staff also asked lJ Expected demographic trends are discussed in Appendix I, Note 6. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - whether the authorities anticipated pressures for expenditure savings to be used to cut the still relatively high tax burden, rather than the deficit. The authorities acknowledged that the central scenario in the Convergence Plan was normative in the sense that it assumed that substantial (but as yet unspecified) measures would be taken to lower structural unemployment. However, an alternative scenario showed that even if the fall in structural unemployment did not materialize, the fiscal deficit would decline to only about 1 percent of GDP by 1998. u This would be viewed as a satisfactory outcome as it would be consistent with a rapid decline in the public debt ratio. Therefore, the government would not be inclined to take compensatory measures in pursuit of a surplus. Regarding tax policy,, the authorities noted that marginal income tax rates had been reduced significantly under the recent tax reform and that, as a result, there were no strong pressures for tax cuts. At the same time, payroll taxes were still low and were not perceived as inhibiting job creation. For these reasons, officials did not believe that the supply-side gains of further tax reductions would outweigh those of deficit reduction. Rather, tax policy would be used to pursue environmental objectives and it was likely that new taxes on corporate energy use would be announced this year. While the revenue raised would be recycled back to the corporate sector by way of cuts in other taxes or social security contributions, the authorities acknowledged that there could be a small adverse impact on the competitiveness of the energy-intensive export sector. However, this was a risk worth taking in view of the wider benefits to the environment. The authorities expressed frustration at the slow progress within the EU toward agreement on common green tax policies. 2. Monetary nolicv The authorities stressed that monetary policy remained firmly oriented toward maintaining exchange rate stability against the core ERM currencies on the basis of existing parities. They added, however, that the National Bank had no informal band within the 15 percent band nor a precise limit for the degree of exchange rate volatility it was willing to accept. Indeed, with the widening of the ERM band in August 1993, it had been necessary to accept somewhat larger fluctuations in the exchange rate. Nonetheless, the National Bank's policy was to limit as much as possible deviations from the central rate and so far developments in this regard had been favorable. In line with fundamentals, the sizable depreciation of the krone that occurred in the aftermath of the second ERM crisis had been quickly reversed and it had been possible to replenish reserves and lower interest rates in several steps, with the spread vis-a-vis German rates narrowing markedly. During 1994, the reflow of capital and rebuilding of reserves had stopped but the lJ The staff's baseline medium-term projection, which assumes no fall in the rate of structural unemployment, reaches the same broad conclusion. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - krone had been broadly stable and the National Bank had generally followed the interest rate policies of its ERM partners. The staff acknowledged that policy had succeeded in maintaining broad stability in the foreign exchange market and shared the authorities' view that monetary conditions, as indicated for example by the high level of interest rates in inflation-adjusted terms, were not unduly lax. Nevertheless, the staff observed that in 1994, short-term interest rate differentials with Germany had widened and that the yield curve had steepened markedly as the rise in long-term interest rates in Denmark had exceeded that in some other financial markets. Moreover, the yield gap between conventional and indexed bonds had also increased perceptibly. The staff wondered whether these developments were cause for concern insofar as they seemed to indicate that markets anticipated that inflation in Denmark might accelerate. The authorities saw several reasons for the persistence of comparatively high interest rate differentials with Germany. These included the uncertainty generated by Denmark's decision not to participate in Stage III of European monetary union and the backwash from financial developments in some other Nordic countries. Nevertheless, it could not be denied that the market's assessment of the inflation outlook was less sanguine than their own. This might be attributed to unwarranted pessimism about the wage round but also uncertainties associated with the fact that Denmark had yet to establish a track record of maintaining low inflation in a period of buoyant economic growth. The authorities were confident that they would succeed, in time, in dispelling these uncertainties and that the risk premia on Danish interest rates would then decline. However, they thought it unlikely that premia would fall to negligible levels until the question of Denmark's exchange rate arrangement in a future EMU had been resolved. The staff noted that, with the widening of the ERM band, the basis on which decisions over the timing and size of interest rate changes were taken had become more ambiguous, and asked whether the authorities were now attaching any weight to indicators other than the exchange rate. In this context, the staff also asked whether, given the comparatively advanced stage of Denmark's economic recovery and the inflationary threat if the wage round turned unfavorable, the authorities would contemplate raising interest rates ahead of other core ERM countries. The authorities explained that other indicators, including the monetary aggregates, were monitored closely but were not playing an important role in guiding policy, especially because they often provided contradictory signals. As for the period ahead, the authorities said that, in view of the strength of the recovery, it was likely that any increase in German rates would be followed immediately. However, it was difficult to foresee circumstances in which the need for independent action on interest rates might arise. If wage settlements proved excessive, interest rates would probably have to be raised, but only because this in itself would likely be reflected in downward pressure on the exchange rate. However, the main Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - policy response would be a tightening of fiscal policy. Similarly, if the krone came under pressure due to some other factor, their inclination also would be to raise interest rates. Looking ahead, the staff inquired what response was planned in the event that a core group of countries went ahead with Stage III of EMU. The authorities stated that Denmark had informed its European partners that it did not envisage being able to participate in Stage III. While the Maastricht treaty did not specify formal arrangements for ERM currencies outside a future EMU, the authorities hoped that it would be possible to establish a narrow band arrangement between the Danish krone and the future European currency. They believed that a narrowing of the present ERM margins before the move to Stage III would increase the feasibility of such an arrangement. It would also reduce the potential for excessive exchange rate volatility in the meantime: with wide bands, active use of monetary policy to offset.temporary pressures ran the risk of highlighting problems rather than solving them. Following the conclusion of the discussions, the krone depreciated against the deutsche mark in the context of general deutsche mark strength both within the ERM and against other major currencies. By early March, it had slipped to about 7 percent below its central rate against the mark. In response, the National Bank raised its discount rate from 5 percent to 6 percent, and its rate on certificates of deposits and repurchase agreements from 5 l/2 percent to 7 percent, amid similar moves by some other ERM-member countries. The National Bank commented that the increase in interest rates was in line with Denmark's exchange rate policy. Moreover, with the development of the Danish economy deemed satisfactory, the weakening of the krone against the strongest ERM currencies was assumed to be of a temporary nature. Short-term market int'erest rates followed the rise in official rates, and in mid-March the differential with three-month money market rates in Germany had widened to about 250 basis .points. At the same time, the krone recovered some ground to stand about 5 ;percent below its central rate against the deutsche mark. This rise in interest rates should help to eliminate some of the uncertainty about the authorities' ability to keep inflation under control during a period of rapid economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in stemming undue pressure on the krone it should also help to enhance credibility of the policy framework. 3. Balance of navments and comnetitiveness The authorities were of the view that the level of the exchange rate was broadly appropriate--a conviction, which they noted at the time of the mission, had been strengthened by the krone's stability under the wider ERM bands. In this context, they observed that there had been no complaints from exporters about competitiveness, despite an earlier significant appreciation of the krone against the currencies of some important trading partners, and that the hard currency policy continued to enjoy broad Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - support. Moreover, although it had declined in 1994, the current account surplus was sizable and was projected to remain so in the medium term. This was appropriate in light of the still-high external debt burden: even after declines in the early 199Os, net external debt was estimated to have been close to 30 percent of GDP at end-1994. The staff broadly agreed with the authorities' assessment of competitiveness and the balance of payments. Its own analysis, presented in the Background Issues Paper, finds evidence that a significant structural improvement in Denmark's current account performance occurred in the late 1980s. Moreover, the present current account surplus does not appear to be an artefact of temporary factors. For one thing, Denmark's economic recovery is relatively more advanced than that of its partners, indicating that the surplus is not the product of depressed aggregate demand. For another, there are no significant lagged competitiveness effects in the pipeline: although the krone has tended to appreciate in nominal effective terms in recent years, Denmark's low wage and price inflation relative to its trading partners has kept the real effective exchange rate quite stable (Chart 5). JJ Indeed, the staff's baseline medium term projection suggests that (assuming a broadly unchanged real exchange rate and terms of trade) the surplus could even increase as the gradual erosion of the net external debt reduces Denmark's perennial deficit on net factor income. Regarding the capital account, private capital flows had been more stable in 1994 and the Government had been able to repay some of its earlier foreign borrowing. The staff also agrees that, at around 30 percent of GDP, the net external debt is high compared to other OECD countries. Thus, it shares the view that continuation of a modest current account surplus is appropriate. 4. Structural nolicies The discussions on structural policies focused mainly on how to address the problem of high structural unemnlovment. Recent official estimates suggest that since the early 1970s structural unemployment has risen by about 5 percentage points to 9-10 percent of the labor force. About half of the increase is attributed to factors that affect the equilibrium level of unemployment on a permanent basis. The most prominent of these factors is a steep rise in unemployment benefits in the 1970s and the resulting compressed structure of wage differentials. The remainder is thought to reflect hysteresis, given the lengthy period of slow economic growth, and is believed to be more easily reversible. lJ The nominal effective exchange rate remained stable through the exchange market turbulence of March this year as depreciation against the deutsche mark was offset by appreciation against the dollar and against some ERM currencies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - The authorities explained that policies to address unemployment were constrained by the Government's (and society's) distributional objectives. The Government was devoting substantial resources to active labor market policies and was constantly seeking to improve the effectiveness of these policies, at times by experimenting ,with new measures. In line with this gradualist approach, several new programs were introduced in 1993-94. These had focused on (a) reducing skills mismatches through active training policies; and (b) improving leave-of-absence schemes in order to encourage job rotation and provide the long-term unemployed with increased work experience opportunities. However, they also believed it was important to prevent workers from becoming marginalized dependents of the social security system and had announced new measures (effective April 1995) to tighten benefit eligibility requirements. In addition, the authorities were looking at ways of streamlining the many grants and work and training programs offered at the various levels of government which hitherto had made it easier for the unemployed to enter and remain in the benefits system. Finally, they were looking into measures to encourage firms to hire the long-term unemployed, on-the-job experience for the unemployed being at present almost entirely provided by public sector work programs. Job subsidies might be considered, but there were concerns about deadweight losses (i.e., subsidies paid to workers who would have found a job anyway), displacement effects and the possible stigmatization of workers. The staff recognized that the authorities' strategy might help reverse some of the hysteresis effects, provided that the government succeeded in its efforts to ensure the sustainability of the economic recovery. However, it pointed out that some of the new schemes, most notably the parental leave scheme, had proven counterproductive in as far as it had exacerbated shortages in the nursing sector and could undermine prospects for maintaining wage discipline. The staff also observed that plans to strengthen eligibility requirements were a useful first step--and should be tightly applied- -in addressing the longer-term problems of structural unemployment, but questioned whether the benefits would be large in the absence of reductions in the generosity of the benefit system and a more differentiated wage structure (Chart 7). L/ The authorities agreed that some of the leave schemes were of dubious value from the perspective of lowering unemployment and stressed that steps had been taken in the 1995 budget to reduce their attractiveness. However, there was no intention to lower unemployment benefits across-the-board as this would have to be done on a socially unacceptable scale to make a meaningful dent on structural unemployment. 2/ 1/ Replacement ratios for low paid workers are as high as 90 percent and the duration of unemployment benefits as long as 9 years. Z!/ According to research cited by the authorities, it would take a lo-15 percent reduction in benefit levels to reduce structural unemployment by 1 percentage point.

It also inquired whether it would be possible to use the 'tax system to compensate for cuts in benefits and alleviate potential unemployment and poverty traps. The authorities noted that in tlhe public sector an agreement had recently been reached with the trade unions which provided for lower introductory wages for younger emplo:yees in return for education benefits. They hoped that similar agreements m:Lght be reached in the private sector, although unions had expressed concerns about possible worker displacement effects. The authorities added, however, that their studies suggested that it was not possible to use the tax system to strengthen work incentives while maintaining an equitable distribution of income. The fiscal costs of untargeted tax relief (such as, for example, those implicit in a negative income tax system) would be prohibitive in the absence of a counter- productive increase in the progressivity of tax schedules, while the efficiency of selective tax breaks in generating net jobs was questionable. Finally, the authorities accepted that there were some poverty traps in social assistance programs (the safety net after eligibility for unemployment benefits expired). These were being looked into but progress was likely to be slow, if only because the system was very complex reflecting the wide diversity in the circumstances of beneficiaries. The authorities stressed that they continue to pursue an active agenda in several other areas of structural nolicv. They noted that they had recently implemented an important tax reform (described in the 1993 Article IV consultation documents) and, in part connected with the implementation of EU directives, had completed the liberalization of domestic and external financial markets. Ongoing projects included: a reorganization of public sector enterprises, particularly of the railways and postal services, where the objectives are to promote greater efficiency and where some partial privatization measures have been included in the 1995 budget; further financial market reform, including reform of the stock exchanges, partly with a view to retaining Copenhagen's financial services industry and helping to establish a regional center; and initiatives to increase competition in the telecommunications market and energy sectors. As mentioned in the section on fiscal policy, Denmark attaches high priority to environmental policies for which a key objective is the reduction of CO2 emissions by 20 percent in the period to 2005. 5. Trade and aid nolicie2 On trade nolicies, the authorities noted that they had calculated that the static gains to Denmark of implementation of the Uruguay Round could amount to about 1 percent of GDP. While this estimate did not include possible gains from the liberalization of services, there would be some offsetting income loss from the effects of the EU's reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Nevertheless, even though Denmark has a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - relatively large agricultural sector, the authorities recognized that further CAP reform might be necessary and were prepared to work to that end with their EU partners. Denmark also favored eastward enlargement of the EU and supports interim measures to lower trade barriers with its Eastern European partners. Denmark's official develoDment assistance amounted to 1.02 percent of GDP in each of 1993 and 1994. The medium-term plan calls for ODA to be sustained at 1 percent of GDP. IV. Staff Appraisal Following several years of lackluster performance, Denmark is in the middle of a robust economic recovery. Output growth is high and expected to be maintained, unemployment has begun to fall, inflation remains low, and the external current account is in comfortable surplus. The authorities need to be commended for this enviable record, which points not just to the success of recent efforts to stimulate the economy, but more importantly to the appropriateness of their long-standing strategy of financial discipline and structural reform. By correcting domestic financial imbalances and alleviating the external constraint to growth, this strategy allowed for a temporary relaxation of policy without undermining credibility. The challenge that the authorities are now facing is to ensure the sustainability of the recovery so as to permit the still high level of unemployment to fall further. Meeting this challenge will require parallel action on two fronts: first, timely adjustments in financial policies in order to avoid the re-emergence of undue wage and price pressures; second, more forceful measures to ease supply constraints, notably in the labor market. Fiscal policy has played a useful role in supporting the current economic recovery but at the cost of a large increase in the structural government deficit. The task ahead is to reverse the fiscal stimulus and resume pursuit of the medium-term consolidation objectives. The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in the 1995 budget represents a modest first step in this direction. In conjunction with the operation of the automatic stabilizers, it should enable Denmark to meet the Maastricht deficit convergence. The tightening of fiscal policy should also help to moderate domestic demand growth. Whether this will prove sufficient to ensure transition to a sustainable path of economic growth is still open to question, however. It will therefore be important that the authorities take corrective measures should bottlenecks become more prevalent or in the event of unexpectedly adverse developments in the wage round. More generally, the authorities will need to be ready to accelerate their medium-term fiscal consolidation program, if necessary through the introduction of a tighter budget for 1996 than at present contemplated. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - The authorities' objective of achieving further reductions in the structural budget deficit over the medium-term, is commendable. In addition to restoring flexibility for the future use of countercyclical policy and lowering the high public debt burden, its attainment would underpin the credibility of the authorities' commitment to convergence with the core economies of the EU and to maintaining stability during a period of buoyant growth. Consequently, it should also contribute to a narrowing of the high yield differential between Danish and German bonds. It might be noted, however, that the official medium-term Convergence Plan assumes a progressive decline in structural unemployment. To the extent that this cannot be achieved, additional fiscal measures would be desirable. These should preferably be on the expenditure side, given the high tax burden. Monetary policy has also provided support to the recovery, both through the gradual easing of interest rates in 1993 and the first half of 1994 and through re-establishing broad stability in the foreign exchange market after the widening of the ERM fluctuation margins. The primary objective for the period ahead is to maintain this stab:Llity which would in itself contribute over the medium term to keeping inflation at bay. Although interest rates in early 1995 did not appear excessively low from a cyclical perspective, markets remained uncertain as to whether it would prove possible to keep inflation under control in a period of rapid economic growth. This uncertainty was partly the reason for'a rather steep yield curve and the persistence of sizable interest rate differentials with Germany. The rise in official interest rates in early March should help eliminate this uncertainty and enhance the credibility of the policy framework to the extent that it succeeds in stemming undue downward pressure on the exchange rate of the krone. The balance of payments has strengthened markedly since the late 1980s and external competitiveness appears consistent with the aim to maintain a favorable current account position and a continued reduction in the external debt burden. Needless to say, steady progress in consolidating the public finances would support the objectives of monetary policy. In the area of structural policy, many reforms have been introduced in recent years and others are now being initiated. Such reforms can generally be expected to improve the functioning Iof markets and augment potential growth. However, in the labor market the new programs have so far produced mixed results and some may even have the unintended effect of permanently lowering labor supply. The latest adjustments in labor market policies are therefore to be welcomed in as far as they might contain excessive recourse to parental and sabbatical leave schemes and strengthen job search and job training incentives. Even so, much more will need to be done if measurable progress is to be made toward the official objective of lowering the structural unemployment rate to 7 l/2 percent by the end of the century. The prospective rapid decline in cyclical unemployment adds urgency to the pursuit of further improvements in labor market structures, but may also increase the acceptability of such improvements to the social partners. In particular, conditions may be propitious for changes in the unemployment A Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - compensation system that would facilitate lower introductory wages for youth as well as for the extension of subsidies to improve employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed. At the same time, unwillingness to reduce the generosity of unemployment compensation makes it even more critical to apply very tight work availability requirements for recipients of unemployment benefits and to ensure their strict enforcement. On trade policies, Denmark's constructive role in promoting, within the ED, market access for Central and East European countries is to be welcomed, as is its support for past and continuing efforts to liberalize the CAP and the global trading system. Denmark also deserves praise for its willingness to play a leadership role in promoting more rational, and fiscally responsible policies for the protection of the environment even if this may entail some cost to her own commercial interests. Finally, Denmark's exemplary record in extending assistance to developing countries and the economies in transition deserves to be singled out for particular mention. It is recommended that the next Article IV mission take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Note 1: Factors behind the consumer boom Three factors played important roles in the strong recovery in private consumption in 1994. First, mortgage refinancing following the steep fall in long-term interest rates in 1993 enabled households to improve their cash flow positions considerably. Mortgage debt turnover in the period May 1993 to August 1994 has been estimated at about 30 percent of GDP and the average present value gain to households put at about 15 percent of outstanding debt. I/ Cash flow effects were compounded by the tendency for homeowners to both extend the maturities of their mortgages (thereby reducing monthly principal repayments) an'd, under relaxed regulations, to withdraw equity from their investments. While some of the equity withdrawal was used to repay other loans, some was used to finance purchases of consumer durables-- and automobiles in particular because of generous incentives (aimed at improving the environment) to trade in old cars for new. Second, cuts in income tax rates at the beginning of 1994 helped raise disposable income by 2 to 3 percent. :v However, according to official estimates, the net effect on real incomes of tax policy in 1994 was closer to 1 percent if reduced mortgage interest tax relief and higher indirect taxes and social security contributions are taken into account. Third, the earlier lengthy period of consumer retrenchment had substantially improved household balance sheet positions, which showed a relatively healthy net financial asset position at end-1993 (see tabulation below). u Since most mortgage bonds are held by domestic pension funds, refinancing is in theory a zero sum gain for the economy. In net present value terms, gains to households would be offset by lower future pension income or higher taxes to compensate the Government for lower tax revenue from pension funds. Thus, the impact on consumption of the refinancing would reflect to a large extent distributional and liquidity effects. u The cuts were part of a tax reform, which was described in more detail in the last Recent Economic Develonmenta paper (SM/94/15, January 1994).

Estimates of the general government structural balance are also shown in the above tabulation. Those of the authorities are based on a simple rule of thumb whereby a cyclical component equal to 1.23 times the difference between the structural and actual rate of unemployment, is subtracted from the budget balance as a percent of GDP. .By contrast, those of the staff rely on separate adjustments to revenues and expenditures: to calculate the structural balance, revenues are scaled by the ratio of potential to actual GDP while unemployment benefits are scaled by the ratio of structural to actual unemployment. The staff's estimate of the structural deficit in 1994 and 1995 exceeds that of the authorities partly because of assumed higher structural unemployment. In addition, mainly reflecting the distortionary effects of the new labor market measures on unemployment in 1994, the structural deficit would be unchanged between 1994 and 1995 despite the estimated fiscal withdrawal.

Note 2: The 1994 labor market measures The 1994 labor market measures included an expansion of places on training schemes, the introduction of three new leave schemes, and the requirement that job action plans be drawn up for unemployed workers. u Due to initial administrative problems, the new schemes somewhat perversely contributed to the persistence of high unemployment in the first half of 1994 despite strong economic growth. In particular, delays in appointing the new regional labor market councils, which preside over many of the schemes, and ambiguities regarding policy at the regional level, led to a reduction in the number on training schemes. The attractiveness of the leave schemes may also have contributed to a surge in the labor force. As the administrative problems were ironed out, the new measures helped unemployment to fall sharply in the second half of 1994. The leave schemes proved very popular, and by end-94, 79,000 persons were taking part: 23,000 on educational, 50,000 on parental and 6,000 on sabbatical leave. However, since many leave spells are for six months only, the full-time equivalent number of persons on leave was much lower. Just over half of those taking leave had previously been unemployed, as the educational leave and training schemes for the unemployed are somewhat fungible. Parental leave (which is a worker's right) was particularly popular among nurses: by October 1994, such leave had been approved for roughly 13 percent of Danish nurses. In order to dampen demand for parental and sabbatical leave, entitlements were reduced. as of the beginning of 1995 from 80 to 70 percent of normal unemployment benefits. u The measures are described in more detail in the last Recent Economic DeveloDments paper (SM/94/15, January 1994).

In the scenario, rapid growth in 1994-96 leads to some overheating and, in combination with higher indirect taxes, inflation rises to nearly 3 percent in 1996-97 (Table 1.1). The overheating is corrected in 1997-98 and thereafter growth is at the estimated rate of potential (about 2 perclent a year) and inflation moderates, The current account remains in surplus throughout the scenario, helped by declining net investment payments abroad. A combination of tax increases (in connection with the 1994 tax reform) and favorable debt dynamics permits a fall in the general government deficit to 1 l/4 percent of GDP and in the gross public debt ratio to under 70 percent of GDI? by the year 2000. More details, along with alternative scenarios, are contained in the accompanying Background Issues Paper. Note 4: Fiscal imoulse and structural budget balance measures The authorities' calculation of the fiscal impulse attempts to measure the effects on GDP of deviations in various tax and expenditure components from their path under "neutral" fiscal assumptions. JJ These neutral assumptions include unchanged tax.rates; constant public employment, real procurement and investment spending; and growth in public wages and transfer incomes in line with private sector wages. The proportionate deviation of each tax and expenditure component from its neutral setting is scaled by its estimated first-year GDP multiplier, as calculated using Denmark Statistics' macroeconomic model (ADAM). By contrast, the staff ,defines the fiscal impulse as the change in the fiscal stance, where the stance in any year measures the difference between the budget balance under ,neutral policies and the actual balance. 2/ In turn, the calculation of the neutral balance assumes that revenues would normally grow in line with actual GDP <while non-unemployment-related transfers would grow in line with potential GDP. It might be noted that, defined this way, changes in unemployment-related fiscal expenditures are not treated as discretionary fiscal action. The two approaches produce broadly similar results for the estimated withdrawal of stimulus in 1995--a rather modest 0.3 or 0.4 percent (see tabulation below). The estimates differ for the recent past with the authorities showing that the stimulus in 1993 and 1994 was relatively evenly spread out, while the staff calculation suggests that the bulk of the I/ For more details, see "Fiscal Policy and Fiscal Indicators," Ministry of Finance, Working Paper No. 3 (Denmark, January 1995). 2/ See Heller, Haas, and Mansur, "A Review of the Fiscal Impulse Measure", IMF Occasional Paper No. 44 (May 1986).

Second, external public borrowing is only used for the purposes of foreign exchange reserves policy, not for deficit financing. Such borrowing creates a counterpart central government deposit with the Nationalbank, which manages public external debt and the reserves on a net basis. Third, the Government has, over the years, invested in the so-called Social Pension Fund, which now holds claims on a considerable amount of private sector mortgage bonds. 2/ Since there are no contingent claims on the Fund (which, despite its name, is not a pension fund) these assets could conceivably be used to retire public debt.
