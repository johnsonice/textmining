Conditions deteriorated further in 1999/2000. In the face of widening fiscal deficits and a worsening external position, the government imposed restrictions in January 2000, but by end- 1999/2000 reserves were down to two months of import cover. Inflation was contained, and economic growth averaged 4.8 percent in 1996-2000, but this was insufficient to raise the standards of living, with per capita GDP remaining flat and social indicators among the weakest in the world. In 2000, when peaceful conditions were restored with Eritrea, the government renewed its commitment to poverty reduction within a framework of macroeconomic stability, as laid out in its comprehensive interim PRSP, which reflects strong ownership. Rapid, broad-based, and equitable growth is to be achieved by promoting rural development, improving human and physical infrastructure-with emphasis on increasing the income-earning capacity of the poor-and addressing the immediate post-conflict reconstruction and demobillzation needs (totaling 6% percent of GDP in 2000/01-2002103). Progressive fiscal consolidation and cautious monetary policy, in conjunction with financial sector reform and structural reforms, which include the elimination of the recently imposed restrictions at the outset of the program, would boost domestic savings and contribute to higher investment. These policies, together with an expected improvement in the terms of trade, would help reduce gradually external financing needs from the high levels projected in the initial years. Nonetheless, to achieve debt sustainability, Ethiopia will need to rely, also over the longer term, on highly concessional external support and debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The underlying fiscal deficits (including grants, but excluding the emergency programs), targeted to decline from 12.4 percent of GDP in 199912000 to 6.4 percent in 2000/01 and to 5.1 percent by 2002/03, and funded by concessional foreign assistance and privatization receipts, would permit phasing out government domestic borrowing. Fiscal policy embraces the redirection of resources from defense-related expenditures toward poverty- reducing outlays, and the laying of a foundation for strong tax revenue performance. A task force will oversee the implementation of a comprehensive tax policy reform, involving the streamlining of tax legislation and increases in the rates and scope of domestic indirect taxation, which will culminate in the introduction of the value-added tax in 2002/03. The establishment of a large-taxpayer unit and taxpayer identification numbers are milestones toward the establishment of an effective tax administration. The monetary program aims at limiting inflation to low single digits while rebuilding international reserves and leaving adequate scope for growth in credit to the private sector. Market determination of interest rates and exchange rates will be critical, beginning with the elimination of excess commercial bank liquidity and administrative hurdles; these Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- actions will facilitate active interbank money and foreign exchange markets. In the context of broader financial sector reform, the program involves further steps to modernlze monetary management, rehabilitate the smaller banks, and implement a strategy to redress the market dominance and managerial inefficiencies of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE). As part of the effort to integrate Ethiopia into the global economy, Ethiopia intends to reduce further external tariffs and eliminate remaining exchange restrictions. The government also intends to regularize its relations with creditors by seeking rescheduling of eligible arrears and maturities falling due. Reforms geared to enhancing the potential for economic growth and to reducing poverty target (i) the judicial and civil services, with emphasis on improving capacity, governance, transparency, and accountability; (ii) regulatory constraints; and (iii) privatization of the bulk of remaining public enterprises over the next two years. Successful implementation of the program should return Ethiopia to a path of high and sustainable growth. Policies to encourage agricultural growth and improve food security, as well as reforms that facilitate private sector development, will reduce vulnerability to external shocks over time. The program reflects the authorities’ strong ownership. Policy implementation at the outset confirms their strong commitment to public and financial sector reforms and removal of restrictions. The staff recommends approval by the Executive Board of Ethiopia’s request for a three-year PRGF arrangement.

INTRODUCTION -1. Discussions on the economic program for 2000/01-2002/03 (fiscal years starting July 8) and for the 2000 Article IV consultation were held in Addis Ababa during August 15-29 and October 14-26, and continued at headquarters during October 3 l-November 3, 2000.’ In the letter of January 29,200 1 (EBS/O l/6), the government requests a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The arrangement is to support the policies and measures described in the memorandum on economic and financial policies (MEFP) annexed to the letter and in Ethiopia’s interim poverty reduction strategy paper (I-PRSP) for 2000/01-2002/03 (EBS/Ol/l 1). The preliminary decision point document for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative (forthcoming) provides additional information relevant to Ethiopia’s request. 2. The last arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), in an amount equivalent to 90 percent of quota, expired in October 1999. Overall, macroeconomic performance was mostly satisfactory, but progress with implementing a broad-ranging agenda of structural reforms was uneven, and the midterm reviews under the annual programs for 1996/97 and 1998/99 were not completed. In November 1998, the Executive Boards of the Fund and the World Bank discussed a preliminary HIPC Initiative decision point document and considered Ethiopia as eligible for assistance under the Initiative. Most Directors agreed that the decision point could be reached at the time of completion of the midterm review under the second annual ESAF arrangement, expected for the spring of 1999. However, a few Directors favored a decision point at the time of Board approval of the third annual ESAF arrangement (see SUR/98/128; 1 l/l 1/98).2 ’ The staff representatives comprised Mrs. Schmitz (head); Messrs. Pition-Farah, Charap, Pitt, and Bhavnani @A), and Ms. Brixiova (all AFR); Messrs. Wang, Panth, Choudhury (RA), and Kalonji (RA) (all PDR); and Mmes. Montero and Silman (AFR-Assistants). Mr. Hernandez-Cata led the policy discussions in the final days of the October mission and at headquarters in November. Mr. Abdi, the Fund’s Senior Resident Representative, played an important role in the work of the missions. The staff met with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi; Mr. Sufian Ahmed, Minister of Finance; Mr. Girma Bin-u, Minister for Economic Development; Mr. Teklewold Atnafu, Governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia; Mr. Neway Gebre-ab, Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister; other senior government officials; and representatives from the private sector and the donor community. The team worked closely with World Bank staff in integrating Bank lending operations into the macroeconomic strategy; in the discussions on the government’s draft interim PRSP; and on debt relief issues. 2 In view of subsequent economic developments in Ethiopia and the enhancement of the HIPC Initiative, it has become necessary to update the debt sustainability analysis and to seek Board guidance on policy aspects related to the I-UPC Initiative instrument.

Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle and continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangement under Article XIV, Section 2 of the Articles of Agreement. In concluding the last Article IV consultation in July 1999, Executive Directors urged the authorities to resume both full and timely reporting of all available data and an intensive dialogue with the Fund and donors. They emphasized that maintenance of a solid track record-particularly regarding sound macroeconomic policies and social and development spending-was critical to bring Ethiopia to its HIPC Initiative decision point. Directors also stressed that efforts to strengthen transparency, including with regard to the financing of military spending, would enhance donor confidence. 4. The proposed arrangement would amount to SDR 87 million (65 percent of quota), comprising seven semiannual disbursements. The program was negotiated under the expectation of Board presentation in December 2000, with the economic program beginning on October 1,200O. A number of financing issues delayed Board presentation, but these were beyond the control of the authorities and all prior actions were implemented on time. Accordingly, the original program timing has been maintained. The first two installments under the arrangement of SDR 17.4 million each would take place upon approval of the arrangement and upon completion of the first review of the program in July 200 1 including observance of end-March performance criteria, respectively. The subsequent five disbursements (SDR 10.4 million each) would be contingent upon observance of performance criteria and completion of semiannual reviews. Over the arrangement period, total outstanding Fund credit would increase from SDR 59 million (44 percent of quota) in December 2000 to SDR 113 million (85 percent of quota) by February 2004. 5. The proposed quantitative and structural benchmarks and performance criteria are set out in Annex Tables 1 and 2 (EBS/Ol/6), while a description of the variables subject to quantitative criteria is provided in the technical memorandum of understanding, all of which are annexed to the letter of intent (EBS/O1/6). 6. The World Bank’s pipeline of approved, undisbursed project lending-about US$841 million as of November 2000-gives priority to infrastructure, rural development, health, and education. Since October 1998, no new projects were submitted for Board approval, with the exception of an HIV/AIDS lending operation that was extended to Ethiopia on a pilot basis. In recent months, subsequent to the cease-fire agreement in the border conflict with Eritrea, the World Bank staff has taken the lead in developing with Ethiopia and its development partners comprehensive demobilization and reconstruction programs, for which the Bank will provide IDA funding on the order of US$428 million over three years. These lending operations, together with planned new IDA credit in support of rural and private sector development, have been integrated into an updated Interim Support Strategy (ISS) that takes stock of Ethiopia’s situation and charts the Bank’s role in the country’s development over the medium term. The Bank Board approved the emergency programs and the ISS on December 5,200O. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- 11. BACKGROUND 7. After the establishment of the transitional government in 1991, which ended 17 years of political dictatorship and central planning of the economy, Ethiopia built a strong record of macroeconomic stabilization and deregulation (while receiving significant financial support from the Bretton Woods institutions and development partners). Subsequently, during the ESAF-supported program period (1996/97-98/99), there was notable, although uneven, progress with market-oriented reforms. However, adverse circumstances, in particular the border conflict with Eritrea, increasingly hampered the government’s efforts at consolidating stabilization gains (see Section II of the MEFP). 8. During the ESAF-supported program period, economic growth averaged 3 percent and inflation was close to 4 percent, notwithstanding adverse factors at times, including drought conditions, a deterioration of the terms of trade, and the pressures from the border conflict with Eritrea that erupted in May 1998 (Table 3). Confronted with an increased need for military spending and declining external grants, the government began to cut back other expenditure, but by 1998/99 the fiscal deficit (including grants) had climbed to 8.5 percent of GDP from 2.4 percent in 1996/97. The external current account deficit, including grants, averaged 2.3 percent of GDP in the first two years but deteriorated in 1998/99, as prices and volumes of coffee exports dropped sharply. Reflecting the fall in export earnings and the weaker fiscal position, gross official reserves had declined by end-1998/99 to 2.8 months of imports of goods and services from 4.4 months at end-1996/97. 9. Regarding structural reforms, the govemment had sought to speed up, during the ESAF-supported program period, the reform agenda with respect to privatization, trade and exchange liberalization, the structure of the financial sector, and the efficiency of its operations; the modernization of the tax system gathered momentum only in 1998. 10. Ethiopia’s economic situation deteriorated sharply in 1999/2000 because of severe drought conditions; a major worsening of its terms of trade associated with lower coffee export prices and the steep rise in petroleum import prices; and the impact of the border conflict. Real GDP grew by an estimated 4% percent and inflation remained subdued, in part because food aid averted food price increases. The fiscal deficit reached 12.4 percent of GDP and was mostly financed by the central bank. Excess reserves at the commercial banks surged, and pressures in the foreign exchange market began to build up. To stem these pressures, the government imposed in January 2000 temporary restrictive measures, including a 10 percent import duty surcharge, a 100 percent advance deposit requirement for import applications, and nonuniform ceilings across banks on their authority to approve import permits. Nonetheless, the external current account deficit, including grants, remained large, at 7% percent of GDP, and gross reserves dropped to two months of import cover; meanwhile, liquid reserves fell to one month of import cover. 11. Considerable progress has been made toward restoring peaceful conditions between Ethiopia and Eritrea. On June 18,2000, both countries signed a cease-fire agreement, and there have been no reported hostilities since then. On December 12,2000, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- both countries signed a peace agreement that calls for the immediate release of prisoners of war and the return of dislocated persons; sets out the modalities for an investigation into the origins of the conflict; establishes a commission to decide through binding arbitration on war-related claims; and charts the procedures and schedule for the demarcation of the border. A United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force (consisting of 4,200 military personnel, including 220 military observers) is being deployed in a 12.5-mile buffer zone. Deployment is expected to be completed in January-February 2001, after which the Ethiopian military is scheduled to return to within the border of May 6, 1998. The UN force will remain until international arbitrators have demarcated the 600-mile border. III. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC STRATEGY 12. The discussions on the government’s economic strategy were informed by the concern that Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world, notwithstanding some recent improvements in poverty indicators (see the interim PRSP). The staff shared the authorities’ view that Ethiopia’s development strategy, formulated in the mid-1990s and reconfirmed in 2000 in the second five-year National Development Program (NDP), rightly focuses on poverty reduction by fostering rural development, designing and implementing a comprehensive food security program, and building conditions for high and sustainable economic growth. The interim PRSP is grounded in the NDP, which itself has drawn upon a consultative process, and it formulates policies aimed at achieving the International Development Goals by 2015. Over the next 12 months, with participation from local stakeholders and development partners, the authorities expect to give specificity to the key elements of the strategy and to refine implementation and monitoring systems in a full PRSP, which will provide the basis for updating the policy content of the PRGF-supported second- and third-year programs. 13. Under the poverty reduction strategy, rural development is to be fostered through policies that upgrade the human and physical infrastructure, raise agricultural productivity, and remove impediments to private sector activity. The authorities emphasized that marked improvements in public services needed to accompany sound macroeconomic policies. They sought to achieve such improvements through capacity building, judicial and civil service reforms, and further fiscal decentralization at the provincial level. Overall efficiency gains were expected to result from further liberalization of the trade and exchange systems, and privatization. 14. The government attached urgency to the objective of resuming implementation of its reform strategy, in particular as the difficult circumstances of the past years had impeded progress. As a priority, the government intends to bring its infrastructure programs back to pre-conflict levels, which would require resumption of donor support for the sectoral development programs (SDPs) in education, health, roads, and utility services. These programs were seen as crucial for increasing the income-earning capacity of the poor and improving Ethiopia’s growth potential. In addition, the government intends to further deregulate and modemize the financial sector operations, so as to improve conditions for private sector activity. The authorities are committed to keep the fiscal stance over the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- medium term consistent with a sustainable external current account deficit and with a ~ monetary policy that targets low inflation, while allowing exchange rate flexibility and a gradual recovery in the level of international reserves. The government emphasized that macroeconomic stability needed to be protected through efforts to raise domestic savings and to solicit considerable support from foreign sources- including grants, highly concessional loans, debt relief, and foreign direct investment. 15. For the immediate period ahead, the government stressed that its strategy reconciled the country’s security needs with the requirement to finance both the emergency programs for reconstruction and demobilization and the improvement of priority public services, all within a sustainable fiscal framework. In designing the scope and content of the emergency programs, the World Bank staff and the government focused on restoring crucial physical infrastructure, and reconstituting and improving the income- earning capacity of both dislocated and deported households and veterans (see paras. 14 and 15 of the MEFP, and Box 1). The envisaged pace of execution is tied to the government’s implementation capacity and the objective of macroeconomic stability, with costs of 6% percent of GDP to be spread over the three program years. The emergency programs will result in large, but transitory, overall fiscal deficits of 8.4 percent of GDP in 2000/01 and 8.8 percent in 2001/02; the deficit would fall to 6.2 percent in 2002/03. The underlying general government deficits (including grants, but excluding the emergency programs) would decline from 12.4 percent of GDP in 199912000 to 6.4 percent in 2000/01 and to 5.1 percent by 2002/03. 16. At this stage, it is assumed that a large part of the fiscal deficits will be financed with disbursements of highly concessional loans and debt relief on concessional terms (Cologne terms as of September 2001).3 Given the targeted, sustained increase in public savings over the longer term and the concurrent return to lower public investment outlays, together with the expected provision of debt relief, Ethiopia would be able to meet its debt-service obligations, notwithstanding the rapid increase in its external indebtedness in the transitory period. Moreover, the government plans to approach its development partners in the coming months to explore whether a larger part of Ethiopia’s financing requirements can be met with grant funding. 17. In the context of its strategy for 2000/01-2002/03, the government expects (i) to limit inflation to low single digits; (ii) to raise the import reserve cover to about four months; and that (iii) economic growth will increase to about 7 percent. The envisaged policies, together with an assumed gradual recovery in Ethiopia’s terms of trade starting in 2001/02, are projected to result in higher private and public domestic savings and contribute to a rise in investment and a reduction in poverty (see page 26 of the I-PRSP). Nevertheless, 3 As discussed below (and in the forthcoming preliminary HIPC Initiative decision point document), Ethiopia needs debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative to achieve debt sustainability.

Emergency Program The government, assisted by the World Bank, has developed a comprehensive emergency program to address the recovery, demobilization, and reintegration needs arising from the border conflict with Eritrea, which ended in June 2000. World Bank support for the program will amount to US!§428 million. The main goals of the emergency recovery project are to provide humanitarian assistance to war-affected people and to rebuild key infrastructure damaged in Tigray and Afar. The project comprises the following components: Household rehabilitation, designed to assist more than 600,000 affected people to rebuild their lives and resume productive activities (364,000 civilians were displaced; 110,000 were or are expected to be deported from Eritrea; and 144,000 people lost their main breadwinner). Households will receive funding for (i) rebuilding/repairing homes; (ii) acquiring basic household items; (iii) obtaining agricultural inputs and tools, or inputs for other business activities in the case of urban beneficiaries. In addition, access to microcredit will be facilitated. The program has three safeguards to ensure that the funds are utilized as intended: (i) a system of verification at the district level and below; (ii) a parallel provision of food assistance to prevent funds from being used for consumption; and (iii) the means of ensuring that sufficient amounts of the production inputs will be available in local markets. The rehabilitation of community infrastructure, under which schools and health facilities will be restored so that the delivery of basic social services can resume. The HIV/AIDS component, which is aimed at mitigating, through prevention and treatment, the increased risk of HIV/AIDS transmission in the border areas. The concentration of a large number of relatively well- paid soldiers, coupled with the inflow of commercial sex workers, has increased this risk. The demining activities, which are crucial for restoring a safe environment for civilians and the UN peacekeeping mission. The reconstruction component, which focuses on rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads and power supply infrastructure, thus reducing the war toll on private sector development. The goals of the demobilization and reintegration project (for which the World Bank will lend US$l7 1 million) are to help an estimated 150,000 war veterans to resume income-earning activities, and thus foster a socially stable environment. The project consists of the following: l Demobilization, which entails the establishment of demobilization centers. Veterans will be transported to these centers and provided with basic health services and a transportation allowance facilitating the return to their areas of origin. The government began to demobilize in November 2000, with the goal of demobilizing 60,000 veterans within a few months. After an evaluation of this first phase, and as the implementation of the peace agreement progresses, the remaining veterans will be demobihzed. l Reinsertion, which entails the provision of transitional subsistence support to soldiers to cover expenses of the reestablishment of civilian households. l Reintegration, which includes provision of training or creation of employment opportunities. The World Bank is making disbursements to the government over three years, with the first one envisaged in February 2001; the following two installments will take into account past performance as well as projected requirements for the next period. Close monitoring and evaluation (based on a set of performance indicators to track program implementation), along with Bank supervision, are designed to ensure the timely demobilization of soldiers and rapid reduction of military expenditures.

The resource gap would decline from 17 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to below 15 percent by 2002/03. IV. ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2000/01-2001/02 A. Macroeconomic Policies ;.y- In line with the medium-term objectives set out above, the first annual program 1 assumes annual rates of real GDP growth of 7-8 percent in 2000/01-2001/02; (ii) seeks to maintain consumer price inflation close to 5 percent; and (iii) seeks to increase reserve cover from 2 months of the following year’s imports as of July 2000 to 2% months by July 2001 and further to 3% months by July 2002.

The twin fiscal policy objectives for the next three years are to redirect resources from defense-related expenditures toward poverty-reducing outlays (while addressing the country’s post-conflict recovery needs), and to lay the foundation for a strong tax revenue performance. The government recognizes that a major improvement in domestic revenue mobilization will be the key to accommodating the level of public services needed to support Ethiopia’s economic development and avoiding an unsustainable accumulation of debt. Public savings are targeted to increase at a pace that will allow the authorities to substantially reduce dependence on external funding of the budget in the medium term. The overall fiscal deficits (including grants and the emergency programs) of 8.4 percent in 2000/01 and 8.8 percent in 2001/02 would be financed by concessional foreign assistance, including debt relief, and by privatization receipts, thus permitting the government to phase out domestic borrowing (Figure 1). 20. The revenue strategy calls for an increase in tax revenue of 2% percentage points during the three-year program period; it takes into account the likelihood that nontax revenue will decline as a ratio of GDP, given the depletion of the petroleum fund and the government’s disengagement from commercial activities.4 To achieve the 4 Most of the remaining state-owned commercial enterprises will be sold over the next three fiscal years. As concerns the petroleum fund, resources were built up during 1998-99 when the decline in world oil prices was not passed on to consumers. In 1999, the government began to use these resources for general budget expenses. In response to the recent steep rise in world oil prices, retail prices were adjusted in January, July, and December 2000 to ensure full coverage of costs. The government is committed to maintaining this policy of regular price adjustments. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicFigure 1.

These measures will more than compensate for the revenue loss from the elimination of the 10 percent surcharge on imports. 22. Overall expenditure (excluding outlays under the emergency programs) is targeted to decline by 5 percentage points of GDP during the program period to 28 percent in 2002/03. Within this envelope, a steep decline in defense expenditures (from over 13 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to 5 !A percent in 200 l/02) ’ will help reduce the overall deficit and make room for an increase in poverty-targeted expenditures from 8% percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to above 13 percent in 200 l/O2 (see adjoining figure). These expenditures, which comprise outlays on social services, agriculture, and priority infrastructure, will be allocated through SDPs elaborated with technical and financial assistance from the World Bank and other development partners6 Of course, the expected 5 These levels include significant transitory expenditures because of the need to build barracks for the standing army. 1 6 See also paragraphs 23 and 24 of the MEFP and Section E of the interim PRSP.

Other government expenditures that were compressed during the conflict period would rise moderately as a ratio to GDP in 2000/01 but remain broadly unchanged in real terms thereafter. Within these overall constraints, little room exists for increases in the total wage bill, and the government plans to revisit its wage bill strategy when it elaborates further its agenda of civil service reform.

The budgetary implications will need, however, to be reconciled within public expenditure reviews (PERs), which the government conducts annually, with collaboration from its development partners, to evaluate its SDPs and further map out its medium-term expenditure strategy within a coherent macroeconomic framework. 23. Regarding the envisaged rapid recovery in nonmilitary core expenditures in 2000/01, the authorities thought that it was possible to accelerate investment spending by concentrating on project preparation early in the fiscal year, notwithstanding the severe constraints on committing expenditure that had been in effect until the 2000/01 budget was approved by parliament in late November 2000. They noted that there was also downward flexibility in case expenditure cuts were needed because of revenue or external funding shortfalls. The Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance authorizes and monitors expenditures on a monthly basis, and it is equipped to enforce revised lower limits for federal expenditure and capital transfers to the regions, which would be set by the Budget Department or the Ministry of Economic Development, respectively. Regional governments cannot borrow. Based on preliminary information, fiscal revenue and expenditure developments during the first four months of 2000/01 were broadly in line with program projections. 24. Public finance management in Ethiopia is relatively strong as regards the integrity of the budget process and the poverty orientation of public expenditure. Several factors encourage fiscal discipline: the federal government determines the aggregate resource envelope; the federal Ministry of Finance and the regional finance bureaus adhere to spending limits as hard budget constraints; reappropriation across budget categories requires legislative approval at the regional or federal level; aid pledges are not incorporated into resource estimates unless they are firmly committed; and the Financial Act prevents the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- accumulation of domestic arrears as it mandates that expenditure commitments be subject to availability of funds. The government has recently launched a series of reforms that would further improve the budgetary process and expenditure tracking, including the following: a pilot exercise for preparing a Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework (MEFF) to determine the resource envelope for a three-year period and to provide a basis for addressing the trade- offs between federal/regional and recurrent/capital expenditures; a decentralization program that assigns responsibility for the bulk of social sector expenditures and antipoverty programs to the regions, thereby strengthening control over service delivery; and the setting up of a welfare monitoring system (WMS) to analyze the impact of public policy on the poor, based on annual household welfare monitoring surveys and other information. 25. Expenditures will be tracked through the preparation of an annual PER by the government in close collaboration with the World Bank and several donor agencies. Seven PERs have been conducted to date, frequently with IMF, European Union, and bilateral donors’ participation, focusing on improvements in budgetary planning and trends in budgetary aggregates. The upcoming PER will seek to improve the timeliness and quality of regional government reporting. In the areas of health, education, and roads, reviews focus on output and outcome indicators and suggest corrective action where necessary. Further initiatives are under consideration to improve expenditure tracking and the monitoring of poverty-reducing outcomes in the context of the preparation of the full PRSP. 26. As regards expenditure controls, federal government expenditures (including for defense) are audited annually by the Auditor General, who is appointed by and submits his report to parliament. The ten autonomous regions have their own audit offices, which operate in close collaboration with the Federation, because, inter alia, over 50 percent of regional expenditures are financed (and therefore audited) by the federal government. The audit for 1997/98 was submitted to parliament in March 1999 and approved shortly thereafter. The audit of federal government operations in 1998/99 is still under review by the Ministry of Finance but is scheduled to be submitted shortly to parliament.7 For fiscal operations, the audit timetable for 1999/2000 is expected to be normalized, with submission to parliament and approval expected in early 200 1. 7 The Auditor General informed the Fund staff that the delay in submitting the 1998/99 report was due to technical work required for the closing of domestic bank accounts that had been mostly inactive since the fall of the Dergue regime.

The government attaches high priority to keeping inflation in the low single digits. To this end, the monetary program aims at limiting consumer price inflation (CPI) to about 5 percent in 2000/01 and 2001/02, a level consistent with a broadly stable money velocity1’ Progress in Fiscal consolidation and foreign inflows help rebuild reserves fiscal consolidation, (Annual percentage change with respect to beginning-of-period broad money) . supported by substantial disbursements of foreign aid, would allow for adequate growth in domestic credit to the private sector, so as to set the stage for private- sector-led growth and facilitate the rebuilding of 15 - Broad money P-----2, --_ Credit to government -10 19951% 199tY97 1997198 1998l99 1999100 2000/01 2001/02 2002lO3 international reserves. The net domestic assets of the national bank would be the key aggregate in steering monetary policy, but developments in other monetary aggregates would also be followed closely. 28. In conducting monetary policy in 2000/01, the authorities said that they saw a major challenge in managing a smooth transition from a situation of government reliance on bank borrowing and external restrictions in the first half of the year to a situation without restrictions and government disengagement beginning in the second half. Against this background, and recognizing that financial markets have remained nascent, notwithstanding the reforms in recent years, the authorities have decided to implement a comprehensive reform agenda over the next 12 months (see Box 3). The reforms aim at modernizing monetary management; improving operations in the interbank money and foreign exchange markets, as well as in the treasury bill and exchange auctions; strengthening the soundness of the smaller banks; and upgrading management at the largest state-owned bank, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE).9 The reform agenda has been developed with MAE technical assistance. Looking ahead, the authorities also agreed to collaborate closely with Fund and World Bank staff in the next phase of financial * The CPI target corresponds to rates of increase in the GDP deflator of 3.2 percent in 200010 1 and 5.8 percent in 2001/02. With the envisaged 7-8 percent annual GDP growth, annual rates of monetary growth would be on the order of 12X-13 percent (Table 7). ’ The government also plans to privatize the Construction and Business Bank (CBB), which has the second-largest branch network in the country.

The goal is to promote the development of a financial system that will foster economic development and active competition by offering an attractive range of financial savings instruments throughout the country and providing for an efficient allocation of financial resources. 29. In managing the above-mentioned transition, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has begun to sterilize the large excess reserves of the banks and will monitor closely bank liquidity, while improving conditions for treasury bill and interbank market activity and removing distortions from exchange market operations (see also paras. 27-33 of the MEFP). Under these conditions, and with the implementation of rehabilitation plans and the establishment of higher capital requirements for the banks, interest rate flexibility is likely to increase. In light of the marked deterioration in Ethiopia’s terms of trade, the program assumes that the birr would depreciate moderately in nominal and real effective terms following the lifting of import barriers and restrictive regulations affecting foreign exchange transactions.” In the event of exchange market pressures, the NBE would tighten monetary policy conditions and would refrain from rationing foreign exchange allocations in the auction or from making sustained interventions in the interbank market. By October 200 1, the weekly wholesale auction will cease, and all foreign exchange operations will be conducted in the interbank market. External sector issues and financing 30. Under its development strategy, Ethiopia’s integration into the global economy will be fostered by taking mutually reinforcing steps to further liberalize the foreign trade and exchange regimes, allow market determination of the exchange rate, and promote export development. In the area of trade liberalization, the elimination of the import surcharge as of January 1,200l (imposed at end-1999 as an emergency measure) will reduce the unweighted average external tariff from 28 percent to 19!4 percent and lower Ethiopia’s rating from 8 to 6 on the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness. This, however, still exceeds the levels in most sub-Saharan African countries. The government is committed to further simplifying and liberalizing the trade regime, and will determine over the next few lo The exchange rate has depreciated in real effective terms by 7% percent over the last two fiscal years when terms of trade deteriorated by 37 percent, reflecting falling coffee export prices and the recent rise in oil prices. During this period, noncoffee exports grew rapidly. Further expansion of Ethiopia’s export sector hinges less on reducing costs of factor inputs, but rather on the removal of structural obstacles-such as lacking infrastructure, administrative hurdles, and insufficient access to credit.

Financial Sector Reform Ifi 1993, when the government of Ethiopia started a comprehensive reform process, the state-owned formal financial sector consisted of the central bank, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE); one commercial bank, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE); two specialized banks; an insurance company, the Ethiopian Insurance Company; and the Pension and Social Security Authority. Until then, these institutions had been providing cheap credit to state-owned enterprises, state farms, and cooperatives within the framework of a command economy. In 1994, the government opened the banking sector to private banks as part of its strategy to foster private sector involvement in the economy. In response, seven new banks-owned exclusively by Ethiopian nationals (foreign ownership is not allowed)--were set up, but their market share remained small. In addition, the financial sector now comprises 6 private insurance companies, 16 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs), about 700 formal savings and credit cooperatives, and numerous informal financial institutions. Nevertheless, the money and capital markets are still underdeveloped, and treasury bills were the only security available to investors until very recently. At this stage, one of the main wealmesses of the Ethiopian banking system is the lack of competition, which allows the CBE to determine lending and exchange rates, and leads, in turn, to an ineffIcient allocation of iinancial resources. Interest rates have remained virtually unchanged since January 1998, when controls were abolished, and banks use collareral to differentiate among borrowers. Another symptom of inefficiency has been the persistent excess liquidity held by the commercial banks; under these circumstances, the interbank money market in domestic currency has been dormant. Furthermore, the new private banks, as well as the CBE, have accumulated reportedly nonperforming loans (23 percent of total loans), reflecting mostly lack of experience in assessing credit risks of potential borrowers, poor monitoring of provided credit, and weak contract enforcement. Since early 2000, the banks have been implementing action plans, agreed with the NBE, to reduce the nonperforming loan ratios. Another problem of the banking sector has been the insuffIcient capacity of the NBE to pursue an active monetary policy, owing to the lack of effective indirect instruments and insufficient autonomy of the NBE. To improve the functioning of financial markets, the government will implement a MO-pronged strategy over the next few years. First, it will uhdertake an immediate shift toward an active monetary policy, seeking to foster interbank market operations and adopting first steps to improve the soundness of the banking system. Second, it will perform a comprehensive review of the government’s financial sector development strategy, with a view to guiding subsequent structural reforms. The most important measures being implemented over the next six-nine months under the first part of the strategy are as follows: . enhancing indirect monetary control by (a) absorbing excess reserves of commercial banks-birr 3,200 million were sterilized with the auctioning of 2-year coupon government bonds at end-November 2000, (b) giving banks access to a rediscount facility for government paper, (c) defining a code of conduct for money market participants, and (d) improving institutional features of the treasury bill auction; . coordinating government borrowing closely with monetary policy objectives and, on the basis of a study in 200 1, increasing the autonomy of the NBE; 0 improving conditions for more efficient foreign exchange market operations by (a) removing barriers to market access, (b) applying limits on foreign exchange open positions of commercial banks only on the basis of prudential considerations, (c) adjusting the NBE’s position in the foreign exchange market according to the program’s net foreign assets targets, and (d) replacing the weekly foreign exchange wholesale auction conducted by the NBE with an interbank foreign exchange market where the NBE will be one of the participants; . strengthening banking supervision by (a) monitoring and enforcing banks’ steps toward reaching the increased minimum capital requirements that apply as of June 2002, (b) adopting fast-track directives for the NBE in addressing bank problems, (c) strengthening key prudential regulations, and (d) enhancing supervision of MFIs; . starting reforms of CBE by putting it under a management contract with a reputable foreign institution, completing its financial restructuring within 1% years, and proceeding with its rehabilitation in light of the results of the comprehensive review of the government’s financial sector development strategy mentioned above.

Ethiopia does not maintain any nontariff barriers, except for sanitary and national security purposes.” 31. Ethiopia maintains two restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions (namely, a limitation on the availability of foreign exchange for holiday travel under Article XIV and a limitation on payments for education abroad by foreign residents subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a)); in addition, multiple currency practices arise from the NE3E’s “Dutch” system of foreign exchange auctions and from the requirement that residents surrender 90 percent of foreign exchange at the marginal exchange rate observed at the weekly wholesale auction, subject to approval under Article VIII. The NEIE intends to eliminate the above mentioned restrictions by end-March 2001 and abstain from introducing new restrictions. It has also requested that Fund staff examine by July 200 1 whether Ethiopia’s legislation is in compliance with the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. With the envisaged elimination of the foreign exchange auction, the multiple currency practice would cease. 32. Balance of payments projections for the period of the arrangement and the medium term assume a reversal of the recently unfavorable conditions. They also assume that the renewed pursuit of reform policies and the expeditious post-conflict reconstruction and reintegration efforts will lead to growing investor confidence and sustained foreign support (see Tables 8 and 9, and Figure 2). Ethiopia’s external position has been beset by two major adverse exogenous factors-a cumulative terms of trade deterioration of 37 percent since 1997/98 and severe drought conditions over the past two years. The terms of trade are projected to improve significantly in the coming years, with coffee prices recovering gradually and oil prices declining from the peak reached in 200010 1. Furthermore, the removal of the external restrictions and the taking of other steps to improve the environment for private sector activity are expected to encourage a steady expansion in nontraditional exports. Also, food imports are to return to normal levels once cereal stocks have been replenished; a contribution can be expected from the main harvest in 200010 1, which is likely to produce a bumper cereal crop. During the period of reconstruction, import requirements would remain high. More generally, through the medium term, import levels reflect the anticipated large increase in investment-geared to providing basic public infrastructure and building the production facilities needed for the envisaged output expansion. 33. After the initial years, reliance on foreign savings would gradually ease in spite of the considerable rise in the investment rate. Private savings would improve in response to efficiency gains brought about by the planned reforms, in particular those geared at ” A regulation requiring imports to be shipped by Ethiopian Shipping Lines (ESL), if the port of shipping is served by the ESL, results in about 25 percent of all imports being shipped by the national shipping line. This regulation does not constitute a nontariff barrier.

In the initial years, the rise in public savings would boost domestic savings, reflecting improvements in tax revenue, a rollback in defense spending, and the eventual phasing out of the emergency post-conflict programs. In the longer run, public sector external borrowing would shift toward project- related financing while reliance on balance of payments loans would cease. However, given Ethiopia’s unsustainable debt-service burden, substantial debt relief will be needed. 34. Against this backdrop, the current account deficit (including official transfers) is expected to decline initially only modestly-from 7% percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to about 6 percent a year in 2000/01 and 2001/02-before resuming a downward trend, starting with a deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 2002/03. During the PRGF-supported program period, the World Bank is expected to provide balance of payments support on the order of US$325 million (in addition to the emergency post conflict loans of US$428 million mentioned above); its first disbursement of US$lSO million early in the second quarter of 2001 will be critical to rebuild international reserves. Furthermore, consistent with pre- conflict levels of foreign assistance, it is expected that much of the sectoral development effort will be funded by multilateral and bilateral donors through grants and highly concessional loans, leading to an improvement in the capital account. With a view to regularizing debt service with its creditors and obtaining help in filling financing gaps during the PRGF-supported program period, the authorities intend to seek Paris Club rescheduling of pre-cutoff-date arrears and maturities falling due through end-December 2003, and to request treatment of arrears and debt service to non-Paris Club creditors on at least comparable terms. The program also assumes the provision of interim debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative from the Fund, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB) beginning in 2001/0212. 35. Any external public borrowing during the program period will be contracted only on highly concessional terms, with the goal of keeping the external debt burden manageable. The peak in external borrowing during the arrangement period (averaging 7.2 percent of GDP annually) is explained by the transitory post-conflict requirements and the need to resume sector development programs, as well as by the time needed to raise public savings to their sustainable levels over the longer term, by building up tax revenue capacity and rolling back military spending. Beginning with the medium term, funding of poverty and development-targeted government outlays would be commensurate with a significantly lower level of borrowing than in the immediate post-conflict years (averaging 2.7 percent of GDP annually during 2003/04-2006/07). I2 The financing gap of US$ 1.1 billion in 2000/O 1 would be filled by disbursements under the post-conflict programs and a balance-of-payments-support operation from the World Bank (totaling US$269 million), as well as debt relief on Naples terms from the Paris Club and non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (US$822 million).

The envisaged traditional relief on Naples terms under a three-year agreement with the Paris Club would involve rescheduling of arrears and other debt relief totaling about US$822 million in 2000/O 1, US$32 million in the second fiscal year, and US$2 1 million in the third year. The program assumes that the interim I-IIPC Initiative debt relief would allow a pari passu increase in the authorities’ poverty-targeted spending of US$46 million (0.7 percent of GDP) in the second fiscal year and US$77 million (1.1 percent of GDP) in the third fiscal year.13 As indicated above (in para. 22), HIPC Initiative debt relief is critical for allowing the needed expansion in poverty-targeted outlays. 37. A sensitivity analysis (see Table 9) shows the impact of deviations from the baseline assumptions on coffee prices, oil prices, and noncoffee export volumes. If coffee prices are 10 percent lower than projected in the baseline scenario in 2000/01, the balance of payments gap will be 0.3-0.4 percent of GDP larger each year thereafter than in the baseline. A similar impact will occur if oil prices are 10 percent higher in 2000/01. If the growth of noncoffee exports during 2000/01-2006/07 is 1 percentage point lower than in the baseline scenario each year, the balance of payments gap will be about 0.2 percent of GDP larger each year. 38. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) (presented in EBS/98/173, 10/29/98) has been revised on the basis of an updated macroeconomic scenario and a loan-by-loan analysis, conducted by the staffs of the Fund and the Bank in close collaboration with the authorities (forthcoming preliminary HIPC Initiative decision point document); the DSA also takes into account the recent economic developments and the government’s commitment to resume the reform path within the context of its poverty reduction strategy. The macroeconomic scenario illustrates that, with medium-term trends continuing, the current account deficit would narrow substantially over the next two decades. The private sector will be able to save more out of its increasing incomes, while public sector savings will increase owing to lower consumption (as a share of GDP) and improved revenue performance as the private sector expands and informal activities grow into the tax-paying, formal sector. With less reliance on foreign savings, project loans will decline gradually as a share of GDP, remaining the only source of debt-creating financing flows. 39. In the immediate post-conflict period, the debt burden (after traditional relief mechanisms) will rise by 2002/03 to 266 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services (net present value terms) from 243 percent in 1999/2000, because of the immediate large external borrowing needs; subsequently, the debt ratio would decline to 1’79 percent by I3 The assumptions underlying the interim HIPC assistance in 2001/02-2003/04 are that the Fund would provide US$S.S million in each of the first two years, and US$3.7 million in the third year, and the World Bank would provide US$15.8 million, US$23.4 million, and US$20.3 million. Phasing of the Fund contribution (15 percent each in the first two years, and 10 percent in 2003/04 as a percent of total HIPC assistance from the Fund) takes the peak in debt service to Fund into account (see para. 40). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - 2009/10 and to an average of 129 percent during 2010/l l-2019/20. Given the highly concessional borrowing terms, the debt-service ratio (under traditional debt-relief mechanisms) would fall from 19 percent in 1999/2000 to 15 percent in 2002/03, to 9 percent by 2009/10, and to an average of 7% percent during 2010/l l-2019/20 (forthcoming Preliminary HIPC Initiative decision point document). 40. The phasing of Ethiopia’s access under the requested PRGF arrangement implies a modest front-loading of disbursements to provide sufficient foreign reserves, so that the recently introduced external restrictions can be lifted at the outset of the program. Total access is consistent with the broad principles guiding access under the PRGF and the substantial, immediate balance of payments needs. As noted above, Ethiopia intends to approach its creditors, including under the Paris Club, to seek a rescheduling of eligible arrears and maturities falling due. Once its debt burden is reduced, Ethiopia should experience no difficulty in servicing its obligations to the Fund and has an adequate track record in servicing past debts. Payments to the Fund will peak initially in 2001/02- 2002/03 (Table lo), at SDR 12.5 million per year (equivalent to 1.2 percent of exports of goods and services and 1.8 percent of gross international reserves), and later again in 2006/07-2007/08, at SDR 11.1 million per year (equivalent to 0.7 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services and 1 percent of gross international reserves-Table 10). 41. The NBE will be subject to a safeguards assessment by the Fund to assess whether the accounting, internal control, reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to ensure the integrity of its operations. The authorities have already provided most of the required documentation to Fund staff, including external and internal audit reports, an organizational chart of the NBE, and lists of correspondent banks and government accounts, as well as legislation governing the NBE. Because of staff constraints, a Stage One Safeguard assessment will only be completed before the first review under the PRGF arrangement, which is expected by July 200 1. B. Structural Reforms 42. In addition to the structural reforms in the financial and external sectors described above, the government intends to take further steps to enhance the potential for economic growth and to reduce poverty, as detailed in the interim PRSP and the MEFP. Key areas of reform include capacity building and judicial and civil service reform-the corresponding plans and analyses are well advanced, and their implementation will help significantly to improve governance, transparency, and accountability. With a view to expediting private sector development, the government has launched a comprehensive study, with World Bank assistance, to identify regulatory constraints and the measures needed to redress them. Substantial progress has been made with the implementation of the privatization program, and the government’s strategy is to sell the bulk of remaining public enterprises over the next two years, including the large industrial enterprises. To further limit the role of government in commercial activities, foreign participation in the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation is envisaged in the near future, and a new regulatory framework for electricity utilities should facilitate private sector participation by 2001/02.

There is substantial unused capacity in the economy, and economic activity should therefore respond fairly quickly to the projected rise in investment, the improvement in confidence resulting from the cease-fire agreement, and the bumper cereal crop expected for 2000/01, following the extreme drought conditions prevailing until recently. It is, however, difficult to quantify the magnitude of the pickup in growth with any degree of precision. Therefore, monetary policy and expenditure management will have to respond with flexibility to ensure macroeconomic stability. The design of the emergency recovery programs and also the systems of budget execution in Ethiopia suggest that the desired institutional flexibility is in place. The financial condition and structure of the banking system is also a weak point, in particular, the competitive advantage enjoyed by the CBE, barriers to entry by foreign banks, poor capital adequacy and profitability, and a weak regulatory and supervisory environment. These weaknesses highlight the crucial importance of vigorous implementation of an appropriate financial sector reform. 44. It is even more difficult to project the behavior of output over the medium term because it will depend crucially on the speed of implementation of the reform program and its effects on productivity. The strong increase in public investment projected by the staff should in itself contribute to higher growth of potential output, provided the projected increase in public saving materializes and the quality of public spending improves. This suggests the need to focus on capacity building, with technical assistance from the development partners and the Fund. The ratio of private investment to GDP is also expected to support higher GDP growth, provided that confidence continues to strengthen with further progress toward a lasting peace, and that the government succeeds in improving public services and infrastructure. 45. A further challenge for the successful implementation of the reform strategy results from the need to adjust policies in case of unfavorable terms of trade developments. On that score, the authorities were in the past prepared to pass negative price shocks on to producers (in the case of coffee) and to consumers (in the case of oil). The authorities and the staff may need to reassess the policies envisaged under the program, in the event that the terms of trade assumptions underlying the program do not materialize. V. STATISTICAL ISSUES 46. The government realizes that the coverage, quality, and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics need to be strengthened considerably. Steps were taken last year to compile more reliable national consumer price indices and to reduce the reporting lags of price data. Regarding other macroeconomic data, the government plans to provide more resources to the Central Statistical Authority to further reduce the reporting lags of fiscal operations, particularly of the regional governments, and to eliminate discrepancies between fiscal and monetary accounts. The reliability of the national income accounts needs to be enhanced with more frequent surveys; similarly, better balance of payments data require comprehensive customs records and technical assistance from international institutions. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - program also calls for improvement in the data essential to assessing poverty in Ethiopia and monitoring poverty reduction programs. In this context, the government will develop, with technical assistance from the World Bank, a database to monitor the output and outcomes of the poverty reduction programs. VI. STAFF APPRAISAL 47. Building upon a solid record of macroeconomic stabilization and deregulation in the first half of the 199Os, the government set out to implement a development strategy directed toward poverty reduction in the context of an ESAF arrangement (1996/97- 1998/99). During this period, there was notable, although uneven, progress with market- oriented reforms. However, adverse circumstances-including the border conflict with Eritrea, drought conditions, and deteriorating terms of trade-increasingly eroded the government’s efforts at consolidating the progress made in stabilizing the economy. Rising military spending widened fiscal deficits and the external position weakened, but inflation was contained and economic growth averaged 3 percent in 1996/97- 1998199. However, and notwithstanding Ethiopia’s reform efforts in the last decade, economic growth was insufficient to raise standards of living. Per capita GDP remained flat and social indicators are among the weakest in the world. 48. The economic situation deteriorated in 1999/2000 under severe drought conditions, a further sharp deterioration in the terms of trade, and an intensification of the conflict with Eritrea. In response to growing imbalances, the government imposed external restrictive measures in January 2000, but by end- 199912000 international reserves were down to two months of import cover. 49. In the second half of 2000, Ethiopia resumed its economic reform efforts under less adverse circumstances. A cease-fire agreement was reached in June and a peace agreement was signed in December. The government reconfirmed and updated its poverty reduction strategy and, subsequently, elaborated it within a framework of macroeconomic stability in a comprehensive interim PRSP. The strategy seeks to promote rapid, broad-based, and equitable growth by rightly emphasizing rural development and improvements in physical and human capital, and addressing the immediate post-conflict reconstruction and reintegration needs. The authorities’ strong ownership of the program is evident. 50. Several elements in the authorities’ medium-term economic program are crucial for sparking economic growth while building a comfortable foreign reserve position. With a view to restoring conditions that are conducive to private sector activity, the authorities have taken a very important step by lifting, at the start of the program, the recently imposed import duty surcharge and other administrative restrictions hampering trade. They also have obtained World Bank support for large-scale emergency programs. Careful monitoring of these programs will be important to ensure that critical infi-astructure is repaired rapidly, and that support reaches the targeted recipients and is used to improve their income-earning capacity. In order to support the envisaged rise in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - investment, financial policies are geared to boosting domestic savings, with the public sector taking.the lead in the early years. 51. The program’s reliance on strong financial donor support takes account of the major challenge Ethiopia is prepared to tackle: rebuilding core development spending from the compressed levels of the recent years and healing the economy from confict- related damages while sharply rolling back military expenditure. Over the medium term; financial policies and structural reforms, as well as a gradual improvement in Ethiopia’s terms of trade, are expected to strengthen the external position, so that project loans would remain as the only debt-creating financing flows. In the interim years, when savings capacity is still being built, substantial balance of payments support, at highly concessional- preferably grant-terms, will be needed. Given Ethiopia’s low level of income, debt relief from its creditors will be essential. 52. The authorities’ program for 2000/01-2002/03 rests on two strong pillars: reforms of the public finances and of the financial sector, both of which are geared to achieving a more efficient use of resources and boosting domestic savings. The authorities recognize that fiscal consolidation will need to involve the reprioritization of expenditures from defense toward poverty alleviation and a strong tax revenue performance, so as to make room for greater private sector activity. Nonetheless, it cannot be overstated that adherence to the fiscal target in 2000/01 will be essential for the credibility of the program. Staying within the envisaged expenditure envelope, while speeding up the execution of the sectoral development programs (SDPs), requires that the government follow through on its commitment to curtail defense spending. The staff welcomes the authorities’ indication that they hope to achieve a steeper decline in defense spending than envisaged in the program, and the fact that actual defense expenditures in the early months of the current fiscal year have been below appropriations, thus providing a cushion for budgetary contingencies. The SDPs contribute a solid platform for targeting poverty alleviation. Past difficulties in execution should be overcome by making effective use of technical and financial assistance from the World Bank and other development partners to enhance implementation capacity. Eventual debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative would allow the authorities to substantially raise education, health, agriculture, and road expenditure above the baseline trajectory. 53. The staff welcomes the government’s preparedness to compress expenditures under special budgetary provisions should the overall ascal situation or other developments so require. To be able to take such decisions in a timely manner, the authorities will need to proceed decisively with their plans for refining budget monitoring and reporting systems. Crucial steps in this direction will be public expenditure reviews, conducted annually in collaboration with development partners. Their focus will be broadened beyond the monitoring of priority expenditure areas to cover the enhancement of systems-also at the regional level-that track expenditures, and assess impacts and outcomes. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - 54. The tax revenue strategy builds upon streamlining direct taxation and the - incentive system; shifting emphasis toward indirect domestic taxation so as to make room for a further reduction in external tariffs; and revamping the tax administration. The recent increase in the sales tax rate and the ongoing overhaul of income taxation are reassuring. To avoid slippages in the remaining reform agenda, the task force for tax reform implementation and the large-taxpayer unit need to be established within the next few months. Both, together in close collaboration with the regional administrations, will have to play a major role in expediting the preparation of a value-added tax-with legislation expected to be enacted by parliament before end-2001, so that implementation can begin in early 2003. In the interim years, the government needs to be ready to expand the coverage or raise selectively the rates of other indirect taxes, if necessary, to safeguard the program’s revenue objective. 55. As envisaged, the authorities have implemented, at the outset of the financial sector reform program, major measures to improve monetary management and the functioning of financial markets by sterilizing excess reserves of commercial banks and removing distortions from the foreign exchange market. Henceforth, the use of monetary policy instruments should replace the rationing of foreign exchange or sustained intervention in the interbank market. The success of the reform requires that the authorities maintain the momentum in pushing ahead with the rehabilitations plans for the smaller banks, the reform of the largest state-owned bank (the CBE), initiatives to strengthen banking supervision, and preparations toward greater autonomy of the national bank. For the CBE, a full-fledged strategy (beyond managerial reform) that responds to the need to deepen financial markets and foster active competition remains to be mapped out within the next few months. The authorities’ commitment to decisive progress in this respect will be a landmark for meaningful financial sector reform. 56. The program provides a springboard for progress in key structural reform areas, notably to improve governance, transparency, accountability, and public sector efficiency. In addition, through liberalizing the foreign trade and exchange regimes, further integration into the global economy is to be achieved. Regarding the foreign exchange regime, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to eliminate the remaining restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current account transactions by end- March 2001 and to move to an active interbank foreign exchange market, thereby setting the stage for acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The multiple currency practice arising from the operation of the weekly wholesale foreign exchange auction will be eliminated once the interbank foreign exchange market is fully active by October 200 1. In light of Ethiopia’s circumstances and the explicit timetable for the removal of the multiple currency practice, the staff recommends its approval. 57. The staff welcomes the government’s emphasis on improving the coverage, quality, and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics, as evidenced by plans to provide more resources to the Central Statistical Authority and efforts to reduce the reporting lag of the fiscal operations of regional governments. Technical assistance is also being offered by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - development partners to expand and update socioeconomic statistics in a more timely manner, so as to facilitate well-targeted and well-monitored poverty reduction programs. 58. With the reforms it has begun to undertake, Ethiopia appears well placed to return to a path of sustained, high economic growth. While it remains vulnerable to external shocks, policies to encourage agricultural growth, and improve food security and reforms to facilitate private sector development will reduce vulnerability over time. As noted, the program reflects the authorities’ strong ownership, as evidenced by the comprehensive interim PRSP. The pace of policy implementation at the start of the program attests to the authorities’ commitment to consolidate public finances, strengthen financial sector performance, and remove restrictions. Lastly, partial information suggests that macroeconomic developments have stayed broadly on course since the beginning of this fiscal year. Based on this track record and the strength of the proposed program, the staff recommends the approval of Ethiopia’s request for a three-year PRGF arrangement. 59. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia be held on the standard 1 a-month cycle.

PROPOSED DECISION In view of the foregoing, the following draft decisions are proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: A. 2000 Article IV Consultation-Exchange Measures Subject to Article VIII 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Ethiopia’s exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 3, in light of the 2000 Article IV consultation with Ethiopia conducted under Decision 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Ethiopia maintains a multiple currency practice arising from a spread of more than two percent between different buying rates at the weekly wholesale foreign exchange auctions conducted by the National Bank of Ethiopia, which is subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 3. In the circumstances of Ethiopia, the Fund grants approval of the retention of this multiple currency practice until October 1,200 1 or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia, whichever is earlier. B. PRGF Arrangement 1. The government of Ethiopia has requested a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in a total amount equivalent to SDR 86.9 million. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-29- 2. The Fund determines that the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Ethiopia set forth in EBD/Ol/lO provides a sound basis for the development of a fully participatory PRSP, and for Fund concessional financial assistance. 3. The Fund approves the arrangement set forth inEBS/O1/13and decides that Ethiopia may request the first disbursement under the arrangement, on the condition that the information provided by Ethiopia on the implementation of the measures specified in Table 2 attached to the letter dated January 29,200l is accurate.

To support these objectives and policies, the Trustee grants the requested three-year arrangement in accordance with the following provisions, and subject to the provisions applying to assistance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Trust. 1. (a) For a period of three years from February [ 161,200 1, Ethiopia will have the right to obtain loan disbursements from the Trustee in a total amount equivalent to SDR 86.9 million, subject to the availability of resources in the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Trust.

The phasing of, and conditions for, disbursements during the second year of this arrangement shall be determined in the context of the second review of Ethiopia’s program contemplated in paragraph 2(d) of this arrangement. 2. Ethiopia will not request the second or third disbursement, specified respectively in paragraphs l(c)(ii) and l(c)(iii) above: (a) if the Managing Director of the Trustee finds that, with respect to the second disbursement, the data as of March 3 1,200 1 and, with respect to the third disbursement, the data as of September 30,200l indicate that: (9 the ceiling on net domestic assets of the National Bank of Ethiopia, or (ii) the floor on net foreign assets of the National Bank of Ethiopia, or (iii) the ceiling on net domestic financing of the general government, or (iv) the ceiling on the stock of outstanding external payment arrears, or w the ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the public sector, specified in Table 1 of the Memorandum and in the Technical Memorandum, was not observed; or 0) if the Managing Director of the Trustee finds: (0 with respect to the second disbursement, that Ethiopia has not carried out its intentions with respect to the signature of a management contract for the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia by June 30,200 1, as specified in Table 2 of the Memorandum; or (ii) with respect to the second disbursement, that Ethiopia has not carried out its intentions with respect to the establishment of a large taxpayer unit by July 1,200 1, as specified in Table 2 of the Memorandum; or Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-48- APPENDIX I (cl if Ethiopia: (0 has imposed or intensified restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, or (ii) has introduced or modified multiple currency practices, or (iii) has concluded bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII, or (iv) has imposed or intensified import restrictions for balance of payments reasons, or w has accumulated any new external payment arrears; or 69 until the Trustee has determined that with regard to the second disbursement, the first review of Ethiopia’s program referred to in paragraph 3 of the Letter and with regard to the third disbursement the second program review referred to in paragraph 3 of the Letter has been completed. When Ethiopia is prevented from requesting disbursements under this arrangement because of this paragraph 2, such disbursements will be resumed only after consultation has taken place between the Trustee and Ethiopia and understandings have been reached regarding the circumstances in which Ethiopia may request further disbursements. 3. In accordance with paragraph 3 of the Letter, Ethiopia will provide the Trustee with such information as the Trustee requests in connection with the progress of Ethiopia in implementing the policies and reaching the objectives of the program supported by this arrangement. 4. During the period of this arrangement Ethiopia shall remain in close consultation with the Trustee. In accordance with paragraph 4 of the Letter, Ethiopia will consult with the Trustee on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate at the initiative of the Government or whenever the Managing Director of the Trustee requests such a consultation. Moreover, after the period of this arrangement and while Ethiopia has outstanding financial obligations to the Trustee arising from loan disbursements under this arrangement, Ethiopia will consult with the Trustee from time to time, at the initiative of the Government or whenever the Managing Director of the Trustee requests consultation on Ethiopia’s economic and financial policies. These consultations may include correspondence and visits of officials of the Trustee to Ethiopia or of representatives of Ethiopia to the Trustee.

In September 1998, the authorities eliminated the remaining restrictions on making of payments for the current international transactions relating to business travel, education, and health, and increased holiday Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - APPENDIX II travel allowances to US$l,200 per person per trip. In addition, the National Bank of Ethiopia _ (NBE) allowed the purchase of foreign exchange by foreigners in Ethiopia for remittances with only ex-post verification. It maintained, however, restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange to non-Ethiopian nationals for education abroad. Effective end-August 1998, exporters were allowed to retain 10 percent of their export proceeds in foreign exchange for an indefinite period. The remaining balance could be retained for a period of 28 days, after which it had to be converted into local currency by the customers’ bank using the official rate (NBE’s marginal rate of the week in the wholesale auction) unless an exporter had spent it on eligible imports within 28 days. All exporters must prove to the NBE that they have repatriated 100 percent of the previous exports’ proceeds before being allowed to obtain an export license again. Facing foreign exchange reserve losses, however, since July 1999, the authorities have exercised a de facto rationing at foreign exchange auctions as the requests of the highest bidders were not always fully satisfied, while lower bids received an allocation of foreign exchange. In addition, in early 2000 the NBE imposed restrictive new regulations on the authorization of import applications, when it introduced a 100 percent advance deposit requirement and non-uniform ceilings across banks on their authority to approve import permits. VIII. Article IV Consultations Ethiopia is on the standard la-month cycle. At the conclusion of the 1999 Article IV consultation discussions on July 27, 1999 (SM/99/166; 7/12/99), the Executive Board adopted the following decision: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Ethiopia’s exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 1999 Article XIV with Ethiopia, in the light of the 1999 Article IV consultation with Ethiopia, conducted under Decision 5392-(77/63) adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Ethiopia maintains a restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions described in SM/99/166, in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, in the form of a limitation imposed on the availability of foreign exchange for the making of payments for holiday travel. Ethiopia also maintains an exchange restriction arising from the limitation on the availability of foreign exchange to Ethiopian residents who are not Ethiopian citizens for education abroad, which is subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), and multiple currency practices arising from (a) a spread of more than two percent between different buying rates at the weekly wholesale foreign exchange auctions conducted by the National Bank of Ethiopia, and (b) from the requirement that residents surrender ninety percent of their foreign exchange at the marginal exchange rate observed at the weekly wholesale auction, which are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 3. The Fund: (9 encourages Ethiopia to eliminate the measure maintained under Article XIV, Section 2, as soon as its balance of payments position permits, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-51- APPENDIX II (ii) in the circumstances of Ethiopia, approves the retention of the multiple currency.. practice arising from the operation of the weekly wholesale auction until the completion of the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia or the expiration of one year from the date of this Decision, whichever is earlier, and (iii) urges Ethiopia to eliminate the exchange restriction and the multiple currency practice arising from the surrender requirement that are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3, respectively. Ix. HIPC Initiative-related Issues In discussing the preliminary document for Ethiopia under the HIPC Initiative on November 6, 1998, Directors agreed that Ethiopia should be eligible under the Initiative. Most Directors agreed that the decision point could be reached at the time of the midterm review of the second annual ESAF arrangement, expected for the spring of 1999. Other Directors, however, favored a decision point at the time of the approval of the third annual arrangement. In the event, the midterm review of the second annual arrangement was not completed, and the three-year commitment period expired in October 1999. X.

In the immediate postwar period, the Bank’s objective is to help the government deal as quickly as possible with the human, material, and financial destabilization caused by the war with Eritrea, while simultaneously reengaging on core development issues. As of November 1,2000, the Bank had 13 active credits in Ethiopia and 61 loans/credits closed. Of the latter, about 80 percent were IDA credits (including a structural adjustment credit (SAC)). No new projects were presented to the Board for approval after the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 1999 and in FY 2000, as the Bank suspended new loans to both combatants in the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict. However, disbursements from already approved projects continued. Since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on June 18,2000, Bank lending to Ethiopia resumed in July with the approval of the Women’s Development Initiatives Project. In September, the Board approved Ethiopia’s Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project. The latter was approved under a Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for Africa. Ethiopia was one of the first two countries to benefit from this program. 2. In response to the present emergency situation in Ethiopia, the World Bank agreed to the reallocation of US$30 million from the current portfolio to the emergency program: US$17.5 million from the Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation Development Fund, US$9.8 million from Energy II, and US$2.5 million from the Ethiopian Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Program. Concurrently, two emergency operations were prepared-the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project (EDRP) and the Emergency Recovery Program (ERP). IDA’s support for these projects was approved by the Bank’s Board in December 2000 and is on the order of $170 million and $230 million, respectively. A Supplemental to the current National Fertilizer Project of $50 million will soon be submitted for Board consideration, and it is anticipated that a quick disbursing emergency support credit will be prepared in early 2001. 3. In October 2000, a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) identified significant weaknesses in portfolio implementation. In response, a Portfolio Improvement Program (PIP) was prepared and agreed with the government. Implementation of the PIP will be monitored by a joint IDA/government team. Early signs of improvement are encouraging. Ethiopia is a candidate for assistance under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). The Fund and the Bank are working together to complete a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and a preliminary HIPC decision point document for consideration by the Boards of both institutions in early 200 1. 4. The Bank is also providing significant nonlending assistance through a close policy dialogue, and studies including Poverty and Policies for the New Millennium (green cover, October 1999); a Country Economic Memorandum - Transitions in a Poor Economy (buff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - APPENDIX III cover, June 1999); and a Public Expenditure Review (gray cover, August 2000). A full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) will be prepared in FY 2002. An Interim Support Strategy (ISS), to guide the Bank’s activities during the next 12-24 months, was approved by the Bank Board, together with the two emergency operations (EDRP and ERP). The World Bank Institute (WBI) has helped train Ethiopian nationals in several areas. In FY 2000, there were four nationally targeted activities in the areas of economic journalism (via distance learning), agriculture management (a training-of-trainers course), credit risk management, and commercial banking and bank supervision. Ethiopia has joined the Global Development Learning Network, which will provide it with regular access to WBI courses using distance learning techniques and facilitate Ethiopia’s participation in the global or regional development debates. The distance learning center is located in the Ethiopian Civil Service College in Addis Ababa. 5. The IFC is carrying out most of its investment processing from its regional hubs rather than from Washington. This is part of a corporate-wide effort to increase the IFC presence in the field. There has been an appropriate transfer of staff from headquarters to these offices. This will improve the timing and quality of its services. As a result, it has closed its office in Addis Ababa. The regional hub in Nairobi will serve Ethiopia. In FY 1999, the IFC’s Board approved an $8.6 million investment in the Sheba Tannery project (producing finished leather goods for export). The Technical Assistance project to set up a stock exchange in Ethiopia has been funded. The IFC has also supported a Plant Hire study, which has been completed and disseminated to interested parties in Ethiopia and elsewhere. However, investment activity has been curtailed by the war. With the return of peaceful conditions and continued reforms to improve the enabling environment, the IFC is prepared to resume a broader range of investment and assistance activities besides technical assistance and capacity building. 6. MIGA and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) are assisting in strengthening the capacity of the Ethiopian Investment Authority to increase inward investment flows. MIGA has been asked to use its good offices to mediate the resolution of claims against the government of Ethiopia as a consequence of the uncompensated expropriations by the Dergue regime. At present, MIGA has no investment guarantees in Ethiopia. However, in the coming months, MIGA is expected to reextend insurance coverage to Ethiopia.

In the context of the last three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement, which called for the adoption of better statistical practices, the authorities improved the timeliness and coverage of national accounts. Preliminary national accounts are available through 1998/99 (July g-July 7), but data on sectoral deflators had not been compiled as of October 2000. A new series of GDP estimates using a 1995/96 base is under construction, but the quality of these estimates (which previously used a 1980/8 1 base) still suffers from lack of continuity in the conduct of some surveys. The Addis Ababa consumer price index (CPI) is published with a four- to six-week delay, but the national CPI is published with a two- to three-month lag and suffers from methodological problems. In March-April 2000, an STA mission visited Ethiopia to review CPI statistics. It recommended several changes that are under implementation, including efforts to ensure consistency between the national index and its urban and rural components. Public finances 2. Monthly federal government accounts are reported with a six- to eight-week lag. The consolidated general government (federal and regional) accounts are reported once a year. L The ongoing devolution of budgetary authority to regional governments l%rther eroded the quality of the general government accounts, owing to the lack of a unified accounting framework. The coverage of government finance statistics is incomplete (it excludes extrabudgetary funds, i.e., the privatization, road, fuel stabilization, and sugar auction funds), and there are discrepancies between data on domestic and foreign financing of the budget deficit and the monetary accounts. The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) established a joint reconciliation committee, which issued a set of recommendations to synchronize the recording of fiscal and monetary data, broaden the scope of institutional coverage, and improve the classification of accounts. Monetary accounts 3. The monetary survey is comprehensive and normally reported with a four-week lag. Progress has been made in adopting several key recommendations of the STA technical assistance mission of May-June 1998. Changes include correcting deficiencies in the estimation of international reserves of the banking system (which had been overestimated through the inclusion in the commercial banks’ balance sheets of foreign assets that were not freely usable) and of broad money (which was being overestimated through the inclusion in “currency in circulation” of demonetized old birr notes, as well as old birr notes held by the Central Bank of Eritrea). However, the coverage of the monetary survey still needs to be broadened to include other financial institutions (especially credit and savings cooperatives). Since 1999, “other items net” has decreased substantially, possibly implying classification problems for transactions that took place during 199912000. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - APPENDIX IV Balance of payments 4. Balance of payments data still require improvements in the coverage, valuation, timing, and classification of transactions. The authorities have begun working toward the adoption of the fifth edition of the Balance ufPaynent.s ManuaZ, but problems persist. In particular, key surveys recommended by the 1995 STA mission for the collection of basic data were not carried out until early 1999/2000. Import data still rely primarily on exchange control data, although the quality of that data has worsened in the wake of exchange system liberalization in 1998. The use of customs records to generate trade data has begun with the operationalization of the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) at major customs stations in February 1999, which should improve the timeliness and coverage of trade statistics. An export unit value index is available (with a two-year delay), but no import unit value index is produced. Data on official and private transfers and private capital flows are also weak. The NBE, in collaboration with the Ethiopia Investment Authority and other government agencies, is preparing a database on foreign direct investment, including a reporting system for tracking new investment. Social Indicators 5. Data on poverty exist in the form of several household surveys regularly conducted by the Central Statistical Authority (CSA).’ In addition, the World Bank has produced reports on Education/Health Sector Development Programs and the Poverty and Policies for the New Millennium Report (1999), which contain data on the poverty situation in Ethiopia. On the basis of this information, the government, with assistance from the World Bank, has constructed welfare indicators for measuring poverty reduction, including income and expenditure per capita, income inequality, literacy, malnutrition measures, and infant/child mortality. Adequate data do not exist on prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS, especially among the rural population, and it is not clear whether there is sufficient monitoring of food consumption among people living in drought-prone areas. ’ Examples of existing surveys include Household Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey (1995/96 and 199912000) and Welfare Monitoring Survey (1996,1997,1998, and 1999). Additional household and consumption surveys were carried out by the University of Addis Ababa in collaboration with Oxford University, but they are not currently available to the public or Fund staff.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Ethiopia On February 16, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Ethiopia.’ Background Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in July 1999, Ethiopia faced increasingly adverse circumstances for the continued implementation of its reform strategy-notably a severe drought, a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade, and an intensification of the conflict with Eritrea. Growth of real GDP weakened to 4.6 percent in 199912000 from 6.2 percent in the 1998199 fiscal year, whereas inflation remained in the low single digits.* The government sought to contain G expenditure pressures while accommodating higher defense spending and protecting priority social spending, however, the general government deficit (including grants) widened to 12.4 percent of GDP from 8.5 percent of GDP in 1998/99. In response to growing external imbalances, the government imposed restrictive measures in January 2000, but by July 2000, gross official foreign reserves were down to two months of import cover from almost 3 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. On the structural front, further progress was made in the area of privatization; the external audit of the state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia was completed by a foreign auditing firm in mid-2000; and work at strengthening tax collection continued. I Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial- information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the February 16, 2001 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report. * The Ethiopian fiscal year ends on July 7.

The government updated its poverty reduction strategy and, subsequently, refined it in a comprehensive interim poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) within a framework of macroeconomic stability. The strategy seeks to promote rapid, broad-based, and equitable growth by emphasizing rural development and improvements in physical and human capital, and by addressing immediate post-conflict reconstruction and reintegration needs. Moreover, financial and technical support from Ethiopia’s development partners is expected to complement the government’s efforts at reprioritizing budgetary expenditures toward poverty reduction and returning development programs in education, health, roads, utility and agricultural services to pre-conflict levels. To lay the basis for fiscal sustainability, the government has also adopted a comprehensive agenda to reform tax policy and build tax administration capacity. Reforms aimed at fostering efficiency in financial markets resumed in late 2000, and included steps to absorb excess reserves of commercial banks, remove external restrictions and other impediments to the functioning of the interbank and treasury bill markets, enhance banking supervision, and strengthen operations of key banking institutions. The government is also moving ahead on privatization and plans to remove obstacles to private sector development including through further reduction in external protection. Given the government’s reform strategy and signs of a strong rebound in agricultural output, the staff now projects that GDP will grow by almost 8 percent in 2000/01, despite the negative impact of the sharp drop in world prices of coffee (the main source of foreign exchange receipts) and the high bill for imports of petroleum products. Targeted fiscal consolidation, supported by prudent monetary policy and the expected resumption of foreign grants, is expected to help narrow the external current account deficit. The improvement in the fiscal position, including the reduction of the general government deficit to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2000101 (including spending on the post-conflict special programs, equivalent to almost 2 percentage points of GDP), reflects steep cuts in defense outlays, which are partly offset by higher spending on key social and infrastructure services linked to poverty reduction. Furthermore, the streamlining of income taxation and increases in indirect taxes are expected to boost tax revenue. The Board of the IMF approved a new three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) on [February 16,2001] and the government’s Interim PRSP was endorsed by the Boards of the IMF (on [. . .]) and the IDA (on [. . .I). Executive Board Assessment Public hformation Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
