The staff team included Mr. Allum (head), Mmes. Zhou and Tom-e (all MED), and Messrs. Bartholomew (MAE), Panth (PDR), Henstridge (FAD), and van den Andel (STA consultant), and was assisted by Mr. Bennett (Senior Resident Representative). Mr. Burton (MED) joined the team for the policy discussions. l Official contacts. The mission met with Prime Minister Ebeid, Ministers Boutros-Ghali (Economy and Foreign Trade), Hassanein (Finance), El-Darth (Planning and International Cooperation), Khattab (Public Enterprises), Central Bank Governor Hassan, Attorney General Abdel Wahed, other senior officials, and banking, industrial, and labor representatives. Mr. Shaalan, Executive Director for Egypt, and Mrs. Farid, Advisor to the ED, participated in the meetings. D The consultation followed a visit to Egypt by the Managing Director on May 13,2001, when exchange rate policy was a focus of discussions. . In concluding the last Article IV consultation on July 27,2000, Executive Directors underlined the need for restrained macroeconomic policies and sustained structural reforms to address Egypt’s weakened external situation and decline in international reserves. They concluded that the pound was almost certainly significantly overvalued, and urged Egypt to move to a more flexible exchange rate regime. Directors also expressed concern about problems with fiscal data. . Egypt has not accepted the obligations of Article VIII, and maintains a number of bilateral payments arrangements subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.

Significant official reserve losses in 1998/99 and 1999/00 reflected shocks to the balance of payments, domestic policy imbalances (notably strong credit growth), and real currency appreciation, as the pound appreciated with the U.S. dollar to which it was pegged. Reserve losses diminished last year (2000/01), but output growth slowed markedly, in large part due to a slowing of credit growth from earlier unsustainable rates. To help support official reserves and lay the basis for stronger external performance and growth, the pound has been permitted to depreciate 25 percent against the dollar since early-2000. In June 2001, Egypt signed an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) providing for phased tariff reductions, and also launched a successful debut Eurobond issue. Extension of the general sales tax to wholesale and retail transactions-an important step toward a full VAT-was adopted in July 2001 after parliamentary approval in May. Policy issues A key immediate challenge is to restore strong economic growth without undermining macroeconomic stability. The staff and authorities agreed that priorities are to: settle remaining domestic fiscal arrears; limit government borrowing to permit some recovery in private credit growth; maintain exchange rate flexibility; and press ahead with measures to signal that the structural reform program remains on track. It was further agreed that efforts to foster stronger economic growth through expansionary fiscal policies could adversely affect confidence and prove counterproductive. Banking indicators have deteriorated somewhat as a result of the economic slowdown and safeguarding the system is a priority. Supervision has been strengthened over the past year and FSAP participation in early 2002 will help identify further policy priorities. A more pro-business environment is needed to sustain strong growth and absorb Egypt’s rapidly rising labor force. Structural reform priorities include further privatization and a reduction of Egypt’s high tariff and other impediments to trade. While progress has been made in strengthening fiscal reporting, uncertainties about fiscal operations and weaknesses in the real sector database continue to hamper macroeconomic management. In June 2001, Egypt participated in the fiscal module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC).

During most of the 199Os, Egypt made considerable progress in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. The fiscal deficit was greatly reduced, inflation fell to low single digits under a currency peg to the U.S. dollar, and debt service indicators strengthened substantially, aided by debt reduction from official bilateral creditors. On the structural front, the early 1990s saw significant financial liberalization and initial progress in reducing Egypt’s high tariff protection. Reforms were reinvigorated under the 1996-98 stand-by arrangement, with good progress in privatization and further steps to reduce tariffs. These advances contributed to rising investment and stronger real GDP growth (5-6 percent). Although the external current account saw a rising deficit (to 3 percent of GDP in 1997/98), this was financed by strong capital inflows. 2. Economic performance weakened, however, in the late-1990s. The policy mix deteriorated (with a substantial upward revision to the fiscal deficit, continuing rapid credit growth, and slowing structural reforms); tourism experienced a temporary downturn; and global financing tightened after the Asian Crisis. At the same time, the pound continued to appreciate as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar to which it remained pegged. These developments resulted in sizeable official reserve losses (US$6 billion). Although official reserves stabilized at close to US$14 billion toward end-2000, supported, in part, by a sharp slowing of private credit growth, the latter was associated with a marked slowdown in economic growth. 3. Against this background, key areas of discussion during the 2001 Article IV consultations included: l Restoring strong economic growth while preserving macroeconomic stability; 0 Introducing further exchange rate flexibility; l Safeguarding the banking system; and l Strengthening Egypt’s macroeconomic database. II. ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSIN 1999/00 AND 2000/01’ A. Activity and Inflation 4. Economic growth has slowed significantly, primarily reflecting tight credit conditions. Although data weaknesses hamper analysis of recent developments in the real sector, it appears that economic growth slowed in the second half of 1999/00, weakening further in 2000/01, where the staffs preliminary assessment is of real GDP growth in the ‘Fiscal years ending June 30. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 3-3l% percent range (Appendix I; Table 1).2 The downturn in activity probably reflected, in large part, the sharp slowing of credit growth from earlier unsustainable rates, combined, to some extent, with temporary liquidity problems associated with government payments arrears, notably to contractors. These factors were exacerbated in the second half of 2000/01 by some deterioration in the tourism sector on account of regional developments. Egypt’s economic slowdown has not yet been reflected in the official unemployment statistics. 5. Consumer prices rose 2.2 percent in the year to June 2001, despite a 12 percent currency depreciation against the dollar over the same period.’ Continuing low inflation reflects several factors. First, the traded goods sector is relatively small, with merchandise imports equivalent to just 17 percent of GDP. Second, the depreciation was more limited (just 1 percent on the same basis) against the Euro, the currency of origin for about one-third of Egypt’s imports. Third, Egypt’s weak domestic economy continues to put downward pressure on pricing. B. Fiscal Monitoring and Developments 6. Updated fiscal accounts for 1998/99 through 2001/02 have been compiled using a new reporting framework developed over the past year with the authorities. This framework, which is based on data from the authorities’ treasury accounts, was developed following the government’s identification in late- 1999 of data discrepancies in the former reporting format.4 The new framework, which is consistent with the 1986 edition of the Government Financial Statistics Manual, permits analysis of fiscal activity at various levels of consolidation-at the level of the budget sector alone; for the broader government, including the net lending and other operations of the National Investment Bank (NIB) and General Authority for Supply of Commodities (GASC);’ and for the general government, including the financing and other operations of the Social Insurance Funds (SIFs) (Table 1).6 7. Although these fiscal accounts represent a significant advance in fiscal reporting, important, unresolved issues remain, clarification of which could lead to further revisions to the fiscal data. While, in principle, the general government accounts give the most complete and meaningful presentation of fiscal operations, they are probably less reliable than for the “This figure assumes continuing modest growth in the agriculture and service sectors, in line with official projections, together with zero real growth in the industrial sector. While industrial production data are not yet available for 200010 1, the latter assumption is consistent with the observed weakening in industrial imports and business survey responses. 3Depreciation is measured in domestic currency terms throughout this report. “See the discussion in the 2000 Article IV consultation report (SM/00/151 (716100); pps 6-10). ‘The GASC is an agent of the government that imports basic commodities (such as wheat and sugar) and sells them to the public at subsidized prices. ‘See Box 1 for a discussion of the activities of the NIB and SIFs. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- budget sector alone,’ due to remaining uncertainties about the accounts of the NIB and SIFs. In the case of the NIB, these uncertainties are unlikely to be resolved in advance of the conclusion of the ongoing audit, scheduled for completion mid-2002.8 9 More generally, it has not yet been possible to develop accounts for the expanded general government, including the economic authorities.” Table 1.

On current data, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have averaged 3-4 percent of GDP in recent years for the budget sector alone, rising to close to 6 percent of GDP when NIB net lending and GASC subsidies are included. After consolidating the surpluses of the SIFs, the fiscal deficit of the general government falls to under 1 percent of GDP (Table l).ll Public debt amounted to almost 100 percent of GDP in 2000/01 at the level of the budget sector, NIB, and GASC, but with a large part of these ‘Uncertainties also arise in regard to the comprehensiveness of the fiscal data reported for the budget sector, as the staff has not been provided with supporting budgetary documents, including the audited statement of the treasury accounts for 1998/99, which was submitted to parliament in mid-2000, and provisionally approved by the latter in mid-200 1. 8 The duration of the NIB audit reflects the scale and variety of its assets, equivalent to over US$40 billion, or 53 percent of GDP. ‘For example, the NIB accounts show acquisitions of unidentified assets of between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent of GDP on an annual basis, currently treated below the line as a (negative) financing item rather than as net lending. A reclassification to the latter basis would significantly increase the recorded deficit. “The public economic authorities consist of fully owned public enterprises that are organized on commercial principles, including the state petroleum company (EGPC), Suez Canal Authority, the power, water, post, and telecommunications utilities, and the ports authority. “Differences relative to fiscal data prepared for 1998/99 for last year’s consultation largely reflect differences in coverage and classification (Box 2). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- representing obligations to the SIFs, the figure falls to about 64 percent at the level of the general government (consolidating the SIFs). l2 Of this figure, about one-third is held by the central bank, reducing holdings by commercial banks and the nonbank public to about 44 percent of GDP, of which a large part is held by banks to meet prudential liquidity requirements.13 Box 1. The Social Insurance Funds and National Investment Bank Egypt’s current social insurance system was established in 1975, comprising two Social Insurance Funds (SIFs). The Government Sector Fund insures about 4 million government workers, while the Public and Private Sector Fund insures about 6 million workers in public enterprises and the private sector, including a number of self-employed, casual workers, and workers abroad. The system provides coverage against old age, disability, and death. The two schemes cover about half of Egypt’s estimated 19 million workforce: coverage of casual workers and workers in the informal sector is limited. The SIFs generate large operating surpluses, estimated at 6 percent of GDP in 1999100. The SIF revenues amounted to a little over I2 percent of GDP in that year, including employee and employer contributions (3.2 percent of GDP), other budgetary transfers (1.9 percent of GDP), and SIF investment incomes (3.7 percent of GDP). By contrast, SIF expenditures amounted to slightly over 6 percent of GDP, primarily comprising benefit payments. The increase in SIF surpluses horn about 4 percent of GDP a decade ago primarily reflects rising investment incomes on the growing SIF investment portfolio, financed out of the surplus of contributions and other transfers over benefit payments. The National Investment Bank (NIB) was established in 1980 to manage the surpluses of the SIFs. Although it also receives postal savings deposits and issues its own investment certificates, the bulk of its financing comprises SIF investments. In 1999100, these amounted to almost 90 percent of total NIB fmancing (or 4.4 percent of GDP). The NIB, which reports to the Ministry of Planning, provides financing for three broad types of activity: the investment program of the government (representing about one-half of outstanding loans); the investment program of the public economic authorities (24 percent); and other loans and investments (25 percent), including loans to public companies, investments in joint venture companies, and soft loans for housing and reclamation projects. Largely reflecting the accumulated surpluses of the SIFs over the past two decades, the NIB has accumulated assets of close to LE 178 billion at end-June 2000 (53 percent of GDP). While the NIB is classified as a nonbank financial institution, its activities are large in relation to the banking system, with NIB assets being equivalent to 55 percent of the combined assets of Egypt’s commercial and investment banks at end-June 2000. On current policies, the operating surpluses of the SIFs are likely to decline over the decade ahead as pension benefit payments begin to rise more quickly than contributions. This will eventually pose challenges for the NIB as it adjusts to a shrinking financing base. l2 This figure excludes net present value of the SIFs’ pension and other obligations, the actuarial value of which is uncertain. 131n June and August 200 I, respectively, Standard and Poors and Fitch lowered their ratings on Egypt’s domestic currency debt, noting that Egypt’s public debt of 95 percent of GDP substantially exceeded levels in comparably ranked countries. This analysis, while reportedly for the general government, appears to include NIB liabilities to the SIFs.

Revisions to the Fiscal Reporting System This box summarizes the main factors accounting for the downward revision to the estimated 1998199 fiscal deficit for the budget sector, NIB, and GASC, reduced from 5.9 percent of GDP in last year’s consultation report to 4.6 percent on the latest data. Of the 1.3 percentage point reduction in the estimated deficit, about one-quarter (or 0.3 percentage points) reflects data revisions. While revenue receipts have been revised down by 0.7 percent of GDP for 1998199, this was more than offset by a downward revision of I. 1 percent of GDP to expenditures and net lending. The latter is more than accounted for by a recalculation of NIB net lending to entities other than the government and economic authorities, revised down by 1.5 percent of GDP. (This revision, together with the other data on NIB activities, is subject to further revision in light of the ongoing audit of the NIB.) The remaining 1 percentage point reduction in the fiscal deficit reflects changes in coverage and classification. In contrast to the fiscal presentation in last year’s consultation report, grant receipts are now scored above the line, consistent with standard GFS treatment: this strengthens the fiscal position in 1998199 by 0.6 percent of GDP. The remaining difference reflects changes in coverage, specifically the exclusion from the fiscal accounts of the foreign-financed investments of the public economic authorities (PEAS), estimated at 0.4 percent of GDP in 1998199, which were included in the deficit reported for last year’s consultation. While it is recognized that many of the PEAS carry out quasi-fiscal activities, further review of this sector will be required before developing a broader general government balance including the PEAS. 9. The fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened by up to 1 percent of GDP between 1998/99 and 2000/01 (depending on the level of fiscal consolidation), rather than narrowing as envisaged in last year’s consultation (Table 1). Fiscal slippages reflected rapid growth of recurrent expenditures set against weak revenue performance. At the level of the budget sector, NIB, and GASC, total revenues are projected to have declined by 0.6 percent of GDP between 1998/99 and 2000/01, as sluggish import growth contributed to a decline in trade taxes in relation to GDP (Appendix I; Tables 3-4). Over the same two-year period, recurrent expenditures increased by 1.5 percent of GDP, reflecting strong growth in public sector wages and salaries (0.6 percent of GDP) and other current spending (0.9 percent of GDP). Capital spending and net lending remained a sizeable 7.1 percent of GDP in 2000/01, but declined from 8.0 percent of GDP 2 years earlier, as falling capital expenditures, including on the mega projects,14 more than offset higher net lending. 10. Rising domestic arrears payments and a one-off debt assumption required increased government resort to bank financing in 2000/01. Sizeable payments arrears were accumulated on investment projects in recent years (the precise timing is uncertain). As part of a program for settling these arrears, the government made payments last year amounting to 2.3 percent of GDP, up from 1.5 percent in 1999/00. I5 In an additional “below 14Large public projects have been initiated to expand Egypt’s agricultural land through irrigation in the Western Delta, the South of the New Valley area (the Toshka scheme), and on the border with Sudan. In addition, large port and industrial development zones are being established at East Port Said and Suez. “Arrears on current expenditures, which are recorded on a cash basis, are recorded “above-the-line”. By contrast, arrears on capital expenditures, which are on an accruals basis, are recorded “below-the-line”.

To finance these activities as well as the fiscal deficit, government borrowing from the banking system rose to an estimated 4.4 percent of GDP in 2000/O 1, up from 2-3 percent of GDP in the preceding two years. 11. As discussed in last year’s staff report, the revisions to the fiscal accounts raise questions about the accuracy of fiscal reporting under past Fund arrangements. As revised fiscal accounts for 1997/98 and earlier years have not yet been compiled, the staff remains unable to reach any conclusion on whether incorrect fiscal data were reported to the Fund for this period (Box 3). Box 3. Possible Issues Related to Fiscal Reporting under Past Fund Arrangements Fiscal data revisions. As discussed in last year’s consultation report ((SMi00115 1, 7/6/00), pps 6-7), concerns about the scale of investment spending in large-scale projects together with discrepancies between debt and financing data led the authorities to review the 1998199 fiscal estimates in late 1999. As a result of this review, the fiscal deficit was revised up from 1.3 percent to 4.2 percent of GDP.’ Although the fiscal data for 1997198 and earlier years were not revised, sizable discrepancies between the financing and debt data also exist for this period. Accuracy of past fiscal reporting. The revision to the fiscal data for 1998199 did not raise issues of misreporting, since: (i) there was no Fund arrangement in effect during 1998/99, and (ii) fiscal data are not covered by Article VIII, Section 5 (unless relevant for performance criteria). Revision to the data for 1997198 and earlier years when arrangements were in effect also would not involve the Guidelines on Misreporting as no purchases were made under the last two arrangements (which were precautionary), and the earlier arrangements were beyond the statute of limitations under the Guidelines. However, should it appear that the reported data for 1997198 and earlier periods were incorrect, it might raise issues under Article VIII, Section 5 as the data involved were relevant for the performance criteria under the arrangements? concerning the fiscal deficit and its domestic financing. Strengthening fiscal reporting. Following last year’s consultation, the authorities have worked with the staff to develop an updated fiscal reporting framework. Initial progress to this end was summarized in Mr. Chabrier’s memorandum of November 30, 2000 to Members of the Executive Board, and subsequently reviewed in an Executive Board discussion of country matters on January 30,200l. During this meeting, the authorities’ view was communicated that, given the heavy workload of the Ministry of Finance, the government’s priority was to establish a comprehensive and transparent fiscal reporting framework that accurately reflects the stance of fiscal policy in Egypt and that strengthens fiscal reporting in the future; in regard to the fiscal accounts for 1997198 and earlier years, it was indicated that a review of this data would not be possible before completion of an audit of the activities of the NIB, scheduled for completion by mid-2002. During the 200 1 Article IV consultation mission, the authorities indicated that the first stage of this audit had been completed, covering the borrowing of the economic authorities, and that the second stage, to be completed over the year ahead, would cover the operations of the NIB. It was not envisaged that the completion of the audit could be advanced. ‘The institutional coverage of the deficit for purposes of these data was the budget sector, GASC, and investment expenditures of the economic authorities. A somewhat different coverage is adopted for purposes of the new reporting framework (see Box 2). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- C. Monetary and Financial Sector Developments 12. Monetary conditions were tightened in 1999100 to support the Egyptian pound, but subsequently eased with the shift to greater exchange rate flexibility. Interbank interest rates rose 2 percentage points in 1999/00 as losses of international reserves were only partly sterilized by increased central bank credit to the government, contributing to some slowing of the narrow and broad money aggregates. With greater exchange rate flexibility in 2000/01 and continuing low inflation, monetary conditions were eased, with the earlier increase in interest rates largely reversed.16 Tighter financial policies in 1999/00, together with institutional limits on further credit expansion, resulted in a marked slowing of private credit growth from earlier unsustainable rates (Box 4). This process continued in 2000/01 as an upturn government borrowing squeezed private credit availability. Accordingly, starting in December 2000-and for the first time since 1992-private credit growth fell into line with overall liquidity growth (Figure 1 and Appendix I; Table 5). However, to the extent that rising government borrowing financed arrears payments (see above), this provided an indirect source of liquidity to the private sector. 17 Box 4. Rapid Private Credit Growth in the 1990s When fiscal consolidation in the early 1990s reduced government borrowing, banks dedicated a larger share of new lending to the private sector. They also financed private credit growth by drawing down their net foreign assets and later by reducing their holdings of government paper. These trends contributed to a substantial restructuring of banks’ portfolios: private credit rose at a 26 percent annual average rate from 1992/93 to 1998/99, or from the equivalent of 40 percent of banks’ deposits in June 1993 to 87 percent by June 2000. At this point, the scope for further growth in the share of private credit became limited. Banks were unable to further reduce their holdings of government paper, which were required to meet prudential liquidity requirements; and a further draw down of net foreign assets was not possible given prudential limits on banks’ open foreign currency positions. 13. Tighter credit conditions and slowing growth have contributed to some deterioration in banking indicators. On the basis of official data, nonperforming loans rose to 14.6 percent of total loans at end-December 2000, up from 12 percent at end-June 1999. Over the same period, provisions fell from 83 percent to 72 percent of nonperforming loans, and the average risk-weighted capitalization ratio declined from 10.5 percent to 10.2 percent (Appendix I; Table 6).‘* Given the rapidity of the downturn in private credit growth after 16Treasury bill rates have been unaffected by these shifts in monetary conditions, remaining in the 8.8 percent to 9.1 percent range since mid-1997. “Estimated arrears payments of LE 8 billion in 2000/O 1 would have been equivalent to an increase in private sector credit of about 4 percent. “Three small banks, accounting for less than 3 percent of banking system assets, continue to fall short of the minimum capital adequacy ratio.

Egyptian equity prices have underperformed emerging markets benchmarks for a number of years, reflecting an unwinding of the 1996/97 surge in Egyptian valuations, deteriorating relative economic performance, and (most recently) depreciation of the pound against the dollar (Figure 2). In the year to August 2001, Egyptian equity prices declined by 37 percent in dollar terms, compared to 27 percent for emerging markets as a whole.

External Developments 15. During 2000, seeking to strengthen the external position, the authorities departed from the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar adopted in early 1991. Between March 2000 and January 2001, the currency was depreciated by 12 percent against the U.S. dollar. Continuing flexibility was signaled at end-January 2001 through adoption of an adjustable currency band of 51 percent, centered on the rate then prevailing in the banking market (LE 3.85 per U.S. dollar). Despite modest steps to depreciate and widen the currency band in May and July 200 1, parallel market transactions emerged outside the band.20 16. Further depreciation and increased intervention restored exchange market liquidity. On August 5,2001, the authorities depreciated the central rate of the currency band by a further 6% percent (from LE 3.90 to LE 4.15 per U.S. dollar), while also doubling the width of the band to &3 percent. After an immediate depreciation to LE 4.22 per dollar, eliminating parallel market activity, the pound subsequently moved close to the more depreciated limit of the new band (LE 4.27 per dollar) (Figure 3). Reflecting this flexibility, as well as increased intervention by the central bank, in part to clear a back-log of demand related to foreign currency shortages that had emerged earlier, indications are that exchange market liquidity has been largely restored. Although the new band is subject to weekly review, with the central rate and band width adjustable in light of market conditions, no changes have been made as of end-September 200 1. 17. Although the pound depreciated by a cumulative 25 percent against the U.S. dollar between January 2000 and end-August 2001, the decline against the Euro was a more modest 7 percent, as the latter also depreciated against the dollar (Figure 3). Reflecting the relatively large weight of the Euro in Egypt’s effective exchange rate measure, Egypt’s real effective depreciation over this period was an estimated 10 percent (Figure 4).21 18. Balance of payments pressures have eased, partly on account of slowing economic growth. The external current account moved into balance in 2000/O 1, from a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in the preceding year (Appendix I; Table 7). This largely reflected a decline in the merchandise trade deficit, as non-oil imports fell by 15 percent in dollar terms and non-oil exports rose 7 percent (albeit on a smaller base). The decline in imports, which follows a smaller fall the preceding year, appears to reflect slowing economic growth. (Egypt’s real effective depreciation since mid-2000 probably had only a limited impact on trade performance in 2000/O 1, and will begin to affect trade flows significantly only in 2001/02.) The deficit on the external capital account also narrowed slightly in “In May 2001, the central rate of the band was depreciated from LE 3.85 to LE 3.86 per U.S. dollar; in July, the central rate was further depreciated to LE 3.90 per dollar, and the band widened to *1..5 percent. “The Euro has a 48 percent weight, compared with 20 percent for the U.S. dollar.

Reflecting these developments, the decline in official reserves in 2000/01 was limited to US$O.9 billion (0.9 percent of GDP), compared with US$3 billion a year earlier (3.1 percent of GDP).

After remaining stable at US$28 billion for the past four years (equivalent to 29 percent of GDP in 2000/01), total external debt rose by US$1.5 billion in July 2001 following a successful debut sovereign bond issue (Appendix I; Table 8). 22 Estimates of short-term external debt vary from US$3.1 billion (official data for end-June 200 1, on a remaining maturity basis) to US$4.8 billion (based on BIS data on short-term liabilities to reporting banks).23 On either basis, net international reserves of about US$15.0 billion at end-August 2001 exceeded short-term external debt by a factor of three (or by a factor of two, if resident banks’ short-term dollar claims on the central bank amounting to about US$5 billion are included).24 The authorities report that all but a small amount of their international reserves are liquid. 22Egypt raised US$500 million on a 5-year issue priced 275 basis points (bp) over U.S. Treasuries and US$l billion on a 1 O-year issue priced 335 bp over Treasuries. These spreads were among the lowest for countries with Egypt’s BBB-/negative outlook foreign currency credit rating. 23The authorities are reviewing the factors contributing to divergence between these estimates, including the possibility that BIS data include liabilities to resident banks. 24These comprise short-term claims of about US$3 billion accumulated in late-2000 and early-200 1 when the central bank sold foreign currency to commercial banks to close short foreign currency positions that had emerged. The banks redeposited this foreign currency with the central bank at maturities of up to one year. In addition, resident banks have foreign currency claims on the central bank in an amount of about US$2 billion as reserve requirements on their foreign currency deposit liabilities.

While the momentum of structural reform abated over the past 2-3 years, several key measures have been adopted in recent months. In the fiscal area, the general sales tax (GST) was extended to the wholesale and retail levels by parliament in May 2001 despite considerable resistance from some quarters; the extension-which brings the GST closer to a full value-added tax-was implemented from July 200 1. The authorities also signed in June 2001 an Association Agreement with the EU, which, once ratified, will provide for a phased, multiyear reduction of tariffs on EU imports. In the financial sector, parliament approved in June 2001 a law promoting the development of a mortgage market, key in which are provisions for strengthening the potential claim of lenders over property collateral. Finally, while the number of majority privatizations has declined from peak levels in 1996-99, and the intended highlight for 2000/O l-the Telecom initial public offering (IPO)-was postponed due to a downturn in global market interest, a number of smaller companies were privatized last year, together with a large cement company in September 2001. III. MACROECONOMIC POLICY ISSUES 21. The immediate challenge for Egypt is to restore strong economic growth without undermining macroeconomic stability. In particular, while international reserves are still at a comfortable level, it would be important to avoid any further significant decline. The authorities and the staff agreed on the need for further exchange rate flexibility to stimulate the traded goods sector and strengthen confidence more generally, and important progress was made in this direction shortly after the consultation mission. There was also agreement on the need for cautious progress toward fiscal consolidation. The importance of further strengthening the macroeconomic database was also discussed. A. Restoring Strong Economic Growth in 2001/02 22. Discussions focused on policy options for restoring strong economic growth. Available indicators suggest that Egypt is experiencing a relatively serious economic downturn, probably related, in large part, to the slowdown in credit growth and emergence of fiscal arrears in recent years. Although adjustment to more modest rates of credit growth was unavoidable, the adjustment process is proving difficult for certain industries, as banks have become more cautious in their lending. 23. The staff and the authorities agreed that no single policy measure would be sufficient to restore growth; rather, this would depend on achieving the right balance of macroeconomic and structural policies. There was agreement that expansionary fiscal policy would likely undermine confidence and prove counterproductive (see below). At the same time, it would be important to avoid exacerbating the economic downturn through overly tight fiscal policies. The budget for 2001/02 appears broadly appropriate in this respect. It envisages some reduction in government borrowing, thereby providing scope for a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- moderate recovery in private credit growth rates. At the same time, plans for settlement of the remaining fiscal arrears will provide liquidity to the private sector. Exchange rate flexibility-including some immediate depreciation-was seen as a priority, both to stimulate the traded goods sector, as well as to restore confidence in general. On the structural front, the staff recommended further signals that the structural reform program remains on track, such as an early prominent privatization. 24. On the assumption that the right policy balance is achieved, and that the private sector responds favorably, the staff is tentatively projecting a recovery in real GDP growth to 4%5 percent in 2001/02 (Appendix I; Table 9). However, even with the steps envisaged above, the timing of recovery remains uncertain and a more prolonged period of slow growth cannot be ruled out, especially if the international economy were to weaken further. Developments since the consultation mission, in particular the terrorist attacks on the United States, have added to the downside risks to global activity and regional economic performance. 25. Indeed, strong economic recovery will depend, in part, on favorable prospects for external demand and financing. Non-oil exports and tourism were tentatively projected to rise 16 percent and 9 percent, respectively, this year (2001/02), reflecting recent competitiveness gains. At the same time, Egypt’s current account deficit is projected to widen as rising economic activity contributes to higher import demand (Appendix I; Table 7). To maintain official reserves at a comfortable level, this will require prompt increases in external financing. Building on Egypt’s recent US$l.5 billion sovereign bond issue, higher foreign direct investment inflows were anticipated this year, reflecting privatizations as well as initial investments in the gas sector. On this basis, a small balance of payments surplus is projected, permitting a US$O.7 billion increase in net international reserves to US$l5 billion (a broadly unchanged 7% months of imports). Downside risks to tourism, privatization, and foreign direct investment from potential global weakness and adverse regional developments underline the importance of exchange rate flexibility.25 B. Fiscal Policy 26. Fiscal discussions focused on assessing fiscal policy in a medium term context, as well as the appropriate policy stance for the current year given Egypt’s slowing economic growth and the deteriorating global environment. 27. The fiscal strategy for the medium term needs to take into account the full range of activities of the general government, including those of the NIB and SIFs. The fiscal reporting framework developed with the authorities over the past year indicates that the 25Given Egypt’s broad trade balance in crude petroleum and refined products, its external position would be little affected by potential increases in world petroleum prices. However, if domestic petroleum prices are not increased in line with world prices, there would be fiscal repercussions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- deficit of the general government is relatively low (under 1 percent of GDP). As noted above, however, the broader fiscal accounts are subject to remaining uncertainties, especially as regards to the accounts of the NIB. At the same time, the debt of the general government, though manageable, is quite high (at 64 percent of GDP). In addition, a preliminary assessment of the outlook for the SIFs raises questions about the sustainability of their net annual inflows, which at over 4 percent of GDP have been a major factor behind the low fiscal deficit of the general government.26 Given these considerations, the staff recommended a cautious approach to fiscal policy, including targeting some reduction over the medium term of the general government debt in relation to GDP. The authorities supported this broad approach, while recognizing the need for further strengthening fiscal data to permit a comprehensive analysis of fiscal sustainability, including a thorough actuarial assessment of the outlook for the SIFs. 28. The staff viewed the authorities’ plans for a broadly unchanged fiscal position in 2001/02 as appropriate, balancing medium-term fiscal objectives with short-run concerns regarding the downturn in activity. The projected deficit of close to 1 percent of GDP at the level of the general government is not expected to require undue bank financing, or put pressure on the external accounts, even taking into account currently projected arrears payments of about LE 4.7 billion (1.2 percent of GDP). 29. A number of downside risks to the recently approved budget need to be considered. In the view of the staff, corporate income tax projections may be vulnerable to recent profit declines; the envisaged pick up in privatization receipts might not materialize; and the outstanding arrears to be settled may be larger than currently projected. While a limited revenue shortfall on account of weaker-than-expected activity would not be problem- atic, fiscal slippages related to large expenditure overruns could undermine confidence in fiscal policy, already shaken by the upward revisions to the data for the fiscal deficit last year. It could also crowd-out private sector credit, and jeopardize efforts to stabilize official reserves. This underlines the importance of public expenditure management, as well as the need to identify possible contingency measures to limit budgetary slippage. Options would include further expenditure restraint as well as price increases for petroleum products.27 26Whi1e these inflows are expected to continue at healthy levels over at least the next few years-and possibly longer, depending on contribution and benefit policies-this financing will need to be repaid at some stage in order to permit the SIFs to meet their rising pension and other benefit obligations. Since this would likely require an increase in general government borrowing at that point, consideration would need to be given, over the medium term, to progressively strengthening public fmances. Specifically, it would be appropriate to save a portion of the SIF surpluses in each year, using these resources to reduce public debt. Z7Given difftculties in quickly adjusting expenditures, petroleum price adjustments might be given priority. In July 200 1, the retail prices of premium gasoline and diesel in Egypt were about 18 percent and 54 percent below world market prices, respectively. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- The authorities agreed that it would be important to limit fiscal slippages and, more generally, that efforts to foster stronger economic growth through expansionary fiscal policies could adversely affect confidence and quickly prove counterproductive.28 30. As a separate issue, fiscal policy will need to be geared, over the medium term, to addressing certain unfavorable trends and risks. On the revenue side, international trade taxes are expected to continue to decline in relation to GDP as Egypt implements tariff reductions in the context of regional trading agreements and trade reforms (though this trend could be mitigated, in the short run, by valuation changes from currency depreciation). Prospects are also uncertain for the growth of nontax receipts from the public economic authorities. Recognizing these factors, the Ministry of Finance is planning to extend the tax base, including through further strengthening the general sales tax, and income tax and tax administration reform, as discussed below. On the expenditure side, the relatively strong growth in recent years of public sector wages and salaries and other current expenditures is cause for concern and needs to be contained. At the same time, as discussed below, reforms to further strengthen controls over investment spending are a high priority. C. Exchange Market Policies 31. Building on discussions during the Managing Director’s visit to Cairo on May 13,2001, there was broad agreement on the need for continued exchange rate flexibility-to restore liquidity and credibility to the exchange market, and foster stronger economic growth. Also, while Egypt’s official reserves remain at a comfortable level, it was agreed that it would be important to avoid a further significant decline. The authorities indicated that, in the near term, this would be achieved through exchange rate flexibility rather than by further tightening credit conditions, which could exacerbate strains on economic growth. They concurred that the priority was to quickly narrow the divergence relative to exchange rates in the parallel market; to widen the currency band to allow greater day-to-day flexibility; and to be ready to adjust the band on a regular basis, as needed. While the modification of the regime announced on August 5,200l went a long way in this direction, it remains too early to judge whether the Egyptian pound’s earlier over-valuation has been fully eliminated.29 Accordingly, while some significant intervention has been needed to clear the backlog of demand, it will be important, looking ahead, for the currency 281n this context, the authorities agreed that, despite pressures to the contrary, it would not be advisable to utilize the Eurobond proceeds to finance net lending above the levels envisaged in the budget. Such additional lending would raise the fiscal deficit substantially above the level currently targeted, require higher bank financing than now foreseen, and undermine the strengthening of Egypt’s reserve position that the eurobond proceeds make possible. “Analysis for the 2000 Article IV consultation suggested that Egypt’s competitiveness primarily deteriorated in the second half of the 1990s when the Egyptian pound appreciated by up to 37 percent in real effective terms relative to mid- 1995. A little over one-half of this real appreciation has been reversed as a result of the depreciation of the pound through August 200 1. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - band to be adjusted regularly in light of market developments to keep reserves at a comfortable level. Consideration could also be given to increasing exchange rate flexibility through a progressive widening of the currency band. 32. The authorities agreed that the move to greater exchange rate flexibility will require efforts to strengthen market-based procedures for exchange market intervention and liquidity management. In the area of banking supervision, continuing efforts will be needed to ensure that banks’ risk management practices give adequate emphasis to exchange rate and credit risks.30 Last, given that Egypt has only limited restrictions on current (and capital) transactions, the staff recommended moving toward accepting the obligations of Article VIIL3’ D. Monetary Policy 33. With greater exchange rate flexibility, monetary and credit policies take on greater importance for the primary policy goal of maintaining low inflation. The staff has prepared with the authorities a scenario to suggest how monetary policy might need to evolve through June 2002 under these conditions (Appendix I; Table 5). The scenario assumes an increase in demand for total liquidity (M2) of nearly 10 percent, consistent with continued low inflation and some pick up in economic activity.32 Based on the fiscal projections discussed earlier and a modest accumulation of net international reserves for the year as a whole, this would be consistent with private sector credit growth of about 11% percent (net of valuation changes to foreign currency credit), up from a projected 7 percent in the year to June 200 1, measured on the same basis. This should permit some easing of credit conditions, helping to stimulate private sector activity. The authorities acknowledged, though, that any such easing would need to be combined with continuing exchange rate flexibility to avoid pressures on official reserves. 34. In addition to a quantitative framework, monetary policy should be based on a broad range of indicators including inflation, particularly given uncertainties about the evolution of money demand. The authorities concurred with the staff that while data weaknesses and the limited development of Egypt’s money markets preclude an immediate move to inflation targeting, a broad range of indicators should be kept under close scrutiny, including interbank interest rates, the exchange rate, and inflation. Where these indicators “It is not known to what extent foreign currency denominated loans-which currently account for about one- sixth of private credit-contributed to the rise in nonperforming loans over the past year (Appendix I; Table 6). The authorities note that banks had been urged to limit such credits to borrowers with U.S. dollar incomes. 31Egypt maintains a number of bilateral payments agreements. Access to foreign currency for current transactions such as foreign travel has also been periodically subject to certain restrictions imposed at the level of banks. A review of such restrictions would be needed before moving to accept the obligations of Article VIII. 32This total liquidity growth rate, which is measured net of valuation changes to foreign currency deposits on account of exchange rate movements, represents a small increase from the outcome in the year to June 200 1. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- suggest increasing inflation risks, liquidity could be progressively tightened, using interest rate movements as a gauge. The authorities also agreed that to enhance the central bank’s ability to conduct market-based monetary policy, it would be important to increase further the flexibility of domestic interest rates, especially in the primary market for treasury bills, as well as for the central bank to acquire a portfolio of marketable securities. They are currently studying options in this area, as well as a number of reforms to develop the government bond and other financial markets, including through establishing a primary dealer system and introducing reverse repos. E. Data Issues 35. Further progress in strengthening Egypt’s macroeconomic database is needed, both to help guide macroeconomic policy as well as to provide confidence to domestic and international investors. The authorities share this view, and are working to address shortcomings in a number of areas, including through Egypt’s recent participation in the fiscal module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) (Box 5). IV. STRUCTURALREFORMS A. Privatization 36. Privatization will be key to developing a competitive, flexible market economy. Regularization of the nonperforming loans of certain public companies in the context of the privatization process will also help strengthen the banking system. While the number of majority privatizations has declined in recent years, the authorities indicated an undiminished commitment to the privatization process, despite a more difficult market environment. They indicated that the remainder of the corporatized (Law 203) public companies would be offered for sale by end-2002, and that sales would not be hampered by issues of valuation. The staff noted the growing use of medium- and long-term leasing of state factories and land: while recognizing that the latter may have a role to play in strengthening management in certain cases, it recommended that priority be given to achieving full private ownership. 37. While privatization in the financial sector has generally lagged, there have recently been signs of increased investor interest in the Egyptian insurance and banking sectors. In the insurance sector, liberalization in recent years has resulted in the establishment of a number of new joint ventures involving major international insurers. In addition, one joint venture company was sold earlier this year, and evaluations have been conducted of the three direct insurance companies and single reinsurance company in preparation for their privatization. The staff strongly supported the authorities’ intention to complete these privatizations speedily, given the considerable potential for development in this sector. In the banking sector, preparations are also underway for divesting public holdings in five joint venture banks, which would represent an initial step toward strengthening the banking system by reducing the current widespread cross ownership. There has been a long delay in the privatization of the four large public sector banks, and the focus is currently on strengthening Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - management rather than divestiture. In order to improve operational and financial efficiency in the banking system, the staff encouraged the government in its efforts toward the privatization of one or more of the public sector banks.33 Box 5. Strengthening the Macroeconomic Database Real sector data. While the limitations of Egypt’s real sector indicators hamper real sector analysis (see Appendix IV), important progress has been made toward developing a monthly index of industrial production, to be based on an employers’ federation survey of 200 of its largest members. Technical assistance on compiling the production index was provided by a statistical consultant working with the Article IV mission, and USAID is considering funding the costs of the program. It is intended that the index be launched in the Fall, with further technical assistance from the Fund. The staff encourages the authorities to build on this program, giving a high priority to developing other high frequency real sector data. Fiscal data. Important progress has been made in strengthening the fiscal database over the past year (Appendix IV). Staff made a number of recommendations for further strengthening fiscal data and transparency based on the findings of the fiscal module of the ROSC. It recommended dissemination of fiscal data on the new reporting basis, which would help resolve uncertainties in the markets regarding Egypt’s fiscal position. To strengthen confidence in these accounts, it also urged publishing the audited end-year fiscal statement after its approval by parliament. Additional recommendations for strengthening fiscal management and reporting in the short term inchde: (a) basing the fiscal projections in the annual budget on a clearly presented macroeconomic framework; (b) compiling and reporting information on contingent fiscal liabilities; and (c) clarifying and making a statement on accounting policies in the accounts and budget reports. The authorities indicated that they would weigh these recommendations carefully. They support publication of the fiscal module in mid-2002, following steps to address the policy recommendations in the report. External sector data. To improve the balance of payments source data, the authorities are giving consideration to using customs-based trade data in place of those reported by the banking system. The authorities are also reviewing the official debt data to verify that they tilly capture private sector external liabilities. On official reserves, the staff suggested moving toward compiling and reporting data in accordance with the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, including showing foreign currency liabilities to resident commercial banks. “Earlier plans for privatizing the state banks had focused on moving initially with one or two institutions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - B. Fiscal Reform 38. A good start has been made in implementing the authorities’ agenda for fiscal reform. These efforts, which have benefited from technical assistance from the USAID and IMF, are especially timely given the prospective declines in some revenue categories over the period ahead, including trade taxes. Following the extension of the GST to the wholesale and retail levels, the authorities intend to further amend the GST to move in the direction of uniform rates, remove exemptions, and strengthen the rebate system. On the income tax, the preparation of legislation to unify the treatment of personal income and broaden the base by eliminating exemptions is well advanced, and is tentatively scheduled for submission to the People’s Assembly this fiscal year. Efforts to strengthen tax administration are also being given a high priority, including the establishment later this year of a “Model Customs and Tax Center” (for large taxpayers) that will be used as a pilot vehicle to test reforms to tax administration. In addition, reforms of customs administration and real estate tax taxation are under active consideration. 39. Strong expenditure management will also be important to maintain fiscal discipline and to create space for higher spending in priority budget areas. Staff indicated that its recommendations at the time of the last consultation for extending Ministry of Finance authority over the full investment budget remained valid: (a) authority for public borrowing should be consolidated in the Ministry of Finance, which should also have responsibility for authorizing spending out of investment accounts at the NIB, and should receive monthly reports on such spending; (b) implementation of the state budget law in the annual budget should be reviewed as regards the potential for spending without parliamentary approval, which appears to run counter to the spirit of the fiscal provision of the constitution; and (c) high priority should be given to adoption of a computerized integrated accounting and financial management system. The authorities indicated that these issues were under review. Consideration is also being given to reform of the social security system, which will be important for achieving fiscal sustainability over the medium term. C. Financial Sector Issues 40. Risks in the banking sector have increased due to greater exchange rate and interest rate flexibility, while the transition to slower private credit growth has been associated with a (thus far) modest deterioration in credit quality. These developments underline the importance of ensuring strong banking supervision. Good progress has been made in improving supervision over the past year, with public banks now subject to full scope and targeted on-site examinations on a biannual basis. The CBE continues to update its supervisory handbook, adapted from a U.S. model, and to strengthen the skills of bank examiners, bankers, and other interested parties through a local banking institute. Egypt’s participation in the joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in early 2002 will provide an important opportunity to identify priorities for a further strengthening of supervision.

Pending a full assessment of financial sector oversight in the context of the FSAP, staff made a number of recommendations for strengthening the system. While the average risk-weighted assets of the Egyptian banking system exceed the Base1 capital standard of 8 percent, this may not be a fully adequate gauge of the riskiness of Egyptian banks’ investments, and an additional useful guide is the unweighted capitalization ratio.34 This ratio is currently about 5 percent on average, and somewhat lower for public banks. The staff encouraged an increase in capitalization, on this definition, to about 6 percent. This would complement the authorities’ plans to raise the minimum risk-weighted capitalization ratio to 10 percent. The staff also supported the CBE’s intention to address long-standing noncompliance by a number of banks with prudential requirements in regard to capitalization and large exposures, and to continue to monitor banks’ foreign currency positions closely, given the recent moves to greater exchange rate flexibility. Further efforts to develop consolidated supervision of companies that own both insurance and banking firms would be appropriate. 42. On the legislative front, a broad range of reforms affecting the financial sector is underway. The recent passage of the mortgage law represents an important step toward strengthening the liquidity of the property market. In addition, an amendment to the financial leasing law was recently passed; a draft law on bank and insurance company ownership is being publicly debated; and amendments to the capital markets law are under preparation. Steps are being taken to strengthen anti-money laundering policies.35 A high level committee, chaired by the Attorney General and General Prosecutor, has been established to revise existing statutes to strengthen the criminalization and detection of money laundering. In addition, the central bank also recently issued to banks instructions on “know-your-customer” policies. D. Trade Liberalization 43. The authorities view the recently signed Association Agreement with the EU as establishing a reference point for broader reforms to attract new foreign direct investments and boost export competitiveness. While welcoming the EU agreement, the staff noted that the recent emphasis on preferential bilateral and multilateral trading agreements risked further complicating Egypt’s already complex trade regime. The staff also noted the need to reduce and simplify Egypt’s general tariff structure, and urged a multilateral approach to these reforms (Box 6). The authorities recognized these risks, noting that a census of Egypt’s bilateral trade agreements had been undertaken, as a first step toward simplification, a committee has been established with Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia to consolidate the 16 bilateral trade agreements between the 4 countries based on these 34The weighted ratio may not be appropriate because government debt, claims on other banks, and mortgages may be more risky in developing economies such as Egypt than implied by the Base1 capital accord. 351n June 200 1, based on a review of Egypt’s banking laws and practices, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) declared Egypt as “noncooperating” in the fight against money laundering.

Quality and other test procedures for imports are also being simplified. In regard to Egypt’s generally high tariffs, the government envisages some reduction over the year ahead, most likely focused on intermediate goods and raw materials.37 E. Poverty Alleviation 44. To help identify recent trends in poverty, the Egyptian authorities intend to prepare with the World Bank an updated poverty assessment. This work, to be coordinated by the Institute for National Planning under the Ministry of Planning, would be based on the results of the 2000 household expenditure survey. The assessment, in addition to identifying the extent and nature of poverty, would provide a poverty map and develop a strategy for poverty reduction. At a macroeconomic level, poverty reduction will require efforts to generate rapid employment growth, as discussed below. V. MACROECONOMICOUTLOOKFORTHEMEDIUMTERM 45. For the medium term, the key challenge is to foster strong output and employment growth. With its young population (more than half aged under 20), Egypt’s labor force is expected to expand by 2.6 percent annually over the next decade. To absorb these new job seekers while also reducing unemployment, over 500,000 new jobs will need to be created each year. This will require a sustained reinvigoration of output growth, together with structural reforms to encourage employment creation. Illustrative medium-term projections prepared by the staff during the mission envisaged a recovery of economic growth to about 6 percent over a 5-year period, based on assumed strong macroeconomic policies, sound institutional structures, and good progress with structural reforms to open the economy and promote a pro-private sector business environment, notably through trade liberalization and privatization (Appendix 1; Table 9). On the external front, a projected widening current account deficit and higher domestic investments are assumed to be financed by an increase in annual capital inflows of more than 3 percent of GDP (from 2000/01 levels). 36 Egypt maintains bilateral trade agreements with a number of other countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, and Syria (Box 6). 37Non-exempt goods are subject to tariffs averaging 26.9 percent (on a simple average basis), as well as various import surcharges that raise the average tariff by a further 2-3 percentage points. However, reflecting an administratively complex system of exemptions, Egypt’s average effective tariff (calculated as the ratio of customs receipts to imports) is close to 1.5 percent. On the IMF’s index of trade restrictiveness, Egypt scores a high “8”. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - Box 6. Developments in Trade Policy Substantial trade liberalization was achieved during the 1990s. Progressive rounds of tariff reductions brought average MFN rates down from 42 percent in 1991 to less than 27 percent in 1998, with the maximum general tariff reduced from 100 percent to 40 percent over the same period. The elimination of export bans and certain restrictions on domestic pricing and distribution also reduced the anti-export bias in the economy. Nevertheless, by international standards, Egypt’s trade regime is still restrictive. Egypt’s MFN tariffs remain high (see Chart). The tariff structure is also complex, characterized by significant dispersion and escalation (higher rates for more processed goods). Egypt’s trade regime scores an 8 out of 10 on the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness, reflecting the combination of “restrictive” tariff barriers and “moderate” nontariff barriers. Simple Average MFN Tariff Rates, 2000 I Non-tariff barriers are being reduced. While a significant share of imports remain subject to demanding quality controls, a joint certification laboratory is being set up to streamline product testing, and a detailed certification code has also been issued. Also, while customs procedures remain restrictive, they are being modernized with USAID assistance. While the authorities do not envisage further broad-based reductions in Egypt’s tariff structure in the near term, trade preferences are being extended through bilateral agreements with the EU and other countries in the region. The Association Agreement with the EU, signed in June 200 I, becomes effective upon parliamentary ratification by Egypt and EU member countries. Under the terms of the agreement, the EU will increase the quotas for Egypt’s main agricultural exports, establish Egypt: Average Tariff Rates quotas for some new agricultural products, and MFN EU Preferential Tariffs provide over-quota tariff reductions for yet other 10 years agricultural products. The preferential duty free Upon entry after entry treatment granted to Egyptian manufactures by the 200 1 into force into force 1977 Cooperation Agreement will also be sxtended. For its part, Egypt will dismantle all All Products 26.9 26.2 12.4 industrial duties within 12-15 years of the Agriculture 63.8 63.4 62.2 agreement’s entry into force and reduce its tariffs Manufacturing 21.0 20.2 4.4 for a number of EU agricultural products. Source: IMF staff estimates. Egypt has also established trade agreements with other countries in the region, including with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia. It is also a signatory of the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement [GAFTA), the African Economic Community (AEC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa [COMESA). Efforts are being initiated to rationalize the trade agreements among Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and Tunisia. While the bilateral agreements contribute to trade liberalization, some concerns remain: . Egypt’s high average tariffs will provide a substantial trading edge to EU and other exporters winning preferential access to Egyptian markets under bilateral agreements. To ensure that Egypt does not become a captive market for such suppliers, to the detriment of lower cost producers from other countries, it will be important to accompany the trade agreements with a general reduction of tariff and nontariff protection. . There is a risk that multiple bilateral and multilateral agreements will generate excessive complexity and reduced transparency, due to differences in coverage, timing of tariff reductions, and rules of origin requirements. Consolidation or streamlining of the agreements is recommended. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - 46. This relatively favorable outcome will require robust policy implementation. Sustaining a bold program of structural reform will involve considerable challenges, including tackling vested business interests; handling the social and economic costs of closing or restructuring nonviable public enterprises; and addressing excessive public sector bureaucracy. If this challenge is postponed, Egypt would risk falling behind more progressive competitors in terms of growth and investment, access to international capital markets, and employment opportunities. In the near term, efforts to stimulate growth through expansionary macroeconomic policies would put downward pressure on reserves and could ultimately jeopardize macroeconomic stability. 47. Key downside risks also exist on the external front. Noting that strong medium term growth will require greater integration into global trade and financial markets, discussions during the mission focused on the critical importance of strong economic policies and institutions to help Egypt weather the external shocks to which it would become increasingly vulnerable. These risks and the importance of strong policies have been abruptly highlighted by the emergence of new downside risks to the global economy and to financing for emerging markets following the recent terrorist attacks on the United States. To address such risks, the staff and authorities agreed on the following priority areas: (i) operating a flexible exchange rate policy, not only to maintain competitiveness, but also to help ride out periods of market turbulence; (ii) further strengthening and developing the financial system, so that it is highly resilient to domestic and foreign shocks; (iii) maintaining a high level of international reserves, as a cushion against temporary difficulties in accessing international capital markets; and (iv) further improving the timely availability of high quality macroeconomic data, both to help guide economic policy, but also to provide confidence to domestic and foreign investors. VI. STAFF APPRAISAL 48. While the Egyptian economy is significantly stronger as a result of the economic reforms implemented during the 199Os, less favorable performance has emerged over the last few years, marked by declining international reserves and slowing economic growth. 49. The key challenge in the period ahead is to restore strong economic growth to underpin robust employment generation, which will have to be achieved in a difficult external environment. These efforts to promote growth need to be consistent with maintaining macroeconomic stability. Looking further ahead, Egypt will likely need to rely increasingly on foreign financing to keep the balance of payments on a sound footing and preserve a strong international reserve position: this will bring new challenges and risks. In particular, to insure against potential vulnerability to fluctuations in international capital markets, it will be increasingly important to have in place strong macroeconomic policies and institutional structures. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - 50. The staff strongly supports the exchange rate flexibility introduced over the past year as well as the authorities’ intention to continue to follow a more flexible exchange rate policy in the period ahead. A more competitive exchange rate will help strengthen growth performance, while flexibility will help Egypt to ride out periods of market turbulence. The central bank’s efforts to increase market intervention starting in August 2001 have also been welcome in restoring exchange market liquidity and eliminating a backlog in demand for foreign exchange. At the same time, while Egypt’s official reserve position remains relatively strong, further significant declines should be avoided. Accordingly, the authorities are encouraged to adjust the new currency band on a regular basis in light of market developments, and to consider moving, over time, to a floating regime with limited intervention. To support greater exchange rate flexibility, it will be important to further develop market-based procedures for exchange market intervention. 51. Credit growth has slowed to a sustainable rate over the past year, and will need to remain measured to support exchange rate policy. Macroeconomic projections consistent with the 2001/02 budget indicate scope for some increase in private credit growth this year to support economic recovery. With greater exchange rate flexibility, monetary and credit policies take on greater importance for maintaining low inflation. In addition to a quantitative framework, monetary policy will need to be guided by a range of indicators, given uncertainties about money demand. To enhance the central bank’s ability to conduct market-based monetary policy, further flexibility will be important in domestic interest rates, notably for treasury bills. It will also be important to press ahead with plans to introduce new tools for central bank intervention (including reverse repos) and to develop secondary markets for government bonds and other paper. 52. Signs of a modest deterioration in credit quality underline the importance of ensuring strong banking supervision. Welcome progress has been made in this regard over the past year, including by strengthening the examination of public banks. The authorities’ intention to address long standing noncompliance by a number of banks with key prudential requirements, and to continue to monitor banks’ foreign currency positions closely is welcome, particularly given the recent moves to greater exchange rate flexibility. Egypt’s participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program in early 2002 will provide an important opportunity to assess risks and practices in these areas and to develop priorities for further reform. 53. On fiscal policy, while some consolidation appears needed over the medium term, it will be important to avoid exacerbating the economic downturn in the immediate future. Given Egypt’s relatively high level of general government debt, uncertainties about the accounts of the NIB pending the completion of the audit, and the neec to prepare for future increases in social security obligations, a progressive strengthening of public finances will be important over the period ahead. For the near term, the recently approved budget for 2001/02 consistent with a broadly unchanged fiscal stance appears appropriate. It should not require undue bank financing, or put pressure on the external Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - accounts, even taking into account the currently projected arrears payments to which a high priority should be given. 54. Given this fiscal stance, continued exchange rate flexibility, and further signals that the structural reform program remains on track, real GDP growth is tentatively projected to recover in 2001/02. With sound macroeconomic policies and sustained structural reforms, a further rise in economic growth toward perhaps 6 percent over the medium term should be feasible. At the same time, downside risks to the global economy and regional economic performance have increased following the recent terrorist attacks on the United States. This adds to uncertainty about the timing of recovery, and a more prolonged period of slow growth cannot be ruled out. Notwithstanding these risks, efforts to foster stronger economic growth through expansionary fiscal policies could adversely affect confidence and quickly prove counterproductive. 55. Further progress with structural reform will be key to achieving the sustained strong employment growth needed to absorb Egypt’s rapidly rising labor force and reduce unemployment. Key goals should be to broaden the activities of the private sector, eliminate impediments to international trade and investment, and reduce official bureaucracy and red tape. Further signals that the structural reform program remains on track in these areas could provide an important boost to confidence and help underpin stronger economic growth. 56. On privatization, the authorities’ plans to offer the remaining Law 203 companies for sale by end-2002 are encouraging. Although the growing practice of offering medium- and long-term leases of state factories and land may also have a role to play in strengthening management in certain cases, staff would recommend that priority be given to achieving full private ownership. While privatization in the financial sector has generally lagged, welcome steps are being taken to privatize the 3 state insurance companies and single re-insurance company, as well as to divest public holdings in 5 joint venture banks. This process should be extended to the other joint venture banks as well as to the four large public sector banks. 57. The recent signing of an Association Agreement with the European Union establishes an important anchor for trade liberalization in the years ahead. However, to minimize trade diversion, Egypt should seek to reinforce the EU agreement with parallel steps to reduce and simplify its general tariff structure. Ongoing efforts to reduce impediments to trade with regional partners should be given a high priority, to strengthen Egypt’s attractiveness as a location for new foreign direct investments. The authorities are also urged to move toward accepting the obligations of Article VIII. 58. The authorities’ agenda for tax reform is timely given prospective declines in some revenue categories over the period ahead. Extension of the GST to the wholesale and retail levels marks an important step forward, and the authorities’ intention to further amend the GST to move in the direction of uniform rates, more limited exemptions, and a stronger Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- rebate system is welcome. Steps to unify the tax treatment of personal incomes and to significantly reduce exemptions to income taxation and customs tariffs will also be important. Efforts to strengthen tax and customs administration are rightly being given a high priority. 59. Strong expenditure management will also be important to maintain fiscal discipline and to create space for higher spending in priority budget areas. In this connection, staffs recommendation at the time of the last consultation for extending Ministry of Finance authority over the full investment budget remain valid. 60. Weaknesses in Egypt’s macroeconomic database continue to hamper policy making, and improvements in a number of areas are important on this account as well as to strengthen macroeconomic surveillance by the Fund. 61. Progress has been made over the past year in strengthening the fiscal data. In particular, an expanded fiscal reporting framework has been developed, largely eliminating former inconsistencies between budget sector financing and debt for 1998/99 and subsequent years. To ensure that the revised framework remains accurate and comprehensive, the authorities are encouraged to increase the provision to the public and the staff of supporting fiscal information, including the audited year-end treasury statements, after parliamentary approval. 62. As discrepancies remain in the fiscal and debt data for 1997/98 and earlier years, the authorities are urged to extend the review of these fiscal data expeditiously, including to resolve issues relating to the reporting of fiscal data under past arrangements. As the government has indicated that this would be possible only after completing the ongoing audit of the activities of the NIB in mid-2002, the latter should be given a high priority and accelerated to the extent possible; the revision of the fiscal data for 1997/98 and earlier years should be implemented promptly on completion of the NIB audit. The authorities’ recent participation in the fiscal module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was welcome, and publication would help strengthen fiscal transparency. It would be useful to disseminate fiscal data on the new reporting basis at an early date. 63. Policy formulation would be enhanced by a better understanding of the most recent developments in the real sector. High priority should be given to compiling and disseminating a broader range of high frequency economic indicators; in this context, efforts to initiate a monthly index of industrial production are very welcome. In the external sector, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- efforts to review the official debt data to verify that they fully capture private sector external liabilities are welcome. It would also be useful to move toward compiling and reporting data in accordance with the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. 64. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

On January 3 1,2001, Egypt introduced an exchange rate band system, with a central rate of LE3.85 per dollar and a band width of il percent. The central rate was adjusted to 3.86 on May 3 1, 200 1, followed by another adjustment to 3.90 in early June when the band width was increased to * 1.5 percent. Most recently on August 5, the central rate was adjusted to LE 4.15 per U.S. dollar, and the width of the currency band was doubled to 13 percent. VIII. Article IV Consultation Consultations with Egypt are on a la-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Cairo during April 1 l-May 4, 2000. The staff report ( SM/OO/151) was discussed by the Executive Board on July 22,200O. IX. ROSCs: A fiscal ROSC module was completed in July 2001. The authorities support publication of this module in mid-2002, after steps to address the policy recommendations in the report. X.

Resident Representative Mr. Adam Bennett has been Senior Resident Representative in Cairo since August 2000. XIII. Cairo Center for Economic Information In mid-1999, the Egyptian authorities established the Cairo Center for Economic Information to provide timely information on recent economic developments and promote a wider understanding of the elements and implications of sound economic policy. The focus of the seminars, workshops, and similar activities will be the economic and financial media, academic and parliamentary communities, and other economic interest groups (labor leaders, etc.) From an initial domestic base, it is intended that the Center’s activities will expand to cover similar key groups in other MENA countries. The Fund is supporting the activities of the Center, including through the provision of resource materials (notably Arabic language documents) and presentations by Fund staff (including the resident representative) at the Center’s seminars and workshops.

The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Egypt for the period FY02-04 was reviewed by the Board on July 3,200 1. In light of the Government’s cautious approach to borrowing and Egypt’s graduation from IDA, future Bank borrowing will be modest and the size of the Bank portfolio is diminishing. In view of Egypt’s goal of reducing unemployment and raising living standards, the following two areas were identified for Bank Group lending: (i) development of human resources; and (ii) natural resource management. In support of these objectives, the Bank Group will provide a range of financial instruments (loans, credits, guarantees, etc.), and assistance in aid coordination and economic policy advice on key issues. The Bank will chair a Consultative Group meeting for Egypt on October 24 - 30, 2001. 2. As of May 3 1,2001, the World Bank had approved 13 1 loans and credits (total principal US$ 6.3 billion) to Egypt (some of them for the same project), of which US$4.3 billion has been disbursed. Roughly one-half of commitments for ongoing operations support agriculture and rural development and one-half support human resource development. 3. IFC investments (including approved investments pending commitment) totaled US$328 million as of April 30,2001, plus an additional $305 million for the account of participants. There have been no MIGA guarantees.

The national accounts data are complied annually by the Ministry of Planning, on fiscal year basis, in current and constant prices. While the compilation methodology appears basically sound, and the accounts are currently being upgraded on the basis of the 1993 System of National Accounts, the qualities of some component data are uncertain. Crosschecks on the accounts are also difficult, given the lack of complementary real sector data, including on industrial production, employment, and retail sales. These uncertainties, together with shortcomings in terms of timeliness and availability, pose serious challenges for macroeconomic management and surveillance in Egypt. As part of the ongoing USAID project on national accounts statistics, a training program has begun and a new computer system is being developed, under the supervision of a term of long-term USAID experts. Some experimental quarterly national accounts estimates are being prepared on a discrete basis and have been shared with the Fund staff. 2. Production statistics. An STA consultant working with the mission team for the 2001 Article IV consultation helped the authorities design a survey to compile a monthly index of industrial production. Follow-up technical assistance will be needed prior to publication of the first production estimates. 3. Price and employment statistics. The CPI weights were revised in July 1998 to eliminate a calculation error identified by a February 1997 STA mission.’ Further efforts are still required to replace the wholesale price index with a producer price index and to improve the external trade price indices (the latter are unreliable and available only annually). Data on employment are available with a lag. 4. Balance of payments (BOP) statistics. The BOP statistics have been revised with Fund technical assistance in accordance with the Fifth Edition in methods and coverage of BOP statistics compiled by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and in reporting of data to the Fund. However, the multi-sector statistics mission found that coverage and classification of the BOP data seem to have recently deteriorated, as evidenced by the sharp increase in net errors and omissions. With foreign exchange liberalization, banks do not get full details of transactions either from the customers or from the overseas correspondents. Early measures are required and the February 1999 STA mission suggested that the CBE explore using trade statistics compiled by Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) in cooperation with customs Administration. ’ The revised series shows a slightly higher increase in prices-O.7 percent over a 12-month period.

Comprehensive data are compiled on public and publicly guaranteed external debt through a mandatory reporting system. However, reporting on, nonguaranteed debt is voluntary and incomplete. The authorities are drawing on advice from Fund staff and other outside advisers on forming a strategy to strengthen the reporting system. 6. Fiscal data. Staffs recommendations during the 2000 Article IV consultation for improving the quality of the fiscal data and their transparency have, for the most part, been implemented or initiated. In November 2000 and June 200 1, technical assistance missions on fiscal reporting developed a comprehensive fiscal reporting framework and applied this to data starting in 1998/99. This has largely eliminated former inconsistencies between budget sector financing and debt data. Despite this, as comprehensive budget outturn data are not published, and as the staff has not received access to the audited treasury accounts for 1998/99 presented to and approved by parliament over the past year, it remains unable to provide assurances that the revised reporting format gives a fully comprehensive picture of budget sector activity. Important uncertainties also remain as to certain aspects of the NIB and SIF accounts, and continuing efforts are needed to strengthen the quality of data on these institutions: to this end, the authorities are currently undertaking a comprehensive audit of the NIB. The authorities participated in the fiscal module of the IMF’s Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) in June 2001. Egypt does not report fiscal data for publication in IFS; annual data in IFS are obtained from the GFS Yearbook. 6. Monetary statistics. The statistics are comprehensive and reported regularly. 7. Data dissemination. Egypt is interested in subscribing to the SDDS. At the moment, no technical assistance mission to Egypt from STA on this issue is planned for FY 2002.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt On 10!17/2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt.’ Background During most of the 1990s Egypt made considerable progress in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. The fiscal deficit was greatly reduced, inflation fell to low single digits under a currency peg to the U.S. dollar, and debt service indicators strengthened substantially, aided by debt reduction from official bilateral creditors. On the structural front, progress was made in financial and trade liberalization, and privatization. These advances contributed to rising investment and stronger real GDP growth. In the late-l 99Os, however, macroeconomic performance deteriorated, with a substantial upward revision to the fiscal deficit, continuing rapid credit growth, and slowing structural reforms. At the same time, tourism experienced a temporary downturn, global financing tightened after the Asian Crisis, and the pound continued to appreciate as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar to which it remained pegged. These developments resulted in sizable official reserve losses. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the 10/17/2001 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

This helped stabilize official reserves toward end-2000, but was associated with a marked slowdown in economic growth from 5 percent, on official data, in 1999/00 to preliminary staff estimates in the 3-3X percent range for 2000/01. Consumer price inflation remains low, at 2.2 percent for the year to June 2001. Updated fiscal accounts for 1998/99 through 2001/02 have been compiled using a new reporting framework developed over the past year with the authorities. On the revised accounts, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have averaged 3-4 percent of GDP in recent years for the budget sector alone, rising to close to 6 percent of GDP when net lending by the national investment bank (NIB) and subsidies of the General Authority for Supply of Commodities (GASC) are included. After consolidating the surpluses of the social insurance funds (SIFs), the fiscal deficit of the general government falls to under 1 percent of GDP. Public debt amounted to almost 100 percent of GDP in 2000/01 at the level of the budget sector, NIB, and GASC, but with a large part of this representing obligations to the SIFs, the figure falls to about 64 percent of GDP at the level of the general government (consolidating the SIFs). During 2000, seeking to strengthen the external position, the authorities departed from the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar adopted in early 1991. Following an initial depreciation, an adjustable currency band was adopted against the U.S. dollar in January 2001; this band was subsequently further depreciated and widened in mid-2001, resulting in a cumulative depreciation of about 25 percent relative to the U.S. dollar. Balance of payments pressures eased in 2000/01. The external current account moved into broad balance in 2000/01, as non-oil imports fell by 10 percent in dollar terms and non-oil exports rose 7 percent. The deficit on the external capital account also narrowed slightly. Reflecting these developments, the decline in official reserves in 2000/01 was limited to US$O.9 billion (0.9 percent of GDP), compared to US$3 billion a year earlier (3.1 percent of GDP). On the structural front, several key measures have been adopted in recent months. In the fiscal area, the general sales tax (GST) was extended to the wholesale and retail levels by parliament in May 2001 and implemented from July 2001. The authorities also signed in June 2001 an Association Agreement with the EU which, once ratified, will provide for a phased, multi-year reduction of tariffs on EU imports. In the financial sector, parliament approved in June 2001 a law promoting the development of a mortgage market, key in which are provisions for strengthening the potential claim of lenders over property collateral. Last, a number of smaller companies were privatized last year, together with a large cement company in September 2001.
