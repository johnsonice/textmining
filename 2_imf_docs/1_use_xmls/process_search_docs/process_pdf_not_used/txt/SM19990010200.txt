INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. The performance of the Vietnamese economy has deteriorated sharply since mid-1997, reflecting domestic structural weaknesses compounded by the impact of the regional crisis. Output growth, foreign direct investment, and exports have fallen, while scheduled debt service obligations were rising. 2. The authorities have responded to these difficulties by maintaining a prudent budgetary stance and by gradually renewing structural reforms. The overall budget deficit was kept on target, but credit to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has increased sharply, and the dong was devalued by a total of 19 percent while external controls were intensified. Some actions have been taken to begin restructuring joint-stock banks, improve the regulatory framework, and speed up SOE equitization. 3. The main policy challenges are to foster a sustainable recovery with external viability, through the active pursuit of structural reforms, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. To achieve higher growth rates, the private sector will need to be more decisively promoted, the very large and troubled SOE sector and the banking system will both need fundamental reforms, and trade liberalization will be essential. 4. A reform strategy for the SOE sector should aim at rationalizing and downsizing the sector to reduce the burden on the banking system, and to improve its efficiency. It will be important to promptly and vigorously implement that strategy. Complementary actions to promote private sector development and improve the conditions for both domestic and foreign investment are equally vital for economic growth, and also to ease the social impact of SOE reform. 5. SOE reform should be coordinated closely with bank restructuring and trade reform. Reform of the state-owned commercial banks needs to bring about more operational independence and foreign management expertise, for which foreign equity participation at an appropriate point would be useful. In the trade area, it is critically important to eliminate nontariff barriers and phase down tariffs, and progressively remove restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. 6. To support structural reforms and economic recovery, the mix of macroeconomic policies should be adapted. Budgetary policies could be eased to help absorb the cost of effective structural reforms, especially of a well-targeted safety net. Credit policy should be tightened, by slowing the rate of growth of credit to SOEs and confining credit to viable borrowers, but more room should be made for the private sector. Greater exchange rate flexibility will be needed to protect competitiveness and reduce reliance on exchange and trade controls, thus improving transparency and bolstering investors’ confidence.

Policies along these lines and a credible commitment to their implementation could form a basis for a program to be supported by a new three-year ESAF arrangement. The authorities agree with the staff on the broad direction of reforms, and have taken initial steps to revitalize the reform process. However, concerns about the social and political impact have limited the pace and scope of reforms, II. THE ECONOMIC SETTING - - 8. At the onset of the Asian crisis in mid-1997, the Vietnamese economy was already showing signs of weakness and vulnerability to shocks. Until then, growth had been rapid, driven by reforms initiated in the late 198Os, along with large inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). Under this first round of reforms, the agricultural sector was liberalized, almost all prices were freed, and the number of SOEs was halved from 12,000 to 6,000 with employment sharply reduced. Subsequently, however, the pace of reform slowed, and concerns grew about the transparency of government policies and the high cost of doing business in Vietnam. Moreover, an increasing share of FDI was directed at projects with low economic justification, such as property development and import substitution. As a result, by 1997, FDI inflows had plateaued, and stress in the banking and SOE sectors began to emerge along with shortages of foreign exchange. 9. Against this background, at the conclusion of the 1997 Article IV Consultation, Executive Directors called for a clear and specific timetable for accelerated structural reforms. In particular, they advocated a much faster pace of privatization of SOEs, the implementation of restructuring plans for the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), and the elimination of nontariff barriers. They also urged the authorities to improve their disclosure of economic and financial information. 10. Since early 1998, in the face of emerging domestic weaknesses, the Vietnamese economy has been hard hit by the Asian crisis, due to its extensive trade and investment links with the region.’ According to staff estimates, growth slowed sharply in 1998 to 3% percent from 9 percent in recent years (Table 1);2 FDI inflows fell to $0.8 billion, one third the pre-crisis level; and inflation picked up to over 9 percent (Charts 1 and 2). Owing to weaker regional demand and reduced competitiveness, exports in U.S. dollar terms fell by 10 percent in the second half,of 1998 (over the same period in 1997, and compared with a growth of 25 percent in 1997). With slowing domestic demand and intensification of trade and exchange curbs, imports were also cut by 10 percent in the same period. As a result, the external current account was reduced slightly in 1998 to 4 percent of GDP (Table 2). Net ‘The region accounts for 60-70 percent of total exports and 75 percent of total FDI flows. 2The authorities estimate real GDP growth in 1998 at 5.8 percent. Box 1 explains the reasons for the different growth and FDI estimates. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- Box 1. Vietnam: Alternative Estimates of GDP Growth and FDI Flows The authorities estimate real GDP growth in 1998 at 5.8 percent, about 2% percentage points higher than the staff&e tabulation; real GDP growth in 1997 was 8.2 percent), and also higher than other market estimates. The main differences are in the estimates for construction and service sector, and are somewhat smaller for manufacturing. There is no major difference for agriculture and industry, for which production and price data ,ere more readily available. . Construction. Based on indicators such as cement imports (dowu 94 percent over 1997), foreign direct itwesbnent (FIX) i&lows in construction (down 92 percent), output of bricks and steel (up 3 % percent and 8’/2 percent, respectively), and government capital expenditure (up 4.2 percent in real terms), it seems unlikely that value added in construction could have increased by more than 3 percent in 1998, about a third of the long-run growth rate in this sector. . Services. The service sector was severely hit by the Asian crisis, and signs of a slowing activity were visible on many fronts: Real growth rate (in 18 zcent) Official Staff Real GDP Agriculture, forestry, fishery ;; 1:; Iudusby and construction 10:3 8.0 Manufacturing 10.0 8.0 Construction 3.0 Services :.“z 4:1 0.5 Wholesale and retail trade Transportation 4.0 -;‘:: Tourism -15.0 Real estate services i:; -10.0 l In tourism, the number of visitors to Vietnam fell by about 15 percent iu 1998, and the average hotel occupancy rate was 40 percent compared with 60-70 percent in 1997; l Real estate services were affected by the general economic slowdown and the drop in FDI: in the office sector in major urban centers, average occupancy fell to 55-60 percent, and rents fell by about 45 percent during 1998; in the residential property sector, occupancy rates fell to 50 percent (from 70 percent in 1997), and rents fell by 35-45 percent; . In the transportation sector, cargo volume fell by about 6% percent, while the number of passengers rose by 4% percent, and the transportation component of the CPI increased by 6.4 percent, Official estimates put real growth in these services at about 3-4 percent in 1998. However, the implicit deflator used for these sectors is substantially higher than suggested by market reports+.g., 7 percent for tourism, 14 percent for the real estate services, and 9 percent for transportation. This discrepancy casts doubt on the growth estimates for the service sector. . Manufacturing. The authorities estimate value added to have increased by 10 percent in 1998, led by the strong output of crude oil, and a pick-up in output of the substitutes for imported consumer goods (which were curtailed due to foreign exchange shortage). Rapid growth of electricity supply (14 percent in 1998) supports these estimates. However, data for manufacturing value added include inventories, so to the extent that these accumulated faster during 1998-a@ there is ample evidence of inventory build-up in cement, coal, steel, and fertilizer industries-growth of value added was overestimated. Furthermore, the shift to import substitutes largely involved assembly operations, so their contribution to value added also may have been overstated. A major factor underlying differing growth estimates for 1998 and projected for 1999 is the assessment of FDI inflows. According to the authorities, FDI inflows amounted to USS2.1 billion in 1998, while the staffs estimate (based on actual disbursements through October 1998 and the balance of payments data for the rest of the year) is at most US$O.S billion. (The authorities’ figure includes a US$O.7 billion Russian investment in a large oil and gas project, agreed in late December 1998, for which no details have been released.) FDI has been an engine of growth in the mid- 199Os, and the drop in FDI inflows by almost two-thirds in one year clearly had a major impact on export growth (which slowed from 25 percent in 1997 to 2% percent in 1998) and imports (which were flat in 1997 and recorded negative growth in 1998) as well as overall growth, given that exports alone account for 48 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- capital inflows were lower than in 1997, with rising repayments of previous FDI loans, and gross international reserves were maintained at 10% weeks of imports. This weak trend accelerated in the first quarter of 1999 (Chart 1). Output growth for 1999 is projected by the staff at 3 l/z percent, but with somewhat lower inflation; external payments pressure is expected to continue, given a further weakening in export performance in the first quarter of the year. 11. The authorities have responded to the weaker external environment by maintaining a restrained budgetary stance and by easing credit policy for the SOEs. The overall budget deficit (excluding onlending of foreign aid) for 1998 was held to the target of 1 percent of GDP with no use of domestic bank financing (Table 3).’ The revenue targets were largely met by maintaining domestic petroleum prices in the face of falling world prices, but also by allowing SOEs to tap bank credit to meet their tax bills, and expenditures were maintained at about budgeted levels. Bank credit to SOEs accelerated to 22 percent in 1998, from 16 percent in 1997, while credit to private enterprises barely increased in real terms (Table 4). With net international reserves virtually unchanged, broad money grew by 24 percent. 12. Over the 18 months to end-1998, the dong was depreciated three times by a total of 19 percent, resulting in a real effective appreciation of 5 percent (Chart 2), but trade and exchange controls were also intensified. The latter included additional import bans, and the imposition in September 1998 of a foreign exchange surrender requirement.4 In February 1999, a new system for setting the exchange rate was introduced, in which the value of the dong in the interbank market is allowed to depreciate by up to 0.1 percent a day, and the official rate is set as the average interbank rate of the previous day. The exchange rate has, however, remained basically unchanged since September 1998. 13. In the structural areas, signs of stress have become more evident over the past two years in the SOE and banking sectors (Boxes 2 and 3). Official data for 1997 suggest that 60 percent of SOEs were running losses or were only marginally profitable, despite extensive trade protection; a number of the larger SOEs were very highly leveraged and several were reported to be in arrears, while overstaffing has been estimated at 25 percent. In the banking sector, based on international audits of the four large state-owned commercial banks, nonperforming loans were running at 30-35 percent of total loan portfolio at end- 1997. All these indicators are expected to have worsened with the growing economic difficulties since early 1998. 3However, a bank recapitalization operation, which was required to implement the new Law on Credit Institutions, increased net banking system claims on the government by 0.7 percent of GDP. 4Under this requirement, exporters have to surrender 80 percent of their foreign currency receipts from current transactions to commercial banks.

Banking Reform Nature and scope of problems l The most vulnerable segment in the past two years has been the 5 1 joint-stock banks (JSBs), whose shareholders include both SOEs and private entities. Although their presence in most areas is small, JSBs account for more than 25 per- cent of banking sector assets in Ho Chi Minh City, which accounts for a quarter of Vietnam’s GDP and over half of exports. Due to imprudent lending and weak regulatory standards, the JSBs have accumulated large nonperforming loans (NPLs) and short foreign currency positions, and many are severely undercapitalized and suffer from serious governance problems. 0 The problems of the four state-owaed commercial banb (SOCBs), accounting for 80 percent of total loans and deposits, are long-standing. These problems originate in incomplete reforms, close links with SOEs, policy interference, and weak regulatory standards. NPLs at two weaker SOCBs were 40-45 percent of their loans (based on recent audits using international standards); there is a large maturity mismatch between the banks’ assets and liabilities; their capital base is weak, and profitability very low. 0 The costs of banking reform appear manageable. Total bank loans amounted to 22 percent of GDP at end- 1998, and rough stafTestimates put the total costs of banking reform and associated SOE reform at about 12 percent of GDP, which could be accommodated given the modest level of government domestic debt and prospective donor support. Approach to banking reform l Joint-stock banks. Following an initial round of assessments, intervention, and closure of two banks in HO Chi Minh City in 1998, the authorities prepared a plan to reorganize the JSB sector in early 1999. The plan emphasizes operational reforms, debt workouts, and recapitalization (including an increase in the foreign ownership limit; public funds would be used under appropriate conditions). Separately, plans for a small-scale deposit protection scheme were prepared. Bank-by-bank restructuring plans have also been developed, allowing for the closure/merger of up to eight banks. There have been delays, and certain specifics of the plans could be improved, but it is expected that the guidelines for establishing a transparent resolution mechanism for handling troubled banks would be soon developed. 0 State-owned commercial banks. Efforts to restructure the SOCBs are still at the early stage: international audits of all four banks have been completed; their frozen loans (inherited from the monobank system) were cleared in a recapitalization exercise in 1998; and a general strategy for the sector, including assessments of the four large banks, was outlined in early 1999. Under current thinking, the emphasis is on operational reforms (separating commercial and policy lending, increasing autonomy, reorganizing management, reducing costs, improving internal controls and training). Consideration is also being given to equitize one smaller SOCB on a pilot basis, including by selling shares to foreign investors. Action plans for individual SOCBs need to be developed, and greater specificity on the content and timetable of key steps is required, including: operational restructuring (which should address labor redundancy, management contracts, and corporate governance issues, and preferably be implemented through twinning arrangements with reputable foreign banks); loan restructuring (to be pursued by special loan workout units and, for certain debt operations, an asset resolution mechanism, with the SBV assessing the macroeconomic implications of the debt resolution process); and recapitalization just ahead of partial privatization of at least one SOCB by 200 1. 0 Policy banks. Much of the increase in credit to SOEs in 1998 was due to directed lending or lending on noncommercial terms through SOCBs. The authorities are planning to establish policy banks with a transition period to phase out such lending through the SOCBs. The staff has argued for a fuewall between commercial and policy lending, and has stressed the need to clearly defme-and strictly limit-the role and scope of such banks by identifying their funding in the state budget and prohibiting deposit taking. l An cwset resolution mechanism is being developed, with World Bank assistance, to facilitate corporate restructuring and help the banks reduce the burden of nonperforming loans. A key prerequisite in this area is to improve the enabling legal environment (see below), and the functioning of the real estate markets and the court system. l Prudential regulations and banking supervision. With MAE and World Bank technical assistance, regulations on loan classification, loan loss provisioning, capital adequacy, and banking supervision were prepared in 1998. Efforts are currently underway to strengthen the rules on bank licensing and bankruptcy, collateral valuation and foreclosure, and the transfer of land-use rights. The authorities also agreed to develop risk-based prudential regulations and supervisory skills, and upgrade accounting standards for banks. These improvements would enable bank supervision in Vietnam to move closer to the Basle Committee’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.

Relative role of the SOE sector The public sector in Vietnam currently accounts for 40 percent of GDP, with a rising share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) estimated at 30 percent of GDP in 1997, due partly to increases in oil production. SOEs now number about 6,000, and account for 20 percent of total investment, nearly one half of outstanding domestic credit, and for over half of industrial output, with dominant shares in oil, cement, chemicals, and steel. Staff analysis based on the data for the 1,044 largest SOEs suggests that the sector is highly concentrated, with the 200 largest SOEs accounting for 40 percent of bank credit and 57 percent of the total state capital. Furthermore, based on data for the 300 most indebted SOEs, 50 SOEs in this group account for two-thirds of the total domestic debt in this group. Compared with China, the SOE sector in Vietnam is relatively larger: SOEs accounted for 55 percent of industrial production in 1997 in Vietnam, compared with less than 25 percent in China in 1998. Also, in China, about 2,600 large enterprises have been corporatized, of which one-half adopted multiple-investor status, including 950 which have been listed on the stock exchanges. In Vietnam, very little has been done beyond the formation of general corporations, and a stock exchange has not yet opened. 2. Financial conditions and recent performance The financial conditions of SOEs have been deteriorating, in part due to inefficiencies, overstaffimg, and outdated technology, and despite extensive protection afforded by the trade regime--in particular, its import substitution bias. Performance has also been affected by the regional crisis, and the resulting economic slowdown. According to official data for 5,429 SOEs in 1997, covering practically the entire SOE sector, only 40 percent of these SOEs are profitable and 60 percent are loss makers or marginally profitable. This latter group accounted for 40 percent of total SOE debt, mostly short-term, and also for 40 percent of total SOE employment of 1.6 million. Data for 1998 are not available, but these indicators can be expected to have worsened due to the more difficult environment. SOEs have relied heavily on domestic bank credit (many without adequate risk appraisal). Bank credit to SOEs grew by 22 percent in 1998, whereas bank credit to the private sector was practically unchanged in real terms. Furthermore, they have significant foreign exchange exposure, having relied on foreign currency dominated loans onlent by the domestic banking system (40-50 percent of total credit to SOEs is denominated in foreign currencies). The full extent of external debt contracted or guaranteed by SOEs is not known. 3. Approach to SOE reform SOE reform efforts have so far focused on the equitization of small and medium-sized SOEs. The pace of equitization has picked up since 1998, with 130 SOEs having been equitized in the 15 months through March 1999. It is, however, too early to assess the impact of equitization on the ownership structure and operations of equitized SOE. Downsizing and rationalizing the SOE sector is vital to ensuring the viability of the banking system, as SOEs account for 35-40 percent of nonperforming loans, and 70 percent of banks’ foreign denominated loans. Accelerated reform of the SOEs will need to include the following elements: . Effective curtailment of budgetary support, or other implicit support, including through the banking system, for nonviable SOEs; . Rapid equitization/privatization of small- and medium-size SOEs; . Restructuring and partiaYfull divestiture (including through joint ventures) of the larger problem SOEs, and closure of the worst performers. . Well-designed social safety nets for retrenched workers, including severance payments, training and micro-credits. The budgetary costs of social safety nets will depend on the modalities, pace, and scope of reform.

Growth of private sector activity has continued to be hampered by the dominant and privileged role accorded to the SOE sector, and by growing concerns about transparency. SOEs have enjoyed preferences in access to credit, land-use rights, tax and regulatory treatment, and targeted trade protection. Also, recent curbs on imports and the exchange system have eroded business confidence. 15. In part spurred by the regional crisis, the authorities have taken initial steps to speed up reform. Parts of the legal framework for the implementation of new banking laws were being put in place and the restructuring of the joint-stock banks was initiated (see Box 2). The equitization program for SOEs was given impetus, and 130 SOEs (mainly small and medium-size) were equitized (including four which were opened to foreign investors) in the 15 months through March 1999, compared with 17 enterprises during 1992-97.’ ILL REPORTONPOLKYDISCUSSJONS A. Medium-Term Outlook and Strategy 16. The discussions focussed on the macroeconomic and structural policies required to foster a sustainable recovery over the medium term. With weak prospects for FDI and exports, growth in the next few years will need to be based on a more efficient use of domestic resources and stronger domestic saving and investment performance. The policy challenges will therefore be to advance structural reforms that address the weaknesses in the SOE and banking sectors and promote a dynamic private sector, within a sound macroeconomic policy framework and supported by an appropriate social safety net. 17. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to establish a market-based economy and agreed with the staff on the direction of reforms, but they emphasized the importance of a gradual approach to reform, stressing the need to maintain social and political stability. They expressed interest in having the government’s reform program supported by an ESAF and SAC, and the staff, in close collaboration with the World Bank, held discussions on a medium-term reform framework that could form the basis for such support6 18. Noting the uncertain external outlook, the staff suggested that it would be prudent to aim the medium-term framework at gradually revitalizing the economy, ‘Equitization, or partial privatization, refers to the conversion of SOEs into joint stock companies, often with some shares retained by the state, and shares sold to workers and managers on a preferential basis, and to outside investors. This process has so far been confined to nonstrategic, small and medium-size enterprises. For details, see the Selected Issues paper. ‘Vietnam is one of six pilot countries for enhanced Bank/Fund collaboration; Appendix V provides a report on the experience with collaboration in this case.

With appropriate reforms to attract a recovery in FDI and donor support, GDP growth in 1999 is projected to remain at about 3’/2 percent, and then rise to about 5% percent by 2001 (Table 5). Inflation should fall slightly to about 7 percent in 1999, and further to about 4 percent by 200 1, while the external current account deficit would gradually narrow from 4% percent of GDP to 3% percent in 2001. However, with very large scheduled repayments of FDI-related loans and a gradual recovery of FDI inflows, considerable financing gaps are projected for this period.’ Assuming availability of additional concessional financing, the debt-service ratio would remain manageable at about 13 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. B. Macroeconomic Prospects and Policies in 1999 19. Primarily reflecting a difference of view with the staff on likely FDI flows, the authorities expect GDP growth in 1999 to reach 5-6 percent, but they have framed their macroeconomic policies on more conservative, implicit assumptions. The 1999 budget has been set cautiously, with the overall deficit to remain at 1 percent of GDP, with no domestic bank financing.’ Revenue is projected to fall from 20 percent of GDP in 1998 to 18% percent 1999, mainly reflecting the uncertainty over growth and allowing for teething problems with the newly introduced VAT. The staff supported the authorities’ intention to compensate for the decline in revenue by cutting nonpriority spending (mainly in administrative areas), while increasing spending on education and the rural sector. Improvements in expenditure monitoring are underway, especially in social spending. 20. The authorities acknowledged the need in 1999 to vigorously implement the VAT. Ongoing Fund technical assistance has identified several issues, including the number of rates, the need to develop self-assessment procedures, the scope of exemptions, and limits of pass-through on prices. Steps are being taken to address these issues, but some actions will require a revision to the law, for which the authorities would prefer to wait until more experience has been gained with implementation. The staff urged that needed revisions to the law be made as soon as possible. Looking ahead, further reforms in tax policy are needed to equalize the tax regime for domestic and foreign investors, eliminate the excess profit tax, and reduce the high marginal tax rates on personal income tax. ’ Appendix VI provides medium-term balance of payments projections, while Appendix VII contains a debt sustainability analysis prepared jointly with the Bank staff. Scheduled repayments (including on FDI loans) are estimated to increase from US$O.5 billion in 1998 to US$l billion in 2001. Over the longer term (through 2020), the DSA shows that the debt service is sustainable, and the debt service ratio for public external debt would fall to 5 percent. ’ Because the budget estimates have been set conservatively, they are also plausible under the staffs lower growth and inflation assumptions.

The staff suggested that it would be appropriate to modify the macroeconomic policy mix to support an effective approach to structural reforms and economic recovery as the government’s plans become more definite. Budgetary policies could be eased to help absorb the.temporary costs of well-designed structural reforms; to ease the social costs of labor shedding in particular, appropriate social safety nets are needed. The prospective fiscal costs (based on the staffs very rough calculations) would appear to be manageable, in light of the current low domestic debt burden of the budget (3 percent of GDP) and the prospective donor financing. 22. The staff argued that credit policy should be tightened to make room for the private sector, as a complement to SOE reform, and to gradually bring down inflation. The growth of broad money in 1999 should be kept at 15% percent, but the growth in credit to the private sector should be raised; SOE credit, however, will need to be slowed, and confined to viable enterprises through enhanced monitoring and specific benchmarks for the largest problem SOEs. The authorities noted that somewhat higher credit and money growth rates would be more appropriate, but they also aimed at providing adequate credit to the private sector. To achieve credit targets, the staff supported the State Bank’s intention to raise reserve requirements and, if necessary, as a second best approach, to reimpose bank-by-bank credit ceilings. The State Bank is also making preparations for the introduction of open market operations by the end of 1999, based on technical assistance from the Fund, and intends to introduce a new (base) interest rate regime to replace the current system of ceilings on lending rates.’ The staff recommended that, prior to establishing the new base rate, the current lending rate ceiling be raised to allow more flexibility and that ample margins be set for bank rates in relation to the proposed base rate. 23. In the area of external sector policies, greater exchange rate flexibility will be needed to protect competitiveness and permit the unwinding of external controls, while a prudent debt management policy is essential. In light of the weakening export performance, the staff recommended a widening in the margin for the interbank rate and a more active adjustment for the official rate to eliminate queuing and segmentation in the exchange market and to return trading volume in the interbank market to more normal levels. A more transparent and flexible exchange system would also help restore confidence. The State Bank indicated readiness to consider adaptation in the light of experience with the new system. Given Vietnam’s relatively large debt service obligations, the authorities recognized that debt management policy would need to be prudent, with primary emphasis on concessional financing of the government. The authorities also were concerned about the potential burden of excessive private sector debt, and have adopted a comprehensive system for monitoring debt, including private sector and FDI-related loans. Wnder this regime, a base rate would be set in relation to the State Bank’s rediscount rate or treasury bill yields to guide bank lending rates.

The authorities have been pursuing a program of gradual SOE reform, focussing chiefly on equitizing smaller SOEs, with limited progress on the larger SOEs. The pace of equitization is picking up, with an additional 250 firms slated for the remainder of 1999. Regulations to simplify divestiture of the smallest enterprises are being issued shortly. However, comprehensive reform plans have taken longer to develop for the larger SOEs, where the authorities have noted their intention to retain full state ownership, and have also been exploring the possibility of forming conglomerates of existing SOEs in some sectors. 25. While welcoming the equitization efforts so far, the staff argued that there is urgent need for a comprehensive reform framework encompassing the larger SOEs, aimed at downsizing and rationalizing the sector through restructuring, partial/full divesture (including promoting joint ventures), and the closure of unviable enterprises. Although mergers and acquisitions could be rational in certain circumstances, the stafFnoted that the government’s plan to create conglomerates would risk reducing competition and increasing cross-subsidization. SOE reform will need to be carefully phased, balancing the need to ease the social costs and to reduce the drain.on the banking sector, and vigorously implemented. Although the authorities recognize the need for reform, including for the larger SOEs, they have not yet agreed on the criteria for classifying SOEs and the options to be pursued for enterprises in financial difficulties. 26. To complement SOE reform, some steps have been taken to promote the private sector and strengthen transparency, but more needs to be done to level the playing field and reduce the regulatory burden on this sector. Recent efforts include permitting some fully foreign-owned enterprises to be formed, reducing the price discrimination against foreign-invested enterprises, and phasing out the requirement of wage-setting in U.S. dollars. Additional steps are needed to support the domestic private sector, for which the legal environment is less favorable than for foreign investors, and to remove barriers to entry for those domestic enterprises potentially in competition with SOEs. To these ends, staff underscored the need to simplify the business registration process, to grant land-use rights to nonstate enterprises, to improve the environment for joint ventures (especially in established enterprises), and to remove the preferential access to credit for SOEs. In this context, greater transparency in statistics is also critical (see Section F below). D. Banking Reform” 27. Reform is needed to strengthen and build a competitive banking system, with an expanding role for the private sector. With technical assistance from the World Bank and MAE, banking reform has proceeded on three parallel tracks: legal and supervisory framework, joint-stock banks (JSBs), and state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). In the ‘ODetails of banking reform are provided in the Selected Issues paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - discussions, there was general agreement on an action plan for improving the legal and supervisory environment (see Box 2). 28. Significant progress has been made in developing a strategy for restructuring the JSBs, but substantial work still lies ahead. Corrective actions have been initiated to contain risks in the JSBs stemming from their high foreign exchange exposure and poor management, and eight (mostly urban) JSBs are expected to be closed by end-1999. The staff encouraged the authorities to proceed expeditiously with the next steps, in particular, by finalizing a restructuring plan for all 5 1 JSBs, and by establishing and implementing guidelines for a transparent resolution mechanism for rehabilitating viable banks and for closing insolvent ones. 29. Reform of the four large SOCBs has been much slower and needs to be accelerated. The staff urged the authorities to develop specific plans for each of the four SOCBs. Particular importance has been attached to speedy and significant operational/management reforms; loan restructuring; and recapitalization at the last stage, after substantial progress in restructuring. Given the lack of critical skills, twinning arrangements with reputable foreign banks will be useful. To ensure that the SOCBs are put on a sound commercial footing, it will also be important to secure domestic and foreign equity participation in SOCBs, including a reputable strategic foreign partner in at least one of the large SOCBs. The authorities have formulated an overall strategy for the state bank sector which is consistent with this broad policy orientation, but they expressed reservations about twinning arrangements, and were prepared to consider foreign equity participation in one small regional SOCB as a pilot case. The staff recommended that policy lending, a source of problems for the SOCBs (see Box 2) should be phased out, and that policy banks-if established-will need to be strictly limited in scope and funded from the budget. The authorities are still developing their plans in this area. E. Trade and Exchange System Liberalization 30. Initial steps are being taken toward greater regional and international economic integration, but these will need to be reinforced. New regulations were issued in 1998 to develop a more liberal trading rights system. In particular, the number of Vietnamese enterprises registered to engage in trade jumped from 3,000 to 30,000 in one year. However, bureaucratic impediments and limits on trading rights for foreign-invested enterprises will need to be removed. At the start of 1999, the maximum standard tariff was reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent, the average tariff rate was estimated at 15.5 percent, and the number of rates was reduced from 14 to 10. In addition, the government has initiated auctions of garment export quotas and private sector participation in the export of rice. However, about 8 additional categories of goods were subjected to quotas in 1999.” l1 According to the Fund’s index of trade restrictiveness, Vietnam is rated 9 on a scale of l-10 (continued.. .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- 31. The staff argued that top priority should be given to phasing out nontariff barriers (NTBs) over a relatively short timetable. Greater exposure to international competition and a shift from import substitution would ensure a more efficient use of resources and reduce the bias in favor of SOEs. Some quotas create a bias against agriculture and other potential exports (both key sources of economic growth), while other restrictions I have fostered nonviable domestic industries. The phasing out of NTBs should be accompanied by transitional tariffs, if needed in some critical cases; in the interim, quotas should be allocated by more transparent methods. Progress should also be made in reducing the still high levels of tariffs in order to reduce protection, augment revenue by reducing the incentive for smuggling, and simpliQ the customs procedures. In the discussions, the authorities preferred to remove NTBs by 2006, in line with the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, in order to ease the transition for SOEs, and questioned the case for tariff reductions in Vietnam’s current circumstances. However, they are also considering firrther changes in the trade regime in connection with discussions on a bilateral trade agreement with the United States, which would facilitate WTO accession. 32. The staff urged the authorities to reverse the recent intensification of exchange controls and to eliminate Vietnam’s remaining exchange restrictions. In particular, the early elimination of the surrender requirement would help boost confidence. The new Foreign Exchange Decree and its implementing regulations seek to provide a liberal framework for the making of payments for most current international transactions, but there is some evidence of ad hoc restrictions resulting from queuing in the foreign exchange market, as noted earlier, and the assignment of priorities in foreign exchange allocation for certain imports. Moreover, the Law on Foreign Investment continues to require foreign exchange balancing and a tax on profit remittances, which are restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4.” The authorities have not yet decided on a timetable to achieve full current account of convertibility for Vietnam. “(...continued) (with 10 being the most restrictive). A description of the trade system is provided in the Selected Issues Paper. 12Vietnam maintains restrictions under Article XIV, Section 2 on payments for certain invisible transactions. In addition, the following measures are subject to approval under Article VIII: (i) restrictions evidenced by external payments arrears; (ii) restrictions arising from the foreign exchange balancing requirements that apply to payments and transfers by foreign invested firms and foreign investors; (iii) the multiple currency practice arising from the tax on profit remittances by foreign investors; and (iv) restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange for payments for imports of certain cdmmodities. The staff is also seeking to resolve a number of jurisdictional questions arising from the new foreign exchange decree.

There was general agreement on the importance of policy and data transparency for improving the business environment and the credibility of policies. With Fund and Bank technical assistance, the authorities have begun publication of data on the approved 1999 budget and the past outcome, but there is considerable scope for improvement, in terms of frequency, comprehensiveness, and coverage. The authorities acknowledged that their statistical compilation methods, especially for national accounts and the balance of payments, are still being adapted to the needs of a market economy. The staff urged further efforts to improve the production and publication of statistics through Vietnam’s participation in the GDDS, noting additional technical assistance-especially in the monetary statistics area- would be available. Reflecting greater openness with financial statistics, the State Bank plans to complete work in 1999 on a country page for International Financial Statistics and the publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin. With respect to Y2K issues, a National Action Plan is being developed, with the World Bank’s assistance, and a Y2K task force has been established.r3 IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 34. The performance of the Vietnamese economy has deteriorated sharply, as domestic structural -weaknesses were compounded by the impact of the Asian crisis. Following several years of strong economic performance driven in part by large FDI inflows, output growth has slowed markedly since early 1998, while FDI flows and exports have fallen substantially, reflecting Vietnam’s extensive trade and investment links with the region. These difficulties reflect the poor performance of the SOE sector and a serious erosion of confidence-stemming from concerns about bank soundness and the transparency and fairness of the business environment. 35. The authorities have responded to these difficulties by pursuing a restrained budgetary stance, easing credit policy with respect to the SOEs, and by adjusting the exchange rate along with a tightening of exchange and trade curbs. Initial steps have also been taken to address the problems in the banking and SOE sectors, and the authorities remain committed to market-oriented reforms. 36. While the authorities’ record of containing inflation is commendable, achieving a lasting reduction in inflation and higher, sustainable growth will require more comprehensive and accelerated structural reforms, including the promotion of private sector activity. The reforms of the state-owned commercial banks, large SOEs, and the trade system are all critical elements of this process, and must be complemented by concrete measures to build the private sector and to develop a social safety net. 13According to recent study by the Gartner Group, Vietnam was rated in the lowest category in terms of its Y2K readiness/preparedness. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- 37. Top priority should be given to downsizing and rationalizing the SOE sector. With limited reform to date, the SOE sector remains very large and a drag on the economy, and SOE financial conditions have deteriorated substantially. To rationalize this sector, all policy options need to be incorporated in the reform strategy, encompassing restructuring, full/partial divestiture -including greater flexibility for joint ventures-and closure. 38. It will also be essential to decisively promote the private sector, both domestic and foreign. Actions are urgently needed to level the playing field vis-a-vis the SOE sector, to remove barriers to entry, and to reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector. Greater transparency and openness with respect to domestic regulation and data will also be critical in this context. 39. Revitalizing the economy will also require a much stronger and more competitive banking sector. Although the restructuring ofjoint-stock banks has begun, effective policies and mechanisms to deal with troubled banks need to be fully defined and implemented in a determined manner. The governance and management of state-owned commercial banks need to be upgraded, and business plans for restructuring each of these banks need to be developed and implemented. To modernize and achieve a sound and competitive banking system, it will be important at an appropriate point to open up the state-owned banks to domestic and foreign private investors, including through equity participation by a reputable foreign partner. Twinning arrangements can also play a beneficial role in the reform process. Further efforts are also needed to improve prudential regulations and bank supervision. 40. Trade liberalization will be essential to develop a more competitive domestic sector and foster a more outwardly oriented economy. Highest priority should be given to the removal of nontariff barriers over a relatively short time frame with the use of transitional tariffs if necessary. Tariffs should also be phased down to contribute to the reduction in protection. Trading partners should be prepared to give Vietnam credit for undertaking such liberalization in their bilateral trade negotiations. 41. To support well-designed structural reforms and foster recovery, some adaptation in the mix of macroeconomic policies would be appropriate, by easing the budgetary stance and by tightening and redirecting credit policy. The 1999 budget is sufficiently restrained, and it is prudent to cut expenditure in the face of the projected weakness in revenue performance. It will, however, be important to secure adequate funding for the most critical economic and social sectors. In the framework of an effective approach to structural reforms, the budget deficit could be permitted to widen to accommodate the temporary costs of well-designed social safety nets for retrenched workers, in light of the currently low domestic debt burden and prospective donor support. For credit policy to better support reforms, growth in credit to the SOE sector needs to be slowed and credit confined to viable SOEs, with a mechanism for enhanced monitoring of SOEs to harden their budget constraints, and more room needs to be made for the private sector.

Greater flexibility in the exchange rate would help to protect competitiveness and facilitate relaxation of trade and exchange controls. A more transparent exchange and trade system would help improve the business climate, and make more foreign exchange available for the private sector. To ensure a sustainable external debt burden, Vietnam should adopt a cautious debt policy, including debt contracted as part of foreign direct investment, I and closely monitor debt on a comprehensive basis. Vietnam maintains exchange measures which are subject to approval under Article VIII. In the absence of a timetable for removal, the staff does not recommend approval of these measures. 43. Welcome steps have been taken to improve data and policy transparency, including the commitment to publish a country page in the International Financial Statistics, but more needs to be done to improve data quality and dissemination for effective surveillance and to come closer to international standards. The coverage of the recent publication of budget information needs to be broadened to permit meaningful analysis. Also, the publication of financial sector data would make the banks’ activities more transparent. Vietnam is strongly encouraged to participate in the GDDS as a means of developing a comprehensive program for the improvement of its macroeconomic statistical systems. 44. Implementation of the policies discussed above, to foster sustainable recovery, will require strong political consensus. The Government’s commitment to these policies and the development of comprehensive action plans would be essential for Fund support through an ESAF arrangement. 45. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12 month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - Table 4.

The authorities are cooperating with the Fund, though work is hampered in some areas by disputes as to which agency should be responsible for certain types of statistics. The authorities are aiming to improve timeliness and coverage of data reported to the staff Vietnam has few , statistical publications that cover statistics beyond the real sector, and Fund documents are among the few publicly available sources of monetary and fiscal data. Extensive technical assistance has contributed to improvements in a number of areas. STA’s technical assistance efforts, in collaboration with APD, culminated in the development of a draft IFS page for Vietnam, which is expected to be approved by the State Bank in 1999. Past technical assistance efforts, however, have not yet led to regular reporting of data to STA. National accounts The General Statistical Office (GSO) provides data on output by industry and on price developments. National accounts statistics are compiled according to the System of National Accounts (SNA), and are available beginning in 1989. However, a methodology fully consistent with the SNA, including the collection of enterprise data based on generally accepted accounting principles, has yet to be implemented. The estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) by expenditure categories remain weak. Although coverage has been broadened to include military and communist party expenditure, the available evidence suggests that the level of GDP may be understated in the official statistics, and that the authorities need to focus on improving data collection from nonstate sectors. To improve transparency, the authorities agreed to initiate work on the publication of a monthly GSO bulletin. Prices The GSO has in recent years published a retail price index @PI) as its basic measure of inflation. A CPI in line with international standards has been compiled since January 1996. The new series was phased in over a two-year period. The introduction of a producer price index is planned. Government finance statistics Annual fiscal data on government operations are produced shortly afIer the fiscal (calendar) year to which they refer, but are only finalized after extended delay. During the last few years, Vietnam has received considerable technical assistance from STA in government finance statistics (GFS) methodology; recently, the authorities have made significant progress in a number of areas related to fiscal transparency, including the implementation of an improved budget management law and the adoption of a GFS-consistent budget classification at all levels of government. The authorities published for the first time in late 1998 the fiscal results for 1997 and the approved budget for 1999, and have agreed henceforth to gazette and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - APPENDIX II publish annual national budget and its outturn, and publish commune levels budgets; prepare a GFS page for Vietnam; prepare quarterly fiscal reports on a regular basis with a 30-day delay using the GFS classification; implement a GFS-based Cmctional budget classification system; and initiate work on revising government accounting standards and introducing an integrated financial information management system for improving treasury management and fiscal reporting. Monetary statistics Data regularly provided to APD by the State Bank include the monetary survey, the State Bank balance sheet (both on a monthly basis with a six-week lag), and a detailed consolidated balance sheets (“derivation tables”) for four state- and 24 nonstate-owned commercial banks (on a quarterly basis with an 8-10 week lag). Beginning in 1997, an expanded monetary survey has been compiled, raising the number of banks covered from 28 to 40 (including the joint-stock banks, joint venture banks, and branches of foreign banks), and the statistical coverage to 86 percent of banking sector assets. In January 1999, the State Bank and commercial banks began implementing new charts of accounts, developed with STA assistance. The State Bank has agreed in principle to provide the monetary survey and derivation tables with a three-week delay, And to prepare a quarterly statistical bulletin for publication in 1999. External statistics Data on foreign reserves (official reserves and net foreign assets) are derived from the monetary survey, and are therefore subject to the same six-week reporting lag as the monetary survey. Recently, however, the authorities have agreed to commence reporting monthly official reserves data with a two-week lag. Moreover, data are reported only in local currency, and there are inconsistencies in the valuation procedures used across banks. Beginning in January 1995, trade data have been compiled on the basis of customs reports. Published trade data, however, contain a number of adjustments to the customs reports, which have been difficult to reconcile, as the staff is only provided data at a relatively high level of aggregation. Data on invisibles continue to be based largely on banking records, which provide incomplete coverage and incomplete identification of the types of transactions. Improvements in balance of payments data continue to be hampered by interagency coordination problems. Detailed data on the contracting of foreign direct investment are maintained by the Ministry of Planning and Investment. Data on the disbursements of FDI are slowly improving, but still have major deficiencies. There is a pressing need for a survey of direct investment because the banking data do not provide sufficient detail. Data on contracting commercial debt are maintained by the State Bank. Some loans are reported only after an extended delay, and the reporting of disbursements and repayments remains poor. Data on contracting, disbursement, and service of official debt are maintained by the Ministry of Finance.

By end-December 1996, 15 operations totaling about $1.6 billion had been approved. So far in 1997, three projects have been approved in forest protection and rural development ($22 million), highway rehabilitation ($196 million), and water supply ($97 million). IDA expects to commit up to $500 million in FYI998 including an IDA credit in support of Vietnam’s London Club debt restructuring. The Bank chaired the last Consultative Group meeting in Paris in December 1998. Vietnam is current in its debt service payments to the Bank as of end-December 1998. The Bank has done substantial sectoral and analytical work on Vietnam. A country economic memorandum on deepening reform for growth has recently been issued. Sector reports have been completed in agriculture, transport, energy, health, external trade, the financial sector, poverty, the environment, education and population. The Bank has also managed technical assistance projects funded by the UNDP and others. World Bank Financial Operations (Millions of U.S. dollars) 1994 1995. 1996 1997 1998 Est.

The objective of operational strategy is to promote efficient economic growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development, taking into account the particular needs of an economy undergoing transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented system. Along this line, AsDB’s support in the medium-term addresses key constraints in the following areas: (i) policy reform and institutional development; (ii) infrastructure development; (iii) rural development; (iv) human development; and (v) environment and natural resource management. From October 1993 to December 1998, AsDB approved 22 loans totaling about $1.58 billion fi-om the concessional Asian Development Fund. Disbursements in 1998 totaled $128 million. Lending has mainly focused on rehabilitating the dilapidated physical infrastructure in the agriculture, energy and transport sectors, but has also addressed social and environmental or cross-cutting concerns in line with the government development strategy and financial sector reform. In addition, the Bank has extended technical assistance amounting to about $54 million for 83 projects. Since December 1998, Vietnam has been classified as a B-l country by the AsDB, which makes it eligible to borrow limited amounts at non-concessional Ordinary Capital Resources terms. Support for policy and structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and to encourage the development of the private sector forms a vital component of AsDB operations in Vietnam. Key areas targeted for policy support include (i) financial sector reforms to increase the confidence of the public in the financial system and improve the efficiency of financial intermediation; and (ii) industrial sector reform to promote a private sector-led export oriented enterprises. So far, AsDB has approved two policy-based program loans in the agriculture sector (US!!80 million in 1994) and the financial sector (US$90 million in 1996). In addition to program lending, policy dialogue is an important feature in all of AsDB’s loan projects in Vietnam. This will include support for increased efficiency through tariff reform and other measures to increase cost recovery and strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and planning within state-owned utilities. In December 1996, AsDB established a Resident Mission in Hanoi, which assists in facilitating the implementation of AsDB-financed projects. In view of the recent regional currency turmoil, the Bank organized a seminar, in December, 1997 in Hanoi, to discuss the experience of affected countries and draw lessons relevant for Vietnam. A Fund staff representative participated in the conference. The Bank and the Fund are closely working together to support the process of economic reforms in Vietnam. This is being done by AsDB staff participation in Fund missions, as well as through close cooperation between the resident missions of the two institutions.

In July 1998, the Vietnamese authorities initiated the practice of tripartite poli,cy discussions with Bank and Fund staff, in view of the close linkages of macroeconomic and structural policies in designing reform options for Vietnam. This initiative was developed in the context of discussions toward a possible ESAF arrangement from the Fund and on a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) II from the Bank. 2. Reinforcing this approach, in September 1998 the authorities agreed to participate in the pilot exercise for enhanced Bank-Fund collaboration to support policy reform and development programs in selected countries. Such collaboration could place both the Bank and the Fund in a strong position to respond quickly and jointly to Vietnam’s needs, particularly arising from the impact of the Asian crisis. 3. Under enhanced collaboration, specific policy areas were identified as warranting special attention and work practices have been adapted accordingly. The work programs of the Bank and Fund country teams have been coordinated to permit parallel missions both for policy and technical discussions, and there has been exchange of information. In late 1998, the Government established an ESAF/SAC steering committee under the Chairmanship of First Deputy Prime Minister Dung, supported by a secretariat to ensure institutional coordination in tripartite collaboration. Areas for collaboration 4. In addition to the main, interrelated aspects of programs to be supported by the ESAF and SACII, four areas were targeted for close collaboration: . SOE and banking reforms, which are crucial and interlinked, and have strong macroeconomic implications. Accelerating these reforms, which have been on the authorities agenda, is a prerequisite for Vietnam’s recovery. . Budget publication and public expenditure review. Improved flows of data for donors and the public promotes greater credibility and transparency of economic policies. Initial efforts have focused on assisting the government to publish the budget, to improve fiscal reporting/information systems and to promote fiscal decentralization. With increased fiscal transparency, Bank dialogue on public expenditure management could be strengthened. ‘This Appendix incorporates comments of the World Bank staff. Vietnam is also a pilot country for the Bank’s Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF).

Prudent external debt management for Vietnam is critical, and requires improving the debt reporting capacity to ‘provide accurate and timely information on the stock of debt and public guarantees. Formulating guidelines for public borrowing and guaranteeing of loans could be part - ’ of a debt management initiative. Key elements are assessments of debt sustainability, and the development of a debt management strategy. Mitigating social costs of reforms. Identifying the social costs’of various reforms, including SOE, banking and trade reforms has been a key concern in ESAFLSAC discussions. Enhanced collaboration would permit a more integrated program design, and support a package of interventions comprising the safety net for vulnerable segments that may be affected adversely by the reforms. 5. Throughout the policy discussions so far, the Fund staff has taken the lead, in close consultation with the Bank staff, on the macroeconomic policy framework and on external sector issues and prospects. As a result, a unified assessment of these aspects was contained in the Bank’s report for the December 1998 Consultative Croup meeting for Vietnam, laying the basis for consideration of donor assistance. Similarly, in its work on trade reform, the Fund staff consulted with the Bank staff and experts, including on the preparation of a position paper on trade reform for the authorities. 6. The Bank staff has also consulted with the Fund staff in areas where the Bank is taking the lead, particularly SOE and banking reforms, and on key development/poverty issues. Technical materials have been shared, issues debated, and both parties have been kept alerted to each other’s thinking on the various issues. The Fund staff has benefited from the Bank’s work on the overall financial conditions of SOEs, on equitization of small and medium-size enterprises, and the related work bearing on social safety nets. Work practices 7. The two country teams have coordinated their work programs and missions to ensure effective tripartite discussions, and the timely contribution of technical work on both sides, and to avoid duplication of efforts. These tasks have been time-consuming, in part because the Bank’s country team is much larger, decentralized and based in Hanoi. Nonetheless, in the seven months under this pilot exercise so far: . AI1 three Fund missions (for ESAF/Article IV discussions) were in parallel with the Bank’s SAC missions, which were staffed by the Bank’s resident mission and technical departments in the Bank Headquarters. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - APPENDIX V Fund staff from Headquarters and the resident representative office actively participated in several Bank’s technical team missions to Hanoi on banking reform and the SOEs. The Bank team in Hanoi worked jointly with an FAD mission to provide technical assistance for budget publication and for improving fiscal reporting/information , system. An MAE technical assistance mission in March 1999 collaborated with the Bank’s Financial Sector mission on bank reform. A joint debt sustainability analysis was conducted during the Article IV mission in November 1998. The Fund’s resident representative has maintained continuous contact with the Bank’s resident mission, and participated in the Bank’s Country Economic Mission in August 1998. 8. Periodic meetings of the ESAF/SAC Steering Committee secretariat, in between missions and with participation of the Fund’s resident representative and the Bank’s chief economist in Hanoi, have been organized to help define more specific work programs for the authorities, to ensure timely availability of data and information, and to track progress in the development of reform plans. 9. Joint, written communications to the authorities, beyond the usual work on drafts of the Policy Framework Paper (PFP) and the PFP matrix, have been prepared. . A aide-memoire for the joint FAD and Bank mission on fiscal transparency was prepared in September 1998. l In the November 1998 round of ESAF discussions, in response to the government’s request, a joint ESAF/SAC mission aide-memoire summarized the missions’ main findings, the status of ESAF/SAC discussions, and recommended next steps. a In the March 1999 round of discussions, a joint letter from the mission heads highlighted the main unresolved issues in the discussions. 10. Information has been exchanged and technical discussions between the two staffs have been continuous. Priorities for technical assistance for areas of common interest have also been reviewed.

From the perspective of Bank and Fund staffs, enhanced collaboration on Vietnam has entailed active coordination of work programs, intensive technical coordination, and preparations for tripartite policy discussions. These efforts are essential for constructive collaboration, have served to minimize duplication of effort, and have helped each staffs own work through the provision of the needed inputs for each other. Nonetheless, by their very nature these efforts have been time consuming on both sides. They have also required efforts to reconcile the different work styles and cultures of the Bank and the Fund, for instance, the Fund’s typically, shorter timetables and its tighter review process, contrasted with the Bank’s greater flexibility and more decentralized decision-making structure. 12. From the perspective of the authorities, enhanced collaboration has promoted the delivery from the Bank and Fund staffs of consistent and indeed-through tripartite discussions-joint policy advice in the critical, common areas of interest. These areas are essential for the development and recovery of the Vietnamese economy, and consistent advice should be beneficial to the authorities. The authorities have also benefitted in practical terms by minimizing time spent in both policy and technical discussions. This benefit should be considerable, in view of the time taken so far for tripartite discussions and the range of policy issues needed to be addressed by the authorities under the current, difficult circumstances. 13. The major benefit of enhanced institutional collaboration can be expected to derive from a more effective integration of development and macroeconomic/structural objectives in the Government’s reform program, as reflected in mutually reinforcing ESAF and SAC supported programs. As E&W/SAC discussions have been protracted and are continuing, it is too early to assess the benefit of collaboration when measured against this standard.

Merchandise trade: Export growth in U.S. dollar terms is projected to grow only by about, 3 percent in 1999, on ‘the assumption of a gradual recovery in Asia, which accounts for more than half of Vietnam’s exports. In addition, the expected increase in the volume of crude oil exports will represent only a modest growth in value terms due to low crude oil prices. The export growth rate is projected to recover to about 7 percent by 200 1. This reflects a resumption of world demand and a supply response from the non-traditional export sector that was established by large FDI inflows in the mid-1990s. Imports, which declined in value terms by 1.1 percent in 1998, are projected to recover gradually with real GDP growth to reach about 7 percent by 200 1. The impact of trade reform on imports is projected to be moderated by appropriate macroeconomic policies. . Services and transfers: Exports of non-factor services are expected to improve in tandem with improvements in merchandise exports, and on account of recovery in tourism. Nevertheless, dividends and service payments on earlier FDI related loans and equity inflows would increase, so that the overall service balance would improve only marginally over the next three years. Both official and private transfers are projected to remain broadly constant over the same period. . Medium and long-term loans: ODA disbursements, which have historically been well below annual commitments, are expected to be constrained, as in the past, by the speed of domestic project implementation. Therefore, ODA disbursements are projected to increase from US$O.8 billion in 1998 to about US$l .O billion in 200 1. To the extent that larger project loans were to become available, this would be partly offset by higher imports, reflecting the typically high import content of projects. Commercial loans have included in the past borrowing by the joint-venture companies, the public enterprises, and the private corporate sector. The amount of borrowing in the next three years is projected at US%O.3 billion per annum, reflecting a gradual improvement in access to capital markets. These loans mostly comprise borrowing by the joint-venture companies, and, to a much lesser extent, the private corporate sector. Amortization is estimated to fluctuate between US$O.5 and US$O.6 billion a year. . Foreign direct investment: Assuming a gradual recovery in Asia, FDI is assumed to also recover gradually over the medium term. It is projected to increase marginally to about US%740 million in 2001 from a projected low of US%600 million in 1999. At the same time, the loan component of the FDI inflows is assumed to remain high at the 1998 level of 70 percent. . Short-term capital flows and reserves: Commercial banks are projected to retain the level of their current net foreign asset position in 1999 and 2000, and increase that level only marginally in 2001. No other increases in short-term capital flows are projected. Reserve targets have been set such that the import cover is maintained above 10 weeks. This represents a cumulative reserve growth of about ’ US$300 million over this three year period. Financing gaps: On the basis of the above projections and assumptions, financing gaps are brojected to total about US$l.5 billion during 1999-2001.

The sustainability analysis differs from that presented in the 1997 Article IV consultation report on account of the less favorable external environment and a less robust growth over the medium term. Export growth and FDI inflows are expected to be relatively moderate due to weaker economic activity in Asia. The main conclusion of the last report was that the projected debt service burden is sustainable and consistent with sustained economic growth. This conclusion is maintained, provided that strong and credible policies are implemented and caution is exercised in external nonconcessional borrowing. As in the previous analysis, public debt service declines to below 4 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services over the next 20 years. The projections take into account pledges made by donors during the Vietnam Consultative Group meeting in Tokyo in December 1998. The World Bank staff agrees with this analysis. Stock of external debt and debt service burden At end-1998, Vietnam’s total stock of external debt is estimated at US$16.7 billion (Table 1). This includes short-term debt of US$O.7 billion, private sector debt of US$4.2 billion, and debt incurred through the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), most of which is debt to Russia, of TR 10.5 billion, valued at US$O.6 per TR 1. A London Club rescheduling agreement was concluded in 1998 on terms comparable to the 1993 Paris Club rescheduling. The total debt stock at end-1998 in net present value terms, including arrears of TR 8.2 bil- lion, is estimated to amount to 59.7 percent of GDP or 125.6 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. Stock of convertible debt at end-1998 amounted to US$10.3 billion. Multilateral debt is estimated at US$l.5 billion, of which 53 percent is owed to the World Bank, 21 percent to the Asian Development Bank, and 24 percent to the Fund. The scheduled external debt service in 1999 is expected to reach 6 percent of GDP and 13 percent of exports of goods and services. About half of the total is public debt service, which is equivalent to 13 percent of budgetary revenue (Tables 2 and 3). Assumptions and medium and long-term prospects The projection assumes, for illustrative purposes, that debt to the CMEA is rescheduled in mid-1999 on terms at least comparable to the 1993 Paris Club rescheduling involving a 70 percent up-front discount on all debt and the application of London terms (50 percent NPV reduction of pre-cut off arrears).’ Furthermore, it assumes that Vietnam maintains prudent macroeconomic policies and accelerates implementation of structural reforms, especially in the areas including trade, public enterprise, and the financial sector, Continued efforts are being made to conclude the rescheduling agreement with Russia.

On this basis, it is expected that the economy would be able to recover and maintain a sustainable growth of about 7 percent in the long term (Table 4). Such a growth rate would need to be supported initially by investment at around 25 percent of GDP, of which 2-3 percent would be from foreign investors. Continued foreign savings would be important to attain the growth objectives even though domestic savings is expected to increase in the long term. Foreign savings needs would decline from 4.2 percent of GDP in 1998 to about , 2.2 percent in 2005 and 1 percent of GDP in the long run. In the long term, export growth is projected to be well below the mid-1990s growth of 20-35 percent a year, but it would recover from the recent past of 2-3 percent, to a more sustainable 9-l 1 percent a year (Table 5). The actual outcome would depend partly on the supply response of the private sector to structural reforms, and partly on the regional environment. Import growth will remain high, growing at about 8-10 percent a year, reflecting strong investment activities. Debt service as a percent of exports of goods and non- factor services would peak in 2000 at 13.8 percent and gradually decline thereafter. This development reflects, on the one hand, the large loan component of FDI that was disbursed during mid-1990s and, on the other hand, the tight limits to be set on external nonconcessional borrowing. In terms of government revenue, the debt service ratio is expected to decline steadily to below 12 percent in 2003. In order to satisfy external financing needs while maintaining the debt service burden manageable, continued foreign support in the form of concessional loans and grants in the range of 4-5 percent of GDP would be required. This support would enable Vietnam to maintain nonconcessional loans at around 1.3 percent of GDP in the medium term. In the longer term, total external annual borrowing could be kept to about 3 percent of GDP, while maintaining adequate international reserves. Sensitivity analysis The medium-term outlook is sensitive to the assumptions made on domestic macroeconomic and structural policies and regional environment. In particular, weaker export performance resulting from poor private sector response to reforms as a result of inconsistent domestic policies or sluggish recovery in the region from the recent turmoil in financial markets would reduce both exports and growth. To test the sensitivity of the outlook presented above to changes in export performance, the alternative scenario assumes that annual growth of exports will be lower by about 3 percent (Table 4). With less investment and export growth, the real GDP growth rate is expected to remain at about 5.5 percent. Imports are expected to grow on average just above 5 percent, reflecting the weaker investment activities and inward policies. Under this scenario, even with a somewhat lower international reserve target, annual external borrowing would need to rise to about 8 percent of GDP. Assuming concessional borrowing could reach about 4.5 percent of GDP, debt service ratio would increase to about 19 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services by 2018. The sensitivity analysis shows that in the long run, prolonged lower export performance is not sustainable as it is likely to lead to import compression and further reduce economic growth.
