ZNTR~DUCTION AND SUMMARY 1. In concluding the 1998 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors expressed concern about Myanmar’s worsening economic situation and the persistent delays in undertaking tindamental economic reforms. They also regretted a recent tightening of administrative controls and cautioned that postponing comprehensive adjustment would result in a prolonged period of slow growth, high inflation, and shortages of foreign exchange. 2. The economic situation has remained diffkult. Myanmar appears to have been relatively unaffected by the Asian crisis, so will not benefit significantly from Asia’s recovery. Without economic reforms and renewed access to concessional financing, foreign exchange will remain scarce and growth will continue to trend down. 3. Unlocking Myanmar’s economic potential will require comprehensive economic reforms and the securing of international support. The elimination of macroeconomic imbalances and a greater liberalization of markets are necessary to boost growth and reduce poverty. Renewed access to concessional external financing will also require steps toward democratization. However, recent political developments have not been conducive to a resumption of international support. 4. Regardless of whether Myanmar succeeds or fails in normalizing its international relations, there is a clear need for economic reform. Staff attempted to identify the necessary changes to macroeconomic and structural policies to initiate the reform process. Prominent among these was the unification of the exchange rate system. The authorities showed some interest in a gradual approach to achieve this objective, but were in general disinclined to attempt major economic adjustments in the absence of external financing. II. BACKGROUND A. Economic Setting 5. Myanmar’s economic potential is considerable. It has large amounts of uncultivated land, extensive fresh water, abundant mineral resources, and an attractive natural environment. Myanmar is located in a region of dynamic growth and is flanked by the giant markets of India and China. It historically has had a tradition of a strong education system and civil service. Given the low base, growth rates could easily approach double digits. 6. Nonetheless, economic performance has fallen well short of potential (Text Chart). GDP growth since the mid-1980s, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- although high, has been modest by regional standards. Official reserves are very low (net reserves cover 1 l% months of imports). Inflation continues to be about 30 percent even as disinflation has taken hold in the region. Physical capital is deteriorating. Poverty is widespread and human development lags other countries in the region. 7. This record reflects both inappropriate policies and an external financing constraint. The current regime took control in 1988 aRer the failure of the isolationist “Burmese Way to Socialism.” Steps taken in the early 1990s to liberalize the economy and attract foreign investment had immediate gains in terms of economic performance. However, liberalization efforts have since stalled and passive monetization of large fiscal deficits has resulted in high inflation and low investor confidence. Government policies continue to be interventionist, despite the break from the command economy. The grossly-overvalued official exchange rate effectively grants monopoly power to state enterprises and encourages rent-seeking. Even before the Asian crisis, growth appeared to be trending down. 8. There is a permanent shortage of foreign exchange. This reflects the conduct of economic policies, but Myanmar has also become subject to extensive international sanctions as a result of its human rights record, as well as concerns about narcotic trafficking and military spending. No financing has been received from international financial institutions for over a decade; a third of external debt is in arrears B. Recent Developments 9. The Asian crisis has had only a limited impact on Myanmar. Following the floating of the Thai baht in mid- 1997, the free market exchange Exchange Rates, 1995-1999 rate depreciated rapidly (Text Chart and Box l), leading to a surge in inflation. Other effects the crisis have included slower growth of tourist arrivals and delayed receipt of gas export revenues.

Myanmar also incurred arrears to the World Bank and the AsDB. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - Box 1. Myanmar: Impact of the Asian Crisis I The Asian crisis has adversely impacted Myanmar, but by less than had been expected: . The FEC exchange rate depreciated by 50 percent against the U.S. dollar during May 1997 to October 1998, reflecting the weakening of the Thai babt, but has since strengthened. 0 Higher import prices (as well as the drought) tripled the officially reported rate of CPI inflation to 67 percent in June 1998 (year-on-year); inflation stood at 29 percent in April 1999. 0 FDI, most of which is from the region, fell by one-third in 1998/99 from the previous year to US%288 million, although this decline also reflected the winding down of large energy and tourism projects begun earlier. New FDI commitments fell to almost zero during 1998/99. . Foreign exchange earnings from offshore gas fields have yet to be realized owing to lower energy demand in Thailand. . Gross international reserves dropped to the equivalent of less than one-month of imp&-t coverage during 1997, but have since doubled. The government has implemented an array of ad hoc measures over the past two years in response to a shortage of foreign currency: 0 Border trade was required to be conducted in U.S. dollars (November 1997). 0 Imports of all goods not on two limited lists of priority goods were banned (March 1998). 0 Restrictions on private-sector commodity exports were imposed (March 1998). 0 Private bank foreign exchange licenses were revoked (March 1998). . Debt service to the World Bank was interrupted, putting Myanmar on a nonaccrual status (September 1998). . A 5 percent commercial tax w+s replaced by an extra income tax of 2 percent and an 8 percent commercial tax, payable in foreign exchange (December 1997 and January 1999, respectively). 0 Open general import licences for state enterprises were made available only on a case-by-&e basis (1998/99). . The monthly limit on remittances against FECs for payments on invisible transactions and current transfers was reduced from $50,000 to $30,000 (1998/99). ’ ’ Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) were introduced in 1993 to legalize certain foreign exchange t.ransactions and reduce the coverage of the fixed official exchange rate. FECs are U.S. dollar denominated and are issued by the Central Bank of Myanmar against hard currencies. They can be exchanged for kyat at a market-determined rate or held as foreign currency-denominated bank deposits (with limited convertibility into forcing currency). The parallel market rate for U.S. dollar currency tends to be slightly more depreciated than the FEC rate. .

Myanmar: Favored Sectors In response to the foreign exchange shortage, the Government of Myanmar has launched several attempts to promote growth in those sectors believed to have the largest potential for generating foreign exchange earnings. Generous fiscal incentives have been used to encourage private investment, in particular foreign direct investment, in these sectors. While the results of the current agricultuml promotion are still to be seen, past government efforts to promote particular favored sectors have not always achieved success. Tourism Tourism was one of Myanmar’s fastest-growing sectors in the first half of the 1990s. The total number of foreign tourists rose steadily from less than 8,000 in 1991/92 to 120,000 in 1995/96, with recorded receipts from travel service exports increasing from $35 million to $189 million. The tourist/construction boom has been fueled by the government’s attempt to boost investment as part of its “Visit Myanmar Year 1996” campaign, with an announced goal of attracting 500,000 foreign visits. Actual tourist arrivals, however, have been far below the official target. Growth of the tourism sector has slowed down markedly in the last two years, leading to a large surplus of hotel facilities as well as widespread and substantial price cutting. This decline reflects an international boycott of tourism to Myanmar on account of human rights concerns, and has more recently been aggravated by the Asian crisis. Energy Foreign investment in the energy sector has been strongly encoaraged in recent years with arrangements signed with several major companies (such as Total, Unocal, Texaco, Arco and PTT). while some of these investments, such as the Yadana and Yetagun natural gas projects, have been (or are soon to be) completed, many are still at the exploratory stage. The government hoped that the energy projects would alleviate the foreign exchange shortage as well as provide energy supply for domestic consumption. Recent developments, however, have fallen far short of this expectation. As a result of consumer boycotts, a number of foreign companies, including Texaco and Arco, have pulled out of Myanmar. In addition, the regional finaucial crisis has resulted iu delayed revenw from the Yadaua project. Agriculture Iu response to the stagnant growth of the key agriculture sector in the past few years, the government has recently granted special incentives to private entrepreneurs for large-scale reclamation projects of wetlands and waste land areas. Besides generous tax exemptions, official support includes provision of irrigation i&as&ucture, land clearing, technical assistance and other services. In an attempt to boost foreign exchange earnings, the government has also granted farmers cultivating 5,000 acres and above the right to export 50 percent of their production. While the environmental impact of these reclamation projects is uncertain, tbe generous fiscal incentives being offered raise doubts about whether they are economic.

Official statistics point to GDP growth of 5 percent for 1998/99, slightly less than in 1997/98 (Table 1 and Chart I).’ Growth of the key agricultural sector fell to 2% percent, reflecting a combination of bad weather, low fertilizer usage, aging equipment, and inadequate credit. The economy suffered from severe power shortages, although the effects on industrial production were mitigated by constraining household electricity consumption and augmenting generating capacity. Investment grew strongly, even though imports were limited by new restrictions. 12. Since mid-1998, the market exchange rate has stabilized and inflation has eased. The free market kyat (FEC rate) lost about half of its value against the U.S. dollar between mid-l 997 and mid-l 998,’ while the officially reported inflation rate tripled over this period to close to 70 percent. The FEC rate has since stabilized at about Kyat 345 per U.S. dollar, aided initially by the import restrictions, and, more recently, by the regional recovery. Inflation has also declined, with the 12-month rate falling to about 30 percent. However, measured inflation would likely be higher if allowance was made for parallel market prices. 13. The official exchange rate remains severely overvalued. The official rate applies to about one-third of transactions (all by the public sector) and is currently Kyat 6.3 per U.S. dollar. It generates substantial protection to import-using state enterprises (Box 3), creates incentives for rent-seeking activities, and profoundly distorts economic statistics. 14. The public sector deficit declined to an estimated 4% percent of GDP in 1998/99, compared with 5 percent of GDP in 1997/98 (and 6% percent of GDP in 1996/97) (Table 2 and Chart 2). This outcome was achieved despite a 40 percent drop in import duty collections (partly due to exemptions granted to foreign investors, but probably also due to lower compliance), and primarily reflected a sharp cut in capital expenditure. State economic enterprises (SEES) continued to incur large losses, and little progress was made with previously announced privatization plans. 15. Monetary policy has continued to be passive. The Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM), which is a department within the Ministry of Finance and Revenue, lacks autonomy and automatically finances the public sector deficit. Credit to the public sector accounted for about half of the 30 percent increase in broad money during 1998/99, although the smaller fisca1 deficit has made room for an increase in the share of bank credit going to the private sector (Table 3). However, velocity is estimated to have increased during 1998/99 for the second consecutive year, consistent with the substantially negative level of real interest rates. Dollarization also increased; over a fifth of bank deposits (valued at the market exchange rate) ’ The outcome for GDP growth in 1998199 (year beginning April) is higher than pre-mission staff estimates, but is broadly consistent with other data provided during the discussions. (See Chapter II of the staff report on Recent Economic Developments.) * Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) are defined in Box 1.

Myanmar: Protection Arising from the official Exchange Bate The current official exchange rate is K 6.3/U% whereas the market-determined FEC rate is about K 345/U!%. At present, only government and State Economic Enkqrise (SEE) transactions, or perhaps 30 percent of total trausa&ons, occur at the official rate. Although the offkAal rate does not apply to private sector transactions, it does serve to distort resource allocation. The ability of SEES to import at l/50 of the price that would be paid by tbe private sector gives rise to high degrees of effective protection. This is illustrated by calculating the effective rate of protection on domestic value added by state enterprises as a result of the trade system.’ The table reports effective rates of protection under various assumptions about tariff levels, value added, and use of imported intermediate inputs. Myaumar: Mustration of Effective Rates of Protection Arising from the Offmial Exchange Rate (In percent) Proportiun of enterprise’s fd selling price Value-added Domestic inputs Imported EiSctive rate of l-ad-a, (ad) Inputs 04 protactio~ (e) Case 1: Zero Unifom Tariff High value-added SEE 60.0 40.0 0.0 0.0 60.0 20.0 20.0 32.7 60.0 0.0 40.0 65.3 Law value-added SEE 20.0 80.0 0.0 0.0 20.0 40.0 40.0 196.0 20.0 0.0 80.0 392.0 Case 2: 10 percent Unlfonn Tariff High value-added SEE 60.0 40.0 0.0 10.0 60.0 20.0 20.0 45.9 60.0 0.0 40.0 81.9 Low value-added SEE 20.0 80.0 0.0 10.0 20.0 40.0 40.0 225.6 20.0 0.0 80.0 441.2 l’he table illustrates that the protection imparted by the offkial rate to an SEE is greater the lower its domestic value added and the higher the proportion of imported intermediate inputs it uses. There is zonsiderable protection even when tariffs are zero. In cases where value added is low aud all intermediate inputs ue imported, the effective protection enjoyed by au SEE can be forty or fifty times as high as the nominal tariff rate. ’ The effective rate of protection is defined as: e = v - v* V+ where v is recorded value added per unit of a good and v* is what value added would be under free trade (Vousden, 1990). ?or an SEE in Myanmar, this expression can be written as: e = p(l+r)(l-a,-a,D)-v* V* where v* = p(1 - m - IY,,,), p is the (tariff exclusive) price of the product, ad and a,,, are spending on domestically produced md imported intermediate inputs, respectively (expressed as a proportion of the price of the product), t is the assumed miform tariff rate (common to imports of both inputs and outputs); and D is the ratio of the official exchange rate per dollar .o the market exchange rate per dollar. Note that a unified exchange rate (D = 1) would imply e = t in this example, or that he effective rate equals the statutory tariff rate. deference: Vousden, N., “The Economics of Trade Protection,” Cambridge University Press, 1990.

Interest rates, which are all controlled, were cut across the board in April 1999 to stimulate economic activity, with the Central Bank rate falling from 15 percent to 12 percent. 16. The external current account deficit declined slightly in 1998/99 to about $600 million (4 percent of GDP)” (Table 4 and Chart 3). Export growth was robust, reflecting success in tapping markets, such as India and China, that were less affected by the crisis. Import growth is estimated to have slowed considerably as a result of the tightening of import and exchange controls. Despite slowing growth in arrivals, higher receipts from tourism helped to improve the services balance. The increase in workers remittances was unexpected given the downturn in the host countries. 17. Capital inflows mainly took the form of FDI and new commercial borrowing. Most amortization falling due was covered by bilateral grants from Japan (debt forgiveness) or led to new arrears (Table 5). FDI inflows fell to $290 million in 1998/99, a return to trend after the completion of large energy and tourism projects begun in 1996-97. Other capital inflows of $3 50 million, mostly suppliers’ credits from within Asia, allowed gross reserves to increase slightly to the equivalent of almost two months of import cover. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 18. The staff argued that the comparatively favorable economic outcome in 1998/99 had been achieved at a cost. The more stable exchange rate and the decline in inflation observed since mid-1998 had required a further tightening of controls. Moreover, the economic situation was likely to remain difficult. The boost to growth from earlier liberalization efforts had dissipated and, in any case, some of that effort had now been reversed. Looking forward, foreign exchange was likely to remain scarce. With imports constrained, the prospects were for growth to continue to trend down. 19. The staff emphasized that the need for economic reforms, as stressed during previous Article IV Consultations, had become no less urgent. Ideally, comprehensive reforms would be pursued in tandem with the provision of concessional external financing; nonetheless, various measures could be taken to boost growth now. These included unification of the exchange rate system; improving tax collections so as to restore expenditure levels; and tightening monetary conditions so as to reduce inflation; as well as structural reforms aimed at enhancing the scope for private sector activity. 20. However, the authorities were not inclined to alter the current policy course, arguing that the lack of foreign financing was the overarching constraint. In their view, it would be risky to undertake reforms such as exchange rate unification without larger reserves. 3 Using the staffs estimate of U.S. dollar GDP. See Table 1.

A. Macroeconomic Policies Exchange rate policy 21. The staff recommended that the offtcial rate be unified with the market exchange rate. Such a move, supported by tight macroeconomic policies, would establish credibility for the authorities’ reform efforts. Thereafter, a flexible exchange rate policy should be pursued. The authorities also favored exchange rate unification, but they were concerned about the political and social implications of the increases in basic commodity prices that would follow.4 They also considered a foreign exchange stabilization fund as essential for unification if confidence was to be maintained. 22. In response to the authorities’ views, the staff suggested that the exchange rate could be unified gradually. One strategy would be to phase out the official rate by progressively narrowing the class of transactions to which it applied. This adjustment could proceed by selectively removing state enterprises from the official foreign exchange budget as part of a program of enterprise reform. To maintain social support, the sequencing should be tailored to minimize the impact on sensitive prices. To minimize the effect on the market exchange rate, import-using and export-earning state enterprises should be removed from the official foreign exchange budget so as to increase demand and supply to the market about equally. A gradual approach along these lines would permit a test of whether a stabilization fund was necessary. The authorities indicated that they would consider this proposal. Fiscal policy 23. The 1998/99 fiscal outturn appears to have continued the recent trend of lower deficits. While welcoming this outcome, the staff noted that it had required reducing capital expenditure by 1% percentage points of GDP. The authorities pointed out that the decline in capital expenditure in 1998/99 partly reflected the completion of a number of large projects in 1997/98. Nevertheless, the staff questioned whether the level of capital spending was adequate given Myanmar’s substantial infrastructure needs. 24. The staff urged the authorities to strengthen the tax effort. Social expenditures had become compressed and the level of public sector wages was exceptionally Iow. The need to contain the deficit and to increase spending made it essential to mount a vigorous effort to 4 The staff estimate that a one-off devaluation would cause a jump in the CPI of 15-20 percent with the impact limited by the small proportion of transactions that occur at the official exchange rate. The devaluation would also increase the public sector deficit by about 2 percentage points of GDP, with the higher cost of public sector imports substantially offset by the gains that would accrue to exporting SEES.

The recent move to expand the coverage of the commercial tax was welcome,5 but the continued granting of exemptions appeared to be eroding the tax base. Tax compliance also appeared to be poor, probably reflecting the low wages paid to tax inspectors. The authorities did not disagree with the stafI’s diagnosis and requested technical assistance in these areas. 25. The staff also questioned whether the budget process was optimal. The budget typically excludes one-half of the eventual capital expenditure, and provides only a partial picture of the authorities’ fiscal intentions6 For example, the authorities’ 1999/2000 budget estimates implied a sharply lower public sector deficit as a result of a cut in capital expenditure apparently even more severe than that which occurred in 1998/99 (Table 2). However, the staffs estimate, based on the historical average for the Supplementary Budget provision, indicated that the deficit and capital expenditure would only decline modestly in 1999/2000. Monetary policy 26. The continuing decline in the fiscal deficit set the stage for further reductions in inflation. Consistent with the lower public sector deficit, there were signs that the growth rates of monetary aggregates would moderate in 1999. The staff did not expect the recent cut in interest rates to affect this trend, since private banks appeared reluctant to increase lending even at the previous level of interest rates which were already highly negative in real terms. Price stability in the region should also assist the authorities in bringing down inflation. 27. The staff emphasized that controls on interest rates were constraining growth. With the public sector borrowing requirement shrinking, credit to the private sector could grow even faster were it not for the rising velocity of money. Declining financial intermediation reflected banks’ unwillingness to expand lending at controlled rates, even as some borrowers were taking expensive informal sector credit. The staff argued that positive real deposit and lending rates would foster increased banking activity. 28. The authorities’ position was that lower lending rates would stimulate investment, particularly in agriculture. They were of the view that the recent cut in rates would not cause any withdrawal of deposits and that real interest rates were higher than suggested by the staff. The current CPI only captured prices in Yangon, whereas inflation was lower elsewhere. The authorities were also concerned that bank lending to more risky - 5 The commercial tax is a turnover tax with provisions for input tax offsets so as to prevent cascading. Five additional services were made subject to commercial tax on April 1, 1999. 6 Chapter III of the staff report on Recent Economic Developments discusses the budget process. In addition, certain expenditures, particularly those related to the military, are understood to occur off-budget, but information about such expenditures was not made available.

In any event, such borrowers were unlikely to have the collateral necessary to secure bank loans. B. Structural Policies 29. The staff pressed for structural reforms that would promote private sector development. The private sector had grown substantially over the past decade, with its export share rising from 45 percent in 1990/91 to 73 percent in 1998/99, but remained subject to extensive controls. The staff argued that growth of the private sector was being impeded by these restrictions, as well as by various fiscal advantages enjoyed by SEES (such as the effective protection resulting from use of the official exchange rate). Key areas for reform were the agricultural, state enterprise and financial sectors, as well as the trade and exchange systems. Agriculture 30. The staff supported further liberalization of agriculture. Foreign exchange earnings and farm incomes would be boosted by allowing all private farmers to export rice and other crops. The staff agreed with the World Bank’s position that since export liberalization would lead to higher domestic consumer prices, particularly of high (export) quality grades, export liberalization should proceed gradually. The recent decision to allow large agricultural projects some latitude to export was a step. forward; however, the generous fiscal incentives being offered raised doubts about whether these projects were economic. The projects were being developed on reclaimed wastelands, which also raised concern about their environmental impact. Replacement of the present procurement system, whereby farmers are required to sell a quota of their crop to the government at below market prices, with an explicit land tax, was another priority for structural reform.’ State Enterprises 31. The staff considered reform of the state enterprise sector to be overdue. Since the use of the official exchange rate served to obscure the true financial position of SEES, reform would first require the re-evaluation of each enterprise’s financial statements at the market exchange rate. It was clear, however, that the SEES lacked financial autonomy and commercial incentives and that the absence of separately reported results undermined _ accountability. SEES should be made subject to hard budget constraints, given greater managerial autonomy, and allowed to conduct business at market prices. The staff noted that limited commercialization was occurring anyway; faced with inadequate foreign exchange, 7 According to staff estimates, the present procurement system is equivalent to a tax yielding revenue of as much as 3 percent of GDP. However, even after taking account of the land tax implicit in the procurement system, tax revenue in Myanmar would only amount to 5- 6 percent of GDP, about one-third of the average for SAF/ESAF countries.

The authorities replied that the limited progress made to date with privatization reflected a lack of capital among domestic investors and a lack of interest on the part of foreign investors. Financial sector 32. The staff underscored the importance of providing a level playing field for all banks. While the private banking sector had recorded impressive growth over the past decade, state-owned banks continued to enjoy important advantages. These now included a monopoly on foreign exchange business. It also appeared that the (unremunerated) reserve requirements, as well as capital adequacy ratios, were not being strictly enforced for state-owned banks. The authorities’ position was that the state-owned banks undertook important social functions and that the state stood behind them in meeting their liabilities8 33. Financial sector development was key to the economy’s future growth. The efficiency of the financial sector would be enhanced by restructuring state-owned banks; by increasing competition through the licensing of joint ventures and foreign-owned banks; and by modernizing the accounting and clearing systems. More fundamentally, ceilings on interest rates needed to be eliminated. However, the authorities were reluctant to consider interest rate liberalization because of its effect on business costs. Trade and exchange system . 34. The staff observed that exchange rate unification would be equivalent to significant trade reform. Whiie Myanmar has a low average tariff rate (about 6 percent), the ability of SEES to import at the grossly-overvalued official rate is equivalent to a nontariff barrier giving rise to very high effective rates of protection. Reform of the tariff system was therefore of lower priority than the need to unify the exchange rate.g In addition, there was a need to eliminate import licensing and import priority lists and to phase out export restrictions. 35. Myanmar maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. Exchange restrictions arise from the prior approval requirement to implement limits on purchases of foreign exchange by residents for foreign travel and on the remittable portion of wages of nonresidents, as well as from the monthly limits on conversion of FECs for payments and transfers relating to invisible and . * Banks are required to maintain a risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent, but full information is not available about the extent of compliance. Nonperforming loans were reported to be about 6 percent of total bank loans at end-1998 (including state banks). ’ Tariff reform is discussed in Chapter VI of the staff report on Recent Economic Developments. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- other current international transactions. A multiple currency practice arises from the divergence between the exchange rate used for official transactions and the FEC rate. Poverty and social safety net 36. Poverty and child malnutrition are endemic, partly reflecting low levels of government spending on health and social welfare. On the basis of the 1997 household expenditure survey, the Bank staff estimated that 23 percent of households in Myanmar, or 13 million people, were below subsistence levels (Box 4). More recent data are not available, but the high rate of infl ation and relatively low agricultural growth have likely worsened the problem in the period since. There is also evidence showing that 30 percent of children under the age of three exhibit signs of at least moderate malnourishment, while 10 percent are severely malnourished. The Bank is increasing its surveillance of poverty and social policies. Statistical and Y2K issues 37. Serious problems with Myanmar’s statistics greatly inhibit policy formulation and Fund surveillance. Problems arise from the recording of external transactions at the official exchange rate; incomplete coverage; defmitions that do not conform to international standards; inconsistencies in intersectoral accounts; and long reporting lags. The staff noted that there had been considerable improvement in the quality of monetary statistics following the technical assistance provided in 1998, and looked forward to similar improvement in balance of payments statistics following the assistance provided this year. The authorities requested technical assistance in the compilation of the CPI. 38. The staff judged awareness of Y2K problems to be low in Myanmar. However, computers appear to be little used, particularly in the public sector, and Myanmar’s vulnerability in this area is probably relatively low. IV. MEDIUM-TERM PROEGPECTS 39. The staff’s baseline medium-term scenario assumes a continuation of present policies and the foreign exchange constraint. Under these conditions, growth would trend downward from current levels of 5-6 percent to 4 percent by 2004/05 (Table 6). Agricultural sector growth would rebound in 1999/2000 and 2000/01, reflecting improved weather and the shifting of resources to agriculture under the new policy initiative, but would slip thereafter, due to the shortage of foreign exchange and limits on private sector activity. Industrial _ production and services growth would decline for similar reasons. Domestic investment would be kept at low levels by the lack of confidence in Myanmar’s growth prospects and the constraints on financial intermediation. 40. In these circumstances, the current account deficit would remain high and arrears would accumulate further. Import growth would decline due to the foreign exchange constraint, while export growth would be gradually slowed by low investment. FDI would be reduced sharply in 1999/2000-2000/01 by the lagged effects of the drop in new commitments that occurred during the Asian crisis, but would pick up somewhat thereafier. The shortfall in FDI would induce higher arrears in the short term, after which the incurrence Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - Box 4. Myanmar: Poverty and Human Development* About 23 percent of households in Myanmar have expenditures below a nationally-defined poverty line, according to the results from a 1997 household survey (World Bank, forthcoming). The incidence of poverty exhibits significant inter-regional variation, from about 35 percent in Kayah and Chin States, and Magway Division, down to lo-12 percent in Shan and Kachine States. Within regions, there are also substantial rural urban differences. In Chin State, for example, the poverty rate in urban areas is 19 percent, whereas the rural rate is reported to be 47 percent. Inter-regional differences in poverty rates may be partly explained by the lack of key basic services in some border areas due to past and on-going conflicts. Recent UNDP surveys provide evidence concerning the best indicators of poverty. Ju rural areas, poverty is correlated with thatch-type roofing; landlessness; and the absence of livestock ownership (ShafTer, 1999). The best urban indicators are low household access to basic water, sanitation and electric services, and the lack of assets such as radios, bicycles and motor bikes. The incidence of poverty among female-households in rural areas is above average. Widespread poverty in Myanmar extends beyond low material living standards, and is reflected in the high incidence of child malnutrition, poor health outcomes, and low educational attainment. While average per capita caloric availability in Myanmar exceeds estimated food reqnirements (IFAD, 1995), UNICEF-sponsored surveys have found that the rate of severe mahmtrition among children under 3 years of age in 1997 was 13 percent, while moderate malnutrition was 35 percent. Rates of infant mortality and under-5 child mortality are currently 79 and 13 1 per 1,000 live births, respectively, significantly above the Southeast Asian averages (60 and 86). Not only are the levels of key human development indicators low relative to most of Myanmar’s neighbor’s (Annex VI), but improvements in human development outcomes over the past decade have been negligible compared to the gains witnessed elsewhere. Public health expenditures are extremely low, around 0.2 percent of GDP in 1998/99. As a result, in rural Myanmar, fewer than 5 percent of rural births are attended by doctors, compared to 3 9 percent of births in urban areas. The lack of adequate health facilities, the shortage of trained medical staff, and pervasive poverty have also led to low health service utilization rates, especially in rural areas. Survey results suggest that transportation costs to health facilities, as well as direct costs of medical treatment, prevent many from seeking help from trained medical staff and encourage reliance upon traditional health care providers. Low school enrollment and retention rates can be linked to the poor quality of educational services, and lack of affordability. Poor families are often unable to finance expend&ores on textbooks, school uniforms and enrolhnent fees, thereby reducing the probability that schooling could be a route out of poverty. The rural-urban disparity in educational attainment is signif!icant; while 37 percent of children eventually reach 4@’ grade in urban areas, only 22 percent do so in rural areas. On the other hand, gender-based differences in primary school attainment are minimal. Access to basic water and sanitation infrastructure is comparable to other Southeast Asian economies. Recent estimates suggest that 66 percent of the population have access to safe water, with access of 88 percent in urban areas and 65 percent do in rural areas (MRX, 1997). Coverage of sanitation services is approximately 45 percent nationally, with 65 percent coverage in urban areas and 39 percent coverage in nnal areas. Improvements in Myanmar’s human development outcomes will require cross-sectoral strategies that increase the access of the poor to basic health and water infrastrncture, and to primary education. Increases in the availability and quality of basic social services are needed alongside improvements in macroeconomic performance in order to raise the living standards of the poor in Myamnar. ‘Prepared by World Bank staff.

Notwithstanding the slowdown in import growth, gross reserve coverage would remain at around 2 months. 41. With comprehensive reforms and the regaining of international support, the medium-term outlook would be considerably brighter. Table 7 illustrates an alternative, reform scenario under the assumption that comprehensive reforms are initiated during 2000/O 1 with exchange rate unification completed by the beginning of 200 l/02. Such a reform scenario would be associated with much higher domestic and foreign investment, leading to significantly more rapid growth in exports and GDP.” However, imports would also grow strongly and the current account deficit would continue to be large. In light of the need to increase reserve cover and eliminate debt arrears, external viability would likely require extensive concessional support from the international financial community, including debt restructuring. Indeed, Myanmar could eventually be considered for assistance under the I-WC Initiative. i’ V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 42. Myanmar’s economy is mired in a low-level trap. Growth has held steady at 5-6 percent per annum during the Asian crisis-a respectable outcome-but, given the low base for economic activity, considerably below potential. Poverty is widespread. Under present policies, economic conditions are unlikely to improve, and there is a risk that they could worsen sharply. 43. There is substantial scope and need for economic reforms that would improve growth performance. The authorities believe that comprehensive reforms can only be pursued in conjunction with external financial assistance. By contrast, the staffs view is that reforms are needed across a broad range of areas and their initiation should not wait for large- scale concessional external financing. Of course, Myanmar should also be making every effort to regain the support of the international community. 44. The official exchange rate remains severely overvalued. The staffs position is that a one-off devaluation would jump-start the reform process, remove excessive protection of state enterprises, and eliminate an important avenue for rent-seeking. However, the authorities are concerned about the associated risk of social disruption. An alternative strategy would be to narrow progressively the class of transactions to which the official rate applies. This could be done as part of SEE reform by making selected enterprises transact at the market exchange lo Much of the increase in the investment/GDP ratio in Table 7 compared to Table 6 reflects revaluation of imported capital goods in the national income accounts at a transactions- weighted average of the official and FEC exchange rate. Foreign saving is higher in Table 7 for the same reason. *I The data available are not adequate to conduct a debt sustainability analysis (DSA).

Once the exchange system is unified, a flexible exchange rate policy should be pursued. 45. There is an opportunity to further reduce inflation. A combination of factors-the lower fiscal deficit (and hence lower reserve money growth), and the absence of inflation in the region, in particular- should permit a further reduction in inflation in the period ahead. Looking forward, monetary policy will need to play a more active role if macroeconomic stability is to be attained. Greater autonomy should also be granted to the Central Bank, and limits should be placed on its ability to fund public sector deficits. 46. The recent cut in interest rates was ill-advised. With real interest rates already negative, the staff do not share the authorities’ belief that this action will increase lending. Instead, it may lead to tirther financial disintermediation, as well as additional dollarization. These trends can only be reversed by lowering inflation, liberalizing interest rates, and allowing private banks to compete on equal terms with state banks. 47. The lower fiscal deficit represents mixed progress since public spending has become severely compressed. Myanmar’s substantial, untilfilled infiastructural needs call for higher capital spending. The poor quality of public services argues for increases in budget allocations for health and education. More generally, the difficulty of retaining skilled personnel implies a need to address the problem of low public sector wages. 48. A major effort is needed to reduce poverty and malnutrition. The severity of these problems highlights the need to increase sharply budget allocations for health-related and welfare expenditures, as well as to implement measures to boost growth. 49. The tax effort must be strengthened significantly. Raising government spending while containing the deficit will require a wider tax base. The authorities should build on the recent expansion of the commercial tax base by undertaking a comprehensive review of tax exemptions so as to assess the scope for their reduction. Perhaps more important than tax reform is the need to radically improve tax compliance. 50. State enterprise restructuring should be initiated. Choosing candidates for SEE reform will require careful assessment of the financial health of individual enterprises, which in turn will require financial analysis based on the market exchange rate. SEES need to be . granted greater autonomy to set prices and to be cut off from automatic access to Central Bank financing. Privatization plans should be pursued more aggressively. 51. Tightening trade and exchange restrictions has long-term costs. The measures taken during 1998 may have helped to stabilize the kyat and have led to some rebuilding of reserves, but they will likely have negative consequences over the longer term, including discouraging private sector expansion and creating uncertainties with respect to the future direction of policies. More generally, reforms of the SEE sector and the trade and exchange systems are closely interrelated; both should go forward at a solid pace, but with care taken to ensure the correct sequencing.

The authorities are now favoring agriculture, even though their past record of picking winners is poor. The authorities should be mindful that one of the causes of the Asian crisis was overinvestment resulting from government interference with market signals. Overly generous incentives can lead to projects that are noneconomic. In the case of reclamation projects, they may also do environmental damage. 53. Myanmar’s economic and financial database remains very weak, hampering the assessment of economic and financial developments. Surveillance is also made difficult by the sketchy provision of data between consultations. 54. Myanmar would benefit greatly from increased transparency. The private sector lacks the data to assess economic developments and tends to take a more negative view than is warranted. The authorities are urged to begin publishing a minimum set of data on variables such as official reserves, foreign debt and nonperforming loans. Countries in Asia that have improved data dissemination practices are now reaping the benefits of greater transparency, and Myanmar should avoid being left behind. 55. Since the last consultation, the authorities have tightened import restrictions for balance of payments purposes. At present, Myanmar maintains restrictions and multiple currency practices that are subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. In view of the absence of a clear timetable for their elimination, the staff does not recommend approval of these restrictions. 56. It is recommended that the next consultation with Myanmar be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Table 1.

All foreign exchange accounts were transferred to either the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank or the Myanmar Investment and Commercial Bank. Invisible transactions and current transfers The limit on remittances against FECs for payments on invisible transactions and current transfers was reduced from $50,000 to $30,000 a month (1998/99). Import and export systems Imports of all goods not on two lists (A and B) of priority goods were banned (March 1998). Private importers are required to import 80 percent of their imports from List A (essential goods) and 20 percent from List B (less essential goods). The number of goods on list B was widened in the first half of 1999. The approval of imports under both Lists A and B also became concurrent (whereas licenses had previously been issued first for List A goods, and only thereaRer for List B goods). Private sector exporting through overseas trade of 30 key goods (including rice, rubber, and gems) was prohibited (March 1998). For border trade, there is an additional restriction on the private sector export of teak. Private entrepreneurs who carry out reclamation of wetlands were allowed to export 50 percent of their produce (rice and other restricted products except edible oil seeds). The limit is 55 percent for rubber plantations. Exporters were required to pay in foreign exchange an 8 percent commercial tax (January 1999) in addition to a 2 percent income tax (levied since December 1997). These taxes replaced a 5 percent commercial tax. The practice of automatic issuance of open general import licenses to selected SEES, and joint-ventures that needed to import frequently under the Foreign Investment Law, was * replaced by approval by the Ministry of Commerce on a case-by-case basis (1998/99).

Myanmar compiles and disseminates a range of economic and social statistics. The Central Bank of Myanmar reports a number of core statistics to the Fund on a monthly basis (attached table) and provides more comprehensive data for the Article IV consultation missions. ’ However, although there have been recent improvements in the quality of statistics, particularly in the monetary area, data shortcomings continue to hinder the monitoring of economic developments and the assessment of policy proposals. National accounts 2. National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and revisions are typically not issued before a new year starts. Private sector transactions are underestimated and exports and imports of non-factor services and all informal sector activities are excluded. The use of the highly overvalued official exchange rate for conversion purposes results in understatement of external trade and the foreign exchange content of consumption, government expenditures, and investment. In addition, the GDP in constant prices base year is 1985/86, which is increasingly outdated in view of the extent of structural changes in the Myanmar economy. Substantive changes in relative prices since price liberalization complicate the interpretation of GDP deflators. Price indices 3. The CPI is based primarily on the results of the expenditure survey conducted in Yangon in 1986 and thus does not capture rural price developments. Data are available with a delay of 3-4 months. The CPI likely underestimates inflation because of its limited coverage (gasoline, for example, is excluded), failure to fully take into account black market prices, and inclusion of only a few imported goods that account for less than 10 percent of the total weights. Weights for non-essential commodities were last compiled in 1978. The authorities are planning to change the CPI base year fi-om 1986 to 1997 using new weights derived from the 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The new CPI would comprise 130 consumption items compared to the current 79 items. Government finance 4. There is no comprehensive monthly and quarterly compilation of fiscal data. . Although a flash report is produced by the Central Bank of Myanmar on a monthly basis, and ’ The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) publishes the Statistical Yearbook, which includes a large number of economic, social, and demographic time series, and the bi-monthly SelectedMonthly Economic Indicators, which include monthly data on consumer prices, selected producer prices and output volumes, key monetary and fiscal revenue data, exchange rates, and external trade values. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- ANNEX11 the Budget Department prepares every four months a summary report based on provisional information on cash expenditures collected from the ministries, the coverage of these reports is incomplete. Annual comprehensive data are compiled with delays of up to twelve months after the end of the reference year, and expenditures are aggregated following a functional classification rather than an economic classification; expenditures by economic classification are produced with a longer delay. In addition, only consolidated data for SEES are available, and some transactions are recorded partly on an accrual basis and partly on a cash basis. Fiscal and monetary data are not always consistent. Budget estimates and actuals tend to differ by wide margins in part because the approved budget allows for little if any inflation. 5. Annual data on the operations of the consolidated central government are reported to the Fund’s Statistics Department for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The reported data, however, do not include an economic classification of expenditure. Monetary accounts 6. The CBM compiles and reports to APD a monetary survey with a lag of 3-4 months. The lag reflects the lack of technological infrastructure and the delay in compiling government accounts at the Myanma Economic Bank which manages them rather than the Ministry of Finance and Revenue. 7. The monetary survey compiled by the CBM covers the central bank and all commercial banks, state-owned and private. However, due to incomplete coverage, net foreign assets approximates net international reserves, rather than net claims on nonresidents. In addition, claims on the government include the CBM’s holding of three-month treasury bills, whereas holdings of 3- and 5-year treasury bonds by commercial banks are not included. Also, narrow money includes currency issued instead of currency outside the banks. 8. The quality of monetary data reported and published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) has improved recently reflecting assistance provided by STA in the context of the 1998 and 1999 Article IV consultation missions, Improvements in the compilation of monetary accounts led to the resumption of publication of monetary statistics for Myanmar in the August 1998 issue of IFS. Starting with the July 1999 issue of IFS, the coverage of the banking system was expanded to include private commercial banks estabiished since mid- e 1992, in addition to the four state-owned banks. Since December 1998, the CBM has also begun compiling monetary accounts based on internationally-accepted methodology (in addition to the monetary survey in its own format). 9. The quality of monetary statistics could be improved further by: (i) the use of the market exchange rate rather then the overvalued official exchange rate for valuing foreign currency-denominated balance sheet accounts; (ii) reporting on a gross basis all interbank claims and claims on the public sector; (iii) the booking of all debit balances (overdrafts) as claims, and the booking of all credit balances as liabilities; and (iv) a review of the interbank Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - ANNEXII accounts, including the financial adjustment accounts, and of the recording of the Fund accounts in the CBM’s balance sheet to ensure consistency with standard procedures. Balance of payments 10. Balance of payments data have various shortcomings arising from the poor quality of data sources and gaps in coverage of the external transactions of the private sector. The use of the overvalued official exchange rate to convert private sector transactions leads to distortions because these transactions actually take place at or near the market rate. The official trade data exclude all military imports, and no adjustment is made for military imports in the balance of payments. Detailed data on services and financial flows are not available. Numerous transactions are misclassified both within the current account and between the current account and the financial account. The financial account covers only direct investment equity flows and general government transactions and is compiled with long delays. There are large discrepancies in the external debt data reported by creditors and debtors. Transactions on arrears are not reported separately. II. Overall export and import volume and price indices are not fblly reported. The export volume and unit value indices computed by the Fund and published in IFS are increasingly unsatisfactory due to the limited types of products taken into account, outdated weights, and highly volatile base series. Furthermore, data on exports and imports by partner country are reported for fiscal years instead of calendar years. 12. These shortcomings reflect the absence of assignment to one institution of the responsibility for compiling balance of payments data. Moreover, an adequate legal framework and interagency cooperation in the development of data sources, methodologies, and the exchange of data are lacking. 13. The quality of balance of payments data could be improved by: enhancements to the institutional framework; the introduction of a quarterly enterprise survey to capture the international service and financial transactions of the private sector from a sample of the largest enterprises; an overhauling of the foreign exchange record for the collection of data on services; the proper classification of arrears; and a shortening of the lag time for data reporting.

Article IV Consultation: The Executive Board discussed the staffreport for the 1998 Article IV consultation on June 5, 1998. It was proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle. IX. Technical Assistance: A substantial program of technical assistance financed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) was initiated in 1989/90 in the expectation of comprehensive policy reforms. The program foresaw extensive technical assistance supported by training in the areas of bank accounting and supervision; monetary, fiscal, and price statistics; tax and customs administration; public finance; and government financial management. As the anticipated policy reforms did not material&e, the UNDP decided to scale back assistance to Myanmar. As a result, the project on government fmancial management was canceled in September 1992 and the funding for the remaining projects was reduced. Following the tripartite review of the technical assistance program conducted during the 1993 Article IV consultation discussions, the authorities were informed that it would be difficult to justify an extension of the program and that the ongoing projects would come to an end by the scheduled closing date of December 3 1, 1993. By that time, 53 person- months of technical assistance and 172 weeks of training had been delivered. Since then technical assistance has continued only in the form of training on a reduced scale. The 1998 Article IV consultation mission included a STA economist, who provided technical assistance in the area of monetary statistics. X.

Myanmarbecame a member of the World Bank in 1952, lFC in 1956, and IDA in 1962. During 1956-61, the Bank made three loans totaling $33.3 million (of which $0.2 million was canceled), all for transportation projects. No lending was requested during 1962-72. Lending was resumed again in 1973 and 30 IDA credits totaling the equivalent of $804 million were committed of which $752.8 million equivalent was disbursed and $92.7 million was canceled. About 26 percent of total IDAABRD disbursements were in support of agricultnral projects, including irrigation, rubber, livestock, seed development, and grain storage. About 24 percent was for energy sector projects, 16 percent for forestry projects, 17 percent for transportation projects, and the remaining 16 percent for projects in the miuiug, manufacturing, constrnction, and telecommunications sectors. 2. There has been no new lending approved since July 1987. The last project closed on December 3 1,1993. IX! had made no investments in Myamnar. Since September 1998, Myanmar is on a nonaccrual status with the Bank and the amount overdue totaled about $25 million as of end-June 1999. 3. Up to the late 198Os, the World Bank provided advice on the formulation and implementation of development policies. Policy recommendations emphasized the need for: fundamental and sustained macroeconomic policy reform, including measnres to adjust the exchange rate, price liberalization, especially in agriculture, export promotion and private sector development, and steps to improve the efficiency of state enterprises. During the 199Os, the Bank prepared only two economic reports (in 199 1 and 1995).

In June 1999, the Bank conducted a technical mission to update its knowledge base about the country at the same time as the Fund’s mission for the Article IV Consultation. A report is being prepared, focusing on poverty and human development, agriculture, private sector development and so&l services. It will be discussed with the authorities during the Ammal Meetings in Washington in September 1999. The previous economic report, Myanmar: PoZicksfor Sustuining Economic ReJorm, was prepared in November 1994, and was discussed with the Government in August 1995. The final report was issued in October 1995. 5. Myanmar Aid Group: The last Consultative Group meeting was held on January 14, 1986 in Tokyo, under the chairmanship of the World Bank. The aid pledges totaled about $1.0 billion for the subsequent two years. There has been no meeting since then. ‘Prepared by World Bank staff.

Myanmar joined the Bank in 1973 and operations started the same year. The Bank has so far provided 32 loans totaling $530.9 million for 28 projects. Of these, two loans amounting to $6.6 million were from the Bank’s ordinary capital resources, and 30 loans amounting to $524.3 million were from its Special Fund’s resources. All of the loans to Myanmar have been closed. The Bank has so far provided technical assistance (TA) totaling $10.7 million for 38 projects. Of these 3 8 technical assistance projects, 28 were project preparatory and 10 were advisory. 2. The processing of new Bank loan and TA projects in Myanmar has been held in abeyance since 1988. However, the Bank sends periodic consultation missions to Myanmar. Furthermore, Myanmar is involved in the Program of Economic Cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS Program). In that capacity, Myanmar participates in regional meetings and workshops supported by the Bank’s regional technical assistance. Close coordination is being maintained with the IMF, the World Bank, and the UNDP with particular emphasis being given to assessment of the Government’s economic reform program and recommended policy actions. Liaison is being maintained with Myanmar’s major bilateral donors regarding the status of their assistance program. Myanmar has not paid its loan service payments due to the Bank since January 15, 1998. As of July 19, 1999, total overdue loan service payments were equivalent to $28.7 million. 3. The sectoral distribution of cumulative Bank lending to Myanmar remains unchanged as shown below: Sector Loans Loans (Number) ($ million) Percent Agriculture & Agro-Industry 15 316.1 59.5 Health 2 63.1 11.9 Transport & Communications 2 42.5 8.0 Industry & Development Banks 4 41.4 7.8 Water Supply 4 36.0 6.8 Energy 5 31.8 6.0 Total 32 530.9 100.0 4. The majority of Bank assistance has been provided for the development of the agricultural sector. Bank assistance in sectors other than agriculture has stemmed from an attempt to achieve sectoral balance in lending and to avoid overextending the absorptive capacity of the country’s agricultural executing agencies. To some extent, diversification has also resulted from the - Government’s own desire to proceed with particular projects in various sectors which had already cleared the Government approval process, and for which, therefore, priority has been established. ‘Prepared by staff of the Asian Development Bank.
