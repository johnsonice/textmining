The team comprised Nita Thacker (head), Masaaki Iizuka and Christopher Crowe (all APD). Ms. Stone (Office of Executive Director) attended the meetings.  • Mission Meetings: The mission met with President Tong, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning Mwenweniwarama, heads of public enterprises, other senior officials, private sector representatives, and donors.  • Outreach: The authorities agreed for the first time to the mission issuing a Press Release at the end of the visit. • Context of Past Surveillance: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on May 4, 2005. Directors emphasized the need for reducing deficits and limiting drawings from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), including through reductions in the wage bill and subsidies. They also underscored the importance of structural reforms to create a conducive business environment. The authorities have reduced the deficit by limiting development spending to donor-financed grants, in line with staff recommendations, although it still remains large. However, progress on structural reforms remains slow. • Exchange rate: Kiribati has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.  • Statistical Issues: Kiribati began participating in the GDDS in 2002. Data are generally available with long lags and quality remains weak.

Inflation has remained flat as a decline in food and clothing prices offset the increase in domestic fuel prices.  • Fiscal deficits have remained large, averaging 25 percent of GDP in 2005–06, though substantially reduced from the 2004 peak. Deficits have been financed largely by drawdowns from the RERF, offsetting strong investment performance. • The current account deficit increased in 2005 and 2006 as a result of higher imports, driven partly by an increase in oil prices, stagnant income flows from fishing license fees and remittances, and declining exports of copra and seaweed. Policy Discussions • Discussions on the budget focused on the need to strengthen tax administration and cut spending, including limiting subsidies to public enterprises.  • With no policy adjustment, deficits will continue to be about 20–30 percent of GDP, undermining the government’s objective of maintaining the real per capita value of the RERF at the 1996 level (the informal benchmark). Staff simulations suggest that in this scenario the RERF would be halved by 2025 and depleted by 2036. Fiscal and structural reforms could help to limit deficits to about 8–9 percent of GDP and sustain the value of the RERF. • To create a conducive environment for the private sector, structural reforms aimed at streamlining the role of public enterprises and creating a business friendly environment for investors remain critical.

It consists of 33 atolls, some of which are only about 2 meters above sea level making it one of the most vulnerable countries to climate changes (Box 1). Nearly half of the population of about 100,000 lives in South Tarawa (the capital) while the rest are spread out over the “outer” islands within Kiribati’s 3.5 million square kilometers of exclusive economic zone in the Pacific Ocean. Huge disparities exist between the economic conditions in South Tarawa and Kiribati’s outer islands. The need for cash jobs, education, and better social services has caused an urban drift leading to overcrowding on South Tarawa.  BOX 1. KIRIBATI: VULNERABLE TO GLOBAL WARMING AND RISING SEA LEVELS With an average height above sea level of about two-three meters and most islands only a few hundred meters wide, Kiribati is one of the countries most vulnerable to rising sea levels induced by climate change. Climate change has also exposed the islands to periodic storm surges and droughts. The small land area effectively reduces adaptation options (e.g., retreat; in some cases entire islands could be eliminated, so abandonment would be the only option). Coral bleaching has already affected the reef fish population on some islands and inundation, flooding, and coastal salinization threaten production of copra and seaweed, Kiribati’s only two cash crops. Kiritimati Island, due to its size and topography, is estimated to be less vulnerable. A 2000 World Bank study estimates that by 2050 large parts of North and South Tarawa could be inundated. In the absence of adaptation, the macroeconomic impact from climate change could result in economic losses as high as 17–34 percent of 1998 GDP by 2050.  The authorities are actively engaged, both domestically and internationally, in raising awareness of the country’s vulnerability. The government has ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1995 and is also committed to regional environmental agreements, including support for proposals in the Pacific Plan. The World Bank is providing assistance through the Kiribati Adaptation Program to help reduce vulnerabilities. The current Phase II of the program will help to set up a monitoring system, particularly for the coral reefs, to reduce the vulnerability of the ecosystem. Kiribati is also included in a project funded by Australia to help Pacific island countries to better plan for extreme weather events and climate changes.    2.      Most of the population is employed in subsistence farming and fishing. Only 20 percent of the workforce is employed in the formal sector, with two-thirds working for the government. Public enterprises (PEs) are engaged in businesses from seaweed and biscuit production to hotels, media, telecommunications, and utilities, with most operating at a loss.

Income from external sources is critical. The main exports are copra and seaweed but export revenue is tiny compared to imports. The main trading partners are Australia, Fiji and Japan. Investment income from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF, Box 2), fishing license fees, remittances of Kiribati seamen on foreign ships, and grants from donors make up a large part of the country’s income, so that GNP is more than 50 percent higher than GDP.  4.      Elections are scheduled for July/August this year. The current government, headed by President Anote Tong, came to office in October 2003. The President enjoys a comfortable majority in Parliament, although this is based on a loose coalition and his party holds a minority of seats. II.   CURRENT ECONOMIC SETTING AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK 5.      Real GDP growth picked up in 2006, but the fiscal and external current account deficits remain large and the underlying economic position is weak. • Growth has improved (Table 1 and Figure 2). Real GDP increased by nearly 6 percent in 2006 following two years of contraction. A 10 percent increase in government wages and a pickup in donor-financed construction activity were the main contributing factors. With donor financing expected to decline this year, real GDP growth is projected to reach 2½ percent.  • Inflation has remained flat in the last three years as a decline in import prices of food and clothing (with a weight of about 50 percent in the consumer price index) and some currency appreciation offset the increase in domestic fuel prices. Kiribati uses the Australian dollar as its currency. However, delays in adjusting fuel prices have resulted in fiscal pressures.  • The fiscal deficit is unsustainable (Table 2 and Figure 3). At 25 percent of GDP, the deficit in 2006 exceeded the budget target by 9 percentage points of GDP. Progress in improving tax collections has been modest and expenditure control has been inadequate. The deficit was financed by drawdowns from the RERF and overdrafts at the sole commercial bank (there is no domestic debt market). For 2007, the budget deficit is targeted at 21 percent of GDP (see below). 0408012016020024020012002200320042005200604080120160200240GDPWorkers' remittancesFishing license feesInvestment incomeComponents of GNP (2001-06)(In millions of Australian dollars)Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 6  BOX 2. KIRIBATI: THE REVENUE EQUALIZATION RESERVE FUND (RERF) Kiribati’s RERF was initially established in 1956 and capitalized using royalties from the extraction of phosphate. Under a conservative reinvestment policy designed to promote asset accumulation, the fund’s assets built up steadily in the years leading to the exhaustion of phosphate deposits in 1979. In subsequent years this conservative approach continued, allowing the fund’s value to increase in value by almost 60 percent in real per capita terms between 1979 and 2006.   However, recent years have seen an increase in drawdowns from the RERF, driven by a widening fiscal deficit. Staff projections suggest that if current trends continue, the RERF will be exhausted by 2036 under the baseline (as discussed in the text).  The key issues for the authorities are:  • What underlying principles should govern the management of the RERF? • Targets or goals for policy need to respond to changed circumstances if they are to remain useful guides for policymakers. Current practice is to maintain the real per-capita value above the 1996 level. However, subsequent capital gains have substantially increased the RERF’s value since 1996, so that this target offers no short-term fiscal discipline, allowing the recent large deficits that will be hard to reverse once the target is neared. • The RERF should be fully integrated with a medium term budget framework to promote long-term fiscal planning and alert policymakers to the intertemporal dimension of current spending decisions.   • What governance reforms could help the authorities to better manage the Fund? Lessons from other countries’ experiences, including from the management of oil funds and other Pacific Trust Funds suggest that: • Formal rules governing drawdowns and targets can provide a benchmark for medium term fiscal planning and can help to build a consensus for sustainable drawdowns, but may prove less effective as binding constraints on policy. • Transparency-enhancing reforms and access to impartial advice and oversight are essential in improving governance.     01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0002000200420082012201620202024202820322036$A 1996ProjectionRERF real per capita value195619791992-961997-20012002-06RERF balance (A$ mn, eop)0.668.0371.8635.9659.6Per capita RERF balance (1996 A$, eop)179.03393.84,703.46,615.35,443.8Average drawdown (percent of GDP)9.93.916.9Average return (percent of GDP)52.677.525.0Average return (percent per year)9.512.73.9  Source: Fund staff estimates.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 7 • Strong performance of the RERF portfolio was offset by large withdrawals. Investment returns on the RERF improved in 2005–06 reflecting strong international financial markets, but the fund’s real per capita balance remains on a downward trend (Box 2). • Public enterprises’ losses increased, requiring large injections of cash, both in the form of large subsidies and government-guaranteed loans. The outstanding loans are estimated to be as high as 15–20 percent of GDP (Box 3).  • The external current account deficit remains substantial (Table 3). The current account deficit increased in 2005 and 2006, driven partly by an increase in the value of oil imports, largely due to the higher prices, stagnant income flows from fishing license fees and remittances, and declining exports of copra and seaweed. The appreciation in the REER (Figure 2) has benefited Kiribati, given its large dependence on imports and the small role played by exports. The tools available to improve competitiveness are wage policy, and productivity-enhancing investments and structural reform. The deficit is projected to widen further in 2007. 6.      Progress on structural reforms has been slow. The National Development Strategies (NDS) 2004–07 laid out an ambitious plan to improve the efficiency of public enterprises, enhance infrastructure, and create an enabling environment for the private sector.1 The private sector has become more active in wholesale and retail trade after the closure of a government wholesale trading company in 2004. While some public enterprises have submitted business plans, in accordance with the NDS, implementation, monitoring and accountability remain inadequate. Infrastructure bottlenecks, including in electricity, communications and roads, remain a major concern. III.   MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS 7.      Under current policies, growth is likely to stagnate and pressures on the RERF will continue (Table 4). Given the narrow production base—limited to copra and seaweed production—and no industrial base, growth will continue to depend largely on government activity and donor-financed grants. Staff’s baseline projections suggest that real GDP growth will stagnate at 1 percent accompanied by large fiscal deficits in the range of 20–30 percent of GDP as a rising population puts pressure on the government to deliver both jobs and services. With no other source of financing, this will require continued large withdrawals from the RERF. Assuming an average nominal return of 6 percent on the RERF (3½ percent in real terms), the real per capita value of the RERF will go below the 1996 level by 2014 and will reach half of this value in a further 13 years.2 Even assuming a 8 percent return (the average of the last 10 years) the RERF would run out by about 2050.                                                  1 See EBS/05/140. 2 The last 5-year average nominal return has been just under 4 percent.

KIRIBATI: PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM  There are over thirty Public Enterprise (PEs) in Kiribati spread across all business sectors including transportation, media, public utilities (electricity, water supply, and telecommunications). Some operate in areas where the private sector, which is presently crowded out, could clearly conduct business more efficiently.   Most enterprises operate at a loss, although a proper assessment of fiscal costs is difficult because of a lack of timely financial reporting. Budgeted subsidies from the government amount to about 4–5 percent of GDP. In addition, the government provides price support to copra producers of about 6 percent of GDP and there are implicit subsidies for transportation and distribution. Many PEs, especially utility companies, have government-guaranteed overdrafts from the commercial bank, amounting to some 20 percent of GDP.   A rigid price structure and lack of an effective governance structure are key factors in weak PE performance. Many PEs have to provide goods and services at government-fixed subsidized prices. In addition, the lack of commercial orientation and accountability aggravate their inefficiency. The recent hike in the public sector wages also led to rising costs as the wages in PEs are generally linked to those of the government officials, albeit somewhat lower.  The new private sector strategy addresses the need to streamline PEs and improve their performance. PEs are already required to submit business plans to their respective ministries and cost-cutting efforts are seen in some PEs. Closer monitoring of submitted business plans and holding PEs accountable for failure to achieve goals will be part of the new strategy.    8.      On the other hand, structural reforms, including on the budget side, could help fiscal consolidation, generate growth and create jobs. Growth would come from the expansion of private sector activity, mainly as improvements in the business climate attract investors to develop Kiribati’s vast marine resources and tourist potential. Other positive spillovers would be jobs for the increasing labor force and improvement in public finances. In particular, such reforms would help to develop Kiritimati Island as envisaged by the authorities. That said, the outlook for reforms remains uncertain given Kiribati’s special characteristics, although countries in similar circumstances in the region like Samoa, that have been persistent on structural reforms, are now starting to benefit from them.

However, there are downside risks from three sources: (i) a period of low returns and weak asset markets, (ii) larger-than-projected budget deficits, and (iii) climate changes. Although the RERF portfolio is diversified, low returns as evidenced in 2001–03 could jeopardize the value of these assets. If fiscal deficits are larger than projected, this could threaten the viability of the RERF more rapidly than under the baseline. With respect to climate change, a more rapid onset of rising sea levels could have serious macroeconomic and social implications.  IV.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS The mission and authorities agreed that the key priorities remain fiscal consolidation and stimulating private sector activity, to help reduce vulnerabilities and improve the growth outlook. With regard to the budget, measures are needed to reduce revenue volatility, contain the wage bill, reduce subsidies to PEs, and limit development spending to donor-financed grants. Policies should aim to ensure that the real per capita value of the RERF is preserved to benefit both the current and future generations. On structural reforms, a more focused and monitorable action plan is needed to ensure that intended measures are implemented. This would help to absorb the growing labor force, generate growth and government revenues and complement the fiscal adjustment.  A.   Reducing Fiscal Imbalances Fiscal Policy for 2007  10.      The 2007 budget targets only a small reduction in the deficit to 21 percent of GDP, financed from the RERF. In particular, current spending is expected to decline by ½ percent of GDP with a decline in operating expenses partially offset by larger subsidies. The total wage bill, which represents about 43 percent of GDP (the highest in the region), and subsidies (about 9 percent of GDP), are expected to remain constant. Fishing license fees and customs duties, which together make up two-thirds of total revenues, are expected to show some improvement allowing the deficit to decline by about 4 percent of GDP. There is a downside risk that these revenues may fall short of expectations making the deficit somewhat higher. Staff views and recommendations:  11.      Despite approval of the budget, the government still has scope to implement measures to improve domestic revenues while holding current spending below agreed targets. In particular, the mission proposed the following measures that aim to limit the deficit to about 16 percent of GDP.  • enforce tax collection from the largest taxpayers (Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) estimates, based on turnover, suggest this could yield up to 2 percent of GDP) and  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 10 • eliminate vacant civil service positions, cut worker overtime, and limit spending on subsidies (this could yield up to 3 percent of GDP). Authorities’ views  The authorities indicated that customs procedures had been tightened and monthly targets had been set to improve revenue collection. Wages had been frozen and vacancies were being left unfilled, both in the central government and at PEs. In addition, development spending would be strictly limited to donor-financed grants. That said, the scope for further large expenditure cuts in the near term is limited given the challenges they face, especially the need to ensure delivery of goods and services to the outer islands.3  Fiscal Policy for 2008 and beyond  12.      For 2008 and beyond, stronger efforts are needed to achieve a sustainable level for the fiscal deficit. Tax administration continues to be plagued by capacity problems and poor enforcement. Pressures on the budget will be further exacerbated by declining customs revenues, as tariffs with neighboring countries are reduced in the context of the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) and Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER). Losses at PEs need to be contained. Simulations by staff suggest that average budget deficits should be limited to about 8–9 percent of GDP to preserve the RERF.  Staff views and recommendations  • On the revenue side: The authorities plan to introduce a broad-based consumption tax, which the mission supports.4 Staff also recommended strengthening tax administration to improve compliance by large taxpayers, moving speedily on the merger of the tax and customs offices and replacing multiple tax identification numbers with a single tax payer identification number for each enterprise. Staff also suggested that the authorities should attempt to negotiate better terms on fishing contracts to reduce volatility in license fees coming from both the cyclical pattern of fish catch and exchange rate fluctuations. • On the expenditure side: Staff recommended reducing the wage bill over time to more sustainable levels and continually improving monitoring and accountability of PEs to reduce subsidies. Staff also underscored the importance of introducing the medium-term budget framework to enhance fiscal management, smooth spending, and safeguard the RERF, while taking into account the volatility in revenues.                                                  3 Transportation costs are very high. Kiribati imports oil mainly through Fiji with costs of transportation adding significantly to the final price. The price of oil, therefore, is almost twice as high in Kiribati as in Singapore. The authorities are exploring ways to increase the storage capacity so as to reduce the per unit cost of transportation.  4 See Selected Issues Paper “Strengthening Kiribati’s Tax System.”  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 11 Authorities’ views 13.      The authorities agreed on the need for fiscal consolidation and with most of the measures proposed by the mission, but pointed out the challenges in cutting spending, which make it difficult to establish a precise timetable for reaching fiscal sustainability.  • Steps planned on the revenue side: The authorities indicated that the merger of the tax and customs offices was already underway and expected to be completed by year-end. In addition, tax payments by large taxpayers will be monitored more closely, including through the appointment of explicitly designated staff. The consumption tax would be introduced, probably in 2008, in line with PFTAC recommendations, and they are seeking technical assistance to make preparations. With respect to fishing license fees, they have only limited leverage to improve the contract terms vis-à-vis big foreign fishing companies, especially given the lack of domestic capacity to undertake such operations. • Controlling spending is more challenging: The authorities agreed that reducing the number of PEs and enhancing their efficiency (by letting prices reflect costs of production) would help to reduce fiscal pressures. The new private sector strategy focuses on this. They are already consulting and encouraging the private sector to participate in the transportation and distribution of copra from the production stage to the end-user to help improve efficiency.  B.   Maintaining the Value of the RERF RERF balances 14.      The total balance of the RERF at end-2006 is estimated at $496 million (about 6 times GDP). The authorities generally managed this fund well for many years after independence in the context of prudent fiscal policy. However, withdrawals have recently picked up significantly and threaten to undermine the government’s current informal benchmark of maintaining the real per capita value of the fund at its 1996 level. The absence of a well-defined target or rule for the RERF combined with the lack of a medium-term budget framework for planning have allowed recent large windfalls to be used for financing current spending, mostly wages and subsidies.  Staff views and recommendations  The mission discussed the importance of limiting the withdrawals from the fund by linking it to a medium-term expenditure framework.5 In particular,  • Limit drawings to sustainable levels: Staff discussed the baseline scenario which indicates that the RERF can sustain deficits of about 8–9 percent of GDP without                                                  5 See Selected Issues Paper “The Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund.” Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 12 Kiribati: Selected Indicators of "Ease of Doing Business"KiribatiRegionOECDEmploying workersDifficulty of Hiring Index023.727Rigidity of Hours Index025.245.2Nonwage labor cost (% of salary)7.59.421.4Registering propertyProcedures (number)54.24.7Time (days)51385.831.8Getting creditLegal Rights Index656.3Credit Information Index01.95Public registry coverage (% adults)03.28.4Enforcing contractsProcedures (number)2631.522.2Time (days)660477.3351.2Cost (% of debt)7152.711.2Source: World Bank.undermining the government’s objective of maintaining the real per capita value of the fund.   • Link drawings from the RERF to a medium-term budget framework: This would allow the RERF drawdowns to respond flexibly to external revenue volatility while allowing expenditure smoothing.   • Greater transparency: At present, detailed reports of the fund’s performance are available to senior officials but reporting to the public is limited. Staff recommended that the transparency of the fund should be improved by publishing the balances, returns, and other relevant details on a regular basis. This could create support for keeping withdrawals more closely in line with the RERF’s objective and discourage ad hoc withdrawals to finance lower-priority spending.  Authorities’ views • On maintaining the value of the fund: The authorities agreed with the staff’s broad analysis of the RERF. They pointed out that the returns in the last two years had exceeded the projections made during the last Article IV consultation, helping to finance the budget deficit. That said, they agreed such high returns are not considered to be the norm. While working with their investment managers to explore possibilities for higher returns, they remained committed to invest in low risk assets. The authorities also plan to reassess their strategy on the RERF in terms of how best to optimize inter-generational benefits.   • On transparency: The authorities pointed out that regular reports (monthly) were made to the Cabinet and periodic updates were provided to Parliament. They did not believe that given the situation in Kiribati (including underdeveloped communications infrastructure) wider dissemination would be feasible or was required.  C.   Enhancing Private Sector Participation Background: 15.      Kiribati’s geographic remoteness, narrow resource base, and small size compared to other Pacific island countries have made it difficult to attract investment. While Kiribati’s overall ranking according to the World Bank’s Doing Business survey is 60th among 151 countries (in 2005 it ranked 58th), this relatively high ranking masks poor Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 13 performance on a number of important indicators like costs of starting a business, obtaining a license, and enforcement of contracts. Also, high public sector wage levels relative to the private sector, land titling problems (due to family based ownership of land) and weak infrastructure have deterred private sector activity. The NDS for 2004–07 recognized these inadequacies, but implementation of measures to alleviate these bottlenecks has been slow. More recently, the government has held open forum discussions with the private sector and is designing a new private sector strategy, which includes privatization of some PEs, mainly in trade, and streamlining and reviewing the costs of doing business and adapting land rights so that leases can be used as collateral for loans. The government is also putting a renewed emphasis on developing tourism on Kiritimati Island, especially for bird watchers. Staff views and recommendations Staff recommendations focused on a number of areas where structural reforms are urgently needed to help create a conducive environment for the private sector. • Public enterprise reforms: Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to review the role of PEs and urged the authorities to adopt a medium-term strategy to streamline the number of PEs engaged in commercial activities, including through the development of cooperatives and community based organizations. Staff also urged the authorities to reduce subsidies to minimize market distortions and create opportunities for the private sector. • Business climate: With respect to the new private sector strategy, staff urged the authorities to define a clear timeline and assign lead agencies responsible for implementation of measures to establish accountability and monitorability.  • Develop marine resources and tourism: Given the narrow resource base, staff outlined the experience of selected other island countries that have successfully attracted foreign investors.  Authorities’ views • On the role of public enterprises: The authorities pointed to the changing nature of retail trade where a Fiji firm and several domestic private investors had become active. They were also trying to involve the private sector in copra production and distribution. Further streamlining and improved accountability would come once the private sector strategy begins to be implemented later in the year. • On promoting private investment: The authorities emphasized their commitment to work with foreign investors to help develop Kiritimati Island, both as a fish processing center and as a center for tourism. Moreover, with land on Kiritimati almost fully owned by the government, it has more liberty to choose how to develop the island.

Financial Sector: The financial sector consists of the Bank of Kiribati (BOK), Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK), Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF), and Kiribati Insurance Corporation (KIC). Financial intermediation is very limited, partly because of the lack of collateral and partly because there are limited business opportunities. The BOK (the only commercial bank, 25 percent government owned and 75 percent foreign private-sector owned), and the KPF invest most of their resources abroad, although borrowing by the central government and PEs (in the shape of government guaranteed loans) from BOK have increased significantly in the last 3 years. BOK also makes limited small consumer and business loans backed by customers’ KPF assets as collateral. The DBK makes loans to small businesses, but poor risk management has led to an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) from about 20 percent in 2004 to about 34 percent more recently. Staff views and recommendations  • Improve financial intermediation: Staff recommended that implementation of reforms on land titling and extending the length of leases on land (AsDB is providing technical assistance) could help to improve financial intermediation and encourage the growth of private enterprises. • Improve supervision: Staff urged the authorities to improve supervision and strengthen risk management at DBK to limit the increase in contingent liabilities for the budget (in the event that it might need to be recapitalized).  Authorities’ views • Domestic bank lending: The authorities had invited bids for allocating 300 plots of land in Tarawa and Kiritimati Island and planned to move rapidly on distribution and registration once the bids were received. This would allow use of land as collateral. In the interim, KPF funds could be used as collateral for loans. • On supervision: They agreed on the need for improving risk management at DBK. A separate work unit to recoup collections on already existing NPLs was being established, although risk management capacity remained low.  E.   Other Issues • Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) legislation: Legislation has been drafted with the help of IMF’s Legal Department, however, it has yet to be submitted to Parliament. Staff urged the authorities to take prompt action.

PFTAC continues to provide technical assistance to improve the quality of data. V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 17.      Kiribati faces many difficult challenges but the still large fiscal deficits need to be reduced. Kiribati’s remote location in the Pacific Ocean combined with the widely dispersed atolls and its narrow resource base present special challenges to the development of a viable private sector and explain the growth of the government sector. However, the large deficits to support cash employment and subsidies to PEs have created fiscal vulnerabilities and are not sustainable over the medium term.  18.      Strong and more decisive action is required to ensure that budget deficits are progressively reduced and can be financed from the RERF without undermining the government’s objective of maintaining the real per capita value of the RERF. If the government continues to run large deficits, the resources in the RERF will be seriously jeopardized. Moreover, the rapid increase in the working age population is likely to put increasing pressure on the government to deliver both jobs and public services, and better prioritization of spending is crucial.  19.      Fiscal structural reforms and the adoption of a medium-term expenditure framework are critical to restoring fiscal sustainability. Improvements in tax administration and the introduction of a consumption tax are critical to help offset the decline in external sources of revenues as well as the scheduled decline in customs tariffs with respect to regional trade. At the same time, a medium-term expenditure framework will help improve fiscal management so that spending can be smoothed, taking due account of revenue volatility and safeguarding the resources in the RERF. 20.      Greater transparency on the RERF is advisable. While the RERF resources have been managed well, the absence of a formal framework guiding the withdrawals allows full discretion in using the resources, and risks the safety of these assets. Greater transparency of reporting would help to maintain discipline and accountability of the fund. 21.      Public enterprises need to become more efficient. While the role of PEs will remain critical in some areas, efforts need to be made to ensure cost recovery, at a minimum. This will help to improve the efficient use of already scarce resources and ease the burden on the budget. In this context, the planned privatization of some PEs is welcome.  22.      The government’s renewed emphasis on the private sector should help to create jobs, improve growth prospects and complement the required fiscal adjustment. The new private sector strategy rightly focuses on the privatization of commercially viable PEs and limiting their role to sectors that are not likely to attract the private sector. In this context, allowing foreign enterprises to enter the market would bring in much-needed capital Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 16 and technical know-how. In particular, they could be partners in developing Kiribati’s large marine resources and tourism potential.  23.      Data improvements will help policy making. Data on the fiscal sector are generally adequate for surveillance, although more comprehensive coverage of the development fund and operations of public enterprises is needed. Data on the real sector and balance of payments suffer from both quality and timeliness problems, largely reflecting capacity constraints.  24.      It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 24-month cycle. The authorities would welcome an interim staff visit, planned for late this year or early next year.

IMF Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati    On [April 27, 2007] the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2007 Article IV consultation with Kiribati.1  Background  Real GDP increased by nearly 6 percent in 2006 following two years of contraction. An  increase in government wages and a pickup in donor-financed construction activity were the main contributing factors. The external sources of income remain critical but both fishing license fees and remittances have been relatively constant in the last three years. The Australian dollar is used as the domestic currency.  Inflation has remained flat in the last three years as a decline in import prices of food and clothing (with a weight of about 50 percent in the consumer price index) offset the increase in domestic fuel prices. However, delays in adjusting the latter have resulted in fiscal pressures.  The fiscal deficit has been cut from about 50 percent of GDP in 2004 to about 25  percent of GDP in 2006, however it exceeded the budget target by 9 percentage points of GDP. Progress in improving tax collections has been modest and current spending remains high, especially on personnel costs and subsidies. The deficit was financed by drawdowns from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), Kiribati's main external reserve fund and overdrafts at the sole commercial bank (there is no domestic debt market). Moreover, public enterprises continue to operate at a loss and require large injections of cash, both in terms of explicit budget subsidies and in the shape of government-guaranteed loans.                                                   1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [April, 27, 2007] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Also, exports of copra and seaweed declined while fishing license fees and remittances have stagnated. The stock of external debt was 16 percent of GDP at the end of 2006, with most borrowing on concessional terms from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). External debt service remains low, at about 2 percent of exports of goods and services. Progress on structural reforms has been slow. The National Development Strategies (NDS) 2004–07 laid out an ambitious plan to improve the efficiency of public enterprises, enhance infrastructure and create an enabling environment for the private sector. On the positive side, the private sector, including a large foreign investor, have become more active in wholesale and retail trade after the closure of a government wholesale trading company in 2004. While some public enterprises have prepared business plans, in accordance with the NDS, implementation remains weak and follow up in terms of monitoring and accountability remains inadequate. Infrastructure bottlenecks, including in electricity, communications and roads, remain a major concern.

KIRIBATI: SUMMARY OF ANNEXES  The full annexes to this report can be viewed in CyberDocs on the Fund’s intranet and on the secure extranet for Executive Directors and member country officials.  Fund Relations  Kiribati joined the Fund in 1986. It has never had a Fund program. Kiribati uses the Australian dollar as its currency. The 2005 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 4, 2005 (SM/05/140).  Relations with the World Bank Group  Kiribati became a World Bank Group member in 1986. Since that time the Bank’s assistance consisted of a range of regional initiatives and the development of a major Global Environment Facility (GEF) program on adaptation to climate change (Kiribati Adaptation Program 2003–2015). Phase I of the Kiribati Adaptation Program (KAP-I) started in 2003 and was completed in 2006. Phase II of the Program, (KAP-II), was approved on 1 June, 2006, with a $1.8 million GEF grant as well as co-financing by the government, AusAid, and NZAid. KAP-II aims to develop the systematic diagnosis of climate-related problems and the design of cost-effective adaptation measures, while continuing to integrate climate risk awareness and responsiveness into economic and operational planning.   Relations with Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC)  The Centre’s assistance to Kiribati since 1998 has included 27 advisory missions. Kiribati has also sent nine officials to regional seminars and workshops. PFTAC continues to provide technical assistance (TA) on tax policy and tax administration, budget management, financial sector issues (though not recently) and on economic statistics. In particular, a Steering Committee has commenced work on the implementation of the Tax Modernization Project, designed by the PFTAC advisor in late 2003. The key objective of the Project is the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax. PFTAC, in conjunction with other donors, is also providing assistance on the implementation of a multi-year budget framework and a cash planning and commitment control system.   Relations with the Asian Development Bank  The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved six project loans to Kiribati amounting to $15.1 million, all from Special Fund resources (concessional). In addition, TA amounting to $12.0 million has been provided for 35 projects. The AsDB is currently providing a $630,000  TA loan for Integrated Land and Population Development Program on Kiritimati Islands.

However, there is no country page for Kiribati in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Data are currently provided to the Fund only on an intermittent basis and major weaknesses remain in the statistics on government finance, national accounts and balance of payments. The IMF’s Legal Department has provided TA on drafting a financial sector law and AML/CFT legislation. The IMF’s Statistics Department has provided some technical assistance in 1994–95. However PFTAC handles all requests now.   Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
