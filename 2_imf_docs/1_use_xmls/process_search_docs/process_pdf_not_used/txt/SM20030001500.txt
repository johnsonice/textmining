Anthony Elson and Michael Hadjimichael January 13,2003 a The 2002 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Honiara during November 4-12. The staff team comprised Messrs. Browne (Head), Berezin (both APD), and Ilahi (PDR). Mr. Callaghan (OED) participated in the discussions. l The team met with Prime Minister Kemakeza, Deputy Prime Minister Rini, then Finance Minister (and now Foreign Minister) Chan, Central Bank Governor Hou, the National Peace Council, private sector representatives, civil society, and donors. a Solomon Islands is on a 24-month consultation cycle. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on January 19,2001, Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to complement the peace process by creating the macroeconomic conditions, especially fiscal discipline, necessary for the urgently needed resumption of donor assistance, the restoration of investor confidence, and a durable economic recovery. Directors underscored that flexibility in exchange rate management and restrained credit policy would be essential to foster price stability and maintain an adequate level of international reserves. Close surveillance over the financial sector was also viewed as important. l Solomon Islands accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 in 1979. However, since June 2000, exchange restrictions have been introduced and increasingly intensified, which impose delays on the availability of foreign exchange for current international payments. 0 Data quality, coverage, provision, and timeliness remained weak during 200 l- 2002, notably in the real, fiscal, and external sectors. These difficulties seriously impede economic analysis and the effective surveillance of policies.

Progress in restoring law and order has been limited, despite the signing of the Townsville peace accord at end-2000 and the election of a coalition government in December 200 1. l The conflict has led to a two-thirds reduction in exports, a one-quarter or more contraction in GDP, a severe drop in fiscal revenue and large budget deficits. Successive governments have not been able to contain expenditures. In particular, there has been a rapid expansion in the public wage bill and large compensation payments to ex-militants. Domestic and external arrears have risen substantially. l International reserves have been virtually exhausted, despite a 30 percent depreciation of the SI dollar in 2002 against the U.S. dollar and tighter exchange restrictions. Key Policy Issues Prospects for the near term depend in large part on the success of measures to restore law and order and tighten fiscal policy, so as to pay down arrears and unlock new donor resources. Given the lack of financing options, staff endorsed the authorities’ intention to target a small (overall) surplus (on an accrual basis) in 2003, mainly through a sharp reduction in the size of the wage bill and a cessation of compensation payments. The staff also discussed strategies to address the high level of external debt. While the 2003 budget along the lines discussed with the mission was approved by Parliament in December 2002, there are serious doubts about its credibility. The unbudgeted payments to militants and the consequent resignation of the Finance Minister immediately following the budget passage do not inspire confidence that an appropriate fiscal plan can be implemented. Monetary policy is appropriately aimed toward restraining inflation, and avoiding adding to balance of payments pressures. However, the financial system is under strain, especially because of concerns about the state of the National Bank of Solomon Islands (the largest commercial bank), the National Provident Fund, and the Development Bank. The staff assisted in designing an indicative macroeconomic framework that could over the medium-term help to promote economic growth, alleviate poverty, and gradually rebuild external reserves. The staff supported the continued depreciation of the domestic currency to alleviate exchange market pressures, and urged removal of exchange restrictions as soon as conditions permit. The authorities agreed that it would not be desirable to pursue at this time their earlier proposal to adopt the Australian dollar as the domestic currency, in view of the large external and fiscal imbalances.

Economic and poverty conditions in the Solomon Islands have deteriorated markedly since the ethnic violence between the indigenous inhabitants of Guadalcanal and people of Malaitan descent erupted in mid-1999 (Box 1). Since that time, real GDP is estimated to have declined by at least 25 percent, including a fall of 4 percent in 2002 (Table 1). Basic infrastructure has been destroyed, the private sector has shrunk considerably and the confidence of investors has not been restored, despite the Townsville peace agreement of October 2000. 2. Partial data indicate annual inflation is within a S-10 percent range, although major utility prices have not been fully adjusted in line with the recent sharp exchange rate depreciation; comprehensive CPI data have not been collected since 2000. The impact of a large currency depreciation on inflation appears to have been limited because of weak domestic demand and the failure to fully adjust public utility prices. 3. Developments in the external sector have been characterized by both the sharp slowdown in trade and reduced capital inflows (Table 2). Exports in 2002 are estimated at just one-third of their level in 1999, with the complete closure of gold and palm oil concerns, although there has been some modest recovery in timber, fish, and cocoa exports in recent months. The economic recession, shortages of foreign exchange, and the sharp depreciation of the currency have caused imports to drop sharply, thus improving the balance on the trade and current accounts during 2002. However, the capital account balance has worsened substantially, because of lower loan disbursements (notwithstanding a $25 million loan from Taiwan, Province of China) and near halting of foreign direct investment. 4. Official international reserves have declined sharply and are now equivalent to only 1.5 months of the compressed level of imports. This has occurred despite the depreciation of the currency in 2002 by 30 percent against the U.S. dollar, and the intensification of exchange controls. With regard to the latter, in addition to the limits imposed in 2000 and 2001,2 since July 2002 the central bank has only provided foreign exchange for a list of critical goods. Staff has also received information that the government ‘Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper discusses economic developments in the Solomon Islands since 2000. 2 Until June 5, 2000, exchange controls were used largely for monitoring purposes. Under the revised regulations introduced at that time, payments in excess of US$25,000 but less than US$40,000 are to be made in two equal weekly installments, while payments in excess of US$40,000 are to be made on four equal weekly installments. Also, the limit on payment applications that may be approved by commercial banks was reduced from US$5,000 to US$l,OOO, with the central bank approving all other bona fide requests. This latter limitation does not give rise to a restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction.

Staff is investigating this measure. Solomon Islands has also asked its neighboring countries for a temporary exemption for some products from the Melanesian free-trade agreement in order to enhance customs receipts and to protect local industries. The tightening of controls has resulted in a sharp increase in the unsatisfied demand for foreign exchange. 5. The government’s finances have weakened considerably since the hostilities began (Table 3). Preliminary estimates indicate that the overall budget deficit increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1999 to 11 percent of GDP on an accrual basis in 2002 (compared with the budget target of 3 percent of GDP). The deficit was initially financed from the central bank and commercial banks, and government debt (two-thirds of which is external) increased substantially (Table 4).3 After the statutory limit on central bank credit to government had been breached, and with the commercial banks unwilling to purchase government securities, the deficit was financed by an increase in domestic and external debt service arrears which together now amount to about 20 percent of GDP (Table 5). In addition, there has been a further build up of arrears on public sector wages and payments for goods and services. 6. The fiscal deterioration has reflected pressures on both revenues and expenditures. Nongrant revenues declined by 10 percent of GDP (to 16 percent of GDP) between 1999 and 2002, due to the fall in economic activity, as well as large customs duty remissions granted by the previous government, although these were withdrawn and the authority of the Finance Minister to issue new remissions was abolished in early 2002. Expenditure trends reflect the increase in compensation payments to ex-militants. As a result, cash payments for education, health, and infrastructure have been squeezed. Moreover, the expenditure arrears on public sector wages have prompted disruptive strikes by teachers, health workers, and air traffic controllers. 7. Monetary policy in 2002 was geared toward restraining inflation and avoiding further weakness in the external position (Table 6). The central bank refrained in 2002 from extending credit to the government, in observance of legislative limits. Bank lending to the private sector increased only because of some pick-up in activity in the forestry and fisheries sectors, from very depressed levels, although overall private sector credit demand remained weak. The continued decline in official international reserves resulted in a net withdrawal of liquidity from the banking system. 8. The financial sector is under strain. The holders of government debt, mostly banks and the National Provident Fund (NPF), have been required to rollover maturing securities at an administratively set interest rate of 3 percent since early 2002 (a much lower interest rate 3Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper presents an analysis of the medium-term sustainability of the government’s external debt position. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- than originally contracted). Nonperforming loans of the Development Bank of Solomon Islands (DBSI) and the National Bank of Solomon Islands (NBSI) have increased substantially. The NBSI, which is the largest commercial bank with about half of banking system deposits, no longer has a foreign equity holder, after the Bank of Hawaii transferred its majority stake to a group of trustees in mid-2002. 9. Fund policy recommendations during the last Article IV consultation, which stressed the restoration of law and order and sound macroeconomic and structural policies as a pre-requisite for higher levels of private investment and external assistance, have not been implemented. In particular, the central government budget deficit has been far in excess of that proposed during the consultation (about 2 percent of GDP in 2001-02). Monetary policy was expansionary in 2000, with net credit to the government increasing by almost 50 percent. While central bank financing was contained in 2001-02, policy could not be geared toward recovery of international reserves, as proposed. Planned improvements in productivity through market reforms, protection of property rights by the restoration of law and order, and other structural reforms were not achieved. 10. A policy dialogue between Fund staff and the present government on how to promote economic recovery and rehabilitate government finances was initiated at the aid donor meeting in Sydney in December 2001. It was continued in a March 2002 staff visit, in which the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank were represented, and the 2002 budget was formulated during the visit. The 2002 budget, which incorporated the staffs recommendations, aimed at reducing the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP, mainly by cutting the wage bill, ceasing new compensation payments, and limiting development spending to available concessional financing. The balance of payments was to be strengthened not only by exercising strict fiscal and monetary restraint, but also by devaluing the Solomon Islands dollar by 25 percent. The decision to devalue was reversed shortly after the mission’s departure, and the budget cuts were not implemented. However, as indicators of a commitment to reform, the pace of exchange rate depreciation was accelerated and the government began paying in full its contributions to the NPF from May 2002, after a suspension of payments from September 2000. 11. Staff took part in a donor meeting in Honiara in June 2002 and another staff visit was conducted in August 2002, to advise further on how to restore macroeconomic stability and implement a medium-term development strategy. During those discussions, the new Finance Minister firmly endorsed the staffs views on the need for fiscal consolidation that, in addition to the restoration of law and order, was seen as vital to re- establish donor support and to create the conditions for a recovery in economic growth. The Cabinet approved, at the time of the August visit, decisions to: (i) reduce the public sector workforce through 1,300 redundancies (15 percent of total employees); (ii) promote efficiency by reducing the number of ministries from 20 to 10; and (iii) prepare a tight 2003 budget fully in line with staff proposals. However, the actions agreed during 2002 have not been effectively implemented and consequently donor support continues to be compromised (Box 2). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- 12. At the time of the Article IV consultation discussions in November 2002, little progress had been made in implementing the August measures. The economic and political situation deteriorated further in December.4 The 2003 budget was delivered to parliament along the lines agreed with the staff team, with stress on the need to end wasteful spending and ensure that the government lived within its means. Shortly thereafter, the government gave in to police threats of armed insurrection, handing over to insurgents who attacked the Prime Minister’s residence, the full amount placed in a special government account earmarked for payments to reduce external and domestic debt service arrears. This prompted the resignation of the Finance Minister, who was replaced by the Deputy Prime Minister. II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 13. The discussions focused on the need to flesh out a sound macroeconomic framework for rebuilding the economy, which the authorities recognized remains in perilous shape because of the breakdown of law and order and the slow pace of economic reform. Attention was given to the extent of fiscal adjustment that should be implemented in the remainder of 2002, and in the context of the budget for 2003 and the medium term. The staff team broadly endorsed the government’s proposals outlined in the medium-term economy recovery plan that was presented to donors in June 2002. That document focuses on the need for fiscal discipline, improved public sector efficiency, higher development spending financed by external aid, and a marked upturn in private sector activity, especially in the export industries. Taking into account the failure to implement agreed fiscal and structural measures during 2002, including the disappointing efforts to implement the August measures, the staff team reiterated the need for an accelerated adjustment effort. 14. The mission also held consultations with civil society focusing on security, poverty, and the transparency of economic policy. There was broad consensus that the government should continue to give priority to improving the security situation and addressing outstanding fiscal issues. It was generally agreed that arrears accumulation as a means to finance government expenditure was untenable and was adversely affecting the private sector. The civil society representatives concurred that the government should implement the necessary fiscal adjustment through redundancies and consolidation of ministries, and that this could be achieved without a serious impact on the poorest elements of society (who are not government employees). Participants also indicated that poverty had increased as a consequence of the civil conflict and the subsequent economic slowdown, and that there was an urgent need to redress the situation. They encouraged the authorities to increase the transparency of economic policymaking by more frequent public statements. 41n late December 2002, a cyclone devastated two remote islands with 1,500 residents. Various governments are providing supplies and financial support. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- A. Fiscal Policy 15. The team noted that progress in implementing the redundancies that were agreed in August 2002 had been slow. In particular, at the time of the consultation discussions, lists had not been finalized of either those willing to leave voluntarily or of the numerous ghost workers. While donors were willing to help finance the redundancy program (and New Zealand had committed to doing so), they sought assurances that the scheme would be conducted effectively, with safeguards to prevent redundant employees from being rehired. The staff team stressed that the authorities should demonstrate their determination to ensure that this would be the case, and urged the government to complete the redundancy program as soon as possible. The authorities responded that the program would be completed as early as possible in the first quarter of 2003 and for the first phase, the termination of employment of 300 persons was initiated in the second half of November 2002. 16. In accordance with the strategy agreed during the mission, the 2003 budget provided for a small surplus. While details had not been finalized at the time of the discussions, the authorities agreed that decisive actions needed to be taken to restore fiscal discipline. They recognized that continuation of the present policy environment would entail, with dire consequences, an additional increase in budgetary and debt arrears, loss of donor assistance, intensified exchange restrictions, and further economic collapse. In addition to pressing ahead with the redundancy effort, the authorities stated that they would undertake the merger of ministries as soon as possible. They pointed out that the 2003 budget had been prepared with expenditure allocations for only ten ministries in the next fiscal year. 17. On the revenue side, the authorities considered that the present economic situation prevented the introduction of new taxes. The staff team proposed that higher rates on petroleum and sales taxes should be imposed to yield l-2 percent of GDP, which would still leave the tax ratio in relation to GDP well below that in effect prior to the 1999 ethnic violence, but the authorities did not consider this action to be feasible. The team welcomed the January 2002 decision to eliminate import duty exemptions, which appears to have been implemented effectively. They also supported the October 2002 regulations issued by the Central Bank to tighten export and import duty collections, especially in view of anecdotal evidence that shortfalls in receipts from timber exports were considerable and import duties were being evaded by weak customs inspections. The team urged the strengthening of tax administration, including the prevention of arrangements whereby individual taxpayers might offset payments obligations against government debts owed to them (which could yield 0.5-l .O percent of GDP). The authorities stated that this was not a serious problem and, if any cases came to their notice, they would be addressed immediately. 18. With regard to current expenditures, the authorities proposed a reduction in the wage bill and compensation payments of no less than 30 percent (as initially targeted in 2002), and this was incorporated in the budget. This adjustment would include downsizing and the termination of compensation payments for property damage during the ethnic strife which will facilitate the fiscal adjustment effort; cuts in wage rates were not Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- considered feasible. Cuts of approximately equal magnitude were incorporated in the budgets of each department. The staff team welcomed the decision to cease compensation payments. With these actions, the budget allowed for an increase in current spending on health, expenditure, and poverty alleviation, while maintaining balance between current revenue and expenditure. The approved budget also provided for 15 percent of current revenue (about 2.5 percent of GDP) to be placed in a special account for the repayment of scheduled interest payments on government securities and domestic and external arrears, with priorities determined by the Ministry of Finance. However, given the extortion in December 2002, it is not longer clear that this commitment will be fulfilled. 19. The 2003 development budget is projected at only 8 percent of GDP, higher than in 2002, but strictly linked to secure donor financing. A cautious approach has been adopted, in line with the staff team’s recommendations. A contingency plan was also prepared to prioritize additional spending should further external support become available. Given the high level of public debt, the authorities agreed that external financial assistance should only be contracted in the form of grants. A multi-donor mission, organized by AUSaid and including representatives of the European Union, New Zealand, and UNDP, visited in November 2002 to promote good governance and report to their institutions on priorities for future support. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank are both precluded from providing further assistance until arrears on existing loans are cleared, but staff representatives have indicated their intention to remain engaged in the meantime and consider providing additional assistance when the issue of arrears is resolved. 20. The staff team urged the authorities to reduce subsidies for public enterprises, all of which are in poor financial condition.5 The supply of electricity and gas has been frequently disrupted by the inability of these utilities to purchase fuel requirements. The port authority has been greatly affected by the fall in external trade. The state airline has discontinued its international services, which are now provided on a limited basis through a chartered aircraft from a neighboring country, but its loss-making domestic services are being continued. The telecommunications company has been adversely affected by shrinkage in the customer base owing to the economic downturn, the failure of the government to pay its accounts, and vandalization of its infrastructure. The staff team stressed that accelerated price rises are needed in light of the pronounced and continuing exchange rate depreciation. 21. Consistent with the medium-term reform agenda (Table 7), the authorities agreed with the need to secure a fiscal surplus on an accrual basis until arrears have been paid off and broad fiscal balance thereafter in order to reduce the high level of official debt and fund the restructuring and recapitalization of the financial sector. However, they had not yet been able to fully develop the medium-term orientation of budgetary policy, in view of the frequent short-term crises that had to be given priority. That 5 The staff team was unable to estimate the precise size of subsidies to public enterprises, in view of the lack of audited accounts. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lo- said, it was nevertheless apparent that financial assistance from donors would be required for a lengthy period to help in the reconstruction of basic infrastructure, alleviate poverty, and free resources to allow the government to meet scheduled debt repayment obligations. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 22. The authorities stated that the framework for monetary policy in 2003 and beyond should continue to be focused on the need to contain inflationary pressures, while rebuilding reserves. They argued that the high level of liquidity in the banking system is not a matter of concern at the moment, given weak private sector credit demand. Based on this, together with the grip on lending to the government, they felt that the stance of monetary policy was appropriately restrained. The team stressed that the situation needed to be kept under careful review, and monetary policy tightened if necessary to protect the external position. In view of the uncertainties regarding the finances of the NBSI, especially because of its potential large nonperforming loans, there is clearly no room for any lapses in maintaining appropriate supervisory policies. 23. The staff team inquired about the reasons for the decline in bank deposits over the past few years, particularly as this seemed to be associated with reserve losses. The authorities agreed that this development could suggest a weakening in confidence in the banking system, given the worsening political and economic situation and an increase in demand for foreign exchange for currency substitution or capital flight purposes. However, they were of the view that the fall in deposits mainly reflected the contraction in economic activity, especially as various businesses have pulled out or downsized, as well as low interest rates (less than 1 percent on most deposits). The staff team pointed to the risks associated with a declining demand for domestic currency (the decline in real M2 exceeded the decline in output) and stressed the urgency of putting in place a set of credible adjustment policies as a means of strengthening confidence and facilitating a recovery in credit and money demand by the private sector. 24. The staff team discussed the risks of a financial sector crisis, and measures that might be taken to shore up the financial sector. The main concern in present circumstances is to ensure the stability of NBSI. There had been a notable improvement in its management in recent months and a run on its deposits had been avoided. An extensive audit was being undertaken and the Central Bank had enhanced its monitoring procedures, with a possible view to restructuring its ownership, if necessary (presently 49 percent of NBS1 is owned by the National Provident Fund). The authorities considered that a further injection of government money to NBS1 might be needed in order to ensure the stability of the banking system. Another issue is the forced rollover and lower interest rates on government debt. While the foreign banks appear to be willing to live with this situation, NBS1 is challenging the legality of it in court. If the legal authorities decide that the authorities pay higher interest rates, this will of course have adverse budgetary consequences. 25. The authorities confirmed their intention to pursue the present exchange rate policy of small and frequent exchange depreciation. However, they were unable to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- provide a firm timetable for the elimination of all exchange restrictions and the staff agreed that some time would be needed to achieve this goal. An important factor would be the pace of rehabilitation of the export sector, especially the gold mine (where infrastructure has been heavily damaged and considerable time will be needed to replace it) and the palm oil plantations (where lack of maintenance will probably require replanting of crops that may take two years to reach maturity). In these circumstances, the short-term price responsiveness of exports to depreciation of the Solomon Islands dollar would be limited and exchange restrictions would need to be maintained in the near term to dampen import demand. The mission agreed that it was difficult at present to determine the appropriate level of the real exchange rate. Nevertheless, some further depreciation was warranted, as this would help boost some exports, including fish and timber, and dampen imports to permit some gradual easing of import restrictions. 26. The staff team also welcomed the drafting of anti-money laundering legislation and urged its early passage by parliament. While recognizing that this has not been a major issue in the Solomon Islands, it could become significant when exchange controls are removed. 27. The authorities agreed with the staff team that the possible adoption of the Australian dollar as the domestic currency-an idea floated in mid-2002-should not be considered at present.6 The team concurred that for a small, open economy with limited capacity to effectively utilize an independent monetary policy, such as the Solomon Islands, an argument could be made that use of the Australian dollar would facilitate macroeconomic stabilization, so long as the underpinnings for dollarization are in place. However, given the present substantial internal and external imbalances in the economy, it would be difficult for the country to make a smooth transition to a dollarized regime. By itself, dollarization would not help to achieve budgetary balance or a lower trade deficit. Moreover, even if the Solomon Islands could acquire enough Australian dollars to replace the domestic currency issue, dollarization could facilitate capital flight by simplifying the evasion of capital controls, rather than stimulating capital inflows. C. Structural Policies 28. Progress on the structural front has been limited during the past several years, reflecting primarily the resource constraint facing the government, and the repeated attention to short-term crises. The overriding issue continues to be the need to restore law and order. While the security position in Honiara and some other areas appears to have improved somewhat as a result of the surrender of weapons under the amnesty that followed the Townsville peace agreement, the situation is very fragile. The National Peace Council, formed in October 2002, continues to try to disarm the militias and foster reconciliation “Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues paper presents a detailed analysis of the relative merits of moving to a dollarized regime at this time.

Several initiatives are under way to restructure the police force, with assistance from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 29. The achievement of medium-term development goals is crucially dependent on greater efficiency in the public sector. The authorities agreed that public sector reforms need to focus on the continued downsizing of the central government, especially through the removal of special constables who are generally performing only limited functions. The staff team also urged the preparation of a comprehensive plan for the privatization of state enterprises, particularly in view of the burden that they all presently impose on the public finances. The government is committed to greater decentralization of budgetary policy to provincial and local governments, beginning in 2004, although detailed planning arrangements for this step have barely commenced. The staff team emphasized the risks of a poorly managed decentralization. The authorities agreed on the importance of ensuring that any additional revenue transfers should be matched fully by the devolution of expenditure responsibilities. 30. The authorities also intended to give greater attention to the creation of a more favorable business environment, especially to promote export growth. The most important factors are the security problems, the failure of the government to pay its bills to suppliers, and the lack of access to foreign exchange for imports. If these issues are resolved, the staff team agreed that there is considerable potential for growth, given the strong resource base of the country, notably in agricultural crops, forestry, fishing, and tourism, especially for diving. Apart from the restrictions on foreign exchange purchases, the trade regime is relatively liberal with moderate duties on most imports and exports (the staff team tentatively rates Solomon Islands as 3 on the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index although detailed statistics on the average tariff bands and a list of products with export duties were not made available to the mission); there are no major regulatory impediments to foreign investment. 31. A major task is to improve administrative capacity, which at present severely limits the government’s ability to pursue necessary reforms. The implications are evident in the paucity of economic data, which, in particular, makes problematic assessments of competitiveness. The staff team defined a specific list of statistical requirements for surveillance needs. The Fund will also continue to provide technical assistance on monetary policy and bank supervision to the Central Bank through MAE and on statistical issues through STA. PFTAC will continue to provide support on fiscal, banking, and statistical issues. D. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks 32. The Solomon Islands’ external and financial sector vulnerabilities and downside risks cloud the medium-term prospects. The most prominent concerns relate to the lack of security, the weakness of the government finances, the lack of financial system soundness, the high external debt and the precariously low level of external reserves. The balance sheet position of the private nonbank sector may also have been adversely affected by the decline in output, the sizable exchange rate depreciation, and the large accumulation of government Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- and domestic arrears. Unless these issues are adequately addressed, the medium-term prospects are bleak (Table 8). Indeed, Solomon Islands’ external debt is currently unsustainable, based on criteria relevant for small-open economies. At end-2002, the ratio of net present value (NPV) of external debt to government revenues was 388 percent, with debt service accounting for 18 percent of nongrant revenues. 33. Accordingly, the main aim of economic policies for 2003, as outlined above, would be to lay the groundwork for faster medium-term growth. The staff team considered that if law and order and macroeconomic stability are restored, real GDP growth of perhaps 5 percent annually could be achieved during 2004-2007, on top of growth of perhaps 1 percent in 2003. With appropriate policies, the rate of inflation could remain modest, although subject to sizable upside risks, including the possibility that further exchange rate depreciation could add to inflationary pressures. Export growth and an increase in external grants and concessional external assistance could help to restore a surplus in the external current account and reserves could be gradually rebuilt, although they might still amount to only 2 months of imports of goods and services in 2007. Under an adjustment scenario, external debt would become sustainable in 2005, with the NPV of debt- to-revenue falling below 250 percent and the debt service-to-revenue ratio below 15 percent. III. STAFF APPRAISAL 34. The Solomon Islands remains in very poor shape. With the breakdown of law and order, real GDP declined for the fourth consecutive year in 2002, and foreign exchange reserves are virtually exhausted. There is an urgent need to restore fiscal discipline, with the overall budget deficit estimated at 11 percent of GDP on an accruals basis in 2002 and the government’s domestic and external debt service arrears having reached 20 percent of GDP. 35. The near-term outlook depends crucially on measures to restore law and order, fully implement the tighter fiscal policy that underlies the 2003 budget, and strengthen public enterprise finances. If success is achieved in fulfilling commitments in these areas, where performance has been deficient in the past several years, the underpinnings for sustainable growth and financial and external viability will be put in place. 36. While the revenue and expenditure assumptions of the 2003 budget are consistent with the rehabilitation of government finances, success in this area hinges crucially on whether the budget can be successfully implemented. Developments in December 2002, when unbudgeted government spending increased, cast doubts on the government’s commitment to reform. The staff would emphasize the need for corrective action. In that regard, the main measures have to be on the expenditure side, where the absence of further compensation payments to ex-militants and the downsizing of the public sector are imperative to reduce current spending. While the potential for revenue raising is constrained in the short term by the weak economic situation, tax administration would become more effective if law and order improves. It is also necessary to regularize relations with domestic and external creditors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- 37. The main objective of monetary policy is to keep inflation under control and ensure adequate reserves in the context of a managed floating exchange rate system, while allowing for a sufficient increase in private sector credit to promote recovery. The authorities deserve credit for resisting pressures to print money in 2002 and must continue to avoid such pressures. However, a further injection of government money to the National Bank of Solomon Islands might be needed in order to ensure the stability of the banking system. It is also important that credit risk is analyzed carefully and supervision policies are enforced. 38. There is a need to remove the large imbalance in the foreign exchange market, which is presently being addressed by tight exchange restrictions. The staff agreed with the authorities that in current circumstances, the emphasis should be on protecting reserves while beginning to unwind the restrictions as soon as conditions permit. While the price responsiveness of exports to changes in the exchange rate at the moment is likely to be limited, some further modest depreciation was likely to be helpful in addressing the external imbalances, and therefore the staff endorsed a continuation of small frequent adjustments in the exchange rate. Given the absence of a timetable for the removal of exchange restrictions, the staff does not recommend their approval by the Fund. 39. The staff would underscore the importance of improving economic data collection and dissemination, as well as data reporting to the Fund. Economic policy formulation is severely hampered by the lack of statistics, particularly the absence of data on national output and the failure to publish a consumer price index. 40. The authorities have requested that, in view of the continuing economic difficulties, Solomon Islands should be placed on a 12-month consultation cycle, rather than the present 24-month cycle. The staff supports this request. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- Box 1. Solomon Islands-Ethnic Conflict The ethnic violence that intensified in mid-1999 developed over a long period. The indigenous majority on Guadalcanal harbor animosity against migrant workers from the island of Malaita, based on the perception that they have enjoyed greater success in the competition for jobs and resources. Further, Malaitans have gained control of a growing portion of land in Guadalcanal as a result of migration in recent decades. The migrants often squatted on the land of Guadalcanal landholders, which led to bitter disputes in some cases over land control. In mid-1999, bands of armed militants from Guadalcanal intensified attacks on workers- many of them second generation-of Malaitan descent. The fear generated by killings and other atrocities led 20,000-30,000 of them to flee. A number of Malaitan militia groups were formed, and launched retaliatory attacks. In early 2000, these groups united into the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF). For their part, the native Guadalcanal armed militias united into the Isatabu Freedom Fighters (IFF). Limited international assistance was insufficient to strengthen the government’s control over the police and to improve its capacity to address the security threat posed by these militias. Violence intensified and, in early June 2000, the MEF staged a coup which led to the replacement of the Prime Minister. The MEF was supported by elements of the police, which had been affected by ethnic division and governance problems. The new government secured a cease-fire agreement in August 2000. Peace negotiations culminated in October 2000, when the government and the main parties involved in the hostilities signed a peace agreement in Townsville, Australia. A cornerstone of the process was the government decision to award compensation payments to victims of ethnic violence, financed by a $25 million loan from Taiwan, Province of China. Much of this loan was used to make payments to militants involved in the violence, who often resorted to force to secure them, at the expense of those who lost property. Final payments were made in September 2002. While the MEF and the IFF were both party to the Townsville Peace Agreement, a small breakaway group of the IFF, the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Arm (GRA), chose not to participate. This group, led by Harold Keke, has its stronghold on the Weather Coast of Guadalcanal, which lies on the rugged southern side of the island. In the last two years, Keke and his followers have been responsible for numerous crimes, including the murder of a government Minister in August 2002. Attempts by the police to apprehend Keke have so far been unsuccessful. The Townsville Peace Agreement did not fully achieve its chief goal of disarming militants. Although many guns were surrendered as part of the amnesty in the months after the agreement was signed, most militants continue to be well-armed. In return for signing the agreement, participating militant groups were awarded amnesty for most criminal acts committed during the ethnic violence, which has led to bitterness on the part of the victims. Random acts of violence have continued in and around Honiara, often by ex-militants that have been absorbed into the police force. International assistance is now being provided to strengthen the police force. The government formed the National Peace Council to replace a similar body under the Townsville Peace Agreement, which expired in October 2002. The Council continues to try to disarm the militias and foster reconciliation among the various warring groups.

Solomon Islands-Policy Challenges and Responses ‘he policy challenges discussed during the 2002 Article IV consultation mission and actions needed to address these challenges. Policy Challenges !aw and Order The law and order situation, which deteriorated markedly since ethnic violence erupted on the main island of Guadalcanal in mid-1999, remains highly volatile (see Box 1). After the mission’s departure, the Finance Minister resigned in protest over exortion payments made to members of the police force; his family, along with the Permanent Secretary and his chief advisor, subsequently fled the country. Gscal Policy The overall deficit, measured on an accrual basis, widened to 11 percent of GDP in 2002, reflecting the severe economic recession and the government’s failure to implement their 2002 budget framework. Exchange Rate Policy Foreign reserves have fallen to about 1% months of the compressed level of imports, despite the high level of unrnet foreign exchange purchase requests and growing external debt arrears. lebt Management The government has suspended payments on most domestic and external debt obligations. Total debt since 1998 has increased to nearly 100 percent of GDP, 70 percent of which is external. The increase in external debt reflects a loan of $25 million secured in 2001 from Taiwan, Province of China. Actions Needed Authorities’ Response to Date - Improve law enforcement and the judicial system; demobilize special constables; continue efforts to remove firearms from circulation. Reduce recurrent expenditures through a public sector redundancy exercise, halve the number of ministries from 20 to 10, and end compensation payments. Strengthen revenue collection by reducing exemptions and tax evasion, and give consideration to new revenue measures. Continue policy of gradual adjustment of the exchange rate in order to reduce external imbalances and improve competitiveness. When conditions permit, ease foreign exchange restrictions. Develop a coherent strategy to record all formal and informal debt claims against the government and initiate a dialogue with creditors to establish a timeframe for repaying existing obligations. Take steps to repay external arrears to bilateral and multilateral aid donors. The government has appointed a new police commissioner to reorganize the police force. A Peace Monitoring Council has been formed to continue the process of disarming militants and fostering ethnic reconciliation. Cabinet passed a motion in August 2002 to reduce the number of ministries from 20 to 10 and to retrench 1,300 workers, but implementation has been very slow. Import tax duty remissions have ceased. The Central Bank allowed the exchange rate to depreciate by 30 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2002. Foreign exchange restrictions were tightened. Most domestic government debt has been forcibly rolled over at an interest rate of 3 percent. No timeframe yet exists to repay outstanding principal and interest arrears to external creditors, including the World Bank and the ADB.

In November 2000, the authorities resumed the policy adopted in August 1998, whereby the exchange rate is determined on the basis of a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon Islands’ major trading partners, with the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. During 2002, as pressures on external reserves intensified, the Central Bank accelerated the rate of currency depreciation, leading to a gradual real depreciation. VIII. Exchange Restrictions Until June 5,2000, exchange controls were used largely for monitoring purposes. Under the revised regulations introduced in June, payments for amounts greater than $25,000 but less than $40,000 are to be made in two equal weekly installments, and those for amounts higher than $40,000 are to be made on four equal weekly installments. Also, the limit on payment applications that may be approved by commercial banks was reduced from $5,000 to $1,000, with the central bank approving all other bona fide requests. This latter limitation does not give rise to a restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction.

Staff has also received information that the government may be restricting current international payments by public enterprises, which would constitute an exchange restriction, subject to Fund approval. Staff is investigating this measure. IX. Last Article IV Consultation: The 2000 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Honiara during March 21-April4 and November 4-10,200O.

The Solomon Islands sent eight officials to regional seminars and workshops, and PFTAC organized six attachments (including Financial Institutions Department’s manager at the CBS1 to a seminar in D.C.). Once the security situation improves, PFTAC intends to resume extensive assistance. Public financial management PFTAC participated in two PEM missions in 1998, one with AUSaid, and one with UNDP, to explore the scope for sustainable improvements in financial management. An advisor was a member of the August 2002 IMF mission and reviewed the PEM system. The priority remains the general rehabilitation of public financial management, including strengthening expenditure and commitment controls, tightening treasury and cash management operations, and improving the budget and accounting system, which is unable to provide adequate data. Tax administration and policy The last missions, undertaken before February 1999, provided advice and input to the administration improvement projects proposed by AUSaid and NZAID. Following a review of the Inland Revenue administration, two four-week consultancies for strengthening the audit area were also organized in May and November 1998. Financial sector regulation and supervision Regular visits to help develop the legal and regulatory framework for banking supervision took place until 1999 when a World Bank peripatetic advisor was hired to improve supervisory skills at the Financial Institutions Department (FID) of the CBSI. In May 2001, in coordination with the World Bank, PFTAC assessed the status of banking supervision. Subsequently, PFTAC provided back-up support to CBS1 from Suva, mostly on the divestment of a foreign bank, amendments to the law on transfer of ownership in a bank, and accounting treatment for restructured government bonds. Economic and financial statistics After a 1998 TA mission on BOP statistics at the Central Bank, PFTAC prepared a recovery plan for the Statistics Office in April 2000, offering recommendations on personnel, the strengthening of the Statistics Act, and a new Statistics Authority. The situation has since deteriorated and only the CPI and trade statistics are now being processed. The Deputy Government Statistician recently (April 2002) sought advice on designing a new recovery plan but, with his subsequent departure, no plan has been proposed. The Solomon Islands participated in the GDDS workshop in Suva, jointly organized by PFTAC and STA, in November 2002, and options for the way ahead will be discussed with the delegation, which includes the Central Bank Deputy Governor. ‘The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor technical assistance institution, financed by IMF, AsDB, AUSaid and NZAID, with the IMF as Executing Agency. The Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

As of July 3 1,2002, arrears to the World Banked totaled approximately $500,000. Previously, the World Bank maintained a significant lending program in the Solomon Islands with a strong focus on education, health, and economic reform. The Bank’s operations in the Solomon Islands are guided by the Bank’s broader PaciJic Regional Strategy (May 2000) which, in keeping with the Bank’s mission of poverty alleviation, identifies as a priority the provision of targeted development financing in sectors where the Bank has a proven track record and where there is a clear link to an explicit policy reform agenda. The other objective of the Bank’s Pacific Regional Strategy, the identification of best-practice approaches and solutions to the development problems in the Pacific, has been carried forward through both country-specific and regional economic and sector work. Recent country work includes PaciJic Islands Stakeholder Participation in Development: Solomon Islands; Voices from the Village-A Comparative Study of Coastal Resource Management in the Pacific Islands; and the Bank’s Pacific Regional Economic Report, Cities, Seas, and Storms-Managing Change in Paczjic Island Economies (forthcoming).

While the first tranche ($7 million) was released in 1999, the subsequent ethnic crisis and associated unrest significantly changed the economic environment in the country, and the SAC will close without disbursing the second tranche. The World Bank is unable to provide any new assistance to the Solomons until the all outstanding arrears have been cleared. Given the length of time that has passed since program assistance was suspended, it is likely that ongoing projects, if they are reinstated at all, will be reinstated only at modest support levels.

As of October 15,2002, arrears to the AsDB totaled approximately $1.5 million. Since joining AsDB in 1973, Solomon Islands has received 16 loans for a total amount of $79.3 million, and 53 TA projects for a total amount of $10.9 million. The loan and TA projects have been in agriculture and fisheries, transportation, infrastructure rehabilitation, finance, power, water supply and sanitation, and ports, as well as on the institutional development of government ministries and public agencies, particularly the executing agencies of AsDB-financed projects. During 1994-97, no new operations were initiated because of government arrears on debt repayments. In 1998, with the clearance of overdue loan payments to the AsDB, lending and TA operations resumed. In August 1998, the AsDB approved a $25 million policy-based program loan and a $1 million TA loan to support the government’s Public Sector Reform Program. The program loan helped finance adjustment costs associated with the reform program, particularly the clearance of government arrears to external and domestic creditors, and separation payments made in 1999 to civil servants. The first tranche of the program loan ($15 million) was disbursed in November 1998. The second tranche of the loan was not released and was eventually cancelled since, subsequent to the ethnic unrest, the new government did not support the program’s objectives. In 2000, the AsDB approved a $10 million post-conflict emergency rehabilitation project loan, which was, however, subsequently suspended due to the government’s failure to repay outstanding interest and debt obligations. After resumption of activities in 1998, AsDB also approved several TA grants for policy advice and project preparation. The suspension of country operations notwithstanding, AsDB operations in the Solomon Islands are guided by the Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium, which was approved and adopted in 2000. Project processing is undertaken by the Pacific Operations Division (POHQ) in the AsDB’s headquarters in Manila, while project implementation is administered largely by the South Pacific Regional Mission (SPRM) located in Port Vila, Vanuatu. POHQ and SPRM are the two operational units under the AsDB’s Office of Pacific Operations.

The quality of data production and dissemination has deteriorated since mid-2000 as a result of ethnic violence and severe budgetary pressures. While there has been some improvement in 2002, significant deficiencies remain. Official consumer price statistics have not been produced since July 2000. While the Central Bank has begun to compile preliminary CPI estimates, there are ongoing problems with data coverage and quality assurance. Shortcomings remain in the compilation of government finance statistics. The CBS1 publishes data on the real, external, and monetary sectors in its Quarterly Review, as well as in its Annual Report. It recently began including fiscal data, but reconciliation with data obtained from the Ministry of Finance remains difficult. There is a Solomon Islands country page in IFS but delays often occur in the transmission of monetary data. Prior to the onset of ethnic violence in 2002, the Solomon Islands received several technical assistance missions from both STA and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC), primarily in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments statistics. The technical assistance identified the critical need for improved resources in all areas of data collection and compilation; improved coordination between producers and users of statistics; and improved record keeping and development of computerized procedures in all areas of government. However, the statistical authorities have noted that, in the absence of a greater commitment of budgetary resources, implementation of technical assistance recommendations will remain problematic. Real sector Estimates of real GDP are produced with significant lags, with the most recent official data available only for 1999. Moreover, the data are mostly employment-based and fail to account for productivity changes. The government has now begun to provide unofficial estimates and near-term projections for GDP. Most data on production of major export commodities are reported with a lag of one year, while data on employment and wages are produced with lags in excess of two years and are quite limited in coverage. Money and banking statistics Monetary statistics are compiled on a weekly basis and are provided to APD with a two to four week lag.

However, the available data still suffer from problems associated with infrequent, inconsistent, delayed, and incorrect postings. The quality of expenditure data suffers particularly from these problems, and there are still inconsistencies in the revenue data reported by Customs and Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Finance, and the central bank. Government finance statistics have not been reported to STA since 1991. External sector Partial quarterly balance of payments data are estimated by the CBS1 on the basis of foreign exchange transactions reported through the banking system and are available with a three- month lag. However, in the absence of supplementary surveys (e.g., on foreign direct investment), such data are deficient in both detail and coverage. Delays tend to occur in the recording of the government’s external debt position. Data on private external debt are not reliable, and data on government debt are not always consistent with balance of payments data on official capital flows. A technical assistance mission which reviewed the balance of payments statistics in June 1998 additionally identified coverage deficiencies in the identification of external debt, particularly external payments arrears, both official and private; the lack of statistics on foreign direct investment; and inaccuracies in the identification of services transactions, official grants and transfers, and other private capital flows. In addition, external debt data are not published in detail on a regular basis. The government intends to document shortly all domestic and external debts and debt arrears.

C. 20431 USA Public Information Notice (PIN) No. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 24,2003 IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with the Solomon Islands On [January 24, 20031, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with the Solomon Islands.’ Background Economic and poverty conditions in the Solomon Islands have deteriorated markedly since the ethnic violence between the citizens of the Guadalcanal and Malaita erupted in mid-1999. Since then, real GDP is estimated to have declined by a cumulative 25 percent, including a fall of 4 percent in 2002. Basic infrastructure has been destroyed and the private sector has shrunk considerably. The confidence of investors has not been restored, despite the Townsville Peace Agreement of October 2000 and the election of a new government in December 2001. Partial data indicate annual inflation is within a 5-10 percent range, although CPI data have not been collected since 2000. The external sector has weakened. Exports in 2002 are estimated at just one-third of their level in 1999, with the complete closure of gold and palm oil concerns, although there has been some modest recovery in timber, fish, and cocoa exports in recent months. External assistance has l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [January 24, 20021 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The economic recession, along with shortages of foreign exchange, has caused imports to drop sharply, thus improving the balance on current account. However, the capital account balance has worsened substantially, because of lower loan disbursements (notwithstanding a $25 million loan from Taiwan, Province of China) and virtually nonexistent foreign direct investment. Central government external debt rose from 37 percent of GDP at end-1999 to an estimated 67 percent at end-2002. There has been a depletion of official international reserves which are now equivalent to only 1.5 months of the compressed level of imports. This has occurred despite the depreciation of the currency in 2002 by 30 percent against the U.S. dollar and 25 percent against the Australian dollar, and the intensification of exchange controls. The central government’s finances have deteriorated considerably since the hostilities began. Preliminary estimates indicate that the overall budget deficit increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1999 to 11 percent of GDP on an accrual basis in 2002 (compared with the budget target of 3 percent). This primarily reflects the failure to control the wage bill, because of the continued employment of special constables, higher police salaries, lack of progress in implementing redundancies, and compensation payments to former militants. As a result, expenditure on education, health, and infrastructure has been squeezed. The deficit was initially financed from the domestic banking system, and domestic and external government debt increased to above 100 percent of GDP. After the statutory limit on central bank credit to government had been breached, along with the unwillingness of commercial banks to purchase government securities, the deficit was financed by an increase in domestic and external arrears which now amount to 19 percent of GDP. More positively, monetary policy has been geared appropriately toward restraining inflation and avoiding further weakness in the external position. Despite the virtual absence of domestic and external financing options, the central bank has refrained in 2002 from extending credit to the government. However, the financial sector is under great strain. The holders of government debt, mostly banks and the National Provident Fund (NPF), have been required to rollover maturing securities at an administratively set interest rate of 3 percent since early 2002 (much less than the originally contracted loans). Nonperforming loans of the Development Bank of Solomon Islands (DBSI) and the National Bank of Solomon Islands (NBSI), the largest commercial bank, have increased substantially.
