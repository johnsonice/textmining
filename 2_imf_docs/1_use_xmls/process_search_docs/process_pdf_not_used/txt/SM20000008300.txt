It has opted for a policy mix of initially boosting public spending on infrastructure and housing, reducing taxes, and promoting tourism and foreign direct investment. At the same time, the authorities seek to restrain the growth in public external debt, which had increased sharply between 1995 and 1997. Thus, the government has begun to privatize the remaining public enterprises to help finance the additional public spending and to raise economic efficiency. The authdrities are also committed to maintaining the exchange rate peg at BZ$2 per US%1 (its level since 1976) to limit inflation. In 1999, economic growth is estimated to have picked up to more than 6 percent from 1.5 percent in 1998, while consumer prices declined by 1 percent (the third consecutive year of moderate price deflation). The public sector borrowing requirement is projected to have narrowed from 6 percent of GDP in 1998/99 (fiscal year begins April 1) to 2.6 percent of GDP in 1999/2000, reflecting a surge in capital revenues (including privatization proceeds) and grants. Net international reserves rose by US$28 million (4 percent of GDP), reflecting in large part privatization proceeds and other external financing to the public sector. Nonetheless, the external position remained weak with gross international reserves amounting to about one and a half months of imports of goods and services at end-1999, and the central bank continued its policy of rationing foreign exchange. In 2000, the authorities expect real economic growth to remain at 6 percent, while consumer prices would rise by 2 percent. Fiscal policy is designed to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement to about 1 percent of GDP in 2000/01, which is expected to help the central bank strengthen its cushion of net international reserves further. The main issue facing the authorities is the sustainability of fiscal policy. A public sector borrowing requirement of about 1 percent of GDP-if sustained over the medium term- would be consistent with no tirther growth in public external debt in relation to GDP and would allow the central bank to stop rationing foreign exchange by strengthening the international reserve cushion. However, the proceeds from privatization are likely to end in one or two years and the staff urged the authorities to rely on permanent sources of fiscal revenue. Also, public support for housing should be limited to no more than a small low- income housing program. The authorities understood that their fiscal policy entails some risk, but felt that they had few other options for promoting faster growth and reducing poverty. With regard to structural reforms, the privatization of the remaining public enterprises is likely to improve the economy’s competitiveness by reducing costs of key services. The authorities reduced the CARICOM maximum common external tariff from 25 percent to 20 percent in April 2000, but the trade system remains fairly restrictive. The authorities agreed that supervision of both onshore and offshore financial institutions should be strengthened.

A mission visited Belize in the period November 29iDecember 10, 1999 and April 18-19, 2000 to conduct the discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation. ’ It met with the Prime Minister; the Minister of the Budget, the Governor of the Central Bank of Belize, senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector. Belize accepted the obligations under Article VIII in 1983, and its last arrangement from the Fund ended in 1 986s2 2. At the conclusion of the 1998 Article IV consultation on August 28, 1998, Executive Directors noted that the fiscal measures adopted by the authorities in 1993-96 had made a start toward correcting Belize’s fiscal and external imbalances and had helped contain the weakening in the foreign reserve position and improve confidence. However, Directors were concerned that corrective measures were not sustained in 1997, when the fiscal deficit widened again and the public sector’s recourse to central bank financing was large. They stressed the importance of strengthening without delay the fiscal and external positions on a sustained basis, refraining from borrowing on commercial terms or using proceeds from privatization to finance the deficit, and accelerating structural reforms to enhance economic efficiency. II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 3. Belize is a small open economy, with imports of goods and nonfactor services equivalent to about 60 percent of GDP. It experienced a decline in real economic growth from over IO percent a year in the period 1987-92 to about 2% percent a year in the period 1993-98 (Figure 1). Factors behind the growth slowdown included the departure in 1994 of British troops, which spent the equivalent of 4 percent of GDP a year, slower growth in tourism and weaker world prices for bananas. The current government has designed its economic policy with a view to reducing poverty through high rates of economic growth, investment in human capital, and the introduction of well-targeted anti-poverty programs. To achieve this, it has opted for a policy mix of initially boosting public spending on infrastructure and housing, reducing taxes, promoting tourism, and foreign direct investment. This fiscal policy contributed to an increase in gross domestic investment from 20 percent of GDP in 1995 to 23 percent of GDP in 1998 and to a moderate decline in national savings from 18 percent of GDP in 1995 to 17 percent of GDP in 1998. At the same time, the authorities ’ The mission consisted of Messrs. Rennhack (Head), Gil-Diaz, Villafuerte, Ms. Zermefio (all WI-ID), and Mr. Visconti (IBRD). 2 Relations with the Fund, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank are presented in Appendices I-IV, respectively.

Thus, the government has begun to privatize the remaining public enterprises to help finance the additional capital spending and to raise economic efficiency. The authorities are also committed to maintaining the exchange rate peg at BZ%Z per US%1 (its level since 1976) to keep inflation under control. 4. Economic growth is estimated to have picked up from 1.5 percent in 1998 to 6.2 percent in 1999, led by increased output in agriculture, fishing, and construction (Table 1). National savings declined to about 16 percent of GDP in 1999, reflecting a deterioration in public savings, while investment rose to 24 percent of GDP. Consumer prices declined by 1 percent during 1999, the third consecutive year of moderate price deflation. Over this period, prices declined in most categories of consumer goods, especially food items, transportation and communication, and clothing items, and this trend reflected in part a significant decline in import prices in 1997 and 1998 (Statistical Appendix Tables 25 and 38). The Belize dollar depreciated in real effective terms by about 4% percent from end- 1997 to end-1999 (Figure 2). 5. The public sector borrowing requirement is projected to have narrowed from 6 percent of GDP in 1998/99 (fiscal year begins April 1) to 2.6 percent of GDP in 1999/2000, reflecting a surge in capital revenues and grants (Table 2).3 Public savings are projected to have declined to 2.2 percent of GDP in 1999/2000, as tax restructuring reduced central government’s current revenues (Table 3). In April 1999, the authorities replaced the value- added tax of 15 percent with a sales tax of 8 percent (12 percent for most fuel and luxury items) and lowered income, business, and excise tax rates. The central government’s current expenditures are projected to have declined to 19 percent of GDP, based in part on a wage increase of 3 percent in 1999/2000. Public investment is expected to have declined to 11 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the privatization of the Belize Electricity Board (BEL) in October 1999.4 Capital revenues and grants are projected to have risen to over 6 percent of GDP, including proceeds of about 2% percent of GDP from the privatization of BEL and grants from Taiwan Province of China (equivalent to 1% percent of GDP). 6. Net domestic assets of the central bank declined by BZ$38 million in 1999 (44 percent of currency issue at end-1998), reflecting largely a significant build-up of deposits by the nonfinancial public sector (Table 4). Currency issue expanded by 20 percent, and contributed to strong growth in broad money. At the same time, the growth in bank credit 3 In their presentation of the fiscal accounts, the authorities record privatization proceeds as capital revenue, and not as a financing item. 4 In 1998/99 capital expenditure by BEL amounted to about 2% percent of GDP and its net borrowing requirement was about 1% percent of GDP.

Nominal deposit interest rates have averaged about 6 percent for the past several years, reflecting mostly the minimum interest rate of 4% percent required on passbook savings accounts, while nominal lending rates have stayed at about 16 percent. The wide spread between deposit and lending interest rates reflects several factors, including high liquid asset and reserve requirements and high operating costs of the domestic banking system.5 7. The external current account deficit rose from over 6 percent of GDP in 1998 to an estimated 8 percent of GDP in 1999, based on strong growth in imports of machinery and fitel (Table 5). Net capital inflows almost tripled to 12 percent of GDP, reflecting in part privatization proceeds, financing from Taiwan Republic of China, and sales abroad of the government’s mortgage portfoli~.~ Net international reserves increased by US$28 million (4 percent of GDP). By end-1999, gross international reserves amounted to about one and a half months of imports of goods and services (about 60 percent of base money plus outstanding public sector domestic securities). Public and publicly guaranteed external debt declined to about 37 percent of GDP. In January 1999, Belize’s long-term government foreign currency bonds received a rating of Ba2 from Moody’s, The central bank continued its policy of rationing foreign exchange, making funds available to cover payments abroad for essential items, such as food, fuel and insurance, while delaying sales of foreign exchange to cover other foreign exchange demands, including for certain current international transactions. Reports indicated that the parallel market exchange rate had depreciated to BZ$2.25-2.3 per US%1 by end-1999 but then appreciated to BZ$2.05-2.10 per US$l by April 2000, reflecting the effect of seasonal fluctuations in the supply of foreign exchange. IIL , POLICY DISCUSSIONS 8. In the discussions, the authorities espressed the view that their strategy was beginning to bear fruit, as evidenced by the sharp pick up in economic growth in 1999. They expected real growth in 2000 to remain at 6 percent, on the projected continued strength of agriculture, fishing, and construction, while consumer prices were seen to rise by 2 percent, broadly in line with inflation in trading partner countries. Fiscal policy is designed to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement to about 1 percent of GDP in 2000/01. Net domestic assets of the central bank are projected to contract further, and net international 5 The factors behind this spread were analyzed in Belize--Recent Economic Developments (W/98/198), August 3, 1998. 6 The government sold abroad mortgages that had been issued by the Ministry of Housing and the former Reconstruction Development Corporation (RECONDEV) of Belmopan to finance houses that had been built by these agencies. The proceeds of these sales are recorded as financing because the government is guaranteeing the mortgages.

The privatization program will continue both as a’ means to generate resources for the government’s investment program as well as to strengthen the economy’s competitiveness by reducing costs of key services over time. 9. The staff commented that the main policy issue facing the authorities is the sustainability of fiscal policy. According to staff projections, the level of the public sector borrowing requirement envisaged for 2000/01, if sustained over the medium term, would be consistent with no tirther growth in external public debt in relation to GDP. This fiscal position would also permit a strengthening of the external position and allow the central bank to stop rationing foreign exchange. However, the staff expressed concern about the reliance on temporary resources, such as privatization proceeds, to limit the borrowing requirement, and doubted whether this approach to fiscal policy was sustainable. The authorities realized that the revenues from privatization were likely to end in one or two years, but expected a compensating expansion in tax revenues, as recent investment projects in citrus, shrimp farming, tourism, and other areas would boost real GDP growth to 9 percent by 2002. Also, many of the public investment projects could be scaled back if the strong revenue growth failed to materialize. The authorities understood that this approach entailed some risk, but felt they had few options for achieving their principal goal of reducing poverty. The staff argued that it would be more prudent to set medium-term fiscal policy on the assumption of a more modest rate of growth, say an average of 5 percent a year, and to rely on permanent sources of revenue. A. Fiscal Policy 10. The ZOOO/Ol budget calls for a decline in the public sector borrowing requirement to slightly more than 1 percent of GDP, as public savings would rise moderately while investment would fall by over 2 percent of GDP. This would allow the public sector to build up net deposits in the banking system equivalent to 2% percent of GDP, with net external financing projected at almost 4 percent of GDP. 11. With regard to the central government, the budget restrains the growth of current spending by freezing purchases of goods and services and transfers to the private sector in nominal terms and limiting the general wage increase to 3 percent Capital spending is expected to fall significantly in relation to GDP in 2000/01, reflecting the completion of a number of short-term, domestically-financed projects. The investment program includes projects supported by multilateral creditors, including construction of several major highways, a low-income housing program as well as projects to prepare Belize to deal with natural disasters. Current revenues are projected to rise to about 21% percent of GDP, as revenue collection under the new tax structure improves.’ Capital revenues and grants were ’ In the early months of 1999/2000, income tax retinds were based on the previous higher effective tax rates, while receipts of this tax were based on the new lower effective tax rates.

All in all, the borrowing requirement of the central government is projected to decline to 1.2 percent of GDP, from 2.9 percent of GDP in 1999/2000. 12. The overall position of the nonfinancial public enterprises is expected to remain in balance. Their current surplus and investment would fall as a share of GDP, reflecting the transfer of BEL to the private sector in October 1999 and the expected divestment of the water authority by December 2000. The modest level of investment in 2000/01 reflects routine improvements by the port authority, and the extension of the pipelines and upgrade of pumping stations by the water authority, with financing from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). The airport authority recently finished a major expansion of the terminal and a new runway, and is not expected to implement any new projects in 2000/01. The surplus of the Social Security Board (SSB) is expected to decline slightly in relation to GDP, as the number of retirees increases gradually. 13. In discussing the fiscal outlook for 2000/01, the authorities believed they would be able to achieve the public sector borrowing requirement of about 1 percent of GDP, even if real GDP were to rise by less than 6 percent, because they expected tax revenues to remain buoyant. They are taking steps to improve the performance of the civil service, where high turnover and inefficiency are serious problems. They recently converted all permanent secretaries into chief executive officers, who can be dismissed for poor performance, and intend to extend this reform to middle managers. They also want to establish a closer link between pay and performance. The authorities felt it was important to introduce private sector discipline into the public workforce, even though they agreed there was a risk that these steps would politicize the civil service. They mentioned that a recent actuarial study showed that the social security system was on a solid financial footing. They are developing legislation (that is to be submitted to parliament by mid-2000) that raises benefits and contributions, which have been fixed in nominal terms for many years, and that raises the employees’ share of the contribution. As part of this reform, the government wants to shift civil servants, who currently participate in their own noncontributory plan, to the social security system. The authorities said the budget for 2000/01 included the current year costs of this reform. 14. The authorities saw housing as the most pressing social need, as many poor people live in temporary shelters. They intend to invest about 1 percent of GDP in 2000/01 in low-income housing. In addition, they are helping finance a plan to make substantial VAT rebates continued but receipts of this tax stopped. Also, revenues from the sales tax were unusually low in its first few months of operation. * Grants from Taiwan POC were unusually high in 1999/2000, when the annual disbursement for 1998/99 came in 1999/2000.

The authorities explained that the government would finance the initial round of construction of these houses by on-lending external financing, mainly from a US$SO million soft loan (disbursed over five years) from Taiwan POC as well as some commercial borrowing, to the government-owned Development Finance Corporation and other financial institutions. The government intends to leverage this initial financing by securitizing and selling mortgages from the first round of construction on the regional secondary market and using the proceeds to finance the construction of the next round of construction. The securitized mortgages carry a government guarantee of the underlying mortgage. They plan to repeat this process until all houses were built, They estimated the cost ofthe construction of 10,000 houses could be substantial, perhaps as much as US$150-200 million (roughly 20-30 percent of annual GDP). The staff agreed on the desirability of addressing the need for low-income housing. However, the plan to build up to 10,000 houses was over-ambitious, unclear in many respects and would strain severely the public finances and the external debt position. Moreover, in Belize mortgages with government involvement have had high delinquency rates in the past, and the government could well end up with substantial losses. B. Credit Policy 15. The central bank projects that its net domestic assets will contract by about BZ$30 million, based on the expected build up of public sector deposits in the central bank. This, in turn, would help the central bank gain US$l8 million in net international reserves. The central bank will receive technical assistance funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to help develop a quarterly credit program, with a view to strengthening the conduct of credit policy, and would appreciate staff comments on this program, after it has been developed. The only instruments of credit policy-besides movements in public sector deposits -are the reserve and liquid asset requirements. Since late 1998, the central bank has lowered the cash reserve and expanded the range of assets that would satisfy the liquid asset requirement, with a view to narrowing the spread between deposit and lending interest rates, but has proceeded caretilly to avoid an excessive credit expansion.’ The staff supported the gradual reduction in the cash reserve requirement, but noted that the steps to widen the range of acceptable liquid assets are an attempt to influence relative interest rates and would distort bank lending decisions. The staff noted that a substantial reduction in the liquid asset requirement would be more effective in narrowing the intermediation spread, but that this approach would require a stronger fiscal policy. The 9 In November 1998, the reserve requirement on eligible deposits was lowered from 7 percent to 5 percent, and banks were allowed to count mortgages for up to 5 percentage points of the liquid asset requirement on eligible deposits. In June 1999, the mortgage interest rate charged by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was lowered from 13 to 12 percent. In April 2000, the central bank allowed banks to reduce their cash reserve requirement by 1 percent point if these funds were channeled to loans to the productive sector, which would be allowed to count towards the liquid asset requirement.

External Sector 16. Based on the envisaged savings-investment position of the public sector, the external current account deficit is projected to narrow moderately to about 73/4 percent of GDP in 2000. Recent foreign investment projects are projected to boost exports of shrimp and citrus products, while imports are projected to rise in line with GDP, as a pick up in private investment is likely to offset the decline in public investment. Also, tourist receipts and net transfers are expected to rise. Net capital inflows are projected to remain above 10 percent of GDP, based on continued strong inflows to the public sector and a moderate slowdown in private capital inflows. External public and publicly guaranteed debt would stay at 37% percent of GDP, with service on that debt amounting to 10 percent of exports of good and nonfactor services. The US%18 million overall balance of payments surplus would boost gross reserves to about two months of imports of goods and services (70 percent of base money and public sector securities). 17. In discussing exchange rate policy, the authorities reaffrrmed that their most important policy commitment was to maintain the exchange rate peg at its current level to provide an anchor for confidence. The staff commented that the foreign exchange rationing raised questions about whether the level of the exchange rate was appropriate. The authorities explained that the central bank-at times- has given priority to essential items when selling foreign exchange to commercial banks. They complained that banks were hoarding foreign exchange, and for this reason the central bank established in 1995 a surrender requirement on sugar export receipts to ensure that the public sector could make its foreign exchange payments. Nonetheless, they agreed that-in the end-the need for rationing and the surrender requirement reflected the effects of fiscal policy. They stressed that all requests for foreign exchange were eventually satisfied and that they were making every effort to shorten the queue for foreign exchange. The statf said that this ad hoc rationing has, at times, resulted in undue delays in payments, giving rise to temporary payment arrears and to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval. D. Structural Policies 18. The authorities intend to privatize the water, port, and airport authorities-the remaining public enterprises-by 2003 through a transparent open-bidding procedure. This policy is designed to raise revenues to cover investment expenditures and to help reduce costs and improve the economy’s competitiveness. The cost of electricity, ports, water, and telecommunication services in Belize are generally much higher than in the rest of Central America. (Table 6). In August 1999, the Public Utilities Commission was established, and will regulate three public utilities-electricity, telecommunications, and water and sewage. The authorities noted that the recently privatized BEL is required to reduce its electricity tariffs by 15 percent by 2003, and expected to adopt regulations that reduced the cost of port and airport services and water following the sale of these three enterprises. The staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - recommended the phase out of the monopoly granted to Belize Telecommunications Limited (BTL), which was fitlly privatized in 1992. 19. The authorities reduced the CARICOM maximum common external tariff rate from 25 to 20 percent in April 2000. Nonetheless, Belize’s trade system remains fairly restrictive, with an average import tariff of over 11 percent and import licenses required for 29 groups, mostly food items (Table 7). Many imports receive exemptions from import duties. Belize is continuing to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with several countries, including Mexico and the other countries in Central America. 20. The authorities agreed that supervision of both onshore and offshore financial institutions should be strengthened. While nonperforming loans of commercial banks are reported to be low,” the central bank’s supervisory department is severely understaffed and unable to enforce the existing banking law and regulations.” In addition, credit unions are subject to very weak regulation, while building societies and the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) (which has sizable nonperforming loans) are completely unregulated. The staff recommended that the central bank strengthen its supervisory department, and aim to conduct annual on-site inspections of each bank. The authorities supported this suggestion, and expressed interest in receiving technical assistance from MAE in this area.12 The staff also recommended that the central bank be given the authority to supervise all onshore financial institutions. The authorities agreed in principle, but were concerned that this step would face strong political opposition. 21. The offshore financial sector, which consists of one offshore bank and over 10,000 registered companies, needs closer supervision, The authorities are of the view that this sector has the potential of significantly contributing to economic growth, and secured passage in 1999 of legislation that broadened the range of offshore financial institutions operating in Belize. They agreed that supervision of this sector could be improved. They intend to modify the law for offshore banks to include the conditions now required by license. They also plan to establish a mechanism to supervise more closely the use of bearer shares, which conceal the identity of the owners and make it possible for residents to conduct financial transactions through offshore institutions. The staff commented that it would also be important for the central bank to conduct on-site inspections of the one offshore bank lo Nonperforming loans are reported at 3.1 percent of total loans in September 1999. l1 The Banks and Financial Institutions Act of 1996 strengthened the regulatory authority of the central bank and established prudential regulations in line with core principles as recommended by the Base1 Committee (W/97/100). I2 MAE offered to provide this assistance in 1999, but the central bank needs to hire a manager for its banking supervision department, who would be the counterpart for MAE experts.

A 1998 MAE technical assistancemission reviewed this law and felt it provided sufficient safeguards.: 22. Belize’s poverty and social indicators compare favorably with neighboring countries (Table 8), although poverty affects indigenous groups in the south more severely. In 1996 the poverty assessment conducted by the Caribbean Development Bank and the government estimated that 33 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, while about 13 percent were considered extremely p00r.l~ The authorities’ poverty alleviation and reduction strategy aims to lower poverty ratio to 28 percent by 2004 through policies to raise economic growth and employment and to improve access to and quality of social services. The authorities are developing a lo-year project with support from the World Bank, to improve education through several actions, including improving teacher training, and continuing to reform the curriculum. The authorities are preparing a health sector reform with the support of the Inter-American Development Bark, that will, inter alia, establish a national health insurance plan to cover personal health care. 23. Environmental protection is a key concern of the authorities, especially because the extensive tropical forests and large coral reef are the main tourist attraction. The authorities’ five year action plan includes an assessment of land use and natural resources; guidelines to control tourism development along the coast; a program to reduce land based sources of pollution; and the development of proper solid waste management. The authorities have been working with the IDB and the United Kingdom to resolve land tenure and forestry issues. E. Statistical Issues 24. Belize reports economic data to the Fund with some delays, and the quality of economic statistics in most areas needs strengthening (Appendix V). The consumer price index is prepared quarterly and is based on an outdated survey of consumption patterns. The national income accounts are based on 1984 weights. The operations of the public enterprises and a financial survey including credit unions are reported with a long lag. The data on public investment spending include outlays for operations and maintenance. Balance of payments data have much room for improvement. In particular, tourism statistics suffer from inconsistencies in reporting from different sources. The authorities attributed these diffkulties to the high turnover among qualified staff in the public sector and would appreciate technical assistance in improving the quality of their economic statistics. I3 The poverty line was estimated at BZ$1,288 a year, while the extreme poverty line was estimated at BZ$75 1 a year.

The staff presented an illustrative scenario based on the assumption that real economic growth would average 5 percent a year in the period 2001-05, with an important objective being to increase international reserves and ease the exchange restriction. Inflation would stay in line with imported inflation, which was projected at about 1 percent a year. This. scenario envisaged that the overall public sector borrowing requirement would remain at 1 percent of GDP, with external financing of 2% percent of GDP (Table 9). Moreover, the government would support only a small, well-targeted low-income housing program. With this fiscal path, external public debt would remain at about 37 percent of GDP and service on that debt would decline to about 9 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. The staff noted that it would be particularly important to monitor closely external borrowing on commercial terms, because debt service-while still comfortable in relation to exports-was equivalent to one fifth of central government current revenues. 26. The staff noted that this path for the fiscal deficit would require a significant increase in public savings or a sharp slowdown in public investment over the next two years, as capital revenues were projected to decline sharply in relation to GDP. The government could achieve the required fiscal adjustment through a combination of expenditure cutting and revenue enhancing measures. The central government should be more selective in choosing investment projects, especially by trimming its involvement in housing construction. Public sector wage increases should be reduced in view of the extremely low inflation. The incidence of import-duty and other discretionary tax exemptions should be minimized, which could boost tax revenues by as much as 1% to 2 percent of GDP. Likewise, it might be appropriate to reverse some of the tax cuts adopted in 1999/2000. 27. The strengthening of the financial position of the nonfinancial public sector would provide the resources for an improvement in gross official international reserves say, to three months of imports of goods and services (and above 150 percent of base money and public sector securities) by 2005. The external current account deficit would decline to 5% percent of GDP by 2005, as public savings rises and public investment falls in relation to GDP (Table 10). A stronger fiscal policy would also help narrow the spread between deposit and lending interest rates, by allowing for a gradual reduction in the liquid asset requirement, and enable the central bank to stop rationing foreign exchange. At the same time, the privatization of the remaining public enterprises would help raising external competitiveness. Limiting the growth in public wages and keeping the lid on the minimum wage growth could also contribute to strengthening of competitiveness. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 28. The economy performed well in 1999, with strong economic growth, no inflationary pressures and an accumulation of net international reserves. Fiscal policy in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- 1999/2000 has slowed the expansion in external public debt in relation to GDP, and the privatization program has the potential of helping to reduce costs in the economy over time. The government’s ongoing efforts to develop key infrastructure (such as the national road network), improve health and education, and protect the environment also will help lay the foundation for growth over the medium term. The prospects for 2000 appear favorable, but it will be crucial to achieve the planned reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement, even if real GDP growth is less than the 6 percent projected by the authorities. 29. However, the staff has serious concerns about whether the authorities’ approach to fiscal policy can be sustained. The proceeds from the privatization process are expected to come to an end in one or two years, leaving a sizable fiscal gap. While a strong pickup in economic growth is desirable, it would be more prudent to base medium-term fiscal policy on more cautious assumptions about real GDP growth, which would imply the need for a much stronger public savings position and a more conservative public investment program. Possible fiscal measures would include a smaller increase in public sector wages, reductions in import duty and other tax exemptions, and reversing some of the tax cuts of 1999/2000. Dropping projects that have relatively low rates of return could help scale back the investment program. To put fiscal policy on a strong footing, it will be important to have a strong civil service. In this regard, it will be important to guard against the risk that the recent reforms will make the civil service political and less efficient. 30. The plan to help finance the construction of as much as 10,000 houses carries serious risks. The government’s plan to sell securitized mortgages on the regional secondary market will add significantly to the economy’s external liabilities, making the country even more vulnerable following the widening of the external current account deficit in recent years, It is unclear how the private sector will generate sufficient savings over the medium term to service these obligations. The government’s guarantee of the underlying mortgages creates even more doubts about the sustainability of the fiscal policy. Moreover, the plan is not transparent. Public support for housing should be limited to no more than a small, well- focused low-income housing program. 31. A stronger savings-investment position of the nonfinancial public sector would support sustainable economic growth through several channels. First, it would help the central bank accumulate more net international reserves and would eliminate the need for foreign exchange rationing, which harms the incentives for private sector investment and growth. The second channel is that stronger public savings would support a gradual reduction in the liquid asset requirement, which should lower lending interest rates. Finally, while the exchange rate peg has provided a usefL1 nominal anchor, a stronger fiscal position, together with the completion of the privatization program and wage restraint, is essential to allow the peg to remain at its current level. 32. The capacity of the central bank to supervise commercial banks needs to be strengthened, and the authorities’ interest in receiving technical assistance from MAE to improve the central bank’s supervisory department is welcome. It would be important to enact legislation that would give the central bank supervisory authority over credit unions Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- and other nonbank financial intermediaries. The offshore financial sector also needs closer supervision. 33. The reduction in the CARICOM maximum tariff rate from 25 percent to 20 percent will move the trade system in the right direction. However, the level of tariffs is still high, and the trade system remains restrictive. It will be important to continue the effort by scaling back the number of imports that require a license, reducing import duty exemptions and lowering tariffs further. 34. The staff notes that the ad hoc rationing of foreign currency sales by the central bank constitutes an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VILI. As the authorities do not have a clear timetable for phasing out this restriction, Fund approval for its retention is not recommended. 35. Belize’s statistical information is weak and complicates the effective monitoring of economic developments. However, the staff notes the authorities’ strong interest in receiving technical assistance to improve the quality of economic statistics. 36. The next Article IV consultation with Belize is expected to be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- Table 1.

Outstanding statistical issues In general, the quality, coverage, and timeliness of Belize’s statistical information permit an adequate monitoring of economic developments. However, there are some shortcomings in national accounts, prices, external trade and debt, government finance, and labor statistics, The authorities have indicated that they would be interested in receiving technical assistance in all these areas. The Central Bank of Belize publishes a quarterly bulletin covering developments in the real, fiscal, monetary, and external sectors, as well as an annual report and a statistical digest. 2. External debt There are discrepancies between the data reported by the central bank and those reported by the ministry of finance, particularly with respect to gross external disbursements to the central government. In addition, the data reported by the central bank and the ministry of finance on the external debt of the public enterprises are incomplete and inconsistent with the information provided by the public enterprises. The authorities are seeking to reduce the discrepancies and inconsistencies by fostering greater cooperation among the agencies involved. 3. Balance of payments The compilation of Belize’s balance of payments is based on the fourth edition of the Balance of PaymentsMmuuZ @PA.&). Belize is one of the few countries in the Western Hemisphere that has not made the transition to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPA43’). As for the coverage, currentness and reporting of data for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY), Belize has reported annual data on balance of payments statistics albeit with some lags. The most recent complete data reported on balance of payments refer to 1998. 4. Real sector With respect to the national accounts, the central statistical office does not produce GDP data by sector at market prices. The CPI market basket is based on a household expenditure survey conducted from June 1990 through March 199 1 and needs to be updated, as does the reference base which currently is November 1999. Also, the CPI is calculated only four times a year (February, May, August, and November), with a lag of about three months.
