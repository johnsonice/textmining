EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Macroeconomic developments have been relatively lackluster in 1998 and 1999, following a period of strong growth and improved inflation performance in 1996 and 1997. Annual growth stood at 3 percent in both 1998 and 1999, while twelve-month period inflation rose to about 11 percent at end-1999. While there was some improvement in the current account in 1999 (with the deficit declining to about 14 percent of GDP), gross international reserves remained at alow level (1.5 months of imports of goods). Georgia continues to experience difficulties in servicing its debt. In 1999, financial policies were adversely impacted by the continued fiscal problems. With little fiscal adjustment relative to 1998, the fiscal stance for 1999 was significantly looser than envisaged in the program. The expected improvement in revenue collections did not materialize; Georgia continues to have one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the BR0 countries. There were substantial overruns in expenditure commitments which, in conjunction with revenue shortfalls relative to the program targets, led to an additional accumulation of expenditure arrears in 1999. While monetary policy remained prudent in the first eight months of 1999, increased pressure from the weak fiscal position and the run-up of the parliamentary elections led to a rapid expansion of net credit to government from the central bank in the last four months of 1999. In terms of the structural agenda, there was further progress in banking sector reform and, to some extent, in privatization in 1999. However, the energy sector continues to face significant difficulties, with repeated power outages and increasingly large debts. There is an urgent need to address the weak and unsustainable fiscal position, and thus provide a better mix between fiscal and monetary policies. The draft 2000 budget envisages an adjustment of about 2% percent of GDP on a commitments basis relative to 1999. However, the staff viewed this as insufficient and recommended a more ambitious fiscal adjustment. With envisaged revenue measures yielding a significant, albeit realistic, improvement in tax collections, most of this additional adjustment would need to come from a fundamental reassessment of the size and scope of government. With governance and corruption being significant problems in Georgia, the authorities will also need to take bold corrective steps in these areas. With increasing external debt service obligations in 2000 and beyond, Georgia’s external debt servicing capacity suggests the need for another round of rescheduling. In the absence of significant financial and structural reforms, the medium-term prospects are bleak. The staff stands ready to assist the authorities in designing an appropriate economic program that would merit the support of the Fund.

The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions were conducted by missions that visited Tbilisi during the periods September 9-22,1999 and December l-14,1999.’ * Over the same period, discussions were held with the authorities on an economic program that could be supported by a successor arrangement under the PRGF; however, these discussions on an eventual arrangement have not yet been concluded. In addition, a staff visit focussing largely on the 2000 budget took place during January 19-27,200O. 2. The 1998 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 27,1998. At that time, Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to stabilize the economy and implement structural reforms. They stressed the importance of stronger fiscal adjustment, the mobilization of additional tax revenue, and the elimination of expenditure arrears. In addition, they emphasized the need to continue with a prudent monetary policy, press ahead with the structural reform program, and reach an appropriate rescheduling agreement with Turkmenistan as soon as possible. Georgia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement on December 20, 1996. Georgia’s exchange system remains free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Georgia also maintains a liberal system with regard to capital account transactions. 3. The three-year arrangement under the ESAF, which was approved on February 28,1996, expired on August 13,1999. After some delay, the mid-term review under the third annual ESAF arrangement was completed on July 23,1999. In the context of the mid-term review, the authorities requested continued Fund support of their economic program. Executive Directors reiterated the need to bring revenues to a level at which expenditure commitments could be covered and strongly emphasized that receiving ’ The staff representatives met with President Shervardnadze; State Minister Mr. Lordkipanidze; Deputy State Minister Mr. Chkhartishvili; the Chairman of the Parliament, Mr. Zhvania; the Minister of Finance, Mr. Onoprishvili; the Minister of Economy, Mr. Papava; the President of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), Mr. Managadze; the President’s Advisor on Economic Reform, Mr. Basilia; and other senior of‘ficials, donors, and representatives of civil society, and of the banking and business, communities. * On one or both of the missions, the staff representatives were Mr. van der Mensbrugghe (head), Mr. Tsibouris, Ms. Bassett, Mr. Hartley (all EU2), Messrs. Barnett and Baunsgaard (FAD), Mr. Srinivasan (PDR), and Ms. Marton (BLS). Mr. Lane, the resident representative, assisted the mission. Mr. Odling-Smee participated in some of the policy discussions in December 1999.

Georgia has received significant financial and technical assistance support from international financial institutions. At end-January 2000, Georgia’s outstanding use of Fund resources amounted to SDR 228.2 million (about US$308 million), equivalent to 15 1.9 percent of quota (Appendix I). Through end-December 1999, outstanding use of World Bank credits to Georgia totaled USS358.3 million, including three Structural Adjustment Credits, an Energy Structural Adjustment Credit, and project loans (Appendix II). Relations with the EBRD are summarized in Appendix III. 5. The quality and coverage of several categories of economic statistics remain very weak. As part of their effort to address some of these weaknesses, the authorities have recently revised the nominal GDP data. The new estimates of nominal GDP are about 34 percent lower than the previously published data, mainly because of a revision of the estimates for informal activities from about 40 percent of GDP to about 25 percent.3 This revision and other statistical issues are discussed in Appendix IV. 6. The party of President Shevardnadze, Citizens’ Union of Georgia (CUG), strengthened its commanding position by winning an outright majority in the parliamentary elections in October 1999. The CUG came very close to obtaining two thirds of the parliamentary seats, which is the majority required for constitutional amendments. Presidential elections are scheduled for April 9,200O. III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCEUNDERTHE THIRD ANNUAL ESAP ARRANGEMENT A. Growth, Inflation, and External Developments 7. Overall output and price developments were broadly in line with the program in 1999, despite the significant fiscal problems that Georgia has been facing. Following real growth in the double digits during 1996-97, the Georgian economy grew by an estimated 3 percent a year in 1998 and 1999 (Table 1 and Figure 1). In 1999, growth was mainly attributable to agriculture (which had been adversely affected by a drought in 1998), transport and communications, and services. Industrial production remained broadly unchanged, while construction in the formal sector declined sharply, in large part due to the completion of the “early oil” pipeline connecting Azerbaijan to the Black Sea and of the Supsa oil terminal. 3An STA mission in December 1999 determined that the revised data were basically sound, though a number of minor improvements were recommended.

Following the depreciation of the lari at end-1998, inflation was quickly brought under control in the early months of 1999 (Figure 2). Owing to both seasonal factors and a more accommodating monetary policy, monthly inflation picked up towards the end of the year; the 12-month rate of inflation in 1999 was 10.9 percent. A freeze of wages in the public sector during 1999 helped contain inflationary pressures, as did the fact that a significant amount of spending was not paid in cash, but was added to budgetary arrears. In the private sector, real wages declined by about 9 percent in the first half of 1999. Average wages in U.S. dollars have remained relatively low when compared to other countries in the region and in the BR0 (Figure 3). Recorded unemployment stood at an estimated rate of 13 percent (IL0 standard definition) in 1999, with urban areas registering significantly higher rates of unemployment. 9. The current account deficit declined from 17.5 percent of GDP in 1998 to an estimated 14.1 percent in 1999. The sharp decline in imports (by 13 percent) was primarily attributable to the slowdown in pipeline-related imports following the completion of the project in early 1999. Following a sharp depreciation of in the last quarter of 1998, the real effective exchange rate appreciated, bringing the rate broadly back to the level of 1997 and the first part of 1998. B. Fiscal and Monetary Developments 10. Since the final review of the ESAF arrangement in July 1999, the macroeconomic program has veered increasingly off-track, with continued problems in the fiscal area that spilled over, in the second half of 1999, into the monetary program.

The overall deficit of the general government on a commitment basis was estimated at 6.7 percent of GDP in 1999, compared with a program target of 2.8 percent of GDP and a deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP in 1998 (Table 2 and Figure 4). On a cash basis, however, the overall deficit remained at about 5 percent of GDP, broadly the same level as in 1998. While the original 1999 budget and program envisaged a reduction of expenditure arrears of lari 90 million (1.6 percent of GDP), expenditure arrears actually increased by an estimated lari 95 million during the year (Figure 5). The stock of expenditure arrears reached an estimated 4.2 percent of GDP at the end .of 1999, the majority of which comprised arrears on wages, pensions, and social allowances. 12. The expected improvement in revenue collections did not materialize in 1999, and Georgia continues to have one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the BR0 countries (Figure 3). Despite significant measures in both tax policy and tax administration over the past few years, general government tax revenues have remained broadly unchanged at about 13-14 percent of GDP in the period 1997-99. The envisaged revenue improvement in 1999 continued to be hampered by administrative difftculties and by a lack of sufficient political will to collect taxes. However, the authorities did abolish tax offsets in mid-l 999. Box 1. Revenue Developments in 1999 After some initial delays, the authorities introduced a number of key tax policy measures in 1999, particularly in the area of cigarette taxation. Excise stamps on domestic and imported cigarettes were introduced in April 1999, and the combined specific taxes (in lieu of excise and VAT) were increased in April 1999 and January 2000 (in line with commitments made in EBS/99/123). Despite these measures, there was a significant revenue shortfall relative to what was envisaged in the 1999 budget, which was largely due to the disappointing collection of indirect taxes, particularly by the State Customs Department. At the same time, the collection of direct taxes, while reaching budget targets, remained at a disappointingly low level of 2.9 percent of GDP. Nontax revenues declined by 1.1 percent of GDP to reach an estimated 0.9 percent of GDP in 1999, in large part due to the inability of the NBG to transfer any profits to the budget. Efforts to collect taxes waned in the second half of 1999, with overall tax revenue collections falling short of the target by 16.2 percent. Over the same period, tax collections on cigarettes and petroleum were some 50 and 42 percent below their respective targets. The strong collection of cigarette revenue early in 1999 subsequently turned out to have been somewhat distorted by advance sales of excise stamps, which later in the year resulted in very low monthly cigarette tax collections. The expected improvement in customs collections, after the initiation of preshipment inspections (PSI) in August 1999, did not materialize due, in part, it would seem, to insufficient cooperation between the State Customs Department and the contracted PSI fhm. 13. There were substantial overruns in expenditure commitments in 1999. The expenditure adjustment of 2 percent of GDP, as envisaged in the 1999 program, did not materialize. Underspending on central government goods and services and capital spending could not fully offset the overspending on subsidies and transfers by the central government Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-11- Figure 4.

There were also outlays on items that were not authorized in the original budget, but which were regularized in a budget amendment in December 1999. 14. Poverty is a significant problem in Georgia, and the system of social protection remains rudimentary and inadequate. The most recent available data indicate that the incidence of poverty (using a poverty line set at 40 percent of median consumption) rose from 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 to 10.2 percent in the third quarter of 1998. In addition, sharp increase in expenditure arrears, particularly on wages, pensions, and social allowance, in 1998 and 1999 has had a direct adverse impact on the incidence of poverty. 15. Monetary policy remained prudent for the first eight months of 1999, supporting the floating exchange rate that was adopted at the end of 1998. With a tight rein on NDA during the first eight months of 1999, the expansion of reserve money was due to higher NFA, reflected in the increase in gross reserves. Bolstered by World Bank and IMF disbursements and by purchases of foreign exchange by the NBG in the third quarter of 1999, freely usable gross international reserves strengthened and stood at US$17 1 million at end-August 1999, compared to US$118 million at end-l 998. 16. Starting in September 1999, increased pressure from the weak fiscal position and the run up to the elections contributed to a rapid expansion in net credit to the government from the NBG (Tables 4 and 5). Over the period September-December 1999, net credit to the government by the NBG increased by an additional lari 88 million. At the same time, the peak in external debt service payments led to a decline of net international reserves. As a result, freely usable gross international reserves declined and stood at US$l29 million at end- 1999. 17. Financial market development resumed in 1999 as remonetization followed the sharp contraction in monetary aggregates at the end of 1998. Deposits grew by 20 percent by December 1999 relative to December 1998 (excluding exchange rate effects) and lending to the non-government sector grew by 31 percent. However, dollarization increased significantly, reaching 79 percent of commercial bank deposits at end-1999, reflecting a lack of confidence in the lari. 18. Interest rates continued to move downward during 1999, although real rates remained high. The 30-day credit auction yielded an interest rate of 29 percent in December 1999, down from 40 in January 1999 and 3 1 percent in July 1999. The market remains relatively thin and, as such, interest rates may not be particularly indicative of market Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- conditions. After nearly a 12-month hiatus, the treasury bill auction resumed in August 1999, albeit in very limited amounts and at below-market interest rates.4 19. AU but one of the fiscal and monetary quantitative targets and financial benchmarks were missed both at end-September and end-December 1999; the exception was the target on net international reserves (overall and in convertible currencies) (Table 6). 20. Reflecting its large internal and external imbalances, Georgia’s public debt has risen steadily since the country regained independence. Excluding contingent liabilities, the government’s internal debt (virtually all of which is owed to the NBG) is estimated at lari 690 million (12.3 percent of GDP) at end-1999. Georgia’s total external debt at end-1999 is estimated at US$l.8 billion (63 percent of GDP), with multilateral debt now accounting for over one-half of the total (see Appendix V; Debt Sustainability Analysis). In net present value (NPV) terms, the stock of external debt at end-1999 is estimated at US$1.4 billion, (equivalent to 200 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services). Even though much of the debt was contracted on concessional terms, the debt service burden is considerable, reflecting the inadequacy of fiscal adjustment efforts. As a result, total central government interest payments due in 1999 accounted for 32 percent of total central government revenue (including grants), and total external debt service payments due in 1999 represented 22 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services. With the exception of minor delays, the government has remained current on interest, both domestic and external, but has accumulated external arrears on principal payments. C. Structural Reforms 21. Prompt action on the part of the NBG helped the banking system weather the Russia crisis. Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs) were signed with the major banks and only a few banks required liquidity injections during the period immediately following the crisis. All the liquidity loans have since been paid back and the MOUs were deemed no longer necessary and were cancelled. 22. Bank consolidation continued to make progress in 1999, with the number of banks declining from 44 to 37 banks. In June 1999, the minimum capital requirement was raised to lari 2 million (about US$l million). Although this requirement was challenged by a few banks in the courts, the NBG was able to de-license one of the banks, following a favorable court ruling in September 1999. Capital requirements were raised further to lari 3 million as 4 The acceptance by banks of interest rates which are artificially low was motivated by a technical change in reserve requirements in July which allowed banks to hold one eighth of required reserves in treasury bills. As the remuneration on required reserves was 10 percent, average treasury bill interest rates above this rate were attractive to banks.

There was moderate progress in large-scale privatization in 1999, but the majority of equity in large-scale enterprises remained in government hands at the end of the year. Telasi, the electricity distribution company of Tbilisi, was privatized at the end of 1998. In addition, some 50 large but not particularly profitable industrial enterprises (including those in the areas of cement, tobacco, textiles, construction, and mining) were privatized in 1999. Plans were developed and refined for the privatization of other large infrastructure entities, including assets in energy generation and distribution, ports, and telecommunications. A law allowing for auctions without minimum prices was introduced in March 1999 in order to facilitate the sale of medium and large enterprises. 24. The energy sector continues to face significant diffkulties. There have been frequent power cuts owing to the lack of rehabilitation of energy infrastructure. The financial position of the energy enterprises is very weak, due to domestic prices below costs (despite the 50 percent increase in electricity tariffs in June 1999), widespread customer discounts, still low payment collection rates, poor management, and financial improprieties. This has brought the energy enterprises to effective insolvency, with outstanding debts estimated at over US$500 million, which may end up being borne by the government or amortized gradually through a tariff surcharge.S 25. Land privatization progressed in 1999. With donor assistance, the government started to survey and register agricultural land parcels; some 200,000 plots had been registered by end-December 1999. The law for the privatization and lease of state-owned non-agricultural land was streamlined. By end-l 999, some 3,200 enterprises had registered their urban and industrial land holdings with the region or municipality. 26. Extensive judicial reforms were implemented in 1999. In addition to opening a Judicial Training Center and conducting seminars for those in the legal profession, qualification tests were established for incumbent judges and judicial candidates. As a result, some 150 new judges were hired in 1999 to replace incumbents. In addition, the Council of Justice drafted a Code of Judicial Ethics and Discipline.6 27. Georgia has maintained a liberal trade and payments system. Tariff rates, at 0, 5, and 12 percent, are at relatively low levels by international standards.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) General Council ratified the Final Working Party document for Georgia in October 1999, thus clearing the way for Georgia’s accession to the WTO. All that remains is for Georgia’s parliament to ratify the WTO Protocol of Accession, which is expected in early-2000. IV. POLICYDISCUSSIONS 28. The discussions focussed on the need to remove the threat to macroeconomic stability posed by lax fiscal policies, and thus help ensure movement towards a more robust growth path and a viable balance of payments. Growing social tensions in Georgia have arisen as a result of the steady increase of expenditure arrears, the continuing energy shortages, and the problem of corruption. In this context, the policies for the year 2000, aimed at achieving real growth of 4 percent and containing inflation to 7 percent, would prove to be critical in light of the low level of domestic savings, the large stock of expenditure arrears, and the already large external debt. New initiatives to significantly strengthen governance would play a key role in ensuring the effectiveness of the authorities’ policies. A. Fiscal Policy 29. The discussions centered on measures aimed at addressing the weak and unsustainable focal position. Revenues have continued to remain significantly short of expectations, thus disrupting the execution of the budget. The staff noted that, in this environment of permanent underfinancing as a result of unrealistic budgeting, the authorities had been unable to prioritize government expenditure, instead resorting to ad-hoc procedures and sequestration as a form of expenditure management. As a result, priority outlays had not been funded and expenditure arrears on wages, pensions, and social allowances-all of them key components of the social safety net-had increased significantly, as opposed to declining over time, thus straining the population’s satisfaction with government policies.* 30. The staff urged the authorities to undertake a major consolidation of the fiscal position in 2000. In the absence of a significant strengthening of public finances, needed 7 Licenses are required for the export of logs, scrap metal, pine seeds, and raw materials for the production of medicine. All exports are subject to a general customs processing fee of 0.3 percent. Licenses are required for the import of weapons, narcotics, industrial equipment, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural pesticides. Licenses are also required to trade in gold. * Chapter IV of the forthcoming paper on Recent Economic Developments provides an assessment of the poverty situation in Georgia Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-17- increases in investment from both residents and nonresidents were unlikely to material& thus adversely affecting growth prospects. The revenue potential in Georgia, assuming unchanged tax rates but improved tax administration, is nearly double of what is presently being collected.’ While there was a clear need for further revenue enhancement stemming from administrative improvements and policy measures, the 2000 budget needed to reflect sufficiently conservative revenue projections as a way to ensure that no further expenditure arrears would be accumulated. In light of this and given the size of the needed fiscal adjustment so as to provide room for a draw-down of the stock of expenditure arrears, there was a need for a fundamental reassessment of the size and scope of government. This will require some reduction in the overall level of expenditures, as well as improved efficiency, better targeting and a review of expenditure responsibilities between the central government and local governments. While agreeing with the overall strategy, the authorities stated that external factors (including in neighboring Chechnya), as well as internal constraints (such as the upcoming Presidential elections) placed limits on the size of cuts in expenditure commitments, including in terms of national security related outlays, that are politically feasible over the short term. 31. The draft 2000 budget, which was submitted to parliament on February 11,2000, envisages an adjustment of about 2.5 percent of GDP on a commitment basis relative to 1999. Gn a cash basis, the overall fiscal deficit of the general government would actually deteriorate by just under 1 percent of GDP, consistent with the planned clearance of core expenditure arrears by 1.7 percent of GDP in 2000. The remainder of the stock of government arrears would be cleared in 2001. Text Table 3.

The revenue projections for 2000 reflect the expectation of a significant, albeit realistic, improvement in tax collections. Tax revenues of the general government (including extrabudgetary funds) are projected to increase by about 1.5 percent of GDP, with all of the improvement coming at the central government level. This improvement would come from both tax policy and administrative measures, as detailed in Box 2. The authorities indicated that, should additional revenues materialize, the budget could subsequently be revised accordingly with a focus on an accelerated clearance of core arrears. Box 2. Envisaged Revenue Measures in 2000 Tax policy The authorities have increased the specific excise rate on cigarettes to 40 tetri per pack for filtered and 30 tetri per pack for unfiltered cigarettes (effective on January 1,200O) accompanied by the imposition of an import duty of 12 percent (effective on February 1,200O). In the context of the draft 2000 budget, the authorities have submitted a proposal to parliament that would shift the revenue sharing formula to 100 percent in favor of the central govemment on VAT and excises. In addition? the regions of Adjara and Abkhazia would receive 50 percent of customs duties, compared to the current 40 percent and zero respectively. This could prove to be a politically difficult measure to implement. Several other tax code amendments have been submitted to parliament, including the introduction of a minimum payroll tax and increases in the presumptive trader tax, and an increase in the excise rate on tires. Tax administration To better effect tax administration reforms, a new Revenue Ministry was created in December 1999. Both the customs and tax departments will report to this new Ministry, a mechanism that is expected to increase accountability in the area of revenue collections. The authorities intend to improve the working of the revenue agencies over the medium term by a combination of having fewer, but better-paid, staff operating in an environment of strengthened accountability. Initial efforts will focus on improving the collection of taxes from petroleum products and cigarettes. Annual tax collections from cigarettes and petroleum products are projected to amount to lari 103 million and lari 119 million respectively in 2000, an increase of 65 percent and 91 percent respectively, relative to 1999. 33. While the 2000 draft budget envisages an adjustment in terms of expenditure commitments, cash spending (inclusive of the clearance of expenditure arrears) would increase in 2000. The draft 2000 budget envisages a reduction in expenditure commitments of about 0.5 percent of GDP for the central government; an equivalent adjustment is envisaged at the local government level. Given the very limited room for maneuver (e.g., interest payments are projected to account for about one third of total revenues of the central government in 2000), nominal cuts in central government expenditure commitments are envisaged practically across the board on discretionary items. Some savings will come about from a restructuring of the civil service, expected to take place after the April elections. Social safety net allocations, including in the areas of health and education, would increase in nominal terms. In addition, the proposed 2000 budget envisages a partial clearance of state government core arrears equivalent to about 1.5 percent of GDP. Given that priority will be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-19- given to the clearance of social safety net-related expenditure arrears (wages, pensions, and social allowances), cash spending in these categories (including payment of arrears) is expected to increase in 2000. To prevent an accumulation of new expenditure arrears, the Ministry of Finance approved, in November 1999, an expenditure control framework in line with FAD technical assistance recommendations. The system is now in place and the Minister has indicated that it will be adhered to during the execution of the 2000 budget. 34. Financing of the budget will continue to be heavily dependent on external sources and privatization proceeds in 2000. In addition to loan disbursements primarily from the World Bank, the draft 2000 budget assumes that debt service relief on the order of 3 percent of GDP will arise out of an eventual rescheduling with bilateral external creditors. In terms of financing of the general government, the authorities expect net privatization proceeds amounting to lari 170 million (about 2.7 percent of GDP), primarily coming from the planned privatization of the telecom companies, The authorities are committed to continue to refrain from the contracting or guaranteeing of foreign non-concessional debt and from engaging in tax offsets. 35. The budget proposal fell somewhat short of the fiscal adjustment recommended by the staff. Given the large debt overhang and the need to relieve the burden falling on monetary policy, the staff recommended additional fiscal adjustment of 1.3 percent of GDP, so as to contain the overall fiscal deficit of the general government (commitment basis) to 2.7 percent of GDP. In the staff’s view, most of this additional adjustment would have to come from the expenditure side, where a more thorough and fundamental reassessment of government operations is required. It will also be important to ensure that fiscal adjustment takes place at the local government level, as envisaged in the budget. In addition, the staff urged for a greater clearance of expenditure arrears in 2000, as well as for greater use of privatization proceeds to pay-off debt rather than finance new budgetary outlays. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 36. For 2000, the monetary authorities remain committed to a restrained stance of monetary policy, and in particular a tightening of credit to government, in order to support price and exchange rate stability under the floating exchange rate regime. The authorities have set an inflation target of about 7 percent for 2000, from 11 percent in 1999. Reflecting some further financial market development, velocity is projected to decline moderately and the money multiplier is expected to continue its upward trend. The authorities indicated that there was room for a further reduction in interest rates, although they envisage a sharp slowdown in credit expansion. In addition, the NBG indicated that they would not consider reducing the minimum reserve requirement until possibly mid-2000. Regarding the international reserve position of the NBG, the staff and the authorities supported a target of US$168 million (1.9 months of imports) by end-2000. The monetary authorities indicated that, as in 1999, intervention would be used only for purchasing foreign exchange to replenish reserves. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2o- 37. The NBG is placing great impqrtance on ensuring the continued stability of the banking sector. A staged increase in the capital requirement is expected to force the under-capitalized banks to either merge or close. The NBG expressed concern about the reliability of the current CAMEL ratings and, as a result, has discontinued their publication; at the same time, it is intensifying its supervision efforts. Concerning Agro Bank, which is no longer a systemically important bank, the NBG plans to commission an audit by an international accounting firm prior to making a final decision concerning the future of the bank. It would appear that Agro Bairk is effectively insolvent and should therefore be closed. The supervision of agricultural credit unions by the NBG is under consideration, though it is likely to be complex and strain staffing resources at the NBG. lo 38. An assessment of competitiveness indicators suggests that the real exchange rate is broadly appropriate at this time. In the context of a floating exchange rate regime since December 1998, the lari depreciated about 15 percent in real terms through the first quarter of 1999, but has since gradually appreciated and resumed broadly its pre-Russia crisis level (Figure 6). A sharp real appreciation vis-a-vis Russia has resulted in a sharp decline in export share, which has been offset by exports to other countries, including Turkey, Germany, and Italy. Average wages in US dollars have remained relatively low compared to other countries in the region and in the BRO. There is, however, unmet demand for foreign exchange, in terms of external debt service obligations falling due and in order to fully provide for fuel imports, which would undoubtedly put pressure on the exchange rate. Exchange rate pressure is expected to mount further, as external debts in the energy sector (recorded incompletely thus far) are accounted for and need to be serviced. C. External Sector Policies and Prospects 39. Georgia’s balance of payments position is expected to strengthen in 2000 (Table 7). The current account deficit (excluding transfers) is projected to decline from 14 percent of GDP in 1999 to 12 percent in 2000, with both export and import volumes expected to rise following a slump in 1999. In the capital account, foreign direct investment is projected to increase in 2000 and gain momentum over the medium-term.” Over the medium-term, reserves are projected to increase to provide an import cover of about 3 months by 2002. These projections are based on the assumption of continued financial support from the Fund and the World Bank in the context of a sound macroeconomic reform program. Repayment obligations to the Fund would increase steadily through 2005. With lo A more detailed assessment of the banking sector can be found in Chapter V of the forthcoming paper on Recent Economic Developments. ” In the absence of sufficient information, the projected path for foreign direct investment does not yet include any increase in investment that would be associated with the new oil pipeline, projected to come on stream in 2001.

Discussions on external sector policies focussed on recent measures taken by the government to further liberalixe Georgia’s trade regime and its accession to the WTO. In 1999, the export tax on scrap metal, which replaced the export ban on scrap metal in 1998, was abolished. In addition, the government has abolished the system of providing licenses to export logs. With Georgia’s accession to the WTO, tariffs are expected to be gradually lowered in 3-5 years to as low as zero percent on most products. The authorities thought that there could be some revenue loss from trade liberalization, although improving tax administration and compliance would contain the possible revenue loss. 41. In the context of liberalizing the trade and investment regime to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), the authorities argued that, with increasing competition among host countries for FDI, Georgia may need to provide tax incentives to lure more investment. The staff, in turn, stated that there was little evidence to suggest that countries that provided tax incentives were successful in obtaining more FDI. Moreover, tax incentives could not substitute for either macroeconomic stability or for a culture that fostered prompt payment of wages and salaries. The authorities acknowledged the negative impact that the weak fiscal situation was having on investor sentiment and accepted the view that a healthy macroeconomic stance was key to attracting foreign investment. In addition, strong measures aimed at reducing corruption and overall criminality would attract FDI. 42. Georgia continues to experience difiiculties in servicing its external debt. Between 1995 and 1997, a first round of rescheduling was undertaken relating to the stock of debt, including arrears, outstanding as of end- 1995 to bilateral creditors. With the exercise being conducted on a bilateral basis, the terms and conditions of the rescheduling were non-uniform across the creditors. While most creditors provided a grace period of at least 5 years, Turkmenistan, one of Georgia’s biggest creditors, offered only a three year grace period, while at the same time providing for some reduction in the stock of debt. As per the agreed schedule, principal obligations to Turkmenistan, amounting to about US$20 million per quarter, began to fall due in March 1998. Given its limited capacity to service debt, which in part reflects lacks of a sufficiently strong adjustment effort, Georgia soon accumulated arrears on principal payments to Turkmenistan, while remaining current on interest falling due. 43. ‘Georgia’s external debt servicing capacity suggests the need for another round of rescheduling. Based on the previous round of debt rescheduling, the grace period on principal obligations to many creditors is expiring in 2000-02. As a result, external debt service obligations falling due over the next three years are large. As indicated in Table 7, however, Georgia has a very limited capacity to honor these obligations in full, which makes Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - it imperative for Georgia to initiate a second round of rescheduling of its debt to bilateral creditors with whom its has conducted a rescheduling in the past. The authorities are currently in the process of preparing the groundwork towards this effort, and plan to write to all bilateral creditors, requesting their participation. The staff have approached the Paris Club indicating Georgia’s interest in pursuing a multilateral rescheduling exercise and have kept the Club abreast with the status of Georgia’s relations with the Fund and its other creditors. A debt sustainability analysis is presented in Appendix V. 44. Debt relations with Turkmenistan, Georgia’s largest bilateral creditor, remain diffkult. In an effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution while seeking another round of rescheduling, Georgia made a partial payment of US$22 million to Turkmenistan in December 1998 towards obligations falling due in 1998 and towards eliminating gas arrears of about US$2.2 million. Despite the attempts of the Georgian authorities, there was limited improvement of the tenuous relations with Turkmenistan on the issue of debt rescheduling. In a good faith effort to bolster Turkmenistan’s willingness to participate in a future rescheduling of Georgia’s obligations to bilateral creditors in a multilateral framework, Georgia made a further payment to Turkmenistan of US$25 million (equivalent to 19 percent of the NBG’s gross international reserves at end-1999) in December 1999. The recent payment was effected on the basis of an understanding reached with Fund staff that Turkmenistan was amenable to participate in a multilateral rescheduling of Georgia’s external debt in an appropriate forum in support of Georgia’s economic reform program. However, in a letter to the staff in early February, the Turkmen authorities have indicated their intention not to reconsider a future rescheduling of Georgia’s debt, notwithstanding recent payments made by Georgia. D. Other Structural Reforms 45. The authorities agreed that there were significant problems relating to governance and corruption, which have contributed to a highly unequal distribution of income. To address these problems, the government will take steps to further tackle corruption, including prosecuting public officials suspected of fraud, broadening financial disclosure laws of public officials and the introduction of a code of ethics for civil servants, while at the same time establishing an independent agency to monitor these initiatives.

Governance and Corruption in Georgia I The authorities have had major difficulties in breaking the power of entrenched interest groups, such as those in the banking, fuel and energy, alcohol, and cigarette sectors. This has been due, in part, to insufficient political commitment to tackling governance problems squarely, as well as insufficient attention to institution building across a broad range of areas. This, combined with what is perceived as widespread corruption at all levels of the government, has severely limited further improvements in revenue and reduced the public trust in state institutions. The regressivity of the way that fiscal policy is being implemented, especially the failure to properly tax the rich and the accumulation-of wage and social safety net arrears, has also detracted significantly from the legitimacy of the government in the eyes of the public. While several senior government offtcials have been forced to resign from their posts under a cloud, few of them have been prosecuted for their alleged misdeeds. Moreover, systemic weakness in the judiciary and in the procuracy has led to limited respect for property rights, which has resulted in limited interest in investing in Georgia, both domestically and from abroad. 46. The authorities are determined to move ahead with the privatization of key infrastructure assets in 2000. Plans are underway to privatize several energy generation and distribution assets, as well as the gas company of Tbilisi. In addition, a tender is underway to select an investment bank to facilitate the privatization of 75 percent of the local telephone switching company and about half of the long distance telephone company that remains in state hands. For the Port of Poti, the authorities intend to make several berths available for long-term lease. Due to the accumulated debts for some of these state assets (particularly in the energy sector), the net proceeds that would accrue to the government may not be significant. The staff encouraged the authorities to proceed with the privatization process in a transparent manner, and emphasized that a significant portion of privatization proceeds be used to retire government debt and not serve to finance current spending. In addition, the staff discouraged the authorities from assuming debts of state-owned enterprise as a way of increasing the proceeds from privatization. 47. The authorities agreed that further progress in land privatization and registration would yield positive results, including importantly in the agricultural sector. Registration of agricultural plots will be accelerated with donor assistance in 2000; this will facilitate the use of laud as collateral for agricultural credits and the consolidation of agricultural land. E. Transparency, Data Provision, and Technical Assistance 48. There have been continued improvements in terms of transparency and provision of information to the public and the Fund; however, much more remains to be done. Both the NBG and the Ministry of Finance have completed their respective questionnaires on transparency. The NBG publishes a monthly bulletin with monetary statistics, and issues an annual report on a timely basis. In the fiscal area, the budget presentation has improved considerably in terms of moving towards international standards. In addition, there has been good progress in enhancing the reporting system of the treasury. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - 49. A Technical Assistance Consultation was undertaken, which summarizes the authorities’ views on recent technical assistance and on needed initiatives in this area in the period ahead (Box 4). The authorities expressed their appreciation of assistance received from the Fund across a broad range of issues through TA missions and resident advisors. Nonetheless, the authorities recognized that in areas of coordinating technical assistance and following through on policy recommendations-particularly in the area of fiscal policies- further progress could be expected. V. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK 50. A major up-front fiscal adjustment is needed to achieve sustainable economic growth, reduce poverty, and alleviate the external imbalances. To illustrate the macroeconomic implications of fiscal adjustment over the medium term, two scenarios are presented: a baseline scenario which shows the impact of continued large fiscal deficits and an adjustment scenario which allows for a sizeable fiscal adjustment in 2000 and thereafter (Table 8 and Figure 7). 51. Should large focal deficits persist over the medium term, the baseline scenario suggests that growth would be limited to 3 percent-a pace insufficient to adequately alleviate poverty-and inflation would remain in double digits. Large government fiscal deficits would dampen domestic savings and crowd out private investment, which in turn would affect competitiveness and export growth. With limited access to external financing, the government would have to rely heavily on central bank financing, which would contribute to high inflation and, adversely impact the economic environment. The lack of fiscal adjustment would also contribute to persistent wage and pension arrears. Furthermore, the debt-to-export ratio would remain high, while reserve coverage would remain below two months of imports. 52. The adjustment scenario indicates that it would be possible to raise GDP growth to 5 percent and maintain inflation below 5 percent. This would require a significant up-front fiscal adjustment, as well as bold measures in terms of improving governance and combatting corruption. Such a pace of growth would allow per capita income to rise and poverty to be alleviated. Domestic saving would increase substantially and, as a result: private investment would be “crowded in.” Recourse to budgetary financing from the.central bank would be limited, resulting in improved inflation performance and a stronger macroeconomic environment, which would encourage the development of financial markets. In addition, domestic expenditure arrears (mainly unpaid wages, pensions, and social allowances) would be eliminated, which would further help reduce poverty. There would also need to be a bolstering of structural reforms, including measures to resolve the problems in the energy sector. At the same time, the current account deficit would be reduced to a level consistent with progress toward external viability; reserve coverage would rise to over three months of imports.

Technical Assistance Consultation A technical assistance consultation was undertaken with the government agencies where the Fund has had active technical assistance programs. National Bank of Georgia The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) recognized that Fund assistance had led to significant progress in the areas of monetary policy operations, banking supervision, financial statistics and accounting reform. The key elements contributing to the effectiveness of this technical assistance were: (i) the experience of hyperinflation in 1994 led to an almost complete change of top and middle management at the NBG, with new officials committed to modemizing the central bank along the lines of best international practice; (ii) high quality and continuity of staff has been maintained with a competitive compensation package. In terms of constraints, the pace of developing monetary instruments was held back by the generally low level of financial intermediation by banks and non-bank financial institutions and low levels of government savings. In discussions, the NBG indicated that urgent future assistance needs include: legislative reform in line with international standards; continuation of assistance in central and commercial bank audit and accounting; continued assistance in prudential supervision, particularly in view of the expected consolidation of the banking industry; introduction of international audit standards in commercial banks; and modeling and forecasting techniques. Ministry of Finance Fund technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance has been comprehensive: treasury system development; expenditure management; budgeting; tax administration; and tax policy reform (including tax code development, fiscal federalism, social safety net provision). In discussions, the authorities assessed positively the contribution of Fund technical assistance. They recognized that progress in implementing advice had been made in several areas notably treasury system development, creation of the large taxpayer unit, and development of the tax code. However, they agreed that progress had been less satisfactory in other areas. The introduction of au expenditure control system in 1999 was hindered by generally adverse fiscal developments, and the authorities have been hesitant to introduce some tax administration measures (such as raising the VAT threshold) out of concern over significant revenue losses. Reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations has been held back largely by political concerns. In assessing future priorities the authorities felt the need for a review of the operations and management of the large taxpayers unit (LTU) together with further assistance with computerization. The tax department requested a continuation of legal assistance relating to tax code amendments. State Department of Statistics The State Department of Statistics (SDS) appreciated the provision of Fund technical assistance in the areas of national accounts, balance of payments and price statistics. While the top management of the SDS is highly receptive to Fund technical assistance, progress in improving statistical methods has been s!ower tinan anticipated owing to budgetary constraints, which make it difficult to retain skilled middle management staff responsible for implementation of technical assistance recommendations.

Georgia’s three-year arrangement under the ESAF expired in August 1999. Much progress was made in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform during the first half of the program period. However, since the end of 1997, the momentum of the reform program flagged, growth slowed, and little headway was made in addressing deep-seated fiscal problems. As a result, the economy continues to face very large internal and external imbalances, which pose a significant threat to macroeconomic stability. The limited growth and employment opportunities in the economy, large arrears on wages, pensions, and social expenditures, persistent shortages of electricity supply (and thus heat), and widespread corruption have all combined to bring about growing public disillusionment with the government’s economic program. 54. A significant strengthening of fiscal policy is crucial for placing the economy on a sustainable path. Increases in investment and saving and boosting confidence in the management of the economy will not occur unless there is a sustained effort of fiscal consolidation. In addition to undermining growth prospects, the persistence of a large fiscal deficit has steadily built up a debt overhang which, in the absence of a concerted and coordinated adjustment program, will eventually lead to adverse consequences in terms of inflation and the exchange rate. Furthermore, the failure to pay adequate attention to the equity issues raised by the tax and spending policies of the government has implications for the sustainability of economic reforms and social stability. 55. Georgia’s inability to collect adequate tax revenues needs to be addressed urgently in order to bring about sustained macroeconomic stability and to restore confidence in economic management among both residents and non-residents. Georgia had the lowest tax to GDP ratio of the CIS countries in the period 1996-1998. A central government revenue to GDP ratio of only 8 percent is clearly insufficient to support the existing size of the government. It is generally recognized that tax evasion remains substantial and that corruption among public officials, including at very senior levels, is widespread. It is unrealistic to expect that the international financial community will continue to provide substantial financial budgetary support to make up for the large loss of foregone revenue as wealthy individuals and companies succeed in avoiding paying taxes. With tax rates on income, goods and services broadly appropriate by international standards, the emphasis should be on tax administration. In this regard, despite extensive technical assistance and the hiring of a foreign firm to provide assistance in customs, the continued poor revenue performance suggests the lack of political will and inability to tackle the fundamental problem of raising revenue at the source. 56. The chronic shortfall in revenue combined with different spending priorities has led to further accumulation of expenditure arrears. The staff regrets that the Fund’s advice on establishing an expenditure control mechanism, including the setting of spending Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - priorities, was not implemented last year but welcomes the initiative this year. A key component of a policy to alleviate poverty is the elimination of arrears on wages, pensions, and social expenditures and to remain current on new outlays. The staff thus regrets the further increase in core expenditure arrears which has had a direct adverse impact on the incidence of poverty. In view of the limited resources and the government’s inability to raise adequate revenue, the staff urges the authorities to undertake a comprehensive review of government expenditure with an objective to rationalize its operations, achieve efficiency gains, and better targeting. Starting from a very low level just a few years ago, it is indeed alarming that interest payments now account for one-third of central government revenue. 57. The pursuit of a prudent monetary policy remains an essential component of the authorities’ reform agenda in supporting price and exchange rate stability. The floating exchange rate regime has served Georgia well and remains appropriate given the low level of gross international reserves and the uncertainty about the competitiveness of the tradable goods sector, reflected in part by the low growth rates of exports recently. In view of the repressed demand for foreign exchange, given the non-payment of external debt and shortages of fuel imports for heating, it will be important to increase the production of tradable goods in order to avoid a loss in the value of the lari and lower real income. 58. Continuing reforms of the banking system remain important. The staff welcomes the authorities’ steps in strengthening banking supervision and prudential regulations, including the recent increase in the minimum capital requirement. The NBG should continue to encourage and facilitate the effective merger or liquidation of banks that do not meet prudential regulations. The staff strongly urges that credit unions, which are currently not regulated, be placed under the supervision of the NE3G. Finally, the NBG should proceed with the audit of Agrobank and promptly move to its resolution. 59. The authorities should press ahead with their agenda for structural reform. It will be important to make further progress in executing the outstanding agenda for large-scale infrastructure privatization, including in the telecommunications and energy sectors, and complete the overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework. Imposing hard budget constraints on the energy sector, inter alia, through the continued privatization of generation and distribution assets, will be essential in restoring the sector to solvency. 60. The staff welcomes the recent efforts by the authorities to improve basic macroeconomic statistics, including the revisions in the national accounts, and urges the authorities to substantially ameliorate the compilation and coverage of the balance of payments as well as the national accounts. 61. Tackling corruption and improving governance will be essential in order to attract long-term capital needed for restructuring the economy and to bring about sustained high quality growth. Much still remains to be done to develop the institutional and legal underpinnings of a market economy, and thus provide a reliable framework for improving governance, reducing corruption, and strengthening the rule of law. There is a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- clear need to establish a more level playing field for investors in order to attract new investment. While there has been much discussion in Georgia, in both public and private circles, about how corruption is undermining the economy, the staff regrets that little by way of concrete actions have been taken so far. 62. Georgia’s external outlook remains difficult. The staffs medium-term scenario and debt sustainability analysis indicate that even with relatively optimistic assumptions, substantial balance of payments gaps remain over the next few years. Clearly a combination of a strong adjustment and structural reform program and international financial support will be required to close the large financing gaps. Gn this basis, the staff would support Georgia’s request to bilateral creditors for exceptional financing in the form of a multilateral rescheduling. Taking into account Georgia’s efforts to normalize relations and its limited debt service capacity, the staff believes that Turkmenistan should consider participating in a multilateral rescheduling of Georgia’s debt. 63. The staff stands ready to assist the authorities in designing an appropriate economic program that would merit the support of the Fund. Critical components of such an economic program would include strengthened fiscal adjustment and strong anti-corruption and governance-improving measures. Also, given the sizable slippages in fiscal policy implementation in the period immediately following completion of the last review of the ESAF arrangement, there is a need for Georgia to establish a track record on revenue collection, expenditure management, and tackling governance issues. Such a track record would help in reestablishing the basis for a resumption of Fund financial assistance. 64. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 1Zmonth cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-31- Table 1.

Exchange Arrangements: The currency of Georgia is the lari, which became the sole legal tender in October 2, 1995. The lari replaced the coupon, which was introduced in April 1993. Since April 29, 1993, the Tbilisi Interbank Currency Exchange (TICEX), established by the NBG and a group of commercial banks, has conducted periodic auctions to determine the exchange rate of the domestic currency. On June 14, 1993, the NBG authorized the establishment of foreign exchange bureaus that are allowed to buy and sell foreign currency bank notes. The frequency of the TICEX auctions was increased from weekly to twice weekly in late September 1994, to thrice weekly in April 1995, and to daily from January 1,1996. The rate established at the TICEX on January 3 1,200O was lari 2.050 per U.S. dollar. From September 1994 until December 7, 1998 intervention was a major factor in the evolution of the exchange rate. However, the difference between the TICEX rates and those at foreign exchange bureaus has become smaller over time. On December 7,1998, the NBG stopped intervening in the foreign exchange market and has allowed the lari to float thereafter. VIII.

Through end-December 1999, the World Bank has approved 18 investment and technical assistance credits and five adjustment operations to Georgia, all with standard IDA terms, totaling SDR 363.8 million. A resident mission was opened in Tbilisi in August 1996. An Institution-Building Credit to Georgia in the amount of SDR 7.3 million was the Bank’s first credit to Georgia, and was approved by the Bank’s Executive Board on July 5, 1994. The credit (closed on June 30, 1998) financed technical assistance, equipment, and training in the areas of privatization and enterprise reform, the financial sector, and economic management. Acquisition of equipment in support of the establishment of a central treasury, along the lines recommended by the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) was also financed. Adjustment lending began in 1995, with a Rehabilitation Credit in the amount equivalent to SDR 5 1 .O million, approved by the Bank’s Executive Board on March 30, 1995. The project supported government reforms aimed at reducing and redefining the role of public sector in the economy, fostering the development and efficiency of markets, and maintaining a minimum social safety net. Among its key reforms were price and trade liberalization, phasing out of the state order system, and improved targeting of social benefits. This credit closed on June 30, 1996. A Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC I) in the amount equivalent to SDR 41.3 million was approved by the World Bank’s Executive Board on April 18, 1996, and was disbursed in two equal tranches (in June 1996 and in December 1996). Among the key reforms supported by SAC I were the removal of tax exemptions and strengthening of tax administration, improvements in collection of energy payments, acceleration of privatization, restructuring of the pension system and social protection, restructuring of the financial sector, and trade liberalization and trade promotion. This credit closed on December 3 1, 1997. In parallel, a technical assistance loan (SATAC I) in the amount equivalent to SDR 3.3 million was approved on April 18, 1996, and closed on December 3 1, 1998. The project facilitated the implementation of the structural reforms supported by SAC, and included, among other things, technical assistance in support of privatization and post-privatization, strengthening of the financial sector, reforming social protection, and strengthening Georgia’s regulatory framework. A second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC II), equivalent to SDR 44.2 million, was approved by the World Bank Executive Board on September 4, 1997. A technical assistance credit (SATAC II) for SDR 3.7 million was also approved on that date. The first tranche of SAC II, equivalent to SDR 29.5 million (US$40 million), was disbursed in November 1997, and the second tranche, equivalent to SDR 14.7 million was disbursed in December, 1998. SAC II was closed on December 3 1, 1998, and SATAC II closed on December 3 1, 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDIX II A third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC III), equivalent to SDR 44.3 million, was approved by the World Bank Executive Board on June 29,1999, for which three equal tranches of 14.7 million were planned. On the same date, an Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC), equivalent to SDR 18.1 million to be disbursed in two equal tranches of SDR 9.05 million, was approved. SAC III supported implementation of the government’s reform program, including measures to: strengthen fiscal performance, ensure budgetary provisions for core social expenditures, improve the legal and regulatory framework for the private sector, and complete the process of ownership change and market liberalization. The key reform objectives supported by ESAC included enhancing the tinaricial sustainability and management of the energy sector, supporting the privatization process, putting in place a sound legal framework for the oil and gas sector and for environmental aspects related to the energy sector, adoption of electricity market rules, and establishment of a sound regulatory framework for electricity. ESAC also supported measures to lesson the impact of these reforms on the most vulnerable through an increase in the poverty benefit. The first tranches of SAC III (equivalent to SDR14.7 million) and ESAC (equivalent to SDR 9.05 million) were released on effectiveness of the credits, on July 27, 1999. A Structural Reform Support project (SDR 12.2 million) was approved on the same date to provide technical assistance to support the implementation of these reform measures, and included an investment component to support the Government’s Hospital Restructuring program in Tbilisi. Investment projects approved by the Bank’s Executive Board include the following operations covering several sectors. A Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation Credit (SDR 12.5 million) was approved in November 1994 to address the severe deterioration of municipal infrastructure in Tbilisi and other major cities and assist in improving energy efficiency in schools and hospitals; this was followed by a Municipal Development Project (SDR 15 million) approved on July 15, 1997 to improve the financial management and support local investments. Assistance in the transport sector included a Transport Rehabilitation project (SDR 8.1 million) approved by the Executive Board in January 1996, which was followed by a Transport Ministry Restructuring credit (SDR 1.8 million) approved on September 2. 1998. Two IDA credits have also been approved in support of Georgia’s energy sector. The first, a Power Rehabilitation credit (SDR 37.7 million) was approved in June 1997, provided funding to undertake urgent rehabilitation of the power system and support reform, including privatization, of the power sector. The second, an Oil Institution Building credit (SDR I .O million) was approved in April, 1997, and provided technical assistance to enhance the capacity of Georgian personnel to undertake international negotiations in respect of oil pipeline transit. An Enterprise Rehabilitation credit (SDR 11 .O million) was approved in December, 1998, to improve efficiency and managerial capacity of private and privatized enterprises, and support creation of new small private businesses. A health sector project (SDR 9.7 million) was approved by the Bank’s Executive Board on April 25, 1996, and supports the restructuring of the health sector, including rehabilitation of health care facilities and reorientation of the health system. An SDR 14.6 million Social Investment Fund credit was approved in December 1997 to support the most vulnerable in Georgia and improve access to basic social and economic services through funding of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-47- APPENDIX II microprojects, particularIy in poor and mountainous areas. A Cultural Heritage project (SDR 3.5 million) was also approved in December 1997, which seeks to improve the management and promotion of Georgia’s rich cultural heritage. Assistance in agriculture and environment includes an Agriculture Development Project (SDR 10.4 million), approved in March 1997 that aims to increase agricultural productivity in Georgia by supporting the development of private sector farming and agro-processing. It supports the authorities’ reform strategy in the agriculture sector by providing direct financial assistance to the land reform program, the privatization and restructuring of agro-processing enterprises, the development of a system to provide credit to small farmers, and the development of an agricultural development and investment program to improve agricultural services. An Integrated Coastal Zone Management project (SDR 3.2 million IDA credit and US$4.0 million GEF grant) was approved in December, 1998 to assist Georgia in managing the coastal resources of the Black Sea by developing methods to integrate environmental planning and management into economic development activities along the Black Sea coast. Most recently, a Judicial Reform project (SDR 9.9 million credit) was approved on June 29, 1999 to assist in the development of an independent and professional judiciary. The project provides support to develop a new court administration system, a new case management system, rehabilitation of selected court infrastructure, as well as a public information component to increase public awareness of the role of the judiciary and the reforms being implemented. To date, IFC has approved 8 projects with total IFC financing of US$SS million in Georgia. The first IFC project-amounting to US$2.8 million-for investment financing in the Georgian Glass and Mineral Water Company (Borjomi) was approved in May 1997. In June 1998, IFC approved an US$8.8 million loan and equity investment in the Ksani Glass Factory. A US$6 million loan has been committed to the Ninotsminda Oil Company for oil field development, and approximately US$30 million of investment in Azeri Early Oil will be committed to support the Georgian section of the oil pipeline and the Supsa oil terminal Most recently, IFC has approved a US$30 million loan to the recently privatized electricity distributor of Tbilisi (AES/Telasi) to strengthen its electricity distribution network and to install new meters to improve collections. IFC has approved three investments in the banking sector: (i) US$3 million credit line and a US$l million option to purchase equity in TBC Bank; (ii) a US$O.75 million equity investment to purchase a 20 percent stake in a new microfinance bank, the Microfmance Bank of Georgia; and (iii) a US$3 million credit line to TbilComBank. Georgia was added to IFC’s Outreach Program in 1998, which enabled IFC to open a representative office, co-located with the World Bank. The World Bank organ&d and chaired an informal donors’ meeting in July 1994 and Consultative Group meetings in November 1994 and May 1996 to mobilize support for Georgia’s stabilization and structural reform efforts. In August 1994, the World Bank chaired a meeting of donors on Georgia’s urgent energy needs. In response to the Russia crisis, the World Bank and IMF jointly chaired an informal donor meeting in November 1998 to mobilize support for the IDA countries most directly affected by the crisis.

Total value of projects supported to date is Euro 280 million (US$269 million). In July 1998, the EBRD provided a convertible loan to Bank of Georgia and by the end- 1998 two large public infrastructure operations were signed. In May 1999, a private project with a glass factory was signed. One of the infrastructure operations is part of a regional project to rehabilitate the Trans-Caucasian railway linking the ports of Poti and Batumi to Baku port in Azerbaijan. The second operation involves the rehabilitation of the Enguri Hydro Power plant, the country’s most important source of primary energy. The pace and composition of portfolio growth in Georgia has varied significantly from year to year. If in 1994 and 1995 exclusively public infrastructure projects have been launched, the portfolio in the following years was diversified including projects principally in the financial sector, consistently increasing the private sector share in the portfolio. With the signing of the two new public sector projects in 1998, the private sector share of the portfolio declined to 35% per cent. However, this increased to 40% with the signing of the glass factory project, and should increase to 60/40 (private/public) by year end as private projects in the pipeline are signed. Current pipeline includes projects in the agribusiness, energy and industrial sector and a co-finance project to rehabilitate and upgrade facilities in Poti port. The Bank is also considering to actively participate in the privatization of Georgian telecoms.

Most recently, progress has been made in the area of national accounts statistics, in particular provisional revised GDP estimates were published in January 2000. In addition, improvements have been made in price, monetary, and government finance statistics. However, the quality of macroeconomic statistics remains poor, reflecting inter alia deficiencies in statistical methodologies, coverage, and inadequate resources. Problems are particularly acute regarding the compilation balance of payments statistics. Nonetheless, the core statistical indicators compiled by the authorities are produced on a timely basis and are adequate to enable the staff to monitor macroeconomic statistics under the program (Appendix IV, Table 1). Real Sector A multisector statistics mission from the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) which visited Georgia in November 1997, found severe deficiencies in the compilation of national accounts statistics by the State Department of Statistics (SDS). In addition, the Minister of Economy expressed concern that GDP data were overstated. With assistance from STA, the SDS has improved the methodology for preparing its GDP estimates. In December 1999, a STA mission found the GDP estimates to be basically sound, although further improvements are needed. The provisional estimates were published in January 2000 for the period 1996-99. The biggest change made to the figures was the revision of the estimates for informal activities which had been estimated at more than 40 percent of total GDP, but now accounts for about 25 percent, which is consistent with those for other transition economies. As a result of these changes in methodology, the revised estimates are some 34 percent below the previously published GDP estimates. The STA mission recommend that the data for some activities be further disaggregated to improve the quality and conceptual basis of the volume measures. Longer term development projects include further improvement of the quarterly accounts and development of annual supply and use tables. A follow-up mission has been suggested by the authorities to take place around September 2000. Balance of Payments Statistics The November 1997 multisector STA mission concluded that despite recent improvements, the quality of balance of payments statistics remained poor. A work program for the following 12 months was drawn up by the mission, including measures to develop sound methodologies for measuring international trade flows, and estimating services data using households surveys, migration statistics, travel debits of Georgians working abroad, and short-term financial assets flows, among others. The mission recommended that several new surveys be introduced by the SDS to improve estimates on services, including on transport flows and on foreign direct investments. During the latest mission, it was found that- because of staff turnover and consequent lack of qualified and motivated personnel-very little progress was made in implementing the action plan recommended by the earlier mission and there was some deterioration in the quality of the data. In light of this assessment, a new Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - APPENDIX IV action plan was proposed. Areas of highest priority include: (i) revision of trade data; (ii) collection of migration-related data; and (iii) implementing the inward FDI survey based on the largest enterprises. The overall assessment is that the remaining difficulties in the BOP area are due to lack of training and loss of staff. Money and Banking Statistics Although the monetary statistics prepared by the NBG are broadly adequate for policy and analytical purposes, several improvements are needed in the new chart of accounts that would be introduced by end-2000. A recent money and banking statistics mission noted progress in several areas, including that the new chart of accounts had been revised in line with some of the previous recommendations and that the NBG had corrected problems associated with classification by residency. The most recent money and banking statistics mission discussed with the authorities a draft country page which was introduced in the February 2000 issue of IFS Government Finance Statistics Progress in this area during the last two years has been commendable, with the Georgian authorities implementing much of the recommendations of the multisector mission, and those of earlier (1995) GFS missions. The multisector STA mission recommended that the report forms used by various government units to report monthly budget execution data be customized according to the GFS classification categories. The mission also recommended that in addition to the functional classification that is currently in place, budgetary outlays be also classified according to the economic categories. A country page for Georgia, with data for 1997, was published for the first time in the 1998 issue of the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) aims at assessing the medium-term dynamics of external debt in Georgia. It presents macroeconomic and external debt projections through 20 10, based on loan-by-loan data provided by the Georgian authorities along with information provided by some creditors. A reconciliation of the data on debt stock outstanding as of end-1998 revealed very small discrepancies between Fund records and records of the Ministry of Finance. The discrepancies can, in large part, be explained by differences in exchange rates. The debt estimates and net present value (NPV) presented here, however, may need to be revised in the context of a more comprehensive debt reconciliation with all multilateral and bilateral creditors. In addition, a full accounting of debts contracted or guaranteed by the government in the energy sector has not yet been completed. 2. At end-1999, Georgia’s total external debt was estimated to be US$1.8 billion (63 percent of GDP). As shown in Figure 1, more than 50 percent of the outstanding debt is owed to multilateral institutions, including to the Fund (IJS$327 million; 19 percent of total) and the World Bank (US!!376 million; 21 percent of total). Debt owed to BR0 countries amounts to US$595 million (34 percent of total), of which Turkmenistan and Russia account for about US$350 million (20 percent of total) and US$179 million (10 percent of total), respectively, With little by way of new credits, the share of debt to bilateral creditors in the total has declined since 1995. By contrast, over the same period, the share of multilateral institutions, and particularly that of the IMF and the World Bank, has continued to rise (Figure 1). In NPV terms, the total debt stock at end-1999 amounts to about US$1.4 billion (53 percent of GDP) and to 200 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services. 3. In the period 1995-97, Georgia obtained debt rescheduling with some bilateral creditors; mostly BR0 countries. Since the rescheduling was conducted on a bilateral basis, the terms and conditions of the agreements varied across creditors.’ While the interest rate for rescheduling was set uniformly at 4 percent, the amortization and grace periods varied considerably. In particular, the grace period on amortization of debts to Turkmenistan expired in 1998. However, with a limited capacity to remain current on external obligations, Georgia accumulated arrears amounting to US$ 113 million to Turkmenistan through end-1999. In addition, with a large bunching of debt service obligations falling due to bilateral creditors in 2000 through 2002 (Table l), the balance of payments outlook in the period ahead is difficult. ’ Box 1 in EBS/97/29 provides a detailed description of the terms and conditions of the previous round of rescheduling.

In order to examine the implications for external vulnerability, two scenarios of the DSA are carried out. Under the baseline, or non-adjustment scenario, the lack of a strong economic reform program results in continued large fiscal deficits over medium-term. This, in turn, impacts negatively on growth and inflation and increases Georgia’s external vulnerability. The negative impact is compounded by the lack of macroeconomic support, in particular from the Fund and the World Bank, over the medium term. In the adjustment scenario, sizeable fiscal adjustment-occurs. In addition, it is assumed that bilateral and multilateral creditors would provide substantial macroeconomic support. Baseline Scenario: Large fiscal deficits and no macroeconomic support in 2000-2002 5. The underlying macroeconomic assumptions are as follows. Average real GDP growth is projected to be 3 percent per annum during 1998-2010. Average inflation is projected to be 15.6 percent per annum during 1998-2003, declining to about 12.5 percent per annum in 2004-2010. Average export volume growth is assumed to rise from 2.9 percent during 1998-2003 to about 6.5 percent during 2004-2010. Over the same time period, average import volume is projected to increase from about 0.1 percent to around 4.3 percent. Transfers are projected to decline as a share of GDP from 5.4 percent during 1998-2003 to around 2.9 percent during the remainder of the projection period. It is also assumed that over the medium-term, performance in the current and capital accounts will allow for little increase in reserve accumulation. On the fiscal side, large fiscal deficits are projected. The overall government balance (commitment basis), as a share of GDP, is assumed to average about 6 percent per annum during 2000-2002, declining thereafter, but still averaging about 4 percent over the remainder of the projection period. 6. This scenario assumes that Georgia will remain current on all external obligations falling due, including on obligations to bilateral creditors due per the previous round of rescheduling. In addition, it also assumes that arrears to Turkmenistan amounting to US%113 million at end-1999 will be extinguished in 2000. In the absence of a strong adjustment program (which would therefore preclude Fund-financial support of the program), macroeconomic support from the World Bank, projected to be about US$52.5 million in 2000 and US$20 million in 2001 and 2002, respectively, is assumed not to material&. 7. Based on these assumptions, the current account deficit, excluding transfers, is projected to remain large over the medium term, averaging about 11 percent of GDP per annum between 2GOO through 2002. Over the same period, the capital account worsens, largely because of the decrease in external disbursements and the steep increase in external debt obligations. Despite no significant increase in reserve accumulation, the projected movements in current and capital accounts lead to large financing gaps in 2000-2002. For illustrative purposes, it is assumed that Georgia is able to procure non-concessional financing to fill this gap, with the terms being 10 years maturity, 3 years grace, and an interest rate of 7 percent. The borrowing to finance the large gaps in 2000-2002, (when existing debt service obligations to bilateral creditors peak), further adds to the difficulty in servicing debt over the A Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-55 - APPENDIX V long run. In the absence of an improvement in the current and capital accounts, financing gaps in the balance of payments would continue through 2008. These gaps are again assumed to be filled by borrowing on the same terms. The implications for debt servicing over the long run, as a result of this borrowing, are discussed below. 8. Under this scenario, with the bunching of obligations falling due to bilateral creditors, debt service payments, as a share of exports of goods and non-factor services, increase sharply in 2000 (to 29 percent) and rise further through 2002. After a modest decline in 2003 (26 percent), debt service payments would rise through 2007, reflecting the amortization of gap-filling debt, before beginning to decline in 2008. Total external debt, as a share of GDP, would peak in 2000 (7 1 percent) before declining steadily thereafter. The NPV of external debt, as a share of exports of goods and non-factor services, continues to remain high, and falls below 150 percent only in 2009. As a share of central government revenue, the NPV figures under this scenario are quite large. NPV of external debt, as a share of government revenue, increases in 2000 to 843 percent, and declines gradually and to below 250 percent only in 2009 2 (Table 2). 9. Overall, in addition to the significant cash-flow problems over the medium term, this scenario indicates a heavy debt burden over the long run. Based on the implications for debt servicing over the medium and long term and for the NPV of external debt, it provides a strong case for Georgia to obtain more concessional financing, including another round of rescheduling of debt to bilateral creditors, to fill the gap in the balance of payments on the basis of a strong adjustment program. Scenario 2. Strong fiscal adjustment and availability of macroeconomic support 10. The underlying macroeconomic assumptions are as follows. Average real GDP growth is projected to be 4 percent per annum during the 1998-2003 and 5 percent per annum during 2004-2010. Average inflation is assumed to fall steadily from 7.7 percent per annum during 1998-2003 to 4.0 percent per annum through the end of the projection period, in line with the inflation rate in partner countries. Average export volume growth is assumed to rise from 5.4 percent during 1998-2003 to 8.5 percent during 2004-2010. Over the same time period, average import volume is projected to increase steadily from 2 percent per annum to around 5 percent per annum. Transfers are projected to decline as a share of GDP from 5.5 percent per annum during 1998-2003 to around 3.7 percent per annum during the remainder of the projection period. The composition of transfers is expected to change, as private transfers, mainly in the fomr of workers’ remittances, replace the inflow of official transfers. Over the medium-term, a modest reserve accumulation is targeted that would provide for an import cover for about 3 months by 2002. On the fiscal side, central 2 As per the revised guidelines, countries seeking debt relief under the HIPC initiative, need to have NPV of external debt as a share of exports of goods and non-factor services of at least 150 percent or 250 percent as a share of central government revenue. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - APPENDIX V government revenue as a share of GDP is projected to rise steadily from 9 percent during 1998-2003 to 11 percent during 2004-2010. Total expenditure and lending would also rise, but at a slower pace than revenues and grants. As a result, the overall government balance is assumed to move from a deficit of around 2 percent of GDP during 1998-2003 to a small surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP by 2007. 11. In addition to the macroeconomic assumptions discussed above, this scenario assumes that Georgia will successfully seek a rescheduling from bilateral creditors with whom it has undertaken such an exercise in the past. Principal obligations falling due in 2000 through 2002 and the stock of arrears to Turkmenistan outstanding as of end-1999 are assumed to be rescheduled. Without preempting the possible terms and conditions that bilateral creditors would offer Georgia in the context of a multilateral debt rescheduling exercise, the DSA is based on a working assumption. It is assumed that the stock of arrears would be amortized over ten years with no grace, while principal obligations falling due in 2000-2002 would be rescheduled to be amortized at a graduated rate over 10 years with a three year grace period. The interest rate for rescheduling is assumed to be 4 percent, similar to that provided by creditors in the previous round of rescheduling. In support of the strong adjustment effort, macroeconomic support from the World Bank, projected to be about US$52.5 million in 2000 and US$20 million in 2001 and 2002 respectively, is assumed to materialize. 12. Based on these assumptions, the current account deficit is again projected to remain rather large over the medium term, averaging about 10 percent between 2000 through 2002. The capital account is again projected to worsen over the medium-term, largely because of a decline in external disbursements. In this scenario, however, the projected financing gap is fully covered by possible Fund financial support of a strong economic reform program and debt relief from bilateral creditors (Table 7 in the staff report). 13. Under this scenario, the proposed debt rescheduling provides relief from the bunching of obligations falling due to bilateral creditors per the previous round of rescheduling (Table 1). As a result, debt service obligations, as a share of exports of goods and non-factor services, would decline sharply in 2000 (13 percent) through 2002 (11 percent). In the period thereafter, as compared to the baseline scenario, debt servicing would follow a more smooth and sustainable path. External debt as a share of GDP, while remaining almost flat through 2002 (63 percent), declines steadily thereafter. The NPV of external debt, while declining steadily from 1999, continues to remain high through 2003 (15 1 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services), before it reaches less than 150 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services in 2004; it declines steadily thereafter. As a share of central government revenue, the NPV figures under this scenario are also quite large. Beginning from a high of 674 percent in 1999, the NPV of external debt as a share of government revenue declines gradually and falls below 250 percent only in 2007 (Table 3). 14. Overall, in addition to providing significant cash-flow relief over the medium term, and while still highlighting the heavy debt burden that Georgia faces over the next 6-7 years, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - APPENDIX V this scenario allows a more sustainable path for debt servicing. It also provides relief in terms of NPV reduction. 15. Based on the two scenarios, it is clear that Georgia’s external burden is very high (Figure 2). It is also clear from the baseline scenario that Georgia does not have the capacity to service external obligations falling due over the medium-term according to the existing schedule. In addition, further debt to finance the gaps in the balance of payments increases the difficulty in servicing debt over the long run. If economic conditions deteriorate more than projected under this scenario, Georgia’s external vulnerability will further increase. This would also imply that the possibility of obtaining financing to fill the gaps at the terms assumed in the scenario will be increasingly difficult. In addition to the substantial cash-flow relief that Georgia can achieve in the medium-term through a debt rescheduling with bilateral creditors, the adjustment scenario envisages a smoothing of debt service obligations over the long run. It also allows for a reduction in NPV terms of its external debt (about 8 percent in 2000). However, this will need to be accompanied by the adoption of a strong economic reform program, which could pave way for macroeconomic support from multilateral and bilateral creditors as a way of reducing Georgia’s external vulnerability. 3 4 If Georgia pursues a strong economic and structural reform agenda (elements of which are highlighted in the main report), the macroeconomic outcome could possibly be superior than projected under the adjustment scenario. In this event, the balance of payments position would be stronger and Georgia’s capacity to service external obligations will be enhanced. ’ As indicated in the text, the authorities are currently in the process of preparing the groundwork towards initiating a second round of rescheduling of debt to bilateral creditors with whom Georgia has conducted a rescheduling in the past. 4 To help the authorities in this endeavor, staff have approached the Paris Club indicating Georgia’s interest in pursuing a multilateral rescheduling exercise, and have kept the Paris Club abreast with the status of Georgia’s relations with the Fund and its other creditors.
