Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in early 1999, the pace of Swaziland’s economic activity has picked up; the rate of consumer price inflation has abated; and the international reserve position has remained relatively comfortable. However, the government budget has moved into a deficit position, and an expected tapering off in receipts f+om the Southern African Customs Union, as well as the costs of the country’s high incidence of HIV infection, pose major challenges for the period ahead. a Against this background, the authorities are already implementing a number of appropriate reforms and policies aimed at enabling the economy to move to a higher output path while maintaining international reserves at prudent levels. Nevertheless, the staff has emphasized the need for the authorities to press forward with additional reforms and policy adjustments if Swaziland is to achieve even scant gains in per capita income over the medium term. l Appropriately phased fiscal consolidation will need to center on expanding both the direct and indirect tax bases and scaling down the large government wage bill. At the same time, budgetary allocations will have to be increased for health and education. l The required strengthening of the banking system calls for implementation of long- overdue actions to enhance the regulatory framework for bank supervision, improve the capital adequacy of banks, and restructure and privatize the Swaziland Development and Savings Bank. Moreover, as Swaziland moves to full capital integration within the Common Monetary Area (CMA), the authorities will need to reduce to a minimum interest rate differentials with South Africa. l In view of Swaziland’s commitment to the CMA and the peg of the lilangeni to the rand, the authorities will need to remain committed to policies that maintain and strengthen the country’s competitiveness. a To help sustain broad-based economic expansion, the staff has urged the authorities to accelerate the pace of structural reforms relating to land tenure arrangements, the restructuring and privatization of additional public enterprises, and implementation of labor-management conciliation mechanisms. The staff has also encouraged the authorities to retain their new, transparent guidelines for foreign direct investment, and to seek other external financing to fund pressing infrastructure needs. 0 The staff has underscored the need for the authorities to make further, wide-ranging improvements in Swaziland’s economic database by following up expeditiously on the recommendations of various Fund technical assistance missions, and, more broadly, to ensure that Fund technical assistance is being put to effective use.

The 2000 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Mbabane during the period April 4-19,200O.’ Swaziland is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 11, 1999. Swaziland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Swaziland has no outstanding use of Fund resources, and is not eligible for assistance under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. 2. Summaries of Swaziland’s relations with the Fund and World Bank Group are provided in Appendices I and II, respectively. Effective surveillance with Swaziland is still hampered by deficiencies in the quality of economic and financial data reported to the Fund relating to the national accounts, other areas of the real sector, the public fmances, and the balance of payments (Appendix III). Therefore, the authorities are urged to make wide- ranging improvements in Swaziland’s economic database. Selected social and demographic indicators are set out on in Appendix IV, and a draft background section for the Public Information Notice is contained in Appendix V. Currently, the World Bank’s operations in Swaziland center on project loans for the development of inf?astructure and directly productive enterprises. Also, the Bank has recently prepared and issued a document entitled Swaziland-Reducing Poverty Through Shared Growth. II. REPORT ON THJI DISCUSSIONS 3. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation with Swaziland, Executive Directors stressed that meeting the principal challenges of delivering higher standards of living and maintaining macroeconomic stability would require the creation of a favorable investment climate that could place the Swazi economy on a higher growth path. Directors attached particular importance to the need to strengthen the public finances through measures that would offset the effects of impending new revenue-sharing arrangements, improve the wage structure and reduce the size of the civil service, and substantially redirect government expenditures to capital outlays and social services. They also emphasized the importance of deepening structural reforms, especially in the parastatal sector. At the same time, they called ’ The government of Swaziland was represented by Mr. John P. Carmichael, Minister for Finance; Mr. Majozi V. Sithole, Minister for Economic Planning and Development; Mr. Martin G. Dlamini, Governor of the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS); Mrs. Musa D. Fakudze, Principal Secretary for Finance; Mr. Ephraim M. Hlophe, Principal Secretary for Economic Planning and Development; and other senior officials responsible for economic and financial matters. The staff representatives were Mr. Saul Rothman (head), Mr. Arto Kovanen, Mr. Gunnar Jonsson, Mr. Markus Haacker (EP), and Ms. Kathleen Brogan (Assistant) (all AFR).

It was against this background that the mission reviewed recent economic and financial developments, and discussed with the authorities recent and imminent policy actions and a scenario that included additional policy adjustments and reforms required for the medium term. A. Recent Economic and Financial Developments, and Policy Actions 5. Responding to an increase in domestic demand associated mainly with an expansionary fiscal stance, the pace of overall activity in Swaziland picked up slightly in 1999, with real GDP estimated to have grown by just over 3 percent (Figure 1 and Table 1). Meanwhile, the rate of consumer price inflation abated from 8 percent in 1998 to about 6 percent (on an annual average basis), as the impact of the sharp depreciation of the rand in 1998 diminished (Figure 2). However, there appears to have been no reversal of the declining trend in private sector employment, and anecdotal evidence suggests that formal unemployment is high and concentrated among the young. Furthermore, although Swaziland is a middle-income country, with a per capita GDP of about US$1,340 in 1999, the World Bank estimates that adult per capita consumption for the poorest 40 percent of its population is equivalent to US$230 or less. 6. The government budget (including grants) (April-March) moved from a surplus of ‘/z of 1 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to a deficit position estimated at 4% percent in 1999/2000, owing largely to an increase in wages and salaries (stemming from the full-year impact of a 15 percent pay raise granted in two stages in 1998 and 1999) and larger subsidies and transfers to public entities (Table 2). As for the government wage bill, at 13 percent of GDP, it remained among the highest in the region and almost twice that of other “small” African countries (see SM/98/268 (12/16/98), page 11). The deficit in 1999/2000 was financed entirely from foreign and nonbank domestic sources. 7. In line with developments in South Africa, monetary conditions in Swaziland eased significantly over the course of 1999, as reflected in the decline of the three-month treasury bill rate from just under 14 percent to 8 percent (Figure 3). Nevertheless, the interest rate on treasury bills in Swaziland remained about 2 percentage points below that in South Africa, which is explained in part by the requirement that Swazi banks hold only domestic assets to meet their liquid asset requirement (see paragraph 22). Reflecting a higher demand for real money balances, the 12-month rate of growth of broad money in Swaziland increased from 13 percent in 1998 to 15*/, percent in 1999, and was met almost fully by a further rise in net foreign assets of the banking system (Table 3). 8.

The capital account also recorded a smaller surplus, attributable to both a slackening in foreign direct investment and higher Swazi pension fund investments in South Africa. However, in light of the large size of errors and omissions--over the period 1995-99, for example, they were some 40 percent larger than the overall balances-Swaziland’s balance of payments data should be regarded with caution. Nevertheless, at end-1999, Swaziland’s net official international reserves were equivalent to 3% months of imports. Moreover, Swaziland’s external debt and debt-service obligations have remained low, at the equivalent of 22V3 percent of GDP and just under 2% percent of exports, respectively. In 1999, as in the previous two years, there was no appreciable movement in Swaziland’s real effective exchange rate. 9. In 1999, the authorities took several policy actions. For example, the liquid asset requirement of commercial banks was lowered from 17% percent to 15 percent; the reserve requirement on the banks was reduced from 6 percent to 4 percent; a revised inspection circular took effect to improve the monitoring of bank loans; and there was a further relaxation of travel allowances (raising them from E 100,000 to E 120,000), emigration facilities (from E 200,000 to E 500,000), study allowances (from E 200,000 to E 240,000), and investment outside the region (from E 100,000 to E 200,000). In addition, Royal Swazi National Airways and the Commercial Division of the Swaziland Dairy Board were partially privatized, and guidelines for investment incentives were issued. Moreover, in the coming months, the company income tax rate will be reduced from 37% percent to 30 percent, in line with the rate in South Africa; the top personal income tax rate will be lowered from 39 percent to 33 percent; the sales tax rate will be increased from 12 percent to 14 percent; and an Industrial Relations Act will be enacted. Also, the government is providing increased resources for social services, with, for example, the budgetary allocation for health and education increasing from 28% percent of current expenditure in 1999/2000 to 29% percent in 2000/O 1. B. Medium-Term Scenario 10. On the basis of the estimated macroeconomic and financial outturn for 1999, the staff discussed with the authorities a scenario through 2004 with the principal objectives of sustaining the recent pace of economic growth (on the order of 3% percent per year) and, given the desirability of maintaining the peg of the lilangeni to the rand, keeping Swaziland’s international reserves at prudent levels (a minimum three-month import cover) (Table 5). For 2000, the scenario took into account prospective higher economic activity in South Africa, as well as the adverse effects of the heavy regional rains and flooding early in the year (which, for example, destroyed about one-third of the maize crop and resulted in direct economic losses estimated at ‘/ of 1 percent of GDP, and caused considerable damage to roads and * South Africa is Swaziland’s dominant trading partner and accounts for about 85 percent and 65 percent of Swaziland’s imports and exports, respectively. .= Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - I Table 4.

For the outer years, account was taken of the expected sustained growth in South Africa; a tapering off in Swaziland’s receipts from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)---which account for about one-half of government revenue-as a result of the impending new revenue-sharing arrangements; projected commodity prices, including oil prices (some 50 percent above their low 1998 level, with an impact on the balance of payments equivalent to 3 percent of GDP); and, very importantly, the fiscal and economic costs of Swaziland’s incidence of HIV infection, which is estimated at 22% percent of the population aged 1549 (Box 1). 11. The staff underscored that achieving even the modest objectives of the scenario- which would permit only scant gains in per capita income (about 1 percent per year) assuming a reduction in the rate of population growth from almost 2% percent per year to 2 percent-would pose major challenges for the authorities. Thus, notwithstanding the recent and imminent policy actions, the authorities would need to press forward with reforms in other key areas so as to enable the economy to move to a higher output path-by maintaining an adequate investment level and enhancing the effectiveness of the country’s capital (Box 2)--while averting unsustainable financial imbalances. Although the authorities considered the medium-term scenario feasible, they hoped to achieve a growth rate higher than that recorded in recent years in order to make a dent in the country’s high level of poverty. They recognized that this would require, among other things, even further significant reforms in the economy, but gave no indication that new major policy initiatives were in the offing. C. Fiscal Policies 12. For the medium term, the staff stressed the need to bring the government budget deficit to a sustainable position, namely, to about 3 percent of GDP by 2004, so as to support needed investment without weakening the external position. At the same time, the fiscal profile would need to allow for a substantial increase in HIV/AIDS-related current expenditure, and, reflecting this, the deficit is projected to reach almost 5 percent of GDP in 2002. 13. To achieve the fiscal objectives, the staff emphasized the importance of a number of revenue reforms, especially as SACU receipts are projected to decline from 16 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 14 percent in 2004; although the modalities of the new revenue- sharing arrangements have yet to be precisely determined, the authorities indicated that, at best, they envisaged SACU receipts increasing only incrementally in absolute terms over the medium terrn3 Therefore, the staff underscored the need to move ahead quickly to boost other tax receipts through adoption of a new income tax bill to expand the taxable base, a 3 For a discussion of the current SACU revenue-sharing arrangements, see SM/98/268 (12/l 6/98), pp. 29-30.

Swaziland: The Impact of HIV/AIDS l In February 2000, the Ministry of Health estimated the rate of HIV infection in Swaziland at 22l/, percent of the population aged 15-49. In this regard, HIV prevalence among pregnant women has risen from 4 percent in 1992 (the earliest survey) to just over 30 percent. These estimates imply that about l$- 2 percent of Swaziland’s working-age population dies of AIDS each year. Based on current estimates of HIV incidence, Swaziland may lose 20-25 percent of its highly educated and skilled population before these people can attain leading positions in the economy or the government. This will have a considerable adverse effect on productivity and the quality of public services. Owing to AIDS, it is now projected that, in the coming years, the fiscal balance would deteriorate by about 1 percent of GDP. In particular, health outlays would need to be 30 percent higher (an increase equivalent to ?, of 1 percent of GDP) in order to accommodate the rise in the number of AIDS patients. Furthermore, the government wage bill would increase by about 2 percent (or Y4 of 1 percent of GDP) because of absenteeism, paid sick leave, and costs of training. Additionally, the AIDS epidemic is having a severe impact on the Public Service Pension Fund (through the payment of pensions for surviving dependents). Officials of the pension fund estimate that, to date, 76 percent of total claims have been AIDS related. Several studies on other countries, based on variations of the neoclassical growth framework, suggest that the impact of AIDS on GDP per capita is negative, but small. In contrast, other empirical studies suggest that AIDS-related employee absenteeism has a significant impact on production costs. Other AIDS-related production costs depend, in particular, on the scale of medical benefits, death-in-service benefits, and company pension plans. From these studies, it appears that AIDS-related costs may well exceed 5 percent of the total wage bill for the formal sector. ’ t For a more detailed discussion of the impact of HIV/AIDS, see the section entitled “The Impact of HIV/AIDS” in the accompanying “Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix.” ’ See Loewenson, Rene, and Alan Whiteside, Social and Economic Issues of HIV/AIDS in Southern Aj-ica, Southern African AIDS Information Dissemination Service, Harare, 1997.

Swaziland: Investment and Growth l This box summarizes an analysis of the growth performance of the Swazi economy since 1972, based on the neoclassical growth model, in which GDP growth is attributed to capital accumulation, labor force increases, and productivity changes. 15 - Figure lV.2. Swaziland: Sources of Growth, 1972-97 (In percent) 10 - Contribution of s- O- Productivity growth’\ . *’ *. , . . . - growth of -5 I capital stock 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 Sources: IMF, International Financial Statistics; and Fund staffestimates. The figure shows that between 1976 and 1984 GDP expanded by 5 percent annually. Of this growth, capital accumulation contributed some 3qj percent annually and growth of the labor force another 13i4 percent, while total factor productivity actually declined by about %‘, of 1 percent annually. Between 1985 and 1989, output growth (83/,percent annually) was led by improvements in total factor productivity (52/3percent annually), while the contribution of capital accumulation (about 1 percent annually) was modest. These large productivity gains were associated particularly with rapid expansion of the manufacturing sector and high rates of foreign direct investment. Over the 1990-97 period, capital accumulation picked up, contributing 2’12 percent annually to GDP growth of some 4 percent. Total factor productivity, however, declined by 3/s of 1 percent annually. These estimates above suggest that, while investment rates in Swaziland have recently been high (an average of 28 percent of GDP over the 199Os), the fast pace of capital accumulation has not translated into high rates of economic growth. Thus, for Swaziland to boost its economic growth rate, both the maintenance of sufficiently high investment levels and enhancement of the productivity of the country’s capital will be required. t For a more detailed discussion of the historical record of investment and growth in Swaziland, see the section entitled “Investment and Growth” in the accompanying “Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix.” Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- strengthening of income tax enforcement, and a widening of the base of the sales tax (Box 3). The authorities expressed a preference for closing loopholes on income taxation by amending the existing income tax law to allow for the taxation of large-scale farming and capital gains and for the application of withholding tax to management fees and royalties. They noted that, although a draft new income tax bill had been prepared, its enactment was not in prospect. 14. On the expenditure front, the staff urged the authorities to press vigorously ahead with implementation of the principal recommendation proposed by the Salaries Review Commission to improve the efficiency of the public sector, namely, to increase the pay of highly skilled workers, and to follow up on forthcoming suggestions of the Public Sector Management Program designed to improve productivity and performance, including a possible scaling down of the civil service. In addition, a significant contribution to deficit reduction would need to come from a restructuring of public entities to reduce their reliance on subsidies and transfers. Moreover, the staff underscored the need for the authorities to significantly redirect expenditure to economic infrastructure and social services, particularly given Swaziland’s AIDS crisis and the need to enhance the skills base of the country’s demographically young population (80 percent of the population is younger than 35 years of age). 15. The authorities responded that, although they were aware of the need to contain the government wage bill, their primary focus was on ensuring enhanced efficiency of the public sector. They, therefore, believed that while there was scope for improving pay relativities, they were less sure that downsizing of the civil service would be feasible, especially at a time when HIV/AIDS-related services would be expanding. The authorities agreed that budgetary allocations for education needed to be increased, especially to improve skills and thereby address the serious unemployment problem, and that outlays for economic infrastructure warranted heightened priority, particularly as a concomitant for foreign direct investment. As for curtailing transfers and subsidies, the authorities were hopeful that a successfully restructured Swaziland Development and Savings Bank (SDSB) would afford appreciable savings (see paragraph 19). 16. Regarding financing, as the outlined fiscal adjustment path implied increases in Swaziland’s external public debt from just below 20 percent of GDP in 1999 to about 29% percent in 2004, the staff stressed the need for the authorities to select capital projects with higher regard for their overall effectiveness, so as to ensure a future capacity to service loans. Moreover, although domestic financing would be relatively modest and could be accommodated easily by a drawdown in government deposits with the banking system (which were equivalent to just over 20 percent of GDP at end- 1999), the staff underscored that such action would complicate the conduct of monetary and credit policy and have adverse consequences, especially for international reserves. In this vein, the staff recommended that, among other things, the authorities facilitate nonbank financing of the government deficit by retaining their fully transparent and market-based mechanism for pricing government securities.

A number of changes expected to take place shortly are likely to have a dampening impact on tax revenue. New arrangements are being negotiated among the SACU member countries and are expected to result in a tapering off in Swaziland’s SACU receipts over the medium term. Furthermore, the government is undertaking to lower both the company income tax rate from 37% percent to 30 percent, in line with the rate in South Africa, and the top personal income tax rate from 39 percent to 33 percent, both of which actions will have an adverse impact on tax revenue. At the same time, the sales tax rate will be increased from 12 percent to 14 percent. Against this background, the authorities will need to take revenue-enhancing measures, so as to safeguard fiscal sustainability without unduly adversely affecting the level of existing public services and permit a much- needed expansion in outlays for health and education. The introduction of a new income tax bill, under consideration by the authorities, would, among other things, extend withholding tax to interest income and dividends paid to residents and to royalties and management fees received by residents; abolish tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and life insurance premiums; rationalize deductions for contributions to pension funds; tax gratuities paid on the termination of fixed-term employment contracts; effectively tax benefits-in-kind provided to employees in the private and public sectors; remove the tax-exempt status of insurance companies and public enterprises; and streamline the depreciation schedule for companies. As a prelude to the eventual introduction of a value-added tax, the coverage of the sales tax would need to be significantly widened to encompass public utilities and the trade sector and be applied to almost all food items. Within the existing income tax law, the authorities are closing loopholes by extending taxation to large-scale farming and capital gains and by applying withholding tax to management fees and royalties.

Banking Sector and External Policies 17. The banking system in Swaziland continues to be burdened by a high ratio of nonperforming loans. The authorities suggested that the ratio of nonperforming loans at the three privsite, foreign-owned commercial banks might even be higher than the 15-20 percent range estimated at the time of the last Article IV consultation discussions, and reiterated that provisioning was often inadequate. As for the govemment-owned SDSB, the authorities stated that the ratio of performing assets was currently about 10 percent, up from the 8 percent ratio indicated by an on-site inspection conducted with Fund technical assistance in March 1998. 18. In discussing initiatives to strengthen bank supervision, the authorities indicated that compliance with the revised inspection circular that had been recently issued was less than satisfactory. They noted that, although a substantially revised Financial Institutions Order had been drafted with the aim of updating and modemizing the legal framework governing banks and other financial institutions, it still awaited government approval, The authorities considered enactment of this order crucial for providing leverage against banks in the event of noncompliance with various guidelines. In the meantime, the central bank was continuing its program of on-site inspections, in part to monitor the quality of bank loans. The staff expressed concern about the long-overdue actions and urged the authorities to strengthen the regulatory framework for bank supervision, as well as to take decisive steps to improve the capital adequacy of banks. 19. For 2000/O 1, the authorities stated that the government intended to make a further injection (equivalent to about 1% percent of GDP) of equity to the SDSB in anticipation of a restructuring of the bank. The staff suggested that a preferable course of action would be to liquidate or privatize the SDSB. However, if political constraints ruled out these first-best options, the staff stressed that the restructured bank should avoid mixing commercial and developmental activities, and that any existing or future developmental funds should be administered by an independent agency and properly accounted for in the government budget. 20. Regarding Swaziland’s exchange rate policy, the staff concurred with the authorities’ assessment that the country’s commitment to the CMA and the peg of the lilangeni to the rand had served Swaziland well in securing broad financial stability. Moreover, in view of Swaziland’s relatively comfortable international reserve position and the virtual stability of its real effective exchange rate, the staff agreed with the authorities that there was a strong case for retaining the present regime. In this regard, the authorities underscored their commitment to keep the country’s competitiveness under continuous review. 21. The staff commended the authorities for the recent relaxation of limitations on access to foreign exchange for specified transactions. Moreover, the staff confirmed that the limitations on access to foreign exchange for travel and education expenses are administrative limits and can be exceeded with central bank approval, and, therefore, do not constitute exchange restrictions under the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

As the authorities considered full capital integration within the CMA as inevitable, the staff stressed the importance of a sound banking system as a precondition for capital account liberalization. In addition, the staff noted that this would require an upward adjustment in the yields of Swazi assets, and that such an adjustment could be achieved by expanding the list of assets eligible for the liquid asset requirement (which is used for prudential purposes) to include South African securities. Furthermore, the staff suggested that the reserve requirement on banks could be gradually lowered toward the level prevailing in South Africa (2% percent), as this would reduce the implicit tax on intermediation and would also help narrow interest rate differentials with South Africa. In response, the authorities indicated that they had some misgivings about further reductions in the reserve requirement, as the action in 1999 apparently had benefited only the banks’ profit margins without leading to a pickup in the rate of growth of credit to the private sector, which, in 1999, was the same (9 percent) as in 1998. 23. Also, given Swaziland’s move to full capital integration within the CMA, the authorities were redoubling their efforts to improve data on the maturity structure of the country’s external debt, especially to permit the calculation of the ratio of international reserves to short-term debt (with the latter on a remaining-maturity basis). E. Structural Reforms 24. In view of the need for Swaziland to promote adequate investment levels, enhance the productivity of capital, and maintain its competitiveness, the discussions on structural reforms focused on several key areas. 25. As the performance of the nonfinancial public enterprises has been a strain on the public finances (through the subsidies granted of up to 2% percent of GDP per year and the exempted payment of company income tax), weakened the efficiency of the economy, and likely deterred foreign investment on account of the resulting weak infrastructure, the staff strongly recommended that the authorities expedite action to restructure and privatize the enterprises. The authorities pointed to the recent partial privatizations of Royal Swazi National Airways (the company is now owned 60 percent by the government and 40 percent by South African Airlink) and of the Commercial Division of the Swaziland Dairy Board (which is now a joint venture between the government (14 percent), Parmalat (an Italian company) (60 percent), and Parmalat Swaziland (26 percent)). In addition, a decision had been taken to restructure the Swaziland Electricity Board, so as to pave the way for private sector funding, and, to this end, discussions on a performance contract were at an advanced stage and revision of the Electricity Act was almost completed. In contrast, only limited progress had been made toward restructuring the Swaziland Television Authority and the Swaziland Post and Telecommunications Corporation. 26. The staff commended the authorities for the imminent enactment of the Industrial Relations Act. The authorities were hopeful that the act would result in more harmonious labor-management relations, especially by permitting greater freedom of association and :-- allowing more than one union per industry. At the same time, however, the staff encouraged - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - the authorities to ensure that the act’s conciliation mechanisms were effectively put in place s.o that Swaziland could secure the benefits from an improved labor-management environment and investment climate. 27. The staff also commended the authorities for the issuance last year of transparent guidelines for investment incentives. In particular, the guidelines grant (i) a 10 percent rate of company income tax (compared with the new regular rate of 30 percent) over a period of 15 years; and (ii) exemption from withholding tax on dividends (15 percent) for the same period to foreign investment projects that, among other things, are being promoted by companies with demonstrably successful track records and have a prospective rate of return of at least 10 percent (as determined by an analysis of the applicant’s detailed project proposal). 28. The staff encouraged the authorities to promote higher levels of domestic investment in the important agricultural sector by changing tenure arrangements on Swazi Nation Land, so as to afford many small-scale farmers the opportunity to provide collateral. However, the authorities indicated that a sufficiently strong national consensus did not currently exist for such a reform. 29. As for economic infrastructure, the staff suggested that the authorities seek other external financing-even on nonconcessional terms, as warranted-to fund pressing needs. On this point, the authorities urged that international fmancial institutions lend to middle- income countries, such as Swaziland, on concessional terms, as, in most cases, large segments of their populations fell below the middle-income threshold. 30. The staff stressed that, although the recent free trade agreement between South Africa and the European Union and the ones envisaged under the Southern African Development Community (SALK) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) would confer welfare gains on the region, these made it even more imperative for Swaziland to implement the key structural reforms discussed above to maintain its competitiveness. Moreover, given the impetus for participation in the SAX, the staff noted that it would be important for Swaziland to minimize the list of sectors to be excluded from intra-SADC liberalization. F. Statistical Issues 31. The authorities pointed to several areas where progress on statistical issues was being made. In the real sector, the Central Statistical Office had undergone a change in management and a revised Statistics Act had been prepared, incorporating proposals recommended by a 1998 STA mission. With respect to the balance of payments, following a 1999 STA mission, the CBS had followed up on most of its recommendations. The methodology for the balance of payments was now consistent with the Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual (fifth edition); efforts were being made to improve the monitoring of data on factor incomes; the monitoring of public sector external debt was expected to improve .--- following the recent implementation of the Commonwealth Secretariat Data Reporting and - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - Management System; and a program for moving to a quarterly compilation of balance of payments statistics had been initiated. The authorities stressed that a lack of sufficient computer resources continued to cause long lags in trade data, and that the large size of errors and omissions reflected, in part, difficulties in fully capturing short-term capital flows between Swaziland and South Africa. As for fiscal data, following a 1999 STA mission, by correcting the differences in institutional coverage, the discrepancy between fiscal and monetary data on financing was largely resolved. 32. Nevertheless, as indicated in paragraph 2, deficiencies in Swaziland’s economic database base are still pervasive. For example, data on GDP by sector of origin are available in current prices only up to 1998; data on GDP by expenditure category are not available in constant prices; and there is no reporting of unemployment data on a regular basis. Moreover, data on central government operations are compiled on a mix of cash and accrual bases, and interest payments on domestic debt are not properly accounted for. 33. Thus, notwithstanding the efforts made to date, the staff urged the authorities to make the still-needed wide-ranging improvements to the country’s economic database to facilitate effective policy formulation and surveillance. To this end, it would be important for the authorities to follow up expeditiously on the recommendations of the various Fund technical assistance missions in recent years, including participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System as a framework for evaluation of the current data system, identification of critical needs, and coordination of the technical assistance. G. Technical Assistance 34. As indicated in Appendix I, Swaziland remains a relatively large recipient of Fund technical assistance. Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation, MAE has continued to provide an advisor at the CBS to help strengthen bank supervision, and, until January 2000, it had provided a long-term advisor to the CBS. During 1999, MAE missions visited the CBS to assist in improving the payments system and to advise on the introduction of electronic payments systems. In March 1999, an FAD mission visited Mbabane to counsel the authorities on a new income tax bill. In April 1999, STA missions visited Mbabane to advise on improving balance of payments and government finance statistics. 35. While the authorities have been following up on STA’s recommendations regarding balance of payments statistics and have taken some actions suggested by STA to eventually improve the national accounts, the action plan to improve government finance statistics has not yet been effectively implemented. Moreover, the new income tax bill, proposed elements of the sales tax, and the revised Financial Institutions Order-all of which benefited from Fund technical assistance-have yet to be enacted. Therefore, the staff alerted the authorities that the continued provision of Fund technical assistance to Swaziland would require clear evidence that the assistance was being put to effective use.

Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in early 1999, the pace of Swaziland’s economic activity has picked up; the rate of consumer price inflation has abated; and the international reserve position has remained relatively comfortable. However, the government budget has moved into a deficit position; there continue to be no gains in private sector employment; and the poverty level remains high. Moreover, an expected tapering off in Swaziland’s receipts from the Southern African Customs Union (the major source of government revenues), as well as the fiscal and economic costs of the country’s high incidence of HIV infection, pose major challenges for the period ahead. 37. Against this background, it will be particularly important for the authorities to press forward with reforms in key areas, so as to enable the economy to move to a higher output path while averting unsustainable financial imbalances. A number of positive policy actions have already been taken by the authorities, and others are imminent. These include a reduction in the company income tax rate, in line with the rate in South Africa, and a lowering of the top personal income tax rate; an increase in the sales tax rate; enactment of an Industrial Relations Act; the partial privatizations of Royal Swazi National Airways and the Swaziland Dairy Board; the issuance of transparent guidelines for investment incentives; and increased budgetary allocations for social services. The authorities have also effected a reduction in the liquid asset requirement for commercial banks; a lowering of the reserve requirement on the banks; the issuance of a revised inspection circular to improve the monitoring of bank loans; and a further relaxation of foreign exchange controls. The authorities realize the need for further reforms, and the staff encourages them to implement the needed wide-ranging measures without delay. 38. In view of the need to phase fiscal consolidation appropriately, it will be necessary for the authorities to move ahead quickly to adopt a new income tax bill, so as to expand the taxable base; strengthen income tax enforcement; and widen the base of the sales tax. On the expenditure front, an improvement in the efficiency of the public sector through a rationalization of the pay scale, especially for highly skilled workers, and a restructuring and possible scaling down of the civil service are called for. In addition, the authorities are strongly encouraged to significantly redirect budgetary outlays to health and education, particularly in view of the AIDS crisis and the need to enhance the skills base of the country’s demographically young population. 39. Given the serious weaknesses in Swaziland’s banking system, the authorities need to undertake without delay long-overdue actions relating to the regulatory framework for bank supervision through the enactment of existing draft legislation; take decisive steps to improve the capital adequacy of banks; and proceed with the long-overdue restructuring and privatization of the large, insolvent, government-owned SDSB. Moreover, as Swaziland intends to move to full capital integration within the CMA, it will be important for the authorities to reduce to a minimum interest rate differentials with South Africa by expanding the list of assets eligible for the liquid asset requirement to include South African securities. --= Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25 - 40. Regarding exchange rate policy, Swaziland’s commitment to the CMA and the peg of the lilangeni to the rand has served the country well in securing broad financial stability, and, in view of Swaziland’s international reserve position and the stability of its real effective exchange rate, the authorities’ intention to retain the present regime has merit. To this end, the authorities will need to remain committed to policies that maintain and strengthen Swaziland’s competitiveness. 41. To help maintain broad-based economic expansion over the medium term, the authorities are urged to accelerate the pace of structural reforms, especially regarding tenure arrangements on Swazi Nation Land, the restructuring and privatization of additional public enterprises, and the effective implementation of conciliation mechanisms under the Industrial Relations Act. Also in this vein, and to help attract much-needed foreign direct investment, the authorities will need to retain their transparent guidelines for incentives. Moreover, the authorities are encouraged to seek other external financing-even on nonconcessional terms, as warranted-to fund pressing infrastructure needs. 42. Despite progress made to date in several areas, further wide-ranging improvements are required in Swaziland’s economic database to facilitate effective surveillance and internal policymaking. To this end, the authorities are encouraged to follow up expeditiously on the recommendations of various Fund technical assistance missions in recent years, including participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System. More broadly, the continued provision of Fund technical assistance to Swaziland will require clear evidence that the assistance is being put to effective use, particularly given the country’s middle-income status. 43. The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Swaziland be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

A technical assistance mission visited Swaziland in 1999 to advise on a new income tax bill. In 1998, LEG assisted Swaziland in drafting a new income tax bill and amendments to the Sales Tax Act. A technical assistance mission from MAE visited Swaziland in 1997 to assist in the drafting of the Financial Institutions Act, and, in 1998, MAE provided an advisor to strengthen bank supervision at the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS). Until January 2000, MAE had provided a long-term general advisor to the CBS. In 1999, MAE also conducted several staff visits to assist in improving the payments system and to advise on the introduction of electronic payments systems. STA sent a mission to Swaziland in 1998 with the objectives of identifying weaknesses in the statistical system and assisting in capacity building, particularly relating to the national accounts and other real sector data. An STA mission visited Swaziland in April 1999 to assist with balance of payments statistics. Another STA mission also visited Swaziland in April 1999 to establish an action plan for improving government finance statistics. Resident Representative None.

Total IDA commitments amounted to US$8.4 million; IBRD commitments amounted to US$lO4.8 million; and IFC commitments amounted to US$38.8 million. The most recent of these operations are an IBRD loan for an Urban Development Project (US$29 million) in 1994, and an IFC loan and equity input of US$3.3 million to Swaziland First Merchant Bank in 1999. The IDA/IBRD assistance has been for a broad range of sectors: roads, education, power, water supply/sewerage, rural and urban development, and development finance. The IFC’s investments have been in support of a development fmance corporation, agro-industrial enterprises producing sugar and cotton, paper pulp production, and textile/garment production. In January 2000, the World Bank issued a policy document on poverty reduction entitled Swaziland-Reducing Poverty Through Shared Growth.

The authorities provide available data to the Fund with a lag of l-2 months, except for the national accounts and international trade data, which are reported with irregular periodic@ and with substantial lags. Real sector data National accounts suffer from serious shortcomings. For example, data on GDP by sector of origin are available in current prices only up to 1998; data on GDP by expenditure category at constant prices are not available; and there is no reporting of unemployment data on a regular basis. For national accounts data, missions rely on estimates provided by the Central Statistical Office. Prices The consumer price index (CPI) was significantly revised in 1998. Monthly consumer price data are published by the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) with a one-month lag. The CPI is reported for different income groups, although an STA mission has recommended that it would be preferable to focus on the index for the all-income group, as significant distortions characterize the narrower indices. Government finance statistics Fiscal data are provided to AFR staff only during missions and/or following budget announcements. The CBS reports to STA fiscal data for publication in IFS. However, no current acceptable data have been reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook. A 1999 government finance statistics (GFS) mission delineated the institutional coverage of the public sector and central government for compiling GFS, and recommended that the same institutional table be used by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to compile fiscal data and by the CBS to compile monetary data. By correcting the difference in institutional coverage, the discrepancy between fiscal and monetary data was largely resolved. The mission prepared detailed GFS tables for budgetary central government directly from the MOF’s existing receipts and payments spreadsheet, and recommended that the coverage be expanded to include extrabudgetary funds and local government. Monetary statistics The CBS provides to the Fund, with a lag of l-2 months, its own balance sheet and a composite balance sheet of the commercial banks, as well as the monetary survey. The data are generally good. However, problems with nonperforming loans and the capitalization of ..-- interest may distort credit data, and the circulation of large amounts of unverifiable South _ African rand make data on money difficult to interpret.

Missions use trade data provided by the CBS. The CBS now adheres to a methodology consistent with the Fund’s Balance ofPayments Manual (fifth edition). However, errors and omissions are large and suggest a need to examine the quality and coverage of data for all components of the balance of payments.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Swaziland On July 19, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Swaziland.’ Background Responding to an increase in domestic demand associated mainly with an expansionary fiscal stance, the pace of overall economic activity picked up in 1999, with real GDP estimated to have grown by just over 3 percent. Meanwhile, the rate of consumer price inflation abated to about 6 percent, as the impact of the sharp depreciation in 1998 of the South African rand (to which the Swazi currency-the lilangeni-is pegged) diminished. However, there appears to have been no reversal of the declining trend in private sector employment; unemployment is high; and, although Swaziland is a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of US$1,340, adult per capita consumption for the poorest 40 percent of its population is equivalent to US$230 or less. Moreover, Swaziland’s incidence of HIV infection is estimated at 22% percent of the population aged 15-49. l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX V The government budget (including grants) in 1999/2000 (April-March) moved to a deficit position estimated at 4% percent of GDP, owing largely to an increase in the wage bill (stemming from the full-year impact of a 15 percent pay raise) and larger subsidies and transfers to public entities. The deficit was financed entirely from foreign and nonbank domestic sources. Monetary conditions eased in line with developments in South Africa, but the interest rate on three-month treasury bills in Swaziland remained about 2 percentage points below that in South Africa. Highly tentative estimates for the balance of payments in 1999 point to another, albeit smaller, surplus in the current account (including transfers) and, at year’s end, Swaziland’s net official international reserves were equivalent to 3% months of imports. Moreover, Swaziland’s external debt and debt-service obligations have remained low, at the equivalent of 22% percent of GDP and just under 2% percent of exports, respectively. A number of policy actions were taken by the government in 1999 and others are imminent. These include a reduction in the liquid asset requirement for commercial banks; a lowering of the reserve requirement on the banks; the issuance of a revised inspection circular to improve the monitoring of bank loans; a further relaxation of foreign exchange controls; a reduction in the company income tax rate in line with the rate in South Africa, and a lowering of the top personal income tax rate; an increase in the sales tax rate; the issuance of guidelines for investment incentives; enactment of an Industrial Relations Act; the partial privatizations of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V Royal Swazi National Airways and the Swaziland Dairy Board; and larger allocations in the 2000101 government budget for social services.
