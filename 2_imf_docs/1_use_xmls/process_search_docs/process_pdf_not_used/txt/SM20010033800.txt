UN peacekeeping forces have been fully deployed. The conflict resulted in a major humanitarian and economic crisis in Eritrea; an estimated 1 million people were displaced, GDP declined, inflation increased and international reserves were nearly depleted. A recent deterioration in diplomatic relations arising from political developments in Eritrea raises uncertainties regarding donor support of the authorities’ economic, reconstruction, and demobilization programs. Report on the Discussions 0 The discussions focused on the authorities’ economic program for 2001-02, which seeks to reconstruct the economy, demobilize and reintegrate combatants, provide adequate humanitarian relief, rebuild administrative and institutional capacity, and begin reversing the macroeconomic imbalances that emerged during the conflict. Real GDP growth is projected to rebound to 7 percent in 2001, and 11 percent in 2002. Inflation would be contained to 15 percent in 2001 and brought down to 5 percent in 2002. International reserves would rise to the equivalent of 2% months of imports in 200 1. 0 The government’s post-conflict Emergency Reconstruction Program (ERP) was developed in close consultation with the World Bank and donors. So far US$244 million of the US$264 million in donor support being sought has been pledged, but Italy and the EU are postponing their decisions on commitments in light of recent political developments in Eritrea. Donor support of the authorities’ US$l97 million demobilization program is similarly at risk. a Given the large demands on the budget arising from reconstruction, demobilization, humanitarian relief, the authorities explained that it would not be feasible to achieve any significant reduction in the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) in 2001. As the projected fiscal deficit was consistent with a sharp decline in domestic financing, the staff concurred that the fiscal program made an important first step toward the restoration of macroeconomic stability. l However, the authorities implemented a tax reform package on October 1,200l that differed in key respects with understandings reached with the staff during the June 2001 discussions. The staff estimates that the revenue shortfall will amount to 1.3 percent in 2001 and about 3 YZ percent in 2002. The shortfall for 2001 could be offset by withholding provisions set aside for contingencies, but the shortfall for 2002 would require significant reductions in projected expenditures in the absence of corrective revenue measures. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- @ The authorities agreed with the staffs recommendation that the government develop and rigorously implement a domestic and external debt strategy focusing on grants and concessional borrowing. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio increased sharply during the war, and is projected to increase further in 2001 because of debt financing of reconstruction. Preliminary analysis indicates that Eritrea would qualify for HIPC assistance based on debt levels projected for end-200 1. Substantial technical assistance is envisaged to strengthen institutional and administrative capacity. Specific areas targeted are fiscal management, banking supervision, monetary statistics, commercial banks’ capacity in project appraisal and credit risk assessment, and economic and social statistics.

Fund missions’ visited Asmara to discuss an economic program that could be supported by Fund resources under its emergency post-conflict assistance program and to hold the 200 1 Article IV consultation discussions. Negotiations on a post-conflict program could not be concluded owing to uncertainties regarding donor support and the implementation of a tax reform package that was not consistent with understandings reached with the staff. Under these circumstances, the agreed macroeconomic program is no longer viable and there is not, at present, a concerted international effort to help the country address the aftermath of the conflict in a comprehensive way (Box 1). 2. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on March 8, 2000. At that time, Executive Directors expressed concern about Eritrea’s difficult economic situation, which was mainly attributable to the war with Ethiopia, and they strongly urged Eritrea and all parties concerned to bring the conflict an early resolution. Directors commended the authorities’ intentions to present to parliament the first-ever public budget in 2000, implement comprehensive tax reform, and make efforts to address institutional capacity constraints with recourse to technical assistance. Directors also urged the authorities to develop a postwar economic strategy aimed at bringing about a quick transition to a peace economy. 3. Eritrea has not had an arrangement with the Fund. Basic economic and financial data are provided in Tables l-6. Technical assistance for fiscal management and to the banking sector is summarized in Appendix I, the medium-term outlook and prospects are summarized in Appendix II, the debt sustainability analysis is summarized in Appendix III, Eritrea’s relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix IV, relations with the World Bank Group are summarized in Appendix V, statistical issues are discussed in Appendix VI, and social and demographic indicators summarized in Appendix VII. II. ECONOMICANDSOCIAL IMPACT OFTHE~ONFLICT 4. While the conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia began in May 1998, fighting was initially sporadic and confined to the area around the southwestern border of Eritrea. Hostilities intensified in May 2000, resulting in an estimated US$565 million in property ’ The Eritrean authorities were represented by Dr. Woldai Futur (Economic Advisor to the Government, Office of the President), Mr. Tekie Beyene (Governor of the Bank of Eritrea), and Mr. Berhane Abrehe (Minister of Finance), as well as other senior officials. The mission held discussions with representatives of the international donor community and officials of the United Nations Mission for Eritrea and Ethiopia (UNMEE).The first mission (November 28-December 14,200O) comprised Messrs. Rogers (head), Nakata and Lueth (all AFR), Ms. Wang (TRE), and Mr. De Zoysa (FAD consultant). The second mission (May 29-June 15,200l) comprised Messrs. Rogers (head), Nakata, Akatu, and Atsou-Dzini (all AFR). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Box 1. Recent Political Developments In early June 200 1, an open letter critical of President Isaias Afwerki’s executive leadership was published on the internet. The letter was signed by 15 members of the central committee of the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ - the ruling party headed by the President), including 3 cabinet ministers and 2 generals. On September 18,2001, 11 of the signatories were arrested and the country’s independent newspapers were closed. A number of journalists were subsequently arrested. The Italian Ambassador to Eritrea, in his capacity as the local representative of the EU presidency, conducted a demarche with President Afwerlci on September 28, expressing concerns about these actions. The Ambassador was expelled the same day and the Eritrean Ambassador to Italy was expelled shortly thereafter. Additional arrests have been made since, including two Eritreau staff working at the U.S. embassy in Asmara. All EU member ambassadors to Eritrea were recalled for consultation. Italy and the EU decision on postponing commitments regarding balance of payments support for Eritrea’s Emergency Reconstruction Program. This support, which amounts to about 11 percent of GDP in 2002, was a crucial component of the agreed macroeconomic framework. damage and loss, equivalent to 93 percent of GDP (Box 2), and preempting planting in regions that account for nearly 80 percent of Eritrea’s crop production. An estimated 1 million Eritreans were displaced by the May offensive and another 335,000 were adversely affected by protracted drought. As a result, almost half of Eritrea’s population will require food and other humanitarian aid for another 12 to 15 months. 5. Macroeconomic imbalances began to emerge early in the conflict. Real GDP fell sharply and inflation accelerated (Table 1 and Figure 1). Declining fiscal revenues and rising defense expenditures led to a rapid expansion in the fiscal deficit, resulting in a sharp deterioration in the external current account and the overall balance of payments, the depletion of international reserves, and a ballooning of government debt. A rapid decline in net foreign assets and a collapse in bank credit to the economy generally helped contain the expansion of broad money. 6. The war adversely affected Eritrea’s institutional and administrative capacity through its impact on staffing, training, and damage to government property. The mobilization of civil servants for military service resulted in staff shortages in a number of key ministries and agencies and prevented civil servants from traveling abroad to receive technical training in policy development and implementation. In addition, technical assistance scheduled to be provided in Eritrea by the Fund and donors was interrupted owing to security concerns. Branch offices of the Treasury, Inland Revenue, Customs, commercial bank branches and other government agencies were destroyed or heavily damaged.

Economic and Social Damages Caused by the May 2000 Offensive Approximately 1.1 million people (about a third of the total population) were forced to leave their homes during the offensive and live in camps, move in with relatives, or flee to Sudan. Deportees from Ethiopia (about 70,000), most of whom left all their assets behind, have added to the humanitarian crisis, further stretching the overburdened traditional support mechanisms. In September 2000, the government of Eritrea, in coordination with the University of Asmara, completed an assessment of the war damages arising from the May 2000 hostilities. The assessment encompassed property damages inflicted upon: farming households (houses, livestock animals, cereals, agricultural implements, and household items), nonfarming households (shops, hotels, restaurants, and small businesses), residential households (urban houses and their valuables), public infrastructure (schools, hospitals, health centers, and government offices), and expensive property (agricultural and industrial complexes, bridges and roads, vehicles, and large equipment). Farming households account for 62 percent of total monetary losses, nonfarming households 17 percent, and other property 21 percent. The value of lost livestock was US$225 million. About 55,000 private houses (US$41 million) are estimated to have been destroyed, and the damages to public buildings are estimated at US$24 million, including US$5 million for schools and US$3 million for hospitals and health facilities. Source: World Bank. 7. GDP growth declined from about 8 percent in 1997 to less than 1 percent in 1999, and GDP fell by 8 percent in 2000 because of a 62 percent decline in crop production2 and the loss of physical capital. Inflation was largely under control through mid-1999, but a temporary surge in broad money and a worsening of supply conditions pushed inflation from 11 percent at end-1999 to 27 percent by December 2000 (on an end-period basis). 8. The war put severe pressure on the public finances. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) increased from 12 percent of GDP in 1997 to 68 percent in 2000 as revenues collapsed and expenditures surged (Table 2).3 Against this background, government debt increased from 47 percent of GDP in 1997 to 177 percent in 2000. Revenues fell primarily because of a sharp decline in port fees associated with transshipment of goods to and from Ethiopia (Table 3). In response to these revenue shortfalls, the government imposed a temporary surtax on personal and business income in 1998. In addition, Eritreans living abroad made substantial voluntary contributions. The largest single source of the expenditure surge was military operations, outlays for which increased from 14 percent of GDP in 1997 2 Of this decline, the staff estimates that 44 percentage points are attributable to the displacement of farmers in May 2000 and the rest to the drought. 3 The deficit excludes errors and omissions equivalent to 4.3 percent of GDP, which arise from the practice of recording expenditures when receipt of payment has been reported to the treasury, while bank financing is recorded on a cash basis. In addition, some government accounts with commercial banks are misclassified.

The government commenced reconstruction immediately after the cessation of hostilities in the second half of 2000, focusing on bridge repair, rehabilitation of water systems, the provision of agricultural equipment and seeds, and debt relief to commercial banks.

The growth of broad money was limited to an average of 24 percent a year during 1997-2000, with declines in net foreign assets and credit to the economy partially offsetting the expansionary impact of bank credit to the government (Tables 4 and 5 and Figure 2). Interest rates were largely stable in nominal terms, reflecting administrative controls, with real interest rates becoming increasingly negative as inflation accelerated.5 The banking system suffered an estimated US$34 million (5.6 percent of GDP) in loan losses as a 4 The staff found defense expenditure data in general to be detailed and comprehensive. The authorities provided staff with detailed (monthly) budgetary outlays for defense by department. The office of the Auditor General (AG) has completed its audit of the 1999 accounts of the Ground Forces Department of the Ministry of Defense, but the draft report has not been issued. 5 The interest rate on domestic debt is administratively set at 2.5 percent a year. Lending rates are effectively capped at 12 percent through laws that limit the extent to which creditors can seize securing assets.

In addition, the use of commercial bank assets by the authorities to support the exchange rate,6 together with an increase in foreign currency deposits, increased the foreign exchange exposure of banks. 10. The deteriorating fiscal position put extreme pressure on the balance of payments and was the principal cause of the increase in the external current account deficit over the 1997-2000 period (Figure 1 and Table 6). With the loss of the Ethiopian market, nongold merchandise exports fell by 63 percent during the three-year period.7 Rising defense and food imports squeezed private nonfood imports, which fell by an estimated 32 percent. The capital account surplus diminished as official disbursements were insufficient to offset the sharp decline in private capital flows. As a result, the overall balance of payments moved from a surplus to a deficit position, and international reserves fell from US$260 million (5.3 months of imports) to US$37 million (less than 1 month of imports), from 1997 to 2000. 11. Eritrea retained a market-determined exchange rate regime through most of the war years. Despite the substantial decline in real income and the sharp increase in the budget deficit, the real effective exchange rate remained broadly stable during the conflict. Notwithstanding heavy foreign exchange sales by the BE, the nominal effective exchange rate fell by 18 percent between end-1997 and mid-2000 (Figure 1). With reserves nearly depleted and wary of the impact of a rapid depreciation on domestic inflation, the authorities implemented exchange controls in July 2000, fixing the exchange rate at ERN 10 per U.S. dollar and prohibiting the sale of foreign exchange by exchange bureaus except to the central bank. As a result, the real effective official exchange rate appreciated sharply as inflation began to accelerate, undermining the competitiveness of exports8 These controls were subsequently lifted (see paragraph 30 below). 12. The stock of Eritrea’s external public and publicly guaranteed debt (disbursed) increased more than fourfold from end-1997 to end-2000 (Table 6). About 90 percent of this was contracted prior to the outbreak of hostilities to finance public infrastructure (primarily 6 The Commercial Bank of Eritrea (CBE) is wholly owned by the government. The use of its foreign exchange reserves was subject to approval by the Bank of Eritrea. 7 In a one-time operation, the Bank of Eritrea exported US$l5 million worth of non- monetary gold in 2000. 8During the period of the controls, most international trade occurred at the parallel rate (which largely retained its value in real effective terms) through thefranco valuta system, by which foreign exchange swaps between residents with local bank accounts, and external transactions between resident and non residents, are permitted. The parallel market premium increased to about 80 percent by November 2000, but subsequently appreciated to about 25 percent in June 2001.

The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio rose sharply from 21 percent at end- 1997 to 207 percent at end-2000. With the expiration of the grace period on many of these loans and the decline in export earnings, the debt-service ratio increased from less than 1 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services in 1997 to about 11% percent in 2000. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 13. Eritrea’s major short and medium-term challenges are how to restore macroeconomic stability and economic growth in the face of a major humanitarian crisis and massive destruction of capital. A reduction of the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) will be difficult in the short run owing to increased fiscal outlays for reconstruction, demobilization and humanitarian assistance. In addition, fiscal revenues will be lower owing to a general reduction of tax rates and the loss of revenues derived from trade with Ethiopia. In the short term, the restoration of economic growth will depend primarily on a recovery in agricultural production. Beyond that, high rates of economic growth require the restoration of private- sector productive capacity through the reconstruction of infrastructure and the provision of capital and intermediate inputs and financial support. In addition, growth cannot be restored without easing labor supply constraints by demobilizing soldiers. The government’s macroeconomic, reconstruction and demobilization programs will, if fully implemented, adequately address these constraints to growth. However, the successful implementation of these programs will require substantial donor assistance, which has become uncertain in the wake of the recent political rift between the government and the EU. 14. The authorities’ basic macroeconomic objectives are to contain inflation at about 15 percent in 2001, reduce it to 5 percent by end-2002, and to increase the import coverage of international reserves to about 1% months in 2001 and 2% months in 2002. Real GDP growth is projected to rebound sharply reflecting a recovery in crop production and the impact of the reconstruction program. However, the growth target for 2002 will be difficult to achieve in the absence of balance of payments support for the ERP from Italy and the EU (11 percent of GDP in 2002) that is currently being reviewed.’ 15. There are indications that macroeconomic stabilization is taking root. In response to a tightening of monetary policy, supported by fiscal restraint, inflationary pressures have abated. The domestic fiscal deficit (revenues less domestic expenditures) in the first half of the year was 6 percent of GDP, compared with 27 percent of GDP in 2000 as a whole, and broad money growth was contained to about 20 percent, in line with the Bank of Eritrea’s target. Nonfood inflation declined from a peak of 26 percent in November 2000 9 The Italian loan (US$27.5 million) was approved, but the financial protocols had not been signed before diplomatic relations deteriorated. The proposed EU grant (US$50 million) has not yet been approved. There have been no disruptions of other donor support pledged toward the ERP(US$166.5 million, see Box 4).

International reserves increased from US$36 million at end- December 2000 to US$40 million at end-September 2001 and the spread between the parallel and foreign exchange bureau exchange rates fell from about 80 percent in late 2000 to about 7 percent by September 2001 following the lifting of the exchange controls. A. Fiscal Policy 16. The authorities indicated that the outbreak of hostilities in May 2000 had preempted the submission of the government’s draft 2000 budget to parliament. They expressed their intention to submit the draft 2001 budget to parliament and to make it public early in the year, but parliament was not convened because of (inter alia) delays in preparing legislation governing the upcoming elections. 17. Given the large demands on the budget arising from reconstruction, demobilization, humanitarian relief, and a general reduction in tax rates, the authorities explained that it would not be feasible to achieve any significant reduction in the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) in 200 1 (Table 2). The authorities expected declines in defense expenditures to underpin a substantial decline of the deficit in 2002. The domestic fiscal deficit, however, was targeted to decline in both years.” Eritrea: Summary of Fiscal Operations, 1997-2002 (In percent of GDP) 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Total revenue 42.9 33.6 34.6 Total expenditure and net lending 55.0 85.7 102.3 Overall balance (excluding grants) -12.1 -52.1 -67.7 Domestic balance -1.6 -33.3 -45.1 External grants 6.1 10.3 a.9 Overall balance (including grants) -5.9 -41.8 -58.8 External borrowing 4.3 9.7 15.9 Domestic borrowing 4.2 35.0 42.7 Errors and omissions/financing gap -2.6 -2.8 0.2 Est.

The government’s 2001 fiscal program was based on conservative revenue projections and incorporated measures to simplify the tax system and improve tax and customs administration. The government proposed some modifications to the tax reforms lo The domestic balance is a proxy for the government’s net absorption of domestic resources. It is defined as revenue less expenditure, excluding outlays on the ERP, humanitarian assistance, demobilization, external interest, and other externally financed recurrent and capital projects.

The new regime is a significant improvement and goes far in streamlining the tax regime. However, the actual tax rates implemented on October 1,200l were, in many cases, lower than what had been discussed.” The staff estimates that the revenue impact of the lower rates will be on the order of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2001 and about 3% percent of GDP in 2002 (Table 2) in the absence of corrective measures. I2 The loss of petroleum revenues accounts for most of the shortfall. 19. Total expenditure in 2001 is projected to fall only moderately to 96 percent of GDP; savings in defense spending will be largely offset by substantial outlays for reconstruction, demobilization, and humanitarian relief. Total defense expenditures are budgeted to fall sharply, from 37 to 21 percent of GDP, based on the demobilization of about 200,000 troops by the end of next year. Core government expenditures13 are budgeted to remain constant in real terms in 2001, which should be sufficient to finance essential government services and non-ERP capital projects. While the projected revenue shortfall in 200 1 could be offset by holding back provisions under contingencies, the shortfall for 2002 would require significant additional adjustments to projected expenditures in the absence of corrective revenue measures. The government’s program incorporates numerous measures to strengthen expenditure management and fiscal reporting, with a view to ensuring fiscal discipline, improving the transparency of fiscal operations, and reducing errors and omissions in the fiscal accounts (Box 3 and Appendix 1). I1 See Box 2 of the 1999 Article IV consultation report (SM/OO/38; February 22,200O) for the FAD proposals. The authorities had suggested a higher maximum import duty of 40 percent for selected imports and a minimum duty of 2 percent for raw material and capital goods (compared to 25 percent and 5 percent recommended by FAD). They also proposed some changes to selected excises. In the tax reform package actually implemented, the maximum duty is 25 percent and excises on alcohol, beer and other goods were lower than proposed. Most importantly, the government did not raise gasoline and diesel taxes, which were to be the main offset to the revenue reducing trade reform package. I2 There has been no deterioration in administrative capacity since the original revenue projections for 2001-02 were made. The downward revision is due solely to the lower tax rates.

The authorities developed a US$l97 million demobilization program in consultation with the World Bank and other donors, who pledged a total of US$132 at the recent Development Partners Conference held in Asmara during September 1 l- 13,200 1. However, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- donor support, beyond US$50 million from the World Bank, is highly uncertain in light of the deterioration of diplomatic relations between the government and the EU. Most of the outlays would be in the form of income support for a total of 200,000 demobilized soldiers, but they would also include provisions for training, reintegration services, and technical and medical support. The government intends to demobilize 80,000 troops in 2001 and the remainder by the end of March 2002, depending on progress in the peace process. Outlays on demobilization would be limited to donor resources received. l4 21. The ERP (Box 4) emphasizes restoring private sector productive capacity. The rebuilding of roads and bridges will restore market access and reduce production costs. Resources for social protection will enable households to maintain consumption levels, provide them with housing, and restore health and education services that were disrupted by the conflict. B. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reforms 22. The authorities indicated that the objective of monetary policy was to bring inflation firmly under control. Toward this end, the Bank of Eritrea (BE) indicated that it will implement a reserve money program together with a flexible exchange rate regime. The reserve money program discussed during the June 2001 mission was based on the cautious assumptions of rising money velocity and a constant money multiplier (Figure 2). However, reserve money growth through August 2001 was substantially lower than targeted.15 Open market operations are not possible in the current environment of a highly concentrated government-dominated banking sector and the existence of interest rate controls.16 As a result, monetary policy will continue to be implemented through moral suasion and the administrative placement of fixed-interest government securities with commercial banks. l4 The authorities indicated that they would proceed with demobilization even in the event of a shortfall in donor support, limiting payments for income support and the provision of services to amounts received from donors. However, as of October 25, demobilization had not yet commenced. I5 After the June mission, the staff learned that reserve money contracted sharply as a result of the government’s assumption of commercial bank debts to Ethiopian banks. Funds were transferred from the commercial banks’ deposits at the BE to the government, which used the funds to retire government treasury securities held by the BE. As a result, reserve money declined by 12.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, against a targeted 14.3 percent increase for the year ending September. As of August, the monetary impact of the transaction has been limited to a reduction in the level of excess reserves of the commercial banks; broad money growth (at 19 percent) was on target. l6 The Commercial Bank of Eritrea is wholly government owned and accounts for about 80 percent of commercial bank assets and deposits. The other commercial bank is wholly owned by the PFDJ (the ruling political party). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- Box 4. Emergency Reconstruction Program, 2001-2002 The ERP comprises four main project componentmgricultue, infrastructure rehabilitation, private sector reconstruction, and social protectiopas well as balance of payments support, program management, and monitoring. Including contingencies, the total project cost comes to US$288 million over three years. Donors have pledged US$244 million and the government will cofinance US$24 million, leaving a US$20 million gap. The first year of the program is fully funded. The key features of each project component are as follows: . Agricultur+purchase and distribution of essential agricultural inputs (seeds and fertilizer), as well as livestock, tools and machinery; . Infrastructure rehabilitation-(i) restoration/rehabilitation of key roads and bridges, restoration and provision of access to settlements/camps, (ii) rehabilitation of Massawa power plant, and .

Impact of September 11 The impact of the September 11 attacks on the world economy will affect Eritrea primarily through two channels; the terms of trade and worker remittances from Eritreans residing in industrialized countries. The trade balance would improve as lower prices for food and petroleum imports will offset the decline in export revenues. If private transfers decline in proportion to income in industrialized countries, the net effect on the balance of payments would be to reduce the external financing gaps by US$4 million in 2002 and US$14 million in 2004. However, the projections of the impact are highly sensitive to the effect of recent events on private transfers and foreign direct investment. An additional 10 percent reduction in these flows would increase external financing gaps by about US$26 million i (3.9P ercent of GDP) in 2002 and US$29 million (3.8 percent of GDP) in 2004. commercial banks will be strengthened with financial support from the World Bank as part of the ERP. Interest rates on government securities will continue to be administratively determined during the next few years. However, the authorities favorably received the staffs recommendation that this interest rate be adjusted upward in the medium term to yield a positive real yield as part of the financial market liberalization strategy. C. Balance of Payments and External Policies” 24. The balance of payments projections assume a reversal of the underlying deterioration experienced during the war-a strong recovery of exports,18 an increase in transfers, and increases in official capital flows-but also incorporate the temporary import surge associated with substantial aid inflow during the program period. The prospects for an improved balance of payments and a buildup of international reserves depend on the availability of international food assistance and the prospects for balance of payments support from Italy and the EU in 2002 under the EIW. 25. The mission met with members of the donor community, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC) to discuss the outlook for food security through 2002. The World Food Program (WFP) and ERREC issued a joint appeal for assistance. Donors had pledged a total of US$64 million through June 2001, leaving an uniinanced food requirement of US!82 million (12 percent of GDP) through 2002. 26. The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to increase in 2001 before contracting in 2002 and beyond. (Table 6). Donors substantially increased their commitments in support of the ERP and humanitarian relief. However, additional commitments (including support of the ERP pledged, but not committed, by Italy l7 The balance of payments projections are based on the pre-September 11 WE0 assumptions. ‘s While exports (excluding gold) are projected to increase on the order of 20-25 percent a year, they would still be less than half the value realized in 1997. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- and the EU, and support for demobilization) would be necessary to fully implement the government’s programs. As noted above, the prospects for donor funding of the demobilization program depend on the outcome of EU deliberations, but outlays on demobilization would, in any case, be limited to amounts received from donors. If the projected food gap is not financed by donors, the BE would forgo part of the projected US$94 million accumulation of reserves, through end-2002, to finance food imports. If relations with donors are normalized, the balance of payments support pledged by Italy and the EU (11 percent of GDP in 2002) could close the remaining gap in 2002. 27. In the absence of this support, the current account deficit would need to contract sharply, primarily through a reduction of imports. The staff estimates that real GDP growth would fall to 3 percent in 2002, compared with the 11.3 percent envisaged in the baseline projection. Without corrective fiscal and monetary policies, inflation would be on the order of 13 percent, against the targeted 5 percent. Achieving 5 percent inflation rate in the absence of the balance of payments support would require reducing money growth to about 6 percent in 2002 (compared with a projected 14.6 percent), which would entail lowering the fiscal deficit by ERN 585 million (6.6 percent of GDP) to 40.8 percent of GPD (excluding grants). To this end, domestic expenditures will need to be reduced by about 17 percent compared with projections made during the June 2001 discussions. 28. Eritrea has remained current on debt obligations. The authorities indicated that they are implementing a domestic and external debt strategy by which it will seek grant assistance to the fullest extent possible and contract new external debt only on IDA terms or better.” 29. The authorities repealed the exchange controls imposed in July 20002’ and commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are once again free to buy and sell foreign exchange at market-determined exchange rates. However, the buying rate has remained I9 The authorities expressed the view that medium-term (l-6 year) dollar-denominated government debt sold to Eritreans living abroad is more concessional than IDA debt because the interest rate on this debt is zero. However, the staff estimates that the grant element of this debt is only about 20 percent (for 6-year maturities). 2o The controls were legally removed on August 15, 2001 and the Bank of Eritrea issued guidelines to commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus on August 29 notifying them that they could legally adjust their rates in accordance with market forces. With the repeal of the controls, the foreign exchange regulations issued May 1, 1998 are once again legally effective. These regulations make no reference to limits on purchase of foreign exchange for any purposes (other than for reasons of health or national security). The exchange restrictions previously identified under Article XIV, therefore, appear to have been eliminated. However, staff will continue to review the operation of the foreign exchange market in Eritrea and consult with the authorities to ascertain any measures that may fall within the Fund’s jurisdiction.

The authorities said that this was not the result of government or central bank policy; apparently there is some collusion among dealers, which will need to be addressed if the foreign exchange market is to function effectively. 30. With the implementation of the new tariff regime, Eritrea’s trade regime is among the more liberal in Africa. The number of tariff bands have been reduced from 12 to 3 and the maximum duty was reduced from 200 to 25. These reforms should reduce the weighted average tariff rate from 17 percent to about 12 percent. There are no taxes on exports, and there are no non-tariff trade barriers except the prohibition of selected imports for health or national security reasons. 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Eritrea: NakfaAJS Dollar Exchange Rate, January 1997 - September 2001 (Monthly averages) 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 D. Technical Assistance, Capacity Building, and Statistical Issues 31. Technical assistance for capacity building will focus on four areas: fiscal operations, banking supervision, commercial bank operations, and economic and social statistics. A key component of the technical assistance program is a two-year US$2.4 million project to strengthen fiscal management capacity which has been developed by the authorities in close cooperation with the Fund (FAD).21 The project will focus on improving expenditure 21 The project is being financed by the Fund (17 percent) and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (50 percent). The Italian Directorate for Development Cooperation has expressed a willingness to fund the remaining 33 percent, but a final decision is not expected until the EU concludes its deliberations on future relations with Eritrea. Technical assistance for other projects from other EU members could also be affected. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- management, fiscal reporting, tax and customs administration, and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework (Box 1, Appendix 1). Additional technical assistance is being provided by the World Bank as part of the ERP. 32. Eritrea’s macroeconomic database is seriously deficient and complicates macroeconomic policy analysis. Eritrea does not provide information to the Fund for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Data on poverty are extremely scarce: no household income and expenditure survey has been completed, there are no national accounts22, no census has been conducted, and data on domestic prices are limited to Asmara. The National Office of Statistics and Evaluation is concluding discussions with donors for support of a multiyear program to improve price, production, and national accounts statistics, and to undertake a household survey. The latter will be a crucial component of Eritrea’s poverty reduction strategy. The BE has made a substantial progress with the help of the Fund STA technical assistance mission to improve the quality of money and banking statistics. IV. STRUCTURALREFORMS 33. The discussions on other structural reforms focused on financial sector liberalization, privatization, energy policy, and remaining price controls. 34. The authorities highlighted their strategy of licensing new banking institutions and opening the financial sector to foreign competition. They indicated that they did not intend to break up the CBE, but agreed that it would be necessary to plan for an orderly downsizing of the bank as it faced increasing competition; they suggested that they were willing to consider its privatization once competition has been established. The authorities are of the view that the other commercial bank (Housing and Commerce Bank) is currently in the private sector, as it is wholly owned by a political party, the PFDJ. The authorities also broadly accepted the staffs view that financial sector reform, bank recapitalization, interest rate liberalization, and the development of government securities markets would need to be appropriately sequenced given their potential impact on the budget and debt sustainability. In this regard, the strategy would focus first on reducing inflation, liberalizing interest rates gradually, recapitalizing the CBE (if necessary), preparing it for an orderly downsizing, and promoting a government securities market. 35. The authorities indicated that, in general, their public enterprise reform program focused on privatizing commercial entities and limiting the government’s role to regulation and oversight. A total of 34 manufacturing enterprises were divested through 22 There are no official national accounts. Fund staff assists the authorities in making GDP estimates from available, albeit poor quality, source data. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - March 200 1, leaving 6 more which the authorities hope to sell or liquidate soon.23 The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to privatize the government-owned hotels, especially the Intercontinental, which was purchased by the government in 2000 at substantial cost (8 percent of GDP).24 The authorities are planning to offer 49 percent of the Telecommunications Service of Eritrea (TSE) and a new operating license was issued in 2001 to a private consortium (Eritel) for the provision of cell phone services. The PFDJ owns and operates about six enterprises, including the Red Sea Trading Corporation. The government considers these to be part of the private sector, but some donors expressed concerns that these enterprises receive preferential treatment from the government and the public financial sector and that this inhibits private-sector investment, including foreign direct investment. 36. The government intends to retain full ownership of the Petroleum Corporation of Eritrea (PCE) and to continue to administratively set domestic wholesale and retail petroleum prices. As wholesale petroleum prices have been raised five times since December 1999 and are above world prices, and no fuel shortages have appeared, the staff did not urge the authorities to include the PCE in the privatization program. The authorities did, however, concur with the staff’s view that the PCE should adjust domestic fuel prices more often (monthly or weekly) to ensure the financial viability of the PCE and to promote efficient resource allocation. 37. Other price controls that remain in place apply to pharmaceuticals and bread. The authorities indicated that they intended to remove price controls for products sold in the private sector, but will continue to sell them to patients of the state-owned hospitals at subsidized prices. A special price applies to a small loaf sold through private bakeries, which are free to sell other products (including other bread products) at market prices. This arrangement has not given rise to any shortages and the staff did not recommend its removal at this time. V. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK, IPRSP, AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 25 38. While substantial progress in restoring economic stability can be made in the medium term, Eritrea’s macroeconomic imbalances are projected to remain unsustainable. Nonetheless, against the background of demobilization, the completion of reconstruction, a 23 Enterprises are sold through public auction and the bids are opened in public. In all but one case, the contract was awarded to the highest bidder. The exception involved a bidder who was deemed not to have the necessary experience to operate the enterprise. 24The construction of the hotel was financed by the state-owned CBE. When the investors were unable to service their loans, the government assumed their liabilities to the CBE and ownership of the hotel. 25 See Appendix II for details of the medium-term outlook, and Appendix III for the DSA.

The external current account deficit is projected to fall to 19 percent. The medium-term outlook envisages a slight increase in the overall debt-to-GDP ratio through 2001, as external debt rises to support reconstruction and demobilization, and then a slight decline (see figure below).26 Fiscal conservatism in the medium term will be especially important given the gradual liberalization of interest rates, which will result in an increase in the domestic interest burden even as the debt/GDP ratio declines. Given the size of the projected financing gaps, Eritrea would need to limit new borrowing and substantially reduce the fiscal deficit to reverse the unsustainable debt dynamics that emerged during the war. Achieving high rates of broad-based economic growth will require appropriate fiscal and monetary policies and structural reforms supported by donor grant assistance at levels well in excess of the historical average. 160 80 40 0 Eritrea: Central Government Debt and Interest Payments, 1993 - 2004 (In percent of GDP) Projections 8 6 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 26 In the absence of any rescheduling of external debt and on the assumptions of the debt sustainability analysis (see below).

The authorities presented their Transitional Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (2001- 2002) to donors during the Development Partners Conference held in Asmara during September l l-13,200l. The paper contains many elements of an I-PRSP, but more will need to be done in mapping out the participatory process. In this regard, progress in implementing the new constitution, which was ratified in May 1997, would help establish a clear framework in which to carry the participatory process forward. It would also help improve governance, transparency and accountability. 40. Four main conclusions emerge from the DSA. First, while the burden of the debt disbursed by end-2000 diminishes quite rapidly, the impact of new disbursements from loans already contracted will dominate the future debt dynamics. Second, even if the projected balance of payments gaps are financed by grants (with the exception of the proposed IDA loan for demobilization), the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio will remain above 150 percent throughout most of the decade in the absence of further rescheduling, and this is true even if private debt to Eritreans living abroad is excluded from the analysis. Third, traditional rescheduling mechanisms could significantly reduce the debt burden, but the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain above 150 percent after such rescheduling, given the projected large disbursements of multilateral debt in 2001 and 2002. Fourth, even under a more optimistic export scenario in which relations with Ethiopia are normalized, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain above 150 percent until the middle of the decade. VI. STAFF APPRAISAL 41. The authorities have made substantial progress in stabilizing the economy and in reconstructing the economy since the conflict with Ethiopia ended in June 2000. Immediately after the end of hostilities, the government began implementing its three-year ERP. This is a comprehensive program that appropriately focuses on restoring conditions conducive to, and providing resources necessary for, a private-sector-led economic recovery. The government has worked closely with the World Food Program to formulate a joint plea for food aid to address the humanitarian crisis generated by the war and drought. On the macroeconomic front, inflation has been brought down and international reserves have increased. These developments have been made possible by a contraction in the domestic fiscal deficit, appropriate monetary policy, and substantial donor support. 42. Unfortunately, the prospects for a continuation of these trends are uncertain in light of the recent diplomatic rift between Eritrea and the EU. The reconstruction program will not be viable in the absence of the balance of payments support pledged by Italy and the EU. Furthermore, it is difficult to envisage the restoration of macroeconomic stability in Eritrea without substantial additional support from donors. Against this background, every effort should be made to restore relations with donors as soon as possible in order to unlock much- needed international financial support. In addition, while the staff recognizes the substantial improvements in tax policy introduced by the authorities, it strongly urges them to raise gasoline and diesel tax rates as they had indicated they would, and to take other revenue Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - measures necessary to place the fiscal accounts on a sound path. The restoration of donor support of the ERP and new understandings between the authorities and the staff on an economic program for 2002 would help establish the basis for a post-conflict assistance next year, with a view to moving to a PRGF at a later date. 43. Given the spending pressures arising from reconstruction and humanitarian relief, a significant contraction of the fiscal deficit, necessary for the restoration of macroeconomic stability, cannot be achieved without a sharp decline in military expenditures. The government’s fiscal program for 200 1, if fully implemented, will constitute and important first step toward this objective. The authorities’ demobilization plan will facilitate sizable reduction in the fiscal deficit (relative to GDP) in the future. Despite the uncertainties surrounding donor support of the demobilization program, the staff urges the authorities to proceed with demobilization in order to support fiscal adjustment and to ease labor supply constraints that have hampered economic recovery. The staff appreciate the very frank and open discussions with the authorities on defense policy, including detailed data on defense expenditure. 44. Achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the authorities will require a steadfast adherence to the fiscal and monetary targets. Specifically, it is important that the authorities ensure that the targeted domestic fiscal balance is achieved. This will require offsetting any shortfall in revenues with equivalent reductions in domestic outlays, and offsetting any overruns in defense spending with corresponding cuts in nonpriority programs. The envisaged improvements in expenditure management, fiscal reporting, and revenue administration will be crucial to the success of the government’s economic program. Furthermore, strong measures are needed to improve the transparency and accountability of public expenditures. The authorities’ intentions to strengthen the underlying legal and regulatory framework for public expenditures are welcome. This framework will also lay the groundwork for undertaking timely and comprehensive audits of public finances by the Auditor General in the future. To further strengthen governance, transparency and accountability, the staff strongly urges the authorities to submit the 2002 draft government budget to the parliament for approval and to make this draft and the approved budget available to the public. 45. Considerable uncertainties surround the stability of the money multiplier and money demand. The BE should, therefore, closely monitor inflation and broad money developments in order to ensure that the recent sharp contraction in reserve money and excess reserves of the banking system do not lead to an undesired monetary contraction. Otherwise, the envisaged economic recovery could be forestalled. At the same time, the BE should be prepared to tighten monetary conditions further if there are signs that inflation might be higher than targeted. The staff also urges the authorities to begin gradually raising the interest rate on government domestic debt and to introduce legislation to remove the effective cap on commercial bank lending rates. These steps will be crucial to the development of financial services necessary to support economic growth. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - 46. The staff welcomes the removal of the exchange controls that were imposed in July 2000. The foreign exchange regulations issued in May 1998 are now in force and provide an adequately liberal regulatory basis for a market-determined exchange rate. However, the staff is concerned that the persistent rigidities in the foreign exchange market and the stickiness of the exchange rate will lead to another round of real exchange rate appreciation. The staff urges the authorities to implement measures to remove the apparent collusion that is preventing exchange rate flexibility. 47. The DSA indicates that Eritrea’s external debt has risen to an unsustainable level. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to a comprehensive debt strategy, including both internal and external debt, focusing on grant financing or highly concessional debt financing. The staff urges the authorities to refrain from selling additional debt to Eritreans living abroad, as it believes that grant element of this debt is not sufficiently high to be consistent with the authorities’ debt strategy. With the objective of restoring and maintaining debt sustainability, the staff recommends that Eritrea pursue the application of traditional rescheduling mechanisms. A PRGF supported program would help establish the conditions necessary for such a rescheduling as well as a track record toward qualification for assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. In this context, the staff urges the authorities to proceed with developing an I-PRSP. 48. There are serious weaknesses in Eritrea’s macroeconomic statistics that impede accurate and timely policy analysis. The authorities’ are receiving technical assistance, including from the Fund, to address these weaknesses. Given the extraordinary efforts that need to be made to strengthen Eritrea’s statistical capacity, the staff urges the authorities to promptly implement the recommendations of previous technical assistance. Substantial improvement in expenditure management, revenue administration, fiscal reporting, banking supervision, commercial bank operations, and economic and social statistics will be crucial for developing the capacity to produce a poverty reduction strategy paper and a medium-term economic program that could be supported under the Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. 49. The staff urges the authorities to move as quickly as possible with demobilization, cognizant of the need to ensure national security. If demobilization does not occur expeditiously and defense overruns are not fully offset, undue pressure would be placed on the monetary program, inflation, and the balance of payments. In addition, continued labor constraints would severely inhibit economic growth and the country’s ability to implement the reconstruction program. 50. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Eritrea be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The baseline medium-term projections are premised on the assumption that relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia are not normalized within the projection horizon. Real GDP is projected to grow at 6 percent, in line with the trend prior to the war, and inflation will fall to 4 percent.’ Broad money would grow in line with nominal GDP. Exports are expected to grow by 20 percent and 15 percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively, but still remain below the 1997 level. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would fall to 23 percent of GDP by 2004, while the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) would fall to 19 percent, reflecting the completion of reconstruction and a reduction in the need for humanitarian assistance. International reserves are projected to rise to about 3 % months of imports. 2. The projected external financing requirement for the medium-term scenario (2001-04) is US$963 million, of which US$447 million had been committed as at end-June 2001 (excluding the Italian balance of payments loan), leaving a cumulative financing gap of US$5 16 million. The prospects for closing the financing gaps without major disruptions depend on donor responses and the authorities’ contingent policies. The gap associated with the demobilization program (US$160 million over the four years) will be closed by linking government outlays to the level of donor support received. If no additional food aid beyond end-June 2001 commitments were forthcoming, the food gap could be closed by foregoing the targeted accumulation of reserves. However, this would leave the level of international reserves at the end of 2002 below 1 month of imports. If the Italian and EU balance of payments support (US$77.5 million) is forthcoming, then an additional US$196 million in new commitments would be needed to close the remaining financing gap. This would represent an average level of non-humanitarian aid somewhat higher than donors provided before the war. 3. Relative to this scenario, a normalization of relations would result in more rapid economic growth, an improvement in the balance of payments and a more rapid reduction of the fiscal deficit. The staff estimates that if bilateral and transit trade were restored to their 1997 levels in 2003, real GDP growth would be on the order of 11 percent in that year, against the 6 percent contained in the baseline scenario. The improved balance of payments would imply either (or both) smaller financing gaps or a more rapid build up of international reserves. ’ While the projected growth rate is line with the pre-war trend, due to the damage to Eritrea’s capital stock during the war, this scenario results in a lower level of real income in the future than would have been realized in the absence of the war. Real GDP per capita in 2004 would be only 2.5 percent higher than that in 1997.

In light of the rapid buildup of external debt and the collapse of exports since 1997, a preliminary debt sustainability analysis (DSA) (the first for Eritrea) was prepared by Fund staff in consultation with the World Bank and the authorities. Calculations of Eritrea’s outstanding external debt (disbursed) as at end-December 2000 are based on loan-by-loan data provided by the authorities.’ The analysis has been extended to cover projected disbursements from debt contracted as at end-June 2001 and examines the implication of debt financing being sought for the demobilization program. 2. Eritrea’s public and publicly guaranteed debt at end-2000 was estimated at US$312 million, with a net present value (NPV) of US$186 million and an NPV of debt- to-exports ratio of 207 percent (Tables 1 and 2). Eritrea has not had a Paris Club rescheduling, but negotiations on flow reschedulings on US$lO6 million in loans to finance the Massawa power plant were recently concluded. Eritrea: Main Assumptions Used in the Debt Sustainability Analysis The following macroeconomic assumptions are used for the 20-year baseline DSA: . Real GDP grows by 5 percent a year during 2005-21. . Growth of real nongold merchandise exports averages 13 percent through 2004 (still leaving exports 22 percent lower than the 1997 level) and then trends downward to 10 percent a year by 20 10. Exports of nonfactor services grow by 5 percent in nominal terms after 2004. Export prices grow by 2 percent a year in U.S. dollar terms. Trade with Ethiopia is not restored. Based on these assumptions, prewar export levels (in nominal terms) would not be attained until 2011. . No new debt is contracted after June 2001 except for US$50 million from IDA in support of the demobilization program; all other financing is in the form of grants . The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) falls from 19 percent of GDP in 2004 to 10 percent of GDP by 2010. . The investment rate declines to about 20 percent of GDP, but structural reforms improve the efficiency of capital. . The external current account deficit (excluding grants) narrows from 18.5 percent of GDP in 2004 to 10 percent in 2010. ’ The data have not been subject to a reconciliation exercise.

Kuwait is Eritrea’s single largest creditor, accounting for 17 percent of total debt in NPV terms. The bilateral debt was contracted on ODA terms, with the exception of the two Libyan loans (US$l4 million), which carry interest rates of 4 percent and maturities of 6 years. Of the US$3 1 million in private debt, US$25 million was in the form of interest-free bonds with one-three year maturities, the remainder carried interest rates between 3-5 percent and maturities of six-ten years. 4. Eritrea has not had a Paris Club rescheduling, but US$106 million in loans to finance the Massawa power plant, with amortization payments commencing in 2000, were rescheduled in 200 1 with amortization payments commencing in 2003 (25-year maturity) at the original interest rate (1.5 percent). Discussions on rescheduling another US$l4 million disbursed by Libya to finance oil imports are ongoing. ;* b Key elements of the medium-term macroeconomic scenario were extended to 202 1 see ox above). The projections assume that Eritrea successfully recovers from the effects of the war, implements fiscal and monetary policies consistent with maintaining macroeconomic stability, and implements structural reforms necessary to promote economic growth and diversify the country’s export base. While the baseline projections do not assume that relations with Ethiopia are normalized, the implication of such a normalization is explored in an alternative scenario. 6. On the basis of these assumptions, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio (based on debt disbursed through end-2000) would fall below 150 percent by 2003 and below 65 percent by 2010 (see Figure 2 and Table 2).3 However, another US$330 million (in nominal terms) in new disbursements from existing official loans is scheduled to be disbursed over the next five years. The disbursement schedules are heavily front-loaded, with about US$270 million projected to be disbursed by end-2002. About US$140 million of this amount is in support of the ERP. The remainder is for a variety of projects (health, ports, agriculture, fisheries, water management, etc.). Including projected new disbursements from existing loans, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would peak at 283 percent in 2001 and remain above 150 percent until 2010.4 7. Regarding the financing of the projected balance of payments gaps, the DSA conservatively assumes that no additional debt is contracted except for US$50 million on 2 Excluding the private debt, the NPV ratio was 179 percent. 3 The ratio would not fall below 150 percent until 2003, even excluding private debt. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio for 2010 would be unchanged, as all the private debt matures before then. 4 Again, the ratio would remain above 150 percent until 2010, excluding the private debt. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - APPENDIX III IDA terms in support of the demobilization program, with US$40 million to be disbursed in 2001 and the rest in 2002.5 Including projected new debt, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would peak at 296 percent in 200 1, and not fall below 150 percent until after 2010. Excluding the debt to Eritreans living abroad, the ratio would peak at 270 percent in 2002 and remain above 150 percent throughout the decade. 8. In the absence of any rescheduling beyond that already concluded for the Kuwaiti loan (US$25 million), the debt-service ratio would rise to 14 percent in 2001 and spike to 32 percent in 2002, reflecting the amortization of US$l8 million of private debt (Table 7).6 The debt-service ratio would then fall to 20 percent of exports in 2003 and gradually decline to 12 percent by 2006. 9. The DSA is sensitive to the prospects for rescheduling and export earnings. If all eligible official bilateral debt disbursed as at end-2000 were rescheduled utilizing traditional mechanisms,7 the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would peak at 235 percent in 2003 (excluding private debt). Assuming the rescheduling were to apply to the projected stock of debt disbursed as at end-2001 would not substantially affect the analysis, as only US$25 million in reschedulable debt is in the pipeline for 200 1. With regard to the sensitivity of the DSA to the export projections, if exports were 10 percent higher than in the baseline scenario from 2002 onward, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would still remain above 150 percent until 2010, in the absence of any further rescheduling. Even under an optimistic scenario in which relations with Ethiopia were normalized and exports to Ethiopia were to recover to 1997 levels in 2003 and grow thereafter in line with the baseline trend, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain above 150 percent until 2006. 5 This conservative assumption is made to highlight the robustness of the analysis and to isolate it from assumptions regarding the size of the projected financing gaps. If additional debt is incurred, the NPV ratios would be correspondingly higher. While the baseline projection incorporates the impact of the rescheduling of the Kuwaiti and Libyan loans, the other power sector loans are incorporated in their original maturities. 6 The rescheduling of US$SO million in power-sector loans from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi were only recently concluded and the impact these reschedulings is not reflected in the debt service projections.The debt-service ratio would rise to 14 percent in 2002, excluding debt service on private debt. 7 ODA debt would be subject to a flow rescheduling with a 40-year repayment period, including 16 years’ grace, at original interest rates. Non-ODA bilateral debt (i.e., the Libyan loan) would be subject to a two-thirds debt reduction, a 7-year grace period, and a 24-year repayment, at commercial interest rates.

Exchange Rate Arrangement Eritrea introduced a national currency-the nakfa-and the Ethiopian birr, which had served as the provisional legal tender since Eritrea’s independence, ceased to be legal tender as of November 22, 1997. Effective May 1, 1998, the authorities put in place a mechanism to provide for a market determination of the exchange rate, with 2 commercial banks and 12 foreign exchange bureaus participating as dealers in the market. In the course of the border conflict with Ethiopia the exchange rate came under pressure as a consequence of which the Bank of Eritrea fixed the exchange rate effective July 19,2000, and the foreign exchange bureaus were only allowed to sell foreign exchange to the Bank of Eritrea. Since August 2001 bureaus and banks are legally free to buy and sell foreign exchange at market-determined exchange rates. However, the buying rate has effectively remained unchanged since depreciating to ERN 13.5 per U.S. dollar and neither bureaus nor banks are selling foreign exchange in the retail market.

It was approved by the Board in March 1993 and made effective in May 1993 in support of the Recovery and Rehabilitation Project for Eritrea (RRPE). In 1994, Eritrea took over the legal obligations of the credit from Ethiopia on becoming a member of the Bank. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) paper on Eritrea was prepared and approved by the Bank Board in February 1996, and a resident mission was opened in Asmara in February 1998. The RRPE was completed with the last disbursement made in April 1997. Current portfolio The Bank’s portfolio in Eritrea includes a Community Development Fund (US$l7.5 million) approved in February 1996, a Road Sector Engineering Credit (US$6.3 million) approved in April 1997, a Ports Rehabilitation Credit (US$30.3 million) approved in November 1997, a Health Project (US$l8.3 million) approved in December 1997 and a Credit for Human Resources Development (US$53.0 million) approved in January 1998. No new Bank projects were presented to the Board for approval for the combatants during the Ethio-Eritrean war. Since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on June 18,2000, the Bank has resumed lending to Eritrea. In response to the humanitarian crisis as a result of the war and to a lesser extent, the drought (due to inadequate rainfall for two successive years), the World Bank agreed to the reallocation of approximately US$25 million from three projects (Health, Community Development Fund and Human Resources Dev.) to purchase emergency drugs and other medical supplies; to meet emergency water and sanitation needs; and to provide nutritional supplements, kitchen utensils, cooking stoves, agricultural inputs and transport services. Projects approved since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement include an Integrated Early Childhood Development Project (US$40.0 million) in July, 2000, an Emergency Reconstruction Program (ERP) (US$90.0 million) in November, 2000 and in December 2000, an HIV/AIDS-Malaria-Tuberculosis (HAMSET) project (US$40.0 million). As of January 21, 2001 the undisbursed balance for these eight active projects was US$223.1 million. Prior to the war situation, Eritrea’s project implementation performance was rated in the top quartile of the Bank. Since May 1998, supervision activities have been disrupted to some extent by the war. In most of the projects, implementation progress has been satisfactory except for the Ports Project and the Human Resource Development Project. While the war played a role in the slow implementation of these two projects, institutional capacity weaknesses were also a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - APPENDIX V contributing factor. Disbursements for the current portfolio were US$72.9 million on January 2 1, 2001. Lending pipeline The following projects - Demobilization, Rehabilitation and Reintegration Program, Cultural Heritage, Community Development Program, Power Distribution, Private Sector Reconstruction, Road Sector Development Program and Basic Education Project - are in various stages of preparation. Nonlending services The Bank is also providing significant nonlending assistance through a close policy dialogue with the government and the preparation of various studies. Three studies (viz. Financial Sector Study, Export Development Strategy and Agricultural Sector Strategy) have recently been completed. These reports were disseminated in Eritrea in January 2001. The reports will feed into a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) cum Public Expenditure Review (PER). Work on the CEM will be initiated in the Bank’s fiscal year 2001 (FYOl) and completed in FY02. A Health Sector Note as well as an Education Sector Note are being prepared in FYOl. An Interim Support Strategy (ISS) was presented to the Board in November 2000 together with the ERP. It stated the rationale for the Bank’s immediate assistance strategy to the Government in the transition to peace. An Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) outlining the Government’s long term development strategy will be prepared in FY02 as well as a full CAS. Operations Evaluation Department (OED) is preparing a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) this fiscal year. Discussions are also ongoing to commission a poverty-monitoring system. Eritrean participants have also been involved in World Bank Institute (WBI) capacity-building activities that focus on health sector reform and financing, education reform, and banking systems development. Eritrea has expressed interest in participating in the Bank’s Global Distance Learning Network. IFC and MIGA Most of the IFC’s efforts in Eritrea have been either delayed or put on hold because of the conflict and the subsequent lack of investor interest. In FY98, the Corporation invested $0.94 million in the Tesinma Company, a $2 million coach and commercial vehicle assembling plant. Another project under consideration, ATMI, a $2.2 million terrazzo and marble tile project, is currently on hold. However, the first phase of a technical assistance project to study private sector opportunities in the banking sector has been completed, and a marble and granite study is being conducted. Technical assistance proposals for shrimp farming and the fisheries sector are also being undertaken. The IFC is also proposing a trust fund to help strengthen the Eritrean Chamber of Commerce. There are no MIGA-guaranteed projects in Eritrea, although some preliminary discussions have been held on the mining sector.

The authorities have been seeking technical assistance from the Norwegian government. An official consumer price index (CPI) for Asmara has been compiled by the National Statistics and Evaluation Office, and a national CPI is under consideration. There is a considerable need for technical assistance in all areas of real sector statistics. Government finance No government finance statistics (GFS) data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) or in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). Some progress has been made in the compilation of government finance data during the past two years. A GFS mission visited Asmara in April 1995 and recommended that GFS data be compiled with more detail and complete coverage of extrabudgetary operations and government transactions financed by external assistance. The mission also recommended the compilation of data on local government operations. Monetary accounts A multisector statistics mission (1993) recommended the establishment of a unit for the compilation of money and banking data, the introduction of call report forms, and revisions in the classification of accounts. A monetary and financial statistics (MFS) mission that visited Asmara in April-May 200 1 assisted the authorities in developing a money and banking statistics compilation system in accordance with the new Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The 2001 STA mission detected major shortcomings in the accounts of the commercial banks regarding the application of the residency criterion and the classification of the public sector accounts. The Bank of Eritrea has started reporting electronically to the Fund its accounts and the accounts of the commercial bank, on a monthly basis, using the forms developed by the mission. Balance of payments Work on the compilation of balance of payments statistics began during the multisector statistics mission that visited Eritrea in May 1993, and some progress has been made in compiling balance of payment data. The Bank of Eritrea started compiling the balance of payments data broadly in line with the fifth edition of the Balance ofPayments Manual. However, balance of payments data are not reported to STA.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Eritrea On 1 l/--/2001, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Eritrea.’ Background Eritrea and Ethiopia signed an armistice in June 2000 and a peace agreement the following December, ending their two-and-a-half year war. Intense fighting in May 2000 resulted in an estimated US$565 million (equivalent to 93 percent of GDP) in property damage and loss in Eritrea, and preempted planting in regions that account for nearly 80 percent of Eritrea’s crop production. Almost half of Eritrea’s population will require food and other humanitarian assistance through 2002. Real GDP is estimated to have declined by 8.2 percent in 2000 and inflation accelerated to 27 percent. The mobilization of an ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Large outlays for defense put pressure on the fiscal and external current accounts, leading to a rapid buildup of domestic and external debt. The monetary impact of the large fiscal deficit was partially offset by a stagnation of bank credit to the private sector and the loss of international reserves, which fell to less than 1 month of imports. The authorities imposed foreign exchange controls in July 2000, fixing the exchange rate and administratively controlling the sale of foreign exchange. The real effective official exchange rate subsequently appreciated as inflation began to accelerate, thereby undermining the competitiveness of exports. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio increased to 207 percent by end-2000 and the external debt-service ratio increased to 11 l/2 percent for the year as a whole. The authorities’ economic program for 2001 aims to begin restoring macroeconomic stability while meeting the country’s humanitarian and reconstruction needs. Demobilization, a sharp decline in defense expenditures, and enhanced outlays for reconstruction, humanitarian relief, and capacity building comprise the cornerstones of the government’s program. The government began implementing its US$288 million emergency reconstruction program immediately after the cessation of hostilities and has prepared a US$197 million demobilization program. Substantial donor support will be needed to fully implement these programs. The authorities repealed the exchange controls in August 2001.

The government implemented a comprehensive tax reform package in October 2001, resulting in a much more streamlined and efficient tax system, including a substantial lowering of customs duties and other taxes. Inflation fell to 14 percent in July 2001, international reserves have begun to increase, and monetary policy has been supported by a sharp decline in government borrowing from the domestic banking system. The authorities have continued to implement structural reforms since the last Article IV consultation: the government raised domestic petroleum prices on numerous occasions to keep them in line with world prices, the privatization of manufacturing enterprises is nearly complete, and the Telecommunications Service of Eritrea has been prepared for privatization. Eritrea is receiving technical assistance in the areas of tax and customs administration, fiscal management, banking supervision, and national economic and social statistics.
