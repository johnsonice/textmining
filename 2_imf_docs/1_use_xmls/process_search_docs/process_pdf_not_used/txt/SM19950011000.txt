Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Tonga were held in Nuku’alofa during February 22-March 8, 1995. The mission’ met with the former Minister of Finance;2 the Minister of Labor, Commerce, and Industries; the Governor of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT; the central bank); other senior officials; commercial bankers; and major aid donors. Mr. Sundara, Advisor to the Executive Director for Tonga, participated in the March meetings as an observer. With respect to surveillance procedures, Tonga provides a steady flow of information to the staff throughout the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Nevertheless, the staffs ability to analyze developments--especially in the fiscal and real sectors--is hampered by data that are limited in scope, unreliable in nature, and available only after long time lags. To redress this situation, the authorities have been obtaining technical assistance from the Fund- supported Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, as well as the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). Tonga has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in February 1994 (SM/94/20, l/19/94), Executive Directors emphasized three points. First, they warned that the recent introduction of competition into the banking system could spur banks to adopt more liberal lending policies, and urged the authorities to respond by tightening their monetary stance. Second, they worried that the long public sector wage freeze would eventually lead to a large increase that would jeopardize fiscal stability, and recommended that a more flexible wage- setting system be adopted. Third, they stressed the need to strengthen the economic structure over the medium term, by reducing the size of the public sector and transferring human and financial resources into the private sector. II. Background and Recent Developments A. Economic Structure Tonga is a small island country located northeast of New Zealand, with a population of about 100,000 and a GDP per capita of about US$1,500. The economy is dominated by ‘The staff representatives were Mr. Felman (Head, SEA), Mr. Nagai (SEA), Ms. Lim (SEA), and Mrs. Liu (STA). *On May 12, Mr. Tutoatasi Fakafanua, the Minister of Labor, Commerce, and Industries, was appointed Finance Minister.

In the modern sector, the key role is played by the state. Central government outla.ys amount to about 40 percent of GDP, partly to finance myriad retail, manufacturing, an,d other commercial activities; in addition, there are numerous public enterprises. To fund its operations, the central government absorbs about one fourth of GDP as domestic revenue, placing a heavy tax burden on the private sector. In particular, import taxes add about 45 percent to the landed cost of private dutiable goods, significantly raising the cost of production in this highly open economy. Partly as a consequence of high taxation, the export base is extremely narrow. Total foreign exchange earnings, mainly from agricultural commodities and tourism, are sufficient to pay for less than half of the economy’s import needs. Moreover, within merchandise exports, the bulk of earnings is generated by just one cash crop--squash--which is exported to one market (Japan) for only two months out of the year. This situation poses serious problems for the authorities. First, it leaves the country highly dependent on external transfers. About one third of import? are financed by remittances, provided by an estimated 40,000 Tongans who have migrated overseas and by foreign affiliates of local churches. Almost another third of imports are financed by official bilateral grants, which also fund nearly all of the development budget. Second, the narrowness of the export ba.se renders the balance of payments vulnerable to shocks in the squash sector, includi:ng production problems, price declines, and the possibility that the market itself may be lost to foreign competitors. The authorities have responded to these problems in a number of ways: by maintaining a comfortable cushion of international reserves, averaging about five months worth of imports;’ by pegging the pa’anga since 1991 to a weighted basket of the currencies of Tonga’s major trading partners; and by subjecting squash exports to a quota system, in order to ensure stable marketing arrangements. And to encourage the expansion of the export sector, they have adopted a policy of reducing the size of the Government and shifting resources to the private sector. B. Recent Economic Performance Despite the significant structural obstacles, Tonga has made considerable economic progress in recent years. GDP gr’owth has increased, to an average of 3 ‘/z percent in 1990/9 l- 1992/93, and to 4 3/4 percent in 1993/94. A key reason has been the marked improvement in financial balances brought about by the Government’s strenuous efforts to reduce budget expenditure. Since: 1989/90,’ operations and maintenance spending has been ‘Of goods and services. 4Excluding imports financed by dolnors’ grants or loans. ‘The fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.

Locally finded development projects have also been sharply scaled back, reducing development expenditure to a level consistent with external grants and the current budget surplus. As a result, by 1993/94 the budget balance had swung into a surplus of 1 */z percent of GDP from a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 1989/90--without any increase in the revenue/GDP ratio. Another key factor behind the improvement in economic performance has been the development of squash cultivation, introduced for the first time in 1988/89 with the aim of exporting during the lean season in Japan. Production has proved highly profitable and farmers have quickly learned the skills necessary to produce a high-quality crop, enabling earnings to climb rapidly, if somewhat unevenly, to 9 percent of GDP in 1993/94. A third key development has been the introduction of competition into the commercial banking system. In late 1993, two new banks entered the domestic market to challenge the monopoly of the Bank of Tonga (BOT). Almost immediately, margins between deposit and lending rates declined7 and financial intermediation through the banking system improved, raising the share of quasi-money (essentially time deposits) in broad money, as well as the ratio of broad money to GDP. Even more significant, however, has been the impact on domestic credit conditions. Until 1993/94, credit had been constrained not so much by monetary policy as by the cautious lending practices of the BOT, which preferred to hold large amounts of low-interest central bank securities, rather than increase its lending to the private sector. Once competition arrived, however, the BOT reversed its priorities, and began to reduce its holdings of central bank securities.’ Meanwhile, a doubling of squash incomes increased households’ desire to purchase durable assets, especially housing. As a result, credit to the private sector increased by 25 percent, to which was added a large increase in other domestic assets, as the central bank, established in 1989, finally constructed its headquarters--at a cost equivalent to 6Effectively, this has allowed most workers to obtain small annual increments as they climbed the rungs on their salary scale. However, workers who have reached the top of their range and senior civil servants on a fixed salary have not received any increases. 71nterest margins in 1994 were about 50 basis points lower than in 1993, reducing the spread to about 4 % percentage points--despite a shift in credit toward household loans, which carry higher lending rates. 8These securities were first issued in 1992193, to replace the BOT’s fixed-term deposits at the central bank. The counterpart to this was a sharp drop in reserve money. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTable 1.

Given the open nature of the economy, ” the impact of this credit expansion was felt not on prices, which increased by only 2 I/? percent in line with inflation abroad, but rather on the balance of payments. The current and capit.al accounts’* both shifted into deficit, and reserve coverage fell to the equivalent of 5 months of imports from 7 months in 1992/93 (Table 2). C. Outlook for 1994/95 The excess demand pressures that emerged in 1993/94 appear to be intensifjling in the current fiscal year. On the supply side, the staRestimates that GDP growth will slow to about 3 ‘/z percent despite a sharp rise in marketed fruit and vegetable production. The reason is that there was an exceptionally poor squash sea:son. The bulk of the problem lay in the marketing of squash, receipts from which plummeted by 40 percent: the crop was harvested early and shipped all at once, causing much of it to spoil and unit prices to collapse. To a certain extent, this problem occurred because prices overseas were falling. However, growers and shippers also rushed because the quota--enforced officially for the first time,13 on a first- come, first-served basis--encouraged them to ship before the limit was reached. Meanwhile, on the demalnd side, the authorities have been tieling a rapid expansion of domestic credit, in at least two ways. First, the NRBT has kept interest rates on its securities at relatively low levels: at 3 percent, the rate on three-month maturities is below even the 4 ‘/z percent rate that banks are paying on their time deposits, which is encouraging banks to ‘Since profits and capital of the NRBT are both small (see Section III. A. below), the counterpart to the increase in net domestic assets (NDA) was essentially a decline in net foreign assets. “‘Measured as a share of end-l 992/93 broad money. The growth rate of NDA itself cannot be compared to that of broad money (or domestic credit) because these categories are of different magnitudes. “The ratio of imports of goods <and services to GDP, as well as the share of imports in the consumer price index basket, exceeds 50 percent. “Based on central bank figures for imports. Government statistics department data shows much lower imports, resulting in a very large negative errors and omissions. See Annex V for a discussion of statistical issues. 13Previously, the export quota had been set by the exporters themselves and was not firmly enforced.

Second, the Government ‘has been placing its growing deposits with commercial banks, rather than the central bank, thereby providing further funds for lending. As a result, by February 1995, the year-on-year increase in credit to the private sector had reached 5 1 percent and that of net domestic assets 4 1 percent,14 far outstripping the 22 percent increase in broad money (Table 3). While monetary pressures have intensified, the fiscal stance has been easing. The current surplus is expected to shrink by about 1 percent of GDP, owing equally to lower nontax revenue and higher spending on health, education, and pensions. Despite this reduc- tion in budgetary savings, development expenditure is likely to grow by about 4 percentage points of GDP, reflecting the initiation of a large AsDB-sponsored project to extend electricity to parts of the outer islands. Consequently, the: fiscal balance is likely to slip into a deficit of 3 ?4 percent of GDP, although this will be more than financed by concessional foreign borrowing. Once again, the impact of these aggregate demand pressures is falling on the external accounts, rather than inflation, which should remain at about 2 percent. The current account deficit is likely to widen to 8 percent of GDP in 1994/95, reflecting the fall in squash exports, as well as a 17 l/z percent rise in imports. The capital account should return to surplus, owing to a doubling of official loans. Still, it is expected that another large overall deficit will be incurred, and reserves will fall to an unusually low level of 3 ‘/z months of imports. Already, as of end-February 1995, reserve coverage had fallen to just over 4 months, the lowest level in over 10 years. III. Report on the Discussions The discussions centered around two policy issues: (i) the short-term measures needed to reduce aggregate demand pressures and reverse the deterioration in the balance of payments, and (ii) the medium-term strategy for promoting economic growth and diversi- fication. A. Short-Term Policy Issues The mission expressed concern about the direction of economic policies. It stressed that the current monetary stance was unsust,ainable: as long as the low current NRBT interest rates are maintained, credit will continue to expand and reserves will continue to decline--until the exchange rate peg itself is threatened: Moreover, fiscal policy could also turn expan- sionary next year, because the authorities are considering a large cost of living adjustment to the public sector wage scales. Finally, even as aggregate demand pressures are intensifying, aggregate supply is being restricted by the squash export quota. 14As a percent of broad money.

In particular, if the monetary stance were tightened but the fiscal deficit expanded, there would be a considerable crowding out of the private sector. This could- be seen in. two ways. First, to rebuild reserves to even a minimal short-run target of 4 months of imports, the growth in net domestic assets would need to.be brought to a halt; in these circumstances, any borrowing by the Government would require an offsetting fall in credit to the private sector. Second, to achieve the reserve target, the current account deficit needs to be reduced, to 3 percent of GDP from 8 percent of GDP in 1994/95. If in these circumstances, the Government increased its deficit, then the private sector would need to, improve its savings/investment balance by more than 5 percent of GDP. Moreover, if the private sector felt compelled to match the government wage increase, profitability would also suffer, and with it the prospects for future growth and diversification. Consequently, the staff urged the authorities to: (i) tighten monetary policy by raising NIBT interest rates; (ii) contain the fiscal deficit by limiting the wage increase; and (iii) lift the squash export quota. Even with these policies, next year would still be difficult, as GDP growth would slow to 2 percent and inflation would rise to 3 % percent. However, a solid foundation would at least be built for growth over the medium term. 1. Monetary and exchange rate policies The authorities explained that their monetary stance needed to be viewed in the context of their three policy objectives. First, and most important, they are committed to maintaining price stability and preserving the exchange rate peg. Second, they wish to develop the banking system and promote financial intermediation. Third, they aim to preserve the NRBT’s profitability and ensure that it can transfer an annual dividend to the Government. These considerations hald guided their attitude toward the increase in private sector credit. Initially, this development was welcomed, as it came after a 3-year period in which outstanding credit had actually declined by 12 p~ercent,15 and so was considered to be a necessary adjustment to bring the level of credit back into line with the needs of the economy. Also, there seemed little reason to constrain credit and dampen the economic expansion, as long as reserve coverage remained ample. However, as the credit expansion continued and reserves approached the minimum level of three months of imports, the NRBT had decided that policy needed to be tightened. To do this, they were considering introducing a balanced package of measures, including a shift from administered interest rates to an auction system for NREIT securities, together with some restraint on commercial bank lending. The mission welcomed the planned tightcening, but questioned the authorities’ choice of instruments. It endorsed the introduction of an #auction system and encouraged the lSFrom 1988/89 to 1992/93.

However, it urged the authorities not to reimpose credit controls, emphasizing that this was not a complement to the market-oriented securities auction, but rather a retrograde step: it would effectively impose a large tax on the private sector, which would discourage financial intermediation; and it could lead to credit rationing, which would distort resource allocation and hinder growth. In sum, it would defeat the purpose of introducing banking sector competition, The authorities accepted these points. However, they emphasized that profitability considerations ruled out exclusive reliance on the auction, since this would require a large increase in interest rates, which the central bank could not afford. The problem lay in the bank’s balance sheet: the main asset, foreign exchange reserves, is matched by an almost equal amount of interest-bearing domestic securities.16 Moreover, only about half of credit to government--the bank’s other significant asset--was interest bearing, while low-cost liabilities such as reserve money and capital were relatively small.” In these circumstances, the NRBT’s profitability was low and its scope to raise interest rates severely circumscribed. Essentially, interest rates on securities could not be increased above those that were earned abroad on foreign assets, or else the central bank would lose money. The mission responded that a first-best solution would be to adopt a market-oriented approach. The authorities should allow NRBT interest rates to rise to levels where they were competitive with the (risk-adjusted) returns from lending, so that enough securities could be sold to stabilize credit and achieve next year’s reserve target. Simultaneously, they could adopt a three-pronged strategy to attack the problem of central bank profitability. The Government could pay interest on all its debts to the NRBT,‘* while augmenting the NRBT’s slender capital base19 by issuing interest-bearing development bonds. For its part, the central bank could reduce operating costs, which in 1994/95 are estimated to amount to more than half of its capital. Finally, banks could be required to share some of the financial burden of monetary policy, without being forced to ration credit, through a modest increase in the (nonremunerated) reserve requirement from the current level of 5 percent. At the same time, the mission cautioned the authorities against trying to improve profitability through a more active foreign exchange investment strategy, emphasizing that the primary focus of reserve management should be to ensure the safety of principal. 16These essentially represent the obligations incurred when the NRBT assumed the BOT’s foreign exchange assets. “The Government borrowed from the central bank in the early 1990s when its deficits were large. Since 1992/93, it has once again built up its cash deposits, but has preferred to place these with commercial banks rather than repay the central bank. “Equivalently, the Government could simply use its deposits to retire its debt to the central bank. “Central bank capital is equivalent to 4 percent of its total liabilities.

In particular, it would be important for the NRBT to step up its banking supervision ~efforts, to ensure that the rapid expansion of credit does not lead to a deterioration in loan portfolios--as occurred during the previous round of lending in the late 1980s. Aware of this risk, the authorities stated that the NRBT would shortly introduce a capital adequacy rat:io, at a level above the Basle minimum of 8 percent, and with a higher-than-standard risk weighting for housing. The central bank is also planning measures to ensure that banks follow adequate provisioning policies. As for the exchange rate, the staff and the authorities agreed that there would be no need for an adjustment of the basket peg, provided that monetary policy was tightened promptly. The current system appears to have served the country well: it has kept inflation low, without any apparent cost in competitiveness, either as measured by the real effective exchange rate--which has been stable since inflation was brought down--or by the growth in exports, which until recently has been rapid (Chart 2). Finally, available evidence does not indicate that there are significant unutilized resources; to the contrary, the expansion of squash production appears to have required a considerable redirection of land and labor from other agricultural and manufacturing pursuits. 2. Fiscal policy The authorities explained that the 1995/96 budget will be built upon three long- standing pillars. First, government expenditure will be kept in line with available resources--a goal that has traditionally been accomplished by achieving a small surplus on the current budget, while relying on external grants or concessional loans to finance development expenditure. Second, the role of the Government in commercial activity will be reduced. Third, any increase in the already-heavy tax burden will be minimized, and focus placed instead on improving govemme:nt efficiency. Consistent with these principles, the inevitable wage scale adjustment would be limited to an amount the budget could afford. In particular, the increase would be kept to 10 percent, even though 30 percent would ‘be warranted by the rise in the consumer price index during the past five years. To finance this wage award, several measures were being contemplated. First, user fees could be raised, particularly for health and education services. Second, to reduce expenditure, additional commercial activities would be removed from the budget and placed on a self-sustaining basis. In 1994/95, the authorities had corporatized the duty-free stores and the large government-owned hotel; in 1995/96, the government store would be spun off, as well. Third, operat.ions and maintenance expenditure would once again be kept at the previous year’s budgeted level. The mission welcomed these proposals, but questioned whether they would be sufficient to balance the budget, given the macroeconomic outlook.

Meanwhile, current expenditure: would rise by about 1 percent of GDP, reflecting the 10 percent wage increase. Consequently, even though development spending would fall, the budget deficit would expand to 5,percent of GDP, compared with 3 ‘/z percent of GDP in 1994195, and there would be a need for some borrowing from the banking system for the first time since 1991/92 (Table 4). The mission stressed thalt a deficit of this size would only aggravate the burden on monetary policy and crowd out the private sector. Ideally, the authorities should instead aim to reduce the deficit from last year’s level, but this will not be feasible in the short run. After five years of expenditure restraint there is little scope for cutting most categories of current spending; to the contrary, the freeze on operations and maintenance spending has become counterproductive and should cease. Moreover, while there is considerable potential for reducing government employment, a rationalization program would take time to formulate and implement--and would generate some initial costs. Accordingly, the staff recommended that the deficit be contained at last year’s level of 3 % percent of GDP. This would at least enable the Government to continue building up its bank deposits, which would aid monetary policy and allow some increase in credit to the private sector, albeit by a modest 2 7’~ percent. To realize this objective, several measures would be necessary. Most important, the authorities would need to break: free from the periodic salary adjustment cycle and adopt a more conventional wage-setting apprqach, with small annual increases being made in light of inflation, available resources, and wage developments in the private sector. This last consideration would suggest a differential sala?/ increase, since salary’surveys indicated that wages at more junior levels were quite competirive with the private sector. If this were politically difficult, the authorities could grant a uniform increase, but for perhaps half of the envisaged 10 percent. Even then, there would still be a need for further offsetting measures. Another % percent of GDP could be obtained by reducing the large number of “casual” workers or through a greater adjustment ofuser charges. Finally, depending on the timing and precise burden-sharing plans, another l/4 percent of GDP might be necessary for the central bank restructuring; this could be obtained by going beyond corporatizing government commercial activities and actually privatizing them. 3. Structural measures In addition to the demand-side measures, the mission also suggested spurring supply by eliminating the squash quota.. The authorities responded by agreeing in principle, but stressing that the timing might not yet be right. To the contrary, the 1994 experience indi- cated to them that greater regulation might be needed, to ensure that the crop was harvested in an orderly fashion and shipped on a staggered timetable. ‘Also, the quota was needed to help Tonga develop its reputation as a stable supplier of high-quality squash.

The mission noted these points, but questioned whether controls could really prove workable in the face of powerful, contrary, price incentives. As long as squash prices are more th;an twice as high as non-labor production costs (as they were even last year), farmers will continue to produce more than allotted and will try to harvest as early as possible, to ensure that they can sell before the quota is filled. To resolve these problems--and ilmprove squash quality--it might be better to simply eliminate the quota, allowing export volumes to rise and prices to fall to a point closer to marginal cost. B. Medium-Term Policy Issues and Outlook The mission emphasized that over the me:dium term Tonga will need to address its long-standing structural problems. First, the country will need to expand its productive base further, to lessen dependence on inflows from abroad. Second, it will need to diversify, to reduce its vulnerability to shocks in the squash sector. *’ Third, it will need to respond to declining real aid, arising from donors’ policies of maintaining external grants stable in nominal terms. These problems are intertwined, severely limiting the policy options. In particular, to preserve fiscal balance in the facie of declining aid, either domestic revenues will need to be increased or expenditure reduced. Yet tax increases will only further weigh down the private sector, making it impossible for the country to diversify exports and reach external self- sufficiency. Consequently, the mission suggested that the only way forward is to scale back the role of the public sector and reorient the economy toward private enterprise. 1. Medium-term scenario An illustrative medium-term scenario indicates the magnitude of the problem. Stable nominal grants imply that the ratio to GDP would fall ‘by about 3 percentage points over the next five years, while external borrowing would need to be curtailed by about 2 percentage points of GDP to stabilize the de:bt/GDP ratio at about 35 percent (Table 5). One possible response to these declining foreign resources would be to choose the path of adjustment, as recommended by the staff team *’ The key task will be to reduce government current expenditure., especially on th,e central government civil service, which has grown by 8 percent since 1988/89, to reach 40 employees per 1,000 population**--about double the ratio in other Pacific iisland developing countries. Even if the wage bill was reduced by, say, 2 percentage points of GDP, however, development expenditure would still “Already, there is a risk that the sharp devaluation of the Mexican peso may allow that country to erode Tonga’s share of the Japanese market. -*‘Including the mission’s proposals for 1995/96 **Based on permanent workers; with casual workers the ratio is 60 per 1,000 population, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Table 5.

In these circumstances, it would be necessary to encourage private sector investment to expand, by reducing import taxes and fostering foreign investment. The authorities would also need to revive their privatization efforts: although a number of commercial activities have been corporatized in recent years, no firm has actually been transferred to the private sector since 1992/‘93. If this strategy is pursued, the medium-term outlook would be favorable. Growth could amount to about 3 percent, based on a steady expansion of fishing and new agricultural products, with a slower growth in squash. Inflation could remain at about 2 !/z percent, about the same rate as in Tonga’s principal trading partners. The fiscal position, meanwhile, would remain strong, with the budget deficit falling to about 2 l/2 percent of GDP. In these circum- stances, the external current account deficit should quickly disappear and turn into a surplus, while reserves would recover to relatively comfortable levels, covering about six months of imports. Both external debt and the debt-service ratio would remain low. Alternatively, the authorities could choose the path of financing, and supplement declining grants with concessional loans. But the mission cautioned the authorities on the risks of this strategy. Already, loan disbursements have doubled over the past few years, and they are expected to double again to the equivalent of nearly one fifth of government revenue in both 1994/95 and 1995/96. A second scenario illustrates what would happen if this trend continues (Chart 3). Without eflorts to transfer resources to the private sector, GDP and export growth would be slower and the external current account deficit wider, making it impossible to build up reserve coverage from the 1995/96 level. Most important, there would be a rapid buildup of external debt, to 50 percent of GDP from 32 percent of GDP in 1994/95-+&h serious implications for the debt-service ratio after grace periods expire. In sum, the Tongan economy would remain, as it is today, highly vulnerable to external shocks,. but with the additional problem of higher indebtedness. 2. Medium-term policies The authorities responded that they shared the staff team’s views. In particular, they agreed that the size of the public sector needed to be reduced and its activities limited to providing infrastructure and a sound macroeconomic framework. To do this would require three types of reform: fiscal, public enterprise, and structural. a. Fiscal reform The authorities explained that they envisage a radical restructuring of the public sector. Over time, all of the government’s commercial activities will be divested, while many government services--such as education and health--will be transferred to independent and largely self-financing statutory boards. Moreover, the generous pension scheme will be closed and replaced by a contributory one, perhaps administered by a national provident fund.

The mission endorsed the. authorities’ intentions. However, it stressed that these need to be translated quickly into concrete timetables and actual measures--especially to streamline the civil service and transfer activities to the private sector. Meanwhile, to guard against excessive borrowing, the staff te.am recommended that a centralized debt management agency be established, with a power to set borrowing ceilings. For example, debt service could continue to be limited to about 6 l/z percent of budgetary revenues, while total debt is maintained at about 35 percent of GDP. A f%rther fiscal step would be needed to encourage private sector activity and diversification. The mission reclommended that .the authorities reduce the unusually high import tax rates, which are raising local production costs significantly. To preserve government revenues, the tax base could be broadened, in at least two ways. First, income tax and customs duty incentives under the Industrial Development Incentives Act could be reduced, especially the provision allowing farmers and fishermen who produce for export to import motor vehicles duty free. Second, action. could be taken to tighten the exemption for imports of personal effects, which is being used to import housing construction materials duty free. b. Public enterprises The authorities explained that over the medium term, they plan to privatize the public enterprises. In the meantime, their financial position is being improved. Royal Tongan Airlines, which only a few years ago had require:d large and repeated capital injections, was now close to breaking even and no longer required subsidies. In fact, the only enterprise that now requires any budgetary subvention is the shipping corporation, which has been unable to service two external loans. The mission welcomed these steps, but noted that many enterprises remained unprofitable with negative net worth, while others earned only a minimal rate of return on assets. Consequently, the mission urged the authorities to revitalize their efforts, especially for Tonga Investments Limited, a holding company set up with the explicit purpose of selling off its retail, manufacturing, and other subsidiaries. c. Structural reform Tonga maintains a liberal economic framework, with few price controls, virtually no quantitative import restrictions, and few limitations on investment. Despite this framework, and a generous Industrial Development Incentives Act, foreign direct investment has remained 23This reduced both government revenues and expenditures, as recording shifted from a gross to a net basis. There was little Iimmediate impact, however, on the overall budget balance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - much smaller than in neighboring countries, possibly because of the case-by-case approach that is utilized for investment approvals. To speed applications and reduce uncertainty, the staff suggested that this system be replaced by a liberal foreign investment act, with well- defined criteria. IV. Staff Appraisal Despite significant obstacles, the Tongan economy has made considerable progress in recent years. The public finances have been brought back into balance through strenuous efforts to reduce budgetary expenditure. Exports have increased through a rapid expansion of squash cultivation. And financial intermediation has increased, owing to the introduction of competition into the banking system. These developments have sparked an acceleration of economic activity, combined with low inflation and--until recently--an improvement in the balance of payments. Nevertheless, the fundamental structural problems still remain. Little progress has yet been made in reducing the size of the public sector: no public enterprise has been privatized since 1992/93, while central government employment has actually increased. Instead, expenditure has been compressed through the unsustainable expedient of freezing the wage scales and reducing operations and maintenance spending. Moreover, even though the productive base has expanded, it has not been diversified; to the contrary, the economy is now dependent on a crop that is exported to one market for only two months of the year. Finally, the advent of banking sector competition has exposed the structural weakness of monetary policy. The central bank can no longer rely on the BOT’s cautious lending policy to contain credit growth, but neither can it exercise its own control, since its weak balance sheet forces it to maintain below-market interest rates on its securities. All of these problems are now coming home to roost. Commercial banks have been redeeming central bank securities and lending the funds out to the private sector, fueling a brisk growth in aggregate demand. Meanwhile, on the supply side, squash incomes have plummeted, since there have been quality problems with this year’s crop. Combined, these have produced strong excess demand pressures, which are causing a serious deterioration in the balance of payments: the staff estimates that the current account will shift into a large deficit and reserve coverage will fall to only three and one half months of imports by the end of 1994/95. Moreover, this situation could worsen next year, since public clamor has mounted for a large wage-scale adjustment, which could cause fiscal policy to turn expan- sionary, exacerbating demand pressures. The authorities recognize that this situation demands an urgent tightening of monetary policy, to ensure that the exchange rate peg can be sustained. Since the central bank’s financial position is weak, however, their envisaged policy package, however, relies heavily on the reintroduction of credit controls, a measure that will discourage financial intermediation and distort resource allocation. To avoid these growth-hindering effects, the staff would Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24, - instead urge the authorities to adopt a market-oriented approach. Interest rates should be allowed to rise in the envisaged auction to levels where they are competitive with the (risk-adjusted) returns from lending, enabling the central bank to sell enough securities to stabilize credit and reconstitute reserves. At the same time, the central bank’s balance sheet problem should be attacked directly, by augmenting its narrow capital base and reducing its operating expenses. Moreover, to ensure that credit expansion does not lead to a deterioration in commercial bank portfolios, the central bank should step up its supervision efforts. Provided that these actions are taken promptly, there would be no need for an exchange rate adjustment: inflation has remained in line with trading partners, while until this year exports have been growing rapidly and the current account has remained near balance. With respect to fiscal policy, the staff would urge the authorities not to allow the deficit to widen next year, as this would only agagravate the burden on monetary policy and crowd out the private sector. Instead, the planned salary increase should be minimized, by abandoning the system of periodic large salary adjustments and adopting a more conventional wage-setting approach. The authorities may als’o wish to consider a differential salary increase, since wages at the more junior level are already competitive with the private sector. Even then, it will also be necessary to reduce employrnent and revitalize the privatization program, to ensure that the defilcit is contained. Finally, in addition to reining in aggregate demand, the authorities should relax their grip on supply, by eliminating the export quota for squash, which is encouraging premature harvests and early shipping, with adverse effects on quality. Over the medium term, the authorities will need to address the fundamental structural problems, whose resolution has continually been deferred. The key challenges will be to expand the country’s productive base, diversify away from squash exports, and adjust to declining real levels of external grants. As the authorities themselves recognize, these challenges will require two responses. First, the: scope of the public sector needs to be reduced. The authorities have already developed a plan to do this, which the staff can endorse. The need now is for prompt action, especially to scale back the size of the civil service, which is exceptionally large, and privatize public enterprises, most of which are not earning an adequate return on capital. Most important, the authorities must be careful not to supplement declining grants with sizeable external borrowing--as they seem to have already started to do. This approach will only lead to a large buildup of external debt, which will prove difficult for the budget to service. Second, action should be taken to promote private sector growth and diversification directly. The authorities should reduce import taxation, which currently increases the cost of imports by nearly one half, and recoup the foregone revenues by eliminating tax exemptions. Also, to attract foreign direct investment, which has remained much smaller than in neigh- boring countries, the current case-by-case approval system should be replaced with a liberal foreign investment law.

Yet, if the authorities were to decisively choose the path of adjustment, then the country would be able to look forward to a favorable medium term, with solid growth, low inflation--and a quick recovery in international reserves.

An IDA credit of US$2 million, cofinanced by the (AsDB), was approved on June 2, 1987 for the Tonga Development Bank. The credit was designed to provide the Development Bank with long-term resources to meet investment demand--particularly in agriculture, industry, and tourism--as well as to support institutional development. A second Tonga Development Bank credit of US$3 million was approved on January 4, 1990 and is also being cofinanced by the AsDB. The second credit is to support interest rate reform as well as to provide financing for projects in the agricultural, industrial, and tourism sectors. The World Bank produced a country economic report on Tonga in March 1993 as part of the second Pacific Islands Rerzional Economic: Report. This report focused on public sector reform, the role of the private sector in achieving sustainable growth, human resource development, and environmental issues. In addition, country reports on Tonga have been prepared as part of the Bank’s Piacific regional studies on post-secondary education, energy, health, and transportation. The current work program includes the third Regional Economic Report which will be finalized in 1995. This is a thematic report focusing on trade, tourism, fisheries, forestry, and regional cooperation.

In addition, technical assistance amounting to US$8.18 million for 38 projects has been provided. In 1994, a loan of US$lO.O million was approved for Tonga for a transportation infrastructure project. Six technical assistance grants totaling 1JS$943,000 were approved in 1994. Five were advisory technical assistance projects for coordination of the Women’s Development Programs; road cost recovery and safety strategies; institutional development of the ports sector; pension scheme for civil service; and an e’conomic management study. The sixth technical assistance grant was a preparatory technical assistance project for a second power development study. Economic growth remains a major priority, and particularly the need to accelerate and sustain growth. The AsDB’s strategy in Tonga therefore retains an emphasis on assisting this growth requirement while at the same time giving increasing concern to capacity building and social dimensions, the commercial performance of public enterprises and creating the conditions conducive to private s#ector development and overall economic growth. It includes helping the Government to define an appropriate role and support functions in agriculture and agro-processing. A recently approved technical assistance operation focuses on reform of the budget and economic and financial management systems. Institutional reform and corporatization strategies will be pursued in infrastructure loan projects. A major aim will be to improve the cost efficiency of infrastructure services provided by the Government. To help promote the private sector, the AsDB will continue to encourage the Government to simplify the business regulation environment and to establish effective policies with respect to attracting foreign investment. In relation to human resource development, the AsDB will aim to improve health and education ;planning with a focus on cost efficiency and effectiveness of resource allocation in these sectors.

Real sector The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) has not reported national accounts data to STA since 1985. GDP data have been updated in International Financial Statistics (IF4 through 1993 using UN estimates. Government budget statements have been based on GDP estimates produced by various consultants and the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Finance through 1993/94. Until recently, the NRBT and the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Finance had different views on the proper way to calculate the agricultural component of GDP, particularly own consumption of farm production. In April 1994, an expert visited Tonga and produced GDP estimates for 1992/93 and 1993/94 in collaboration with the Statistics Department and the NRBT. These estimates were officially adopted in the government budget statement for 1993/94. However, the Statistics Department may have insufficient expertise to revise and update GDP estimates, in accordance with the requirements of the improved methods. Other national accounts data, including wholesale prices, manufacturing production, employment, earnings, and trade indices are unavailable. 2. Government finance In 1994, the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Finance reported government finance statistics to STA for the period 1987/88 through 1992/93, compiled by a statistician from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These data are not consistent with data compiled by STA, as shown in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook for 1992. In 1994, the NRBT completed a computerized system for compiling government finance statistics. 3. Balance of payments Although Tonga compiles balance of payments data on a quarterly basis, only annual data are reported to STA. The currentness of these data in IFS would improve if data were reported to STA as they become available. No details for the component of official reserves have been reported.
