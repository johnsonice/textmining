Introduction A 13-month stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 27.45 million (30 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board on April 21, 1995. l/ In light of their relatively comfortable level of official international reserves, the authorities indicated their intention to effect no purchases under the arrangement. Since not all performance criteria were observed at end-June and the first program review has yet to be completed, Latvia is currently not eligible to make any purchases under the stand-by arrangement. Discussions for the first review of the program and the 1995 Article IV consultation took place in Riga during the period July 25-August 10, 1995. 2/ The Latvian representatives included the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Latvia, and senior officials from these as well as other ministries and institutions. The mission also held meetings with officials from several banks. The staff was unable to reach understandings with the authorities on the requisite policies to improve fiscal performance and address problems in the banking system and therefore the review discussions were not completed. The Executive Board concluded the 1994 Article IV consultation on July 15, 1994. On that occasion, Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued firm commitment to the overall aims of the economic program and welcomed Latvia's acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 in June 1994 (Appendix I). They regarded price stability as a prerequisite for sustainable growth and underscored the need for continued efforts to develop financial markets and indirect monetary policy instruments as well as the importance of limiting the deficit of the general government within the target envisaged under the 1994 budget. With respect to trade policy, the authorities were encouraged to resist domestic pressures for protection. Directors welcomed the progress made in restructuring the financial system and urged the authorities to accelerate privatization. Latvia's reform efforts are being supported by technical and financial assistance from the World Bank. The Bank has approved five loans for a total of about US$123 million: an import rehabilitation loan, an agricultural development loan, an enterprise and financial sector loan, an environment loan, and a district heating rehabilitation project loan l/ The Board papers are EBS/95/53 (3/27/95) and Buff/95/35 (4/20/95). 2/ The staff representatives were Mr. van der Mensbrugghe (head), Ms. Castello-Branco, Mr. Gropp, and Mr. Richards (all EUR II), Mr, Anayiotos (PDR), Mr. Vollan (MAE), and Ms. Immers (EUR II) as staff assistant. Mr. Paljarvi, the Fund's resident representative, assisted the mission. The First Deputy Managing Director held discussions with the authorities over a period of three days. In addition, Mr. Bergo and Ms. Srejber, respectively, Executive Director and Alternate Executive Director for Latvia, attended some of the meetings.

Extensive technical assistance has been provided by the Fund in support of Latvia's reform program (Appendix III), as well as by other multilateral (notably the IBRD and EU/Phare) and bilateral sources. The Latvian authorities compile the full range of core statistics necessary for effective surveillance on a timely basis. While the major macroeconomic statistics are generally compiled in close accordance with international guidelines, their usefulness is constrained by the incomplete coverage and quality of the basic data sources. The authorities have given a high priority to the resolution of these problems since the last consultation. A detailed assessment of the economic database for Latvia is contained in the Annex. II. Recent Economic Developments and Performance Under the Stand-Bv Arrannement After a prolonged period of making considerable strides in stabilization and in the transformation process (Box l), the current economic situation in Latvia is difficult. Since the approval of the stand- by arrangement, economic and financial developments have been adversely affected by the simultaneous emergence of a deteriorating fiscal position and a banking crisis. These two factors combined have led to an erosion of public confidence and have caused some uncertainty about the future course of the economy. The latest official estimates confirm that an economic recovery occurred in the year to March 1995, following a pronounced decline in output (Table 1 and Chart 1). Comparing the first quarter of 1995 with that of 1994, the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) estimates that real GDP grew by 1 percent; based on a range of indicators, staff estimates suggest somewhat higher growth. Rapid growth in both consumption and investment led the economic upturn. However, since the public disclosure of the weaknesses in the banking system, several indicators suggest that a contraction in measured economic activity is currently underway. Registered open unemployment has nevertheless remained steady since early 1994 at about 6 l/2 percent of the labor force. After reaching a peak of 3.5 percent in January 1995, the monthly inflation rate gradually declined to 0.3 percent in July and was in fact slightly negative in August (Chart 2). Between end-1994 and August 1995, the consumer price index increased by 15 percent, the program target for all of 1995. The lagged effect of the large surge in liquidity stemming from the balance of payments surpluses in the latter part of 1994, together with increases in administered prices, account for much of the higher-than- projected inflation outcome.

AchievemmtsThrough 1994 After regaining independence in 1991, the authorities moved rapidly to implement economic reform aimed at transforming Latvia into a market economy. The stabilisation and structural reform programs were centered on price liberalization, elimination of subsidies, tight financial policies, and a liberal trade and payments system . At an early stage of the adjustment process, Latvia introduced its own currency in order to allow the Bank of Latvia to run an independent monetary policy. As a result of the firm implementation of stabilixation policies, the Latvian authorities succeeded in bringing inflation down, arresting the decline in output and accumulating a sizable amount of international reserves. Inflation declined sharply, from 960 percent in 1992 to 26 percent in 1994. Following a decline of 50 percent during 1992-93, real GDP increased by 2 percent in 1994. Between June 1992 and December 1994, gross official reserves rose by more than USSSOO million and by end-1994 covered 4 l/2 months of imports of goods and non-factor services. Prudent fiscal policies were a centerpiece of LaWia’s stabilization efforts. Expenditures were kept within budgeted amounts and, as a result of the introduction of new taxes and improved tax administration, the revenue to GDP ratio increased significantly. Fiscal management was strengthened in early 1994, with the adoption of a law on budget and financial management, and the creation of a Treasury Department and the State Revenue Service. Monetary developments during 1993-94 were strongly influenced by the sizable inflows of foreign currency to the Bank of Latvia, partly reflecting the increased demand for money. After the initial depreciation of the interim currency (the Latvian ruble) against the US dollar in 1992, the lats appreciated significantly in the subsequent years. Progress in the area of structural reform has lagged somewhat behind the achievements in macroeconomic stabilization. Although considerable progress has been made in the privatisation of small enterprises and in agriculture, in general the privatisation process has moved slowly, reflecting weaknesses in the legal and institutional framework. These have been partially removed with the adoption of a new privatisation law and the establishment of the Privatixation Agency and the State Property Fund in 1994. Major steps have been taken in financial sector reform, including the phasing out of interest rate controls, directed and subsidixed credits, the introduction of current account convertibility and the elimination of all restrictions on capital movements. Excluding agriculture, a liberal trade regime was adopted. Following the creation of a two-tier banking system, an excessive number of banks was established as a result of very liberal licensing policies; a consolidation of the sector has been gradually taking place. As a result of an abrupt shift in capital flows, a balance of payments deficit of nearly US$200 million was recorded in the first half of 1995. The closure of several large banks (Box 2) plus the associated general uncertainty led to immediate demands for foreign exchange. Commercial banks' net foreign assets declined by nearly US$lOO million during the first quarter following the closure of a prominent bank and the inability of several other banks, including the largest bank (Bank Baltija), to submit audited 1994 reports to the Bank of Latvia on schedule. The central bank intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market in the second quarter to defend the fixed exchange rate (pegged to the SDR at a rate of LVL 0.7997 per SDR since February 1994), losing nearly US$90 million in reserves in the weeks surrounding the closure of Bank Baltija. The external current account deficit was broadly as envisaged under the program, with faster export Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4 - growth being offset by higher imports. Gross official international reserves at end-June amounted to US$540 million, equivalent to 3 l/3 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services (Chart 3). The government financial deficit for the first half of the year was LVL 38 million (1.6 percent of annual GDP) compared with the annual program limit of LVL 40 million; the performance criterion on the financial deficit at end-June thus was not observed (Table 2). Financing of the budget deficit was largely provided by recourse to central bank credit, which also resulted in the nonobservance of the end-June performance criterion on net domestic assets. As commercial banks' liquidity worsened in the face of deposit withdrawals, banks reduced their claims on government during this period. Prior to the removal of the cut-off discount rate in June, the rigidity in the discount rate also dampened the demand for Treasury bills. u The outstanding stock of Treasury bills, which peaked in March at LVL 58 million, declined to a trough of LVL 24 million in early July but has since recovered to LVL 37 million in mid,-September in response to increased interest rate flexibility. There has been a general weakening in tax collections. Revenue fell short of the program target by LVL 34 million in the first half of 1995 (1.4 percent of annual GDP, Table 3). The banking crisis and the weakening, of the economy have had some impact on revenue but they can account only for a part of the slippage. Following the resignations of a number of senior officials in the State Revenue Service, tax administration has been in some turmoil. Tax arrears have increased significantly. Tax evasion is widespread and, given limited efforts at enforcement, appears to be growing. Concerns about the soundness of the financial system has led some enterprises to forsake the banking system for cash-based transactions, which may help explain increased evasion. Despite the increase in wages, there have been significant shortfalls in the collection of the payroll tax; even some budgetary organizations are reportedly not paying the payroll tax. In view of the lower than envisaged revenue, government spending, excluding wages and pensions, has been curtailed sharply. Total government expenditure in the first half of the year was LVL 16 million (0.7 percent of annual GDP) less than programmed. Monetary developments clearly reflect the erosion of confidence brought about by the banking crisis. As indicated above, the net foreign assets of the banking system declined by US$200 million during the first half of the year (Tables 4 and 5). Since the program provided for a large intervention margin to support the exchange rate, the performance criterion on net international reserves at end-June, however, was met by a margin of US$3 million. As envisaged in the program, monetary policy was tightened in I/ Even though supply exceeded demand, the Ministry of Finance kept the cut-off discount rate on one-month Treasury bills around 18 percent from end-1994 through May 1995. In early May, the cut-off rate was increased from 18.25 to 24.5 percent, and further to 30 percent at end-May.

TheBankingSectoraudthe1995Crisis The closure of several prominent banks, including Latvia’s largest bank, Bank Baltija, in the first half of 1995, is the culmination of a crisis which had been brewing for some time and reflects major structural weaknesses in the banking sector. Liberal licensing policies allowed for the establishment of a large number of banks (63 at end-1993), without the necessary qualified staff, appropriate accounting methods and internal control procedures, and without sufficient capital. The lack of an effective regulatory framework, as well as of consistent enforcement of prudential regulations, allowed banks to take excessive risks and adopt unsound lending policies. In particular, widespread insider lending, coupled with the existing complex links between banks and enterprises, added to the problems caused by poor loan portfolios. The lack of financial discipline and inappropriate accounting systems at the level of enterprises further contributed to the development of financial fragility in the banking sector. The licenses of 8 commercial banks were revoked in 1994, and during the first seven months of 1995 the activities of another 15 banks, including 3 of the largest 10, were suspended. The publication, in April, of banks’ audited reports for 1994 revealed severe financial distress in the banking sector, with 2/3 of the audited banks having recorded losses last year. The failure of Bank Baltija, as well as several other large banks, to submit audited reports by the March 31 deadline further undermined confidence in the banking system, leading to capital flight and deposit withdrawals. Initially, Balti,ja received liquidity support from the Bank of Latvia, but when it became clear that the bank was insolvent, its activities were suspended in May, triggering a full-blown banking crisis. Before its collapse, Bank Baltija had followed a very aggressive policy to gain market share, offering the highest deposits rates in Latvia. At the same time, the bank had concentrated its lending on high-risk short-term loans and kept a large open position in foreign currency. As a result of poor lending policies, lack of internal controls and neglect for prudential regulations--in particular, significant insider lending, its financial situation deteriorated drastically during 1994. Furthermore, outright fraud was uncovered, leading to the incarceration of both the main shareholder and the president of the bank. By the time the bank’s operations were suspended, most of its assets had been stripped, leaving negative net worth of around US$400 million, equivalent to 8 percent of GDP. Deposit liabilities at end-March 1995 accounted for around LVL 138 million (excluding bank deposits), or about 30 percent of total deposits. Following the authorities’ intervention, the Bank of Latvia assumed the responsibility for running the bank, but after insolvency was formally declared, it was handed over to a court-appointed administrator in July. At the end of July, 1995, Latvia was home to 41 commercial banks, including three state-owned banks (the Mortgage and Land Bank, the Latvian Savings Bank and the Universal Bank of Latvia) and one foreign bank (So&X G&&ale); the Universal Bank of Latvia is in the process of being privatized. Currently, only 17 banks hold unrestricted licenses and are allowed to take household deposits. These “core” banks are the largest banking institutions in Latvia and held 82 percent of total assets, 96 percent of total deposits and 78 percent of total capital of the banking system at the end of June 1995. Although the capital and reserves of the banking system grew from LVL 7.4 million in 1992 to LVL 156.3 million in June 1995, most of the small banks are expected to face difficulties in meeting the increased minimum capital requirement (LVL 1 million) by early 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - response to large foreign exchange outflows; on June 1, the Bank of Latvia increased its refinance rate by 1 l/2 percentage points to 26 l/2 percent. Total money supply over the first half of the year declined by 5 percent in nominal terms, or about 17 'percent in real terms (Chart 4). As a result, velocity rose sharply. Excluding deposits which are now blocked in insolvent banks, total liquidity in the economy fell by 25 percent over the same period, or 35 percent in real terms. Total domestic credit grew by 13 percent reflecting, as programmed, restrained lending to the economy except to the Government. Largely on account of increased reporting of banking losses, other items net rose. Although interest rates have declined gradually since mid-1994, lending rates continue to be high in real terms, while deposit rates have turned negative (Chart 5). Progress in structural reform has been slower than envisaged under the program.. Partly on account of increased uncertainty stemming from the banking crisis, the pace of privatization has not picked-up as much as expected. Bankruptcy legislation has not been submitted to Parliament and measures to prevent the accumulation of (energy arrears encountered resistance from Parliament. III. Policy Discussions The authorities restated their commitment to the policies underlying the stand-by arrangement, but noted that several objectives of the program were no longer attainable as a result of the banking crisis and budgetary slippages. In particular, they agreed to retain the current pegged exchange rate with the continued support of tight monetary policy. The authorities acknowledged the need to urgently adopt supporting fiscal policies to limit the budgetary overruns and address the medium-term fiscal outlook. To restore confidence in the banking system,, both the Government and Bank of Latvia concurred on the importance of dealing decisively with the banking crisis and strengthen banking supervision. Furthermore, renewed efforts are required to prevent a loss in the momentum of privatization. In agreeing to the above, the authorities noted that the parliamentary elections, scheduled for September 30-October 1, were complicating these various tasks, in particular, the adoption of budgetary measures. Largely for this reason, the staff was unable to complete the review discussions at the time. 1. The macroeconomic setting As a result of the financial crisis, the economic growth target of 5 percent in 1995 is no longer feasible. Noting the difficulties of quantifying the impact of the crisis, the authorities and staff have tentatively revised downwards the projected real GDP growth rate in 1995 to zero. Despite the sharp contraction in liquidity, the authorities were not overly concerned about substantial deflationary pressures for several reasons. First, the role of financial intermediation in the economy was quite limited, with a high level of transactions, including payment of wages and salaries, still conducted on a cash basis.

Moreover much savings were held in the form of foreign banknotes. Second, some of the lost deposits were of a very speculative nature. Third, indicators of economic activity were contradictory and inconclusive. Inflationary pressures have diminished considerably given the recent decline in the money supply. Largely on the basis of expected increases in energy tariffs, inflation in the second half of the year is nonetheless expected to average about 1 percent a month. For the year as a whole, the inflation target has been revised to 23 percent. With respect to the external sector, the current account deficit is expected to remain equivalent to 3 percent of GDP and gross official international reserves are projected to increase to achieve coverage of 3 l/2 months of imports of goods and non-factor services. 2. Fiscal policv and the social safetv net Despite efforts to curtail expenditure, the government financial deficit has been much higher than budgeted. Based on recent trends, the decisions to increase pensions and to compensate depositors of failed banks, and in the absence of corrective measures, the staff projected a financial deficit of LVL 120 million (5 percent of GDP) for 1995, compared with the program target of LVL 40 million (1.6 percent of GDP). The authorities agreed with the need to tighten fiscal policy in order to alleviate the pressure on monetary policy and absorb less of the limited savings available in the economy. On the basis of both revenue-raising and expenditure- reducing measures, together with increased foreign financing, the authorities agreed in the context of the review discussions to limit the financial deficit in 1995 to LVL 90 million (3.8 percent of GDP). The ceiling on net lending would remain tight and thus the fiscal deficit would be limited to 4.4 percent of GDP compared with the program target of 2.2 percent of GDP. Noting some exceptional factors, in particular the direct costs related to the banking crisis, the staff was prepared to accommodate this temporarily enlarged budget deficit within a revised program provided measures would be put in place to prevent a recurrence of budgetary difficulties next year. A supplementary budget was submitted to Parliament on August 24 with a revised financial deficit of LVL 92 million. However, the supplementary budget did not specify the measures which would enable achievement of the targeted deficit and therefore it was not considered a basis for concluding the review. The Parliament approved the supplementary budget in the first reading and the second reading is expected to take place before end-September. Assuming no changes in tax policy, total government revenue in 1995 would fall short of the program target by about two percentage points of GDP and would be lower than the 1994 outcome. The authorities indicated that they were taking various steps to counter this disturbing trend. The recent appointment of a State Minister of Revenue would provide some leadership to the State Revenue Service. Tighter controls on the granting of tax deferrals will be implemented and inspection of borders intensified. Furthermore, the authorities agreed to implement, prior to October 1, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - following specific measures aimed at improving tax administration: 1) introduction of tax payer identification numbers within a comprehensive tax payer register; 2) the establishment of a large tax payers unit, and 3) the establishment of monthly revenue targets for tax offices. The authorities acknowledged that increased yields of these measures would only start accruing next year. On the other hand, the authorities were reluctant to consider increasing tax rates, primarily for two reasons. First, in view of the forthcoming elections, it would be difficult to advance such a measure at present. Second, the tax burden is already high and thus an even greater burden would be placed on those taxpayers who are discharging in full their tax liabilities. Consequently, greater emphasis is to be placed on tax controls and enforcement. While sympathetic to the need to minimize the tax burden, the staff noted that in the absence of draconian measures to cut expenditure, the inability to contain the deficit would compromise the key macroeconomic objectives. Moreover, in assessing the medium-term fiscal outlook, significant revenue-raising measures were required since it appeared unlikely that expenditures could be reduced to the extent needed. The staff noted that by international comparisons, excise taxes were relatively low. For example, the excises on gasoline and diesel are about 17 and 9 percent, respectively, of the pump price. Excises on alcohol are also relatively low. The authorities agreed to give further consideration to the matter. Expenditures are scheduled to increase in the second half of the year in two areas unforeseen in the program. First, pensions were raised on July 1 by about 7 percent, resulting in additional spending of LVL 12 million in 1995. Second, the Government has decided to compensate household depositors for their losses in failed banks up to a limit of LVL 500 per depositor. Given the budget constraint, cash compensation will be limited to LVL 200 per depositor over half a year starting in August 1995, resulting in additional government expenditure of LVL 23 million in 1995. Over the following three years, depositors will be eligible to receive an additional LVL 100 per year. While efforts are being undertaken by the Government to recover the assets of failed banks, actual receipts are likely to be small. Despite these unexpected expenditures, equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP, total government expenditure is still projected to be lower than the programmed amount on account of restraint elsewhere in the budget. Excluding wages and transfers, which account for two-thirds of total government expenditure, spending has been very tight. Investment expenditure has again been curtailed sharply and government spending on goods and services and general maintenance has been only about half of budgeted amounts. The authorities recognized that there was little scope for further reductions in such spending since productivity could be adversely affected by cuts in basic supplies and maintenance. They accepted the need for larger investment, particularly in infrastructure, which would help spur private investment. Moreover, greater resources are required for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - such areas as the legal system, land registry, and law enforcement in order to provide the requisite support and institutions necessary for completing the transition to a market economy. The authorities acknowledged the need to control spending on wages and salaries but ruled out the possibility of reversing the recent increase in pensions. The Government is seeking to lower the wage bill for all budgetary organizations except the Ministry of Education by 15 percent, effective September 1, which would result in budgetary savings of LVL 1 million a month. Since budgetary organizations receive wage funding for more positions than there are employees, such a reduction would not necessarily translate into either a 15 percent cut in employment or a 15 percent cut in wages. More generally, the Government recognizes the need for a major overhaul of the public sector, including a significant reduction in the number of employees and the closure of institutions in many ministries, including health, education and agriculture. Ministries are being encouraged to introduce fees for services, as witnessed by the recent government decision to charge hospital patients 25 percent of the costs for health care. In order to finance the larger financial deficit, equivalent to 3.8 percent of GDP, recourse to significant external financing is required. Through a private placement of a two year bond in the international capital market, the Government received LVL 22 million (Yen 4 billion) on August 15. The Government has also requested the disbursement of the second tranche of the EU loan, equivalent to LVL 30 million, though it is uncertain if such financing will be forthcoming since the EU loan was originally intended for balance of payments purposes. Recognizing that the current budgetary situation threatens to compromise the goal of macroeconomic stability, the present Government intends to submit a financial balanced budget for 1996. Assuming new revenue-raising measures which would generate additional tax receipts equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP, growth in nominal expenditures would have to be limited to about 10 percent (which implies a decline in real terms of about 5 percent) to achieve a balanced position. In preparing the 1996 budget, the authorities accepted the need to allow for contingencies associated with the banking system, repayment of government-guaranteed debts of insolvent enterprises, and increasing unemployment. Owing in part to the need to repay the foreign bond issue, the 1997 budget will also be tight. In assessing the medium-term budgetary outlook, the authorities acknowledged the need to reduce the size of the public sector. In addition to downsizing the number of civil servants, the authorities felt that a rationalization of the education and health sectors was required. Given the demographic characterization of the population, the need for pension reform is also apparent. In July 1995 a package of legislation was introduced into Parliament that would significantly overhaul the social security system. The aim of the proposed reforms is to ensure the continued affordability of the social security system and to move toward an insurance system that links individual benefits more closely to prior contributions. The current Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 1.0 - pension system would be replaced by a funded scheme and the minimum retirement age for women would be increased from 55 to 56 in 1996, with half-yearly increases every year until the target of 60 is attained. Rather than raising the retirement age to 65 for men and women, the pension formula would provide incentives for working past the age of 60. The proposed legislation would also reform sick leave and unemployment benefits. 3. Monetary and exchanFe rate policies Exchange rate stability will remain as the main goal of monetary policy and the Bank of Latvia will continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary to support the current peg to the SDR. Since the exchange-rate anchor, which was adopted but not officially announced in February 1994, is viewed as a stable, well-known arrangement, the authorities see little merit in announcing a formal peg. The Bank of Latvia's successful intervention in the foreign exchange market and increase in the refinance rate have contributed to the restoration of confidence in the lats; the authorities expect some recovery in the level of international reserves within the next few months, as a result of the reflow of foreign investors' funds and reverse currency substitution. Should outflows of foreign exchange resume, however, the Bank of Latvia is prepared to raise its interest rates in order to arrest a further decline in international reserves. The monetary outlook for the remainder of 1995 was discussed with the Bank of Latvia. The authorities believe that the decline in monetary aggregates observed during the first half of the year should be interpreted with caution, in view of the large amounts of foreign exchange circulating in the economy and the size of residents' accounts held abroad. The strong monetary growth observed in late 1994 provided a cushion dampening the deflationary impact of the banking crisis. In light of these considerations, the Bank of Latvia does not envisage a relaxation of monetary policy in the near future. The intention is to extend no further credits to the Government this year, but to provide liquidity support to sound banks as necessary. The Bank of Latvia will continue to monitor developments carefully, however, in order to avoid a liquidity crunch which could compromise growth prospects. To prevent further deposit withdrawals and help mobilize additional funds, the Bank of Latvia will, through moral suasion, encourage commercial banks to raise their deposit rates. Banks expressed doubts about this strategy, citing the experience of Bank Baltija, after which offering high deposit rates is perceived as riskier by the public. The Bank of Latvia remains committed to a more active use of monetary instruments for liquidity management and to the development of interbank and money markets. Over the next few months, it plans to introduce an automatic short-term refinance facility, to require collateral on all refinance facilities, and to start engaging in repurchase agreements with commercial banks. To foster market development and increase the liquidity of Treasury bills, the Bank of Latvia will step up its participation in the secondary market. In order to stress the temporary and exceptional nature of its Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - support to the budget in 1995, the Bank of Latvia decided to increase substantially the credit line to the Government instead of purchasing more government securities. 4. Structural issues in the financial sector The closure of many banks, including Latvia's largest bank, has severely eroded public confidence in the banking system. The collapse of Bank Baltija was particularly damaging, in view of the bank's size, and it evolved into a full-scale banking crisis. Bank Baltija was declared insolvent by Latvia's commercial court at end-June and the court-appointed administrator will decide about its future by mid-October. The authorities have indicated their preference for liquidation and insist that public funds will not be used in the unlikely event a decision is made to recapitalize the bank. Although no large scale bank runs have taken place, deposits have declined steadily since April 1995, mainly as a result of withdrawals by households. The banking crisis also led to significant portfolio shifts, with households moving into cash or demand deposits and enterprises keeping a larger share of their funds in foreign-exchange denominated deposits in Latvian banks. Rumors about the financial health of some banks have led to further withdrawals of deposits and to liquidity problems in several major banks, including the Latvian Savings Bank (LSB), which holds about 40 percent of unblocked household deposits. As indicated above, the Government has promised to compensate depositors of all failed banks up to LVL 500 per depositor, with no interest, during a three-year period, with a view to restoring confidence in the banking system; in aggregate, deposit compensation will amount to LVL 55 million. Cash compensation has started on a limited scale, using funds recovered by bank administrators of small failed banks. The authorities have indicated that claims from legal entities on failed banks will be honored to the extent that assets are recovered and that residents and non-residents will receive equal treatment. The authorities recognize the need for an orderly reduction in the number of banks and for further restructuring of the sector. A first step in this direction was taken in June 1995, when the Bank of Latvia limited the number of banks allowed to accept household deposits, without, however, announcing publicly the criteria. The staff urged the authorities to make this information public as a confidence-boosting measure; in August 1995 the Bank of Latvia issued a press release listing the 17 banks in Latvia which qualified as deposit-taking institutions. These "core" banks recorded interim profits of around LVL 5 million (7 percent of capital) in the first half of 1995. They are in compliance with prudential regulations and are considered as fundamentally sound and thus eligible for liquidity support by the Bank of Latvia. Of the remaining 24 banks, 17 recorded losses during the first half of the year. Fifteen banks could in principle be upgraded to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - the "core" group through capital injections, mergers or acquisitions, but the prospects for attracting new capital in the sector are not encouraging. The others are not considered viable and are likely to be closed soon. 1/ As part of its efforts to strengthen banking supervision, the Bank of Latvia plans to make enhanced use of external auditors to monitor the "core" banks on a quarterly basis, to increase its resources in the supervisory area, and to establish an early-warning system to prevent future crises. In mid-July 1995 the Bank of Latvia issued regulations introducing stricter limits on insider lending (15% of capital), on credit concentration (25% of capital), and on open foreign exchange positions (10% of capital on any one currency and 20% of capital on all currencies). However, implementation of these tighter limits has been delayed, since the new law on credit institutions extended the effective date for compliance to September 1996. u This law is currently under Parliamentary review, together with a law on bankruptcy of credit institutions, deposit insurance and deposit compensation. Progress in the restructuring and privatization process of the remaining state banks is encouraging with respect to the Universal Bank, but disappointing as far as the LSB is concerned. A four-stage privatization program for the Universal Bank was launched earlier this year and 50.1 percent of its shares were sold to the public in May in exchange for privatization vouchers. The bank is committed to finding a strategic investor and the Government envisages the completion of the privatization program by April 1996. The LSB incurred major losses in 1994 on account of poor lending policies and an unwieldy branch structure, and is currently facing both liquidity and solvency problems. The staff urged the authorities to quickly implement a rehabilitation program for the LSB, in close cooperation with the World Bank and other international organizations, aimed at restoring profitability by simultaneously restructuring the bank's operations, appointing new management and providing the necessary recapitalization. 5. External oolicies The authorities reiterated their commitment to a liberal trade and payments system. The basic import tariff, excluding agricultural commodities, is 20 percent or lower (15 percent for countries with "most favored nation" status); most raw materials and spare parts are assessed an import duty of 1 percent. The average production-weighted tariff rate for agricultural goods, however, is more than 50 percent. u Four additional banks had their operations suspended in August. 2/ A revised draft of the credit institutions law, dated August 18, establishes January 1996 as the effective date for compliance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - The first meeting of the WTO Working Party conducting membership negotiations with Latvia took place at end-March 1995 and the second meeting is scheduled for end-September; the authorities expect that WTO membership is possible within the next year. In the context of their negotiations with the WTO, the authorities indicated that no discussions on agricultural tariffs took place since the issue is subject to bilateral negotiations with trading partners. The authorities are, however, considering binding agricultural tariffs at 50 percent ad valorem. The staff noted that this would not result in a significant reduction as agreed under the program, and that it was in Latvia's interest to offer bindings at lower rates. On reference prices, the staff encouraged the authorities to consult with the WTO to ensure that their implementation is consistent with WTO rules. On account of the exceptional circumstances related to the banking crisis and the need to instil1 confidence, as well as the prevailing budgetary difficulties, the authorities justified the recourse to external financing in the form of a Yen 4 billion (US$41 million) two-year bond issue in August 1995. While noting the importance of restoring confidence, the staff indicated that the terms of the bond issue were onerous and would place much pressure on the 1997 budget and that foreign borrowing would be better utilized to finance investment. The bond issue also violated the performance criterion for contracting external loans with a l-5 year maturity and left nearly no margin for the l-12 year ceiling at end-September 1995. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to a prudent external debt policy and remarked that total external debt outstanding was equivalent to only 12 percent of GDP. The Government has tightened its policy on the onlending of EXJ/G-24 credits and other balance of payments loans. In particular, the Government has refrained from issuing guarantees and commercial banks have greater incentive to identify credit-worthy clients since they now bear the risk of default. Both commercial banks and borrowing enterprises are subject to greater scrutiny through more frequent auditing. Preliminary findings of a report monitoring the onlending to enterprises of the first tranche of the EU/G-24 credits indicate that the probability of repayments with respect to about 50 percent of the amount lent is slim. Despite the pronounced real appreciation of the exchange rate over the last 2 l/2 years, some 250 percent against a basket of convertible currencies (Chart 6), a margin of competitiveness appears to still remain. Real exports to the West have continued to rise at a steady pace. However, the average wage expressed in US dollars is currently nearly US$200 per month, compared with a monthly average of US$140 in 1994, and thus the margin of competitiveness has narrowed considerably. The margin of competitiveness as measured by wages has also narrowed vis-a-vis Eastern European countries (Table 6). Despite difficulties in certain sectors, notably agriculture, the authorities agreed with the staff that the Latvian economy remained competitive.

Structural oolicies The authorities realize that the transfer of productive assets to private ownership and the establishment of a clearly specified set of property rights are crucial steps in the transformation to a market economy. Progress in this area has been slow, initially as a result of the decentralized approach adopted before the establishment of the Privatization Agency and the State Property Fund in 1994. More recently, the requirement (introduced in September 1994) for the use of vouchers for 50 percent of the sale price has complicated the privatization process considerably and has acted as a deterrent to foreign investment. Nonetheless, more than 300 enterprises have now been passed to the Privatization Agency and the authorities still aim at privatizing 250 medium- and large-sized enterprises this year through international tenders or public offerings (voucher privatization), which would imply that by end-1995 at least 40 percent of the Latvian industry and services sector would be privately-owned. To achieve this goal, the authorities acknowledged that the pace of privatization would have to be accelerated substantially. Since late 1994, 16 enterprises have been privatized through public offerings and two international tenders have been launched. As a result of the first tender (of 45 enterprises), 17 enterprises were sold and another 17 are expected to be privatized before the end of the year. The second tender yielded offers for 30 enterprises, but no sales have been finalized yet. The third tender, of an additional 30 large industrial enterprises, is expected to be launched before the end of September and will include the sale of 24 percent of the shares of the gas company (Latvijas Gaze). At the same time, 10 additional enterprises will be sold to the public in exchange for vouchers. Legislation regulating the privatization of publicly-owned apartments has been adopted. However, the implementing regulation still requires Cabinet approval and the low level of rents is discouraging apartment privatization. One major obstacle to the development of Latvian private enterprises has been the difficulty in purchasing land and using it as collateral to obtain credit. The legal basis for collateralizing land is very weak, since only registered land can be collateralized, and the registration process is expected to take several years; only 25,000 out of some 400,000 plots of land have been registered. The authorities are committed to drafting legislation enabling legal and physical persons to purchase, own, sell, and collateralize land. A persistent problem in the restructuring process has been the accumulation of interenterprise and household arrears, particularly in the energy sector, leading the Government to use foreign credits to settle external debts of energy enterprises on several occasions in 1994. Although some gas prices were increased recently and the prospects for the privatization of the electricity and gas companies (Latvenergo and Latvijas Gaze) are promising, the current tariff-setting policy limits the profitability of energy enterprises. A recent attempt by Latvenergo to raise tariffs by 30 percent was rejected, but the authorities plan to raise Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public350 300 250 200 - 14a - CHART 6 LATVIA EXCHANGE RATES Bilateral Exchange Rate (US$/Lata, DEC 1992 = 100) :’ . . . . ,/’ ,/ ,i / ,.*’ 100 1 ’ I t I 1 I t I I II III IV I II III IV I II 1993 1994 1995 Nominal Effective Rxchange Rates l/ (JAN 1993 = 100) ,... ..r--... ,....’ ,...*. . . . . ,:’ ,: 2000 15oc 501 101 I 300 250 200 150 100 50 I.- I ( I - )- l- o- l- I J l- JAI Bilateral Exchange Rate :Ruble/L.ats.

The response to increased arrears has been varied. In the case of gas and electricity, supplies to delinquent customers have been cut off and some arrears have been recovered. By contrast, the supply of heating and hot water has not been cut off, both due to political pressures and to technical difficulties in disconnecting individual consumers in order to enforce payments. Latvenergo is examining ways to overcome these technical problems and is also considering cutting off supplies to whole districts if payments fall below a certain threshold. While not aimed at offsetting any energy arrears as foreseen in the program, Government transfers to local governments have been partially cut as part of current expenditure-reducing efforts. New legislation on insolvency and bankruptcy procedures, aimed at improving financial discipline among enterprises, was not submitted to Parliament by June 1, 1995, as envisaged under the program. Work on bankruptcy legislation is proceeding and the authorities expect that a draft will be presented for Parliamentary review this year, including workout procedures for orderly corporate restructuring under protection of the courts as well as comprehensive rules for the rights and obligations of parties to loan agreements. IV. Medium-term Outlook and Canacitv to ReDav the Fund The external current account deficit in 1995, excluding official transfers, is projected at US$184 million (equivalent to 4 percent of GDP), as envisaged under the program (Table 7). Total exports of goods, however, are now projected to increase by 21 percent compared with the 11 percent targeted rise. On the basis of results in the first half of the year, penetration of markets in the West appears to remain vibrant, in particular for wood and wood products, textiles, and chemicals. The volume of exports to the West are again projected to rise by about one-third this year. Imports are likewise increasing sharply, with growth in nominal terms projected at 14 percent; imports from the West in real terms are projected to rise by nearly 25 percent. Reflecting the large income Latvia derives from transit trade, the trade deficit is partially offset by the large surplus in the services account. The revised projections assume no further capital outflows, but in fact a net inflow in the second half of the year as a result of the bond issue and official disbursements. Foreign direct investment, which amounted to US$lOO million in the first half of 1995, largely on account of investment in the telecommunications sector, is expected to be considerably lower in the remainder of the year. On the basis of these assumptions, some recovery of the loss in net foreign assets of the banking system would occur. Gross official reserves of the Bank of Latvia at end-1995 are projected at US$600 million, equivalent to 3.6 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. The medium-term balance of payments outlook is based on the assumption that appropriate policies are in place, thus reducing uncertainty and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - restoring confidence, and that external competitiveness remains close to the current level. Autonomous capital inflows would resume but at a moderate pace; combined with the pursuit of tight monetary policy this would lead to a deceleration in inflation and result in little further real exchange rate appreciation. Export volume growth is projected at a quicker pace than that of Latvia's trading partners, reflecting the ongoing adjustment in productivity towards Western levels. Import. volumes are projected to grow at about the same rate as GDP. Under this scenario, the current account deficit, excluding official transfers, would gradually decline to 2 percent of GDP by the year 2000 (Table 8). Reflecting continuing progress in structural reform, foreign capital would be attracted. Foreign direct investment is projected to increase gradually to about 3 percent of GDP. Gross official reserves would rise moderately over the medium term, providing coverage of more than 4 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. External borrowing would remain limited, with the stock of debt in relation to GDP not exceeding its current level of 12 percent. The debt service ratio, in percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services, is projected to increase from 6 percent in 1996 to 10 percent in 1997, owing to the amortization of the bond issue as well as a peak in service payments to the Fund. The one large bullet payment that falls due in 2000 (first tranche of EU loan) again results in a discrete jump in the debt service ratio to 13 percent. Assuming no further use of Fund resources, Latvia's financial obligations to the Fund in 1997 are equivalent to 2.2 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services and 6.6 percent of the projected level of official international reserves (Table 9). The low level of external indebtedness plus the expectation of the pursuit of appropriate economic policies strongly suggests that Latvia is unlikely to face difficulty in discharging its financial obligations to the Fund as scheduled. The worsening government financial balance in 1995 represents a significant increase in government dissaving, rather than a large increase in investment (Table 10). Nonetheless, the external current account deficit in 1995 is projected to widen only slightly, indicating an increase in private sector savings partly related to the banking crisis. As noted above, the authorities acknowledged the need to reduce the role of the public sector to limit its demand for resources. The bulk of fiscal adjustment over the medium-term, the authorities agreed, would fall on expenditure. On the basis of a strengthening of fiscal policy in 1996, public savings would increase and with diminishing uncertainty, part of the increase in private savings would be reversed. In the medium term, savings in both the public and private sector are expected to increase to enable repayment of foreign borrowing and to fund higher investment.

Staff Aooraisal Since the Latvian authorities launched their program aimed at transforming Latvia into a market economy and at attaining macroeconomic stability, considerable progress has been achieved. Prices have been freed, the exchange and trade (excluding agriculture) system is very liberal, and the process of privatization is now firmly entrenched. The implementation of stabilization policies resulted in a sharp decline in inflation and a pronounced increase in the level of gross official international reserves. Moreover, in 1994 economic growth had finally started to resume. The simultaneous emergence of the budgetary difficulties and the banking crisis has placed major strains on the economy. Confidence has been eroded, uncertainty has escalated, and growth has stopped. Recent developments;underscore the necessity not only to retain tight demand management policies but also to deepen structural reform in order to eliminate bottlenecks and provide the necessary legal and institutional underpinnings for stabilization and growth. The slippage in fiscal policy has placed more onus on monetary policy and has rendered the task of restoring confidence in the banking system more difficult. Since the large increase in wages and pensions in the fourth quarter of 1994, revenue has failed to keep pace with increased expenditure. The shortfall in revenue is very worrisome. While the banking crisis has had some impact on government revenue, the reported widespread tax evasion is cause for concern. Before nonpayment of taxes becomes an accepted norm of behavior, the authorities need to take firm and bold action to enforce the existing tax code, including assessing and collecting penalties for tax evasion. A substantial strengthening of tax administration is certainly called'for but since the fruits of such efforts generally take time, a change in tax policy, in the absence of draconian cuts in expenditure, is also necessary. In particular, there is scope to increase excise taxes, which are low by international standards, and which would have the added advantage of generating positive externalities. To minimize the tax burden and in keeping with the objective of a market economy, a rationalization of government expenditure is required. The staff welcomes the authorities' intentions for major reform of public sector employment. Since wages and transfers absorb about two-thirds of government spending and have been considered very sensitive politically, expenditure reductions have fallen disproportionally on other items of the budget, particularly basic maintenance and investment. Moreover, some expenditures, for example, on law enforcement, the reform of the legal system, and the land registry, which would yield high dividends and provide needed support to the structural reform program, have not been undertaken. Given the budgetary developments in the first half of the year, a postponement in the increase in pensions to beyond 1995 would have been warranted. On pension reform, given the projected increase in life expectancy, the staff regrets the decision not to raise the retirement age to 65 and urges the authorities to ensure that the new system provides Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - strong incentives to work past 60. With regard to increased expenditure on account of deposit compensation, the staff supports the authorities in limiting compensation and spreading it out over several years. Given the need for the budget to absorb part of the costs directly related to the banking crisis in order to restore confidence in the financial system, the staff was prepared to accommodate a larger budget deficit in a revised program provided appropriate measures were in place. Such measures need to be adopted urgently in order to address both the short-and medium-term fiscal outlook. Recourse to external financing would also be appropriate in the context of a well-articulated plan to address the causes of the imbalances. With particular .reference to the foreign bond issue, the staff cautions the authorities that such borrowing entails sizable risks and is not a viable option on a larger or repeated basis. As part of the efforts to bring about macroeconomic stability and restore confidence, the staff endorses the authorit,ies' objective of a balanced- budget in 1996. Given the turnaround in capital movements, the focus of monetary policy has changed considerably compared with the recent past. While the significant decline in real money balances has had a notable impact, the raising of interest rates by the Bank of Latvia was a welcome step in providing a strong signal and arresting a further decline in international reserves. Instead of financing the budget deficit through the purchase of Treasury bills, the Bank of Latvia extended a large direct line of credit to the Government. The central bank thus did not seize the occasion to increase its holdings of Treasury bills and therefore its ability to withdraw liquidity in the event large capital inflows resurfaced. The staff strongly encourages the monetary authorities to improve coordination with the Ministry of Finance and to strengthen their efforts to develop the Treasury bill market in order to increase their ability to use open market operations. Inertia in dealing with the fragility of the banking system has resulted in steep costs, many of which are difficult to quantify. While the extent of criminality involved was perhaps surprising, enforcement of existing prudential regulations would have enabled the Bank of Latvia to revoke the license of Bank Baltija and other banks much before reaching the critical stage of insolvency. By failing to intervene early, the authorities missed the opportunity to avoid a crisis and increased sharply the costs of any rescue package. Resolution of the crisis has also proceeded rather slowly. The staff strongly urges the authorities to draw up a medium-term strategy to restructure and strengthen the banking sector. Components of such a strategy would include identification of banks to be rehabilitated, encouraged to be merged, or liquidated. For the short run, the staff welcomes the Bank of Latvia's decision to limit the number of banks eligible to receive household deposits and the strengthened supervision of these banks, including through quarterly auditing by accounting firms working directly for the central bank. To limit the possibility of further bank Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - failures with systemic consequences, the staff supports the Bank of Latvia's intention to provide liquidity support to banks considered solvent and viable. In this connection, the staff urges the authorities to design immediately a credible rehabilitation program for the Savings Bank. To strengthen banking supervision, stricter prudential regulations, including tighter limits on insider lending, credit risk concentration, and open foreign exchange positions, need to be adopted, and their enforcement intensified. The Fund staff stands ready to assist the Bank of Latvia in their endeavors, including by providing an advisor in banking supervision. Latvia's exchange rate policy has been helpful in bringing about stabilization. During the recent crisis, the pegged exchange rate proved very useful in anchoring expectations. Despite the pronounced real appreciation in the exchange rate and recent wage increases, competitiveness in the traded goods sector appears to have been maintained. Continued vigilance is required to ensure that the margin of competitiveness is not eroded by too rapid growth in domestic costs. In order to take full advantage of the gains from trade, the staff urges the authorities to reduce sharply the current high import tariff rates on agricultural commodities. Following recent developments, an acceleration of structural reform is clearly required to hasten the transition process and economic growth. Given their linkages, enterprise restructuring is also crucial for the restructuring of the banking sector. It is disconcerting that the new legislation on insolvency and bankruptcy procedures aimed at improving financial discipline among enterprises has not yet been submitted to Parliament. The acceleration of land registration and legal reform would also lend support to the development of financial institutions. The staff welcomes the authorities' intent to continue the privatization process vigorously, as evidenced by their plan to privatize the utility companies and the recent sale of shares in Universal Bank. As a major step toward eliminating the incidence of arrears, another key structural measure, political interference in the setting of energy tariffs needs to be removed as soon as possible. With the winter season approaching, the authorities should ensure that policies are in place which will not tolerate any accumulation of arrears, including the possibility for the central government to reduce its transfers to local governments for nonpayment of energy bills and for utilities to cut off supplies. On statistics, despite expanded coverage of the enterprise register and improved response rates to statistical questionnaires, considerable scope still exists for broadening the coverage and quality of data on private sector activity. The Central Statistical Bureau should therefore continue to give a high priority to these efforts. In the case of the balance of payments, the need to improve the coverage and quality of customs statistics remains urgent as does the establishment of better reporting by enterprises and commercial banks in order to better distinguish between current and capital account transactions. In order to effectively implement the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - recommendations of several Fund technical assistance missions in balance of payments statistics, past and future, the C:SB would also need to devote more resources in this area. In sum, since embarking in 1992 on the stabilization and structural reform program with the support of the Fund, considerable progress has been achieved in Latvia. The difficulties which have emerged in 1995 result mainly from lax fiscal policies and inadequate banking supervision and illustrate the need to be steadfast in the implementation of stabilization policies and to pursue structural reform vigorously. Faced with the present challenge, the staff urges the authorities to address boldly the budget difficulties and the banking crisis to lay the basis for renewed growth; such actions would restore confidence both inside and outside the country and would allow a completion of the review under the stand-by arrangement. The staff looks forward to working with the new Government to this end. It is recommended that the next Articl'e IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

On October 22, 1992, the Board of Directors approved the first loan to Latvia, a Rehabilitation Loan for US$45 million equivalent. This loan assisted the Government in the design and implementa,tion of its economic reform program. The loan financed imports of essential goods for high priority sectors. The loan was closed on December 31, 1994; about USS2.6 million was not used and cancelled. This loan has been co-financed by a US$35 million equivalent from the Export Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM), of which about US$25 million have been disbursed. An Agriculture Development loan for US$25 million was approved by the Board of Directors on January 11, 1994. The loan supports private agriculture development by providing investment credit to newly emerging private farmers and investment funds for expansion and upgrading to private agro- and forest-industries. On September 20, 1994 the Board of Directors approved an Enterprise and Financial Sector Loan (US$35 million), comprising a credit line, technical assistance for large-scale privatization, and finance for rehabilitation of the payments system, and in December 1994, a US$4 million Liepaja environment loan was approved. A district heating project in Jelgava (USS 14 million) was approved on May 29, 1995. The first World Bank Country Economic Memorandum (GEM), published in April 1993, provided a comprehensive overview of the Latvian economy. It was followed by an economic update report to provide advice to the Government on various macroeconomic and structural reform issues. The Bank has also undertaken sector reviews in the areas of agriculture, public sector management, municipal finance, enterprise development and financial sector reform. A Public Expenditure Review report provided the Government with recommendations on public expenditure planning, programming and management. A report on Local Government Expenditures and Resource Transfer analyzed aspects of expenditure and revenue priorities facing local governments in Latvia. The Bank has also provided substantial technical assistance on tariff policy, customs administration, the design of a duty draw-back scheme, the preparation of a public investment program, and procurement related matters.

The enterprise register is incomplete, response rates to statistical questionnaires are less than satisfactory, and there is misreporting, sometimes deliberate, of economic activity. The authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund, mainly through the resident representative office, and available data are provided on a timely basis. Latvia has a well-articulated publications policy and produces a broad range of publications on economic and financial statistics on a regular and current basis. The authorities have also, for the first time, reported data for the Fund's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook and the Balance of Pavments Statistics Yearbook. Work on the introduction of a page for Latvia in International Financial Statistics has reached an advanced stage. The Fund's Resident Statistical Advisor for the Baltic States is assisting the Latvian authorities in improving the database of macroeconomic statistics. Advice on statistical matters is also provided under the EU/EFTA program of statistical technical cooperation with the statistical offices of the Baltic countries. Activity under this program has recently resumed after a one-year hiatus. 1. National accounts The Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts data on a regular and timely basis, largely following the recommendations of the 1993 SNA. The underlying data are primarily obtained through a comprehensive set of questionnaires that the CSB sends to businesses and individuals, supplemented by information obtained from other government agencies. These basic data are widely believed to understate economic activity, although the degree of this understatement, and how it might be changing over time, is not clear. The official national accounts data published by the CSB incorporate a very approximate adjustment for underrecording. There are also significant discrepancies between the estimates based on production and those based on expenditure and income. The staff therefore makes its own independent estimates of nominal and real Gross Domestic Product. The CSB has just begun a joint project with the statistical offices of Estonia and Lithuinia, funded by the UN/ECE, to develop statistics on the hidden economy. 2. Prices The CSB compiles a nationwide consumer price index. While, with Fund technical assistance, it has been able to develop appropriate methodologies to deal with most of the technical problems resulting from the major structural shifts that have occurred in the economy, information on typical consumption patterns remains weak. The introduction in early 1996 of a new household budget survey, based on World Bank technical assistance, will provide a much improved weighting base for the index and will enable the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - ANNEX compilation of indices for different types of households. The CSB has also recently published a new producer price index, which follows the Fund's recommendations, and is about to publish export unit value and volume indices for the first time. Improvements in the quality of the latter indices will be dependent on progress made in extending the scope and quality of the underlying customs statistics. Work is about to commence on developing an import price index and in revamping the existing construction price indices. 3. Government finance statistics The staff is provided with current quarterly information on the revenues and expenditures, and financing, of the central and local governments. It is necessary to make a number of imputations to make these data analytically useful. Data on the operations of extrabudgetary units, which are growing in importance, are sparse and incomplete. The staff is now assessing the data for 1994 that have just been reported for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and will work with the authorities to reconcile these with the existing staff presentation. 4. Monetary statistics Monthly monetary survey data and data on the Bank of Latvia balance sheet and the consolidated accounts of banking institutions are published with a very short lag. The institutional coverage of the accounts of the banking institutions is complete, and the sectorization and classification of the accounts accord with Fund methodology. The authorities are able to provide short-term data on key analytic components of the accounts on a timely basis. The Bank of Latvia intends to implement recommendations on revisions in the plan of accounts for the monetary authorities shortly. The authorities also intend to amend the treatment of the accounts of de- licensed banks in the monetary survey, based on STA's recommendations. 5. Balance of navments statistics While substantial advances have been made since the beginning of an intensive program of Fund technical assistance almost three years ago, the quality of balance of payments statistics now being produced still falls short, in terms of coverage and reliability, of that required for proper economic analysis. This lack of progress largely reflects resource limitations in the CSB and other involved government agencies. The data on foreign trade continue to be subject to significant coverage and valuation problems. Data on the service transactions of resident enterprises suffer from the general limitations noted earlier and nonresident enterprises and governments have been reluctant to report on their transactions. In the area of transfers, there is as yet no comprehensive and regular source of data on foreign aid received by Latvia. Data on the financial account are incomplete. Difficulties remain in enterprise reporting of short-term capital flows, and medium- and long-term external borrowing by commercial banks and enterprises.
