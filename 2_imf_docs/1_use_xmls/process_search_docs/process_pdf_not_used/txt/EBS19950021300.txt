However, economic growth did not immediately pick up as expected. Inflation was reduced rapidly, helped by a strict wage policy. 0 Weaknesses in tax administration required both corrective measures and a revision of the initial fiscal targets. By end-1994, the authorities were able to reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.8 percent of GDP. 0 All benchmarks for end-1994 were observed, except those on the reduction of external and domestic payments arrears. The 1995 nrogram 0 The 1995 program was on track as of September 30, 1995 (the test date) and is expected to remain on track through end-December 1995. All quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks have been observed for end-September. 0 Real GDP growth of 4-5 percent is projected for 1995. Inflation (cumulative) should be limited to 5 percent. However, the improvement in the external current account balance is frustrated by much lower-than- projected workers' remittances. 0 Good progress has been made on the fiscal front, with a strong revenue performance complemented by effective expenditure control (including, but not limited to, the wage bill). As a result, external and domestic payments arrears have been repaid faster than planned. 0 The civil service census was completed and steps have been taken to design a mechanism to control the wage bill starting in 1996. Important progress has been made in the privatization program, but banking system restructuring continues to lag. Staff position 0 The staff is encouraged by the fiscal results obtained, and urges continuing efforts to achieve all program targets for 1995 as a whole. l The authorities should assume full ownership of the adjustment effort and strengthen their commitment to scale the role of the Government in productive sectors in favor of a larger responsibility for the private sector.

Introduction The discussions on the 1995 Article IV consultation and the midterm review under the third annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) for Burkina Faso were held in Ouagadougou during the period October 20-November 3, 1995. I/ The third annual ESAF arrange- ment was approved on May 31, 1995, in support of Burkina Faso's adjustment program for the period April 1995-March 1996. The attached letter from the Minister of Economy, Finance and Planning, dated November 3, 1995 (Appendix II), reviews the progress made under the program during the first nine months of 1995, and sets out the policies and measures to be imple- mented during the remainder of 1995. A three-year arrangement under the ESAF, in an amount equivalent to SDR 48.62 million (110 percent of quota), was approved on March 31, 1993 (EBS/93/35); the amount of the arrangement was augmented to SDR 53.04 mil- lion (120 percent of quota) in conjunction with the approval of the third annual arrangement on May 31, 1995 (EBS/95/79). As of end-October 1995, Burkina Faso's outstanding use of Fund resources amounted to SDR 41.7 mil- lion (equivalent to 94 percent of quota). With the final disbursement under the third annual ESAF arrangement, which is to be made available upon completion of the midterm review, Burkina Faso's use of Fund resources will amount to SDR 50.5 million (114 percent of quota) at end-December 1995. Burkina Faso is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on October 17, 1994, Executive Directors noted the positive response of the economy to the devaluation of the CFA franc and commended the authorities for their efforts to restrain public expenditures and contain inflationary pressures. They stressed the need to reverse the disappointing performance of government revenue. They also urged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms, including completion of the civil service census, privatization of public enterprises, and banking system restructuring. Burkina Faso's program of structural reform continues to receive support from the World Bank and other creditors and donors. In addition to the disbursement of the third tranche of the structural adjustment credit (SDR 15 million) in March 1995, the World Bank is expected to release SDR 12 million under an agricultural adjustment credit (AGSECAL) by end- 1995; disbursements of the second and third tranches of the transport adjustment credit (SDR 12 million), programmed for 1995, are likely to be delayed until 1996. Burkina Faso's relations with the Fund and the World l-/ The Burkinabe representatives included the Minister of Economy, Finance and Planning and other ministers in charge of economic and financial affairs; the National Director of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO); and other senior officials. The staff representatives (all AFR) were Mr. Diogo (head), Ms. McAuliffe, Mr. Driessen, Ms. Scarlata, and Ms. Wein (assistant).

At a roundtable conference held October 16-18, 1995 in Geneva, donors expressed support for Burkina Faso's medium-term adjustment strategy, as spelled out in the policy framework paper (PFP) for 1995-97. Burkina Faso's economic data base is comprehensive but remains weak, notably in the areas of national income accounts, balance of payments, and price statistics (Appendix VI). The authorities are continuing their efforts to improve the quality, coverage, and timeliness of data. At their request, a multisector statistics (STA) mission completed an overall assessment of the macroeconomic statistical system in July 1995, and highlighted areas for reform in the short and medium term. II. Background and Performance Under the 1995 Program After a period of deteriorating economic conditions in the early 1990s--marked by slow output growth as well as persistent and large fiscal and external imbalances--and a series of unsuccessful attempts at adjustment, the Burkinabe authorities, along with their partners in the CFA franc zone, adopted in January 1994 an adjustment strategy centered on the devaluation of the CFA franc. In order to ensure that the strategy effectively restored competitiveness, it was supported by strong demand management policies --notably strict control over public sector wages--as well as strengthened structural reforms designed to stimulate private sector activity and raise the growth potential of the economy. Performance under the 1994 program was broadly satisfactory, although initial weaknesses in fiscal management required both corrective measures and a revision of the original fiscal targets (Appendix I, Table 1). Owing to' sizable external financing shortfalls, however, the 1994 benchmarks on external and domestic payments arrears were not observed. All other benchmarks for end-December 1994 were met. Inflation in 1994 was lower than projected, while GDP growth was slightly below target; the external current account showed a smaller deficit than projected, owing to a much sharper- than-expected contraction of imports in the wake of the devaluation (Chart 1). Broad money increased by 30 percent in 1994, significantly faster than projected, reflecting a rapid reconstitution of real money balances and a return of flight capital (Appendix I, 'Cable 2). This was reflected in a strong recovery of net foreign assets, while net bank domestic assets increased only moderately. An increas'e in net credit to the Government, partly related to the issuance of securities in the context of bank restructuring, was offset by a decline in credit to the private sector (Appendix I, Table 3).

The main areas of slippages included the restruc- turing of the banking system and the reform of the civil service. Building on the gains achieved in 1994, the authorities pursued a strong policy agenda in 1995, focusing on a continued tight fiscal policy and an accelerated pace of structural reforms. Specifically, the 1995 program aimed at increasing government savings in order to spur a recovery in public investment, while also allowing for a rapid reduction of both domestic and external arrears. Structural reforms were expected to stimulate private sector activity. The encouraging performance of the first nine months of the year suggests that the 1995 program is well on the way to achieving its objectives of raising real GDP growth to 4-5 percent; reducing annual inflation to about 5 percent and limiting the external current account deficit,. excluding official transfers, to 14 percent of GDP. All quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks for end-September were met, with fiscal performance in the period exceeding program expectations (Appendix II, Tables 1 and 2). Inflation has slowed significantly in 1995, owing importantly to the maintenance of a tight expenditure policy, especially with respect to the wage bill. The consumer price index rose by only 4 percent over the period December 1994-September 1995, compared with an increase of 29 percent during the same period a year earlier. With the containment of inflationary pressures, the CPI-based real effective exchange rate has remained fairly constant in 1995, thereby consolidating the gains of a 40 percent real depreciation achieved in 1994 (Chart 2). Exports, in turn, have continued to grow in 1995, with the volume of cotton exports (which account for over 30 percent of total exports) increasing sharply, albeit from a low base in 1994. Other nontraditional exports also maintained an upward trend in 1995. Livestock exports have fallen from their 1994 peak level, however, as local cattle raising in Burkina Faso's main export destination, CBte d'Ivoire, is improving. In contrast, imports have rebounded more rapidly than expected in 1995, particularly capital goods imports, which had slowed in 1994 following the devaluation. Since the core of Burkina Faso's adjustment strategy continues to be the strengthening of public finances, given its exchange arrangements, determined efforts have been made during 1995 to reduce the overall fiscal deficit. Owing to the revenue enhancement and tight expenditure policies, the fiscal balance on central government operations Yl/ at end-September 1995 turned into a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP, compared with the deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP targeted for the period (Appendix I, Table 4). On the revenue side, the 1995 program targeted revenue collection at 10.7 percent IJ Unless otherwise indicated, the fiscal deficit is defined throughout the text on a commitment basis and excluding grants, foreign-financed investment, and restructuring operations.

This was based on a tax effort of 10.3 percent of GDP from the normal tax base, augmented by collection of revenue equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP .arising from tax liability payments from (i) the cotton and gold export companies; (ii) withholding on betting operations that had not been previously transferred to the Treasury; and (iii) the wedge between the notional and effective import cost of petroleum products. Through end-September, collection of the exceptional revenue was achieved as programmed, while total receipts exceeded the program target by 1.4 percentage points of GDP. The excess revenue at end-September reflects in part a one-time improvement in corporate profit tax collection (about 0.3 percent of GDP higher than programmed) owing to the windfall gains associated with revalued balance sheets following the devaluation. The single most important contri- buting factor to the stronger revenue performance, however, was the improved buoyancy of the tax system, as the reforms in tax administration introduced since 1993 began to take hold. Specifically, during 1995, the tax adminis- tration reforms included measures to automate the processing of monthly billing; and computerized, automatic reminders of late payments sent to the largest delinquent taxpayers identified as of end-1994. At customs, supervision and discipline of customs officers and procedures were also strengthened. To make import inspection more effective, the minimum value for imports subject to inspection was reduced, pre-shipment verification of imports was enhanced, and a closer collaboration was instituted with the pre-shipment inspection company (SGS). Initial steps have also been taken to reduce tax exemptions, notably those benefiting public enterprises. On the spending side, the authorities maintained the prudent policy followed in 1994. Total government expenditure was lower than programmed for the first nine months of 1995. No general salary increase was granted. Nonpriority expenditures have been contained, and adequate funding has been provided for the priority sectors of health and education. Investment outlays have picked up in 1995, but the implementation of foreign-financed projects has been somewhat slower than expected. The much-stronger-than- programmed fiscal performance has enabled the authorities to reduce external and domestic arrears more rapidly than planned, an important priority of the program. The first nine months of 1995 witnessed a further recovery of money demand, with broad money increasing by almost 19 percent, against a projected growth of 15 percent, which points to a continued strengthening of confidence in the CFA franc. This was reflected in net foreign assets of the banking system at end-September 199s which exceeded the program target by CFAF 30 billion. Credit demand continued to be weak in 1995, however, despite a downward trend in lending rates by commercial banks. Net bank claims on the Government was also substantially below program target at end;September, reflecting the strong fiscal balance, as well as large disbursements of external adjustment assistance during the third quarter of 1995. As such, by end-September, the Government was able to reduce the net debtor position it had accumulated with the banking system at end-June, when Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public1'0 110 101) 90 80 70 60 50 45 1 CHART 2 BURKINA FASO REAL AND NOMINAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATES, 1985-95 l/ Nominal effective exhange rate (1990=100) 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1991 1994 !395 Source: IhrF, I?forn;atian Notice System. 80 l/ Infzrmotion Nstice System weigh’s adjusted to ccvel infcrmcl trcde Hith Nigeria and Ghana 2/ Based cn relaljve CPls Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicDownload Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - larger-than-programmed repayment of domestic arrears, combined with short- falls in external adjustment assistance, resulted in higher-than-programmed domestic bank borrowing. All structural benchmarks for end-September were observed; however, there were delays in completing structural reforms in the areas of improved budgetary procedures and banking system restructuring. Specifically, the privatization program proceeded as planned during 1995, with the support of sufficient budgetary allocations to the privatization committee responsible for preparing offers for sale and appraising prospective bids. Important progress also was achieved in the area of civil service reform, with the completion of a comprehensive census of the civil service at end-June 1995. On the basis of the census results, the Government has already announced that only civil servants confirmed in a regular position by the census will be included in the payroll beginning end-November 1995. In addition, the Government has introduced draft legislation in Parliament to reform advancement procedures, with a view to eliminating automatic promotions. A preliminary plan to keep the wage bill in check, including a plan to control recruitment, has been drafted but needs to be more fully developed. With these actions, all structural benchmarks and performance criteria were observed for end-September 1995. In addition to the measures subject to structural benchmarks, the program called for a number of initiatives to improve budgetary procedures and efficiency (Appendix I, Table 5). While there were some initial delays, accelerated efforts have been made during the last quarter of 1995 to implement the required measures. Specifically, the draft 1996 budget has been prepared according to a new budget nomenclature, thereby allowing for improved monitoring of expenditures by economic classification in 1996; an exhaustive list of value-added tax (VAT) and customs exemptions has been completed, which will facilitate a comprehensive audit of these exemptions and contribute to improved monitoring. In addition, to avoid bottlenecks in payment procedures and possible arrears, expenditure data are now being recorded at each stage of the payment process, with the situation monitored on a monthly basis. Finally, closed government accounts have been completed for fiscal year 1993, and the exercise has commenced for the 1994 fiscal year. u On the other hand, the restructuring of the banking system has continued to experience delays. Liquidation of the National Development Bank (BND-B) has lagged, as small depositors have not been coming forward quickly for reimbursement. In addition, the privatization of the BFCI/UREBA/CAI bank group, begun in 1994, has not yet been completed, u The closed government accounts have been prepared by the Government, but the competent judiciary body whose review and approval will transform the draft into law (loi de rbglement) has not yet been set up.

III. ReDort on the Discussions The discussions with the Burkinabe authorities focused on the measures to be implemented in the remaining period to consolidate the recent progress and to attain the program objectives for 1995 as a whole. Preliminary discussions on the 1996 fiscal program also took place. The authorities indicated that they looked forward to continued IMF support for the next phase of their reform efforts under a successor ESAF arrangement. The authorities were confident that the macroeconomic objectives for 1995 were within reach, given the strides made during the first nine months of the year and their determination to sustain the adjustment effort and avoid policy slippages. On the inflati.on front, they expected that, given the substantial deceleration already observed and the post-harvest seasonal drop in prices in the latter part of the year, the 8 percent annual average inflation objective would be attained. At the same time, the stronger fiscal position is expected to contribute to higher domestic savings (by 1 percent of GDP) in 1995, thereby reducing reliance on foreign savings to spur economic growth (Appendix I, Table 6). The rebound in cotton production during 1995 and continued strengthening of private sector activities, particularly in import substitution activities, should help raise real GDP growth to 4-5 percent. Consistent with this growth rate, imports that were sharply reduced in 1994 will be somewhat higher than expected in 1995, reflecting in particular a strong rebound in capital goods imports. This should offset somewhat the impact of the expected gains in export earnings on the trade balance. At the same time, lower-than-expected workers' remittances are likely to result in an external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, slightly larger than the 13 percent of GDP initially projected for 1995 (Appendix I, Table 7). 1. Financial nolicies Developments through end-September 1995 suggested that the fiscal deficit for 1995 could be held to CFAF 8.2 billion (0.7 percent of GDP), or about one-half the initial program deficit target of 1.5 percent of GDP. To preserve this improved outcome, the authorities intended to maintain the pace of revenue collection, while keeping expenditures in check. On the revenue side, a total of CFAF 135 billion (11.6 percent of GDP) was projected for end-1995, compared with a program target of 10.7 percent of GDP. The authorities' projections were based on the broad-based nature of the improvement in collection through end-September, when all revenue categories performed better than expected. During the remainder of 1995, the authorities planned to intensify efforts to monitor taxpayers, and toI this end, existing teams of collection agents were being reorganized in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - order to reduce the average number of taxpayers each team monitors. Computerization of revenue collection was also proceeding at a steady pace. With regard to customs administration, the authorities were committed to intensifying the fight against fraud and further reducing exemptions. On the expenditure side, the main priority of the authorities was to maintain spending within the ceiling programmed for 1995, after taking into account the release of previously frozen expenditures. lJ The wage bill as well as outlays for water, electricity, and telephone service (including full commitment of third and fourth quarter consumption), should remain within the 1995 program ceiling. The containment of utilities expenditures in 1995 reflects efforts taken to weed out private consumption previously incorrectly charged to the government account. Spending on goods and services in the health and education sectors, as well as transfers to the privatization committee are expected to be fully committed before year-end. With respect to social outlays, the Government completed by end-September the purchase of an initial stock of generic medicines to ensure wider distribution among the most needy segments of the population. Expenditure savings, on the other hand, are expected on external interest reflecting exchange rate developments in the currencies of Burkina Faso's creditors during the year. These developments should allow for the release of the previously frozen expenditures while remaining within the program expendi- ture ceiling. Following completion of an audit of the current stock of domestic arrears, a further reduction of about CFAF 3.1 billion in domestic arrears was expected by end-1995. u The authorities have also stressed their commitment to further improving government savings in 1996, by continuing to bolster revenue while maintaining tight control over expenditures. To this end, they have already included in the 1996 budget the following discretionary measures: (a) a broadening of the tax base to include non-alcoholic beverages, and addi- tional services; 2/ (b) expansion of the tax base on wages and salaries to include all benefits; and (c) an increase in the tax rate on both locally produced and imported tobacco products. These measures are expected to raise government revenue to 12.2 percent of GDP in 1996. The authorities are prepared, however, to draw on the recommendations of a recent FAD technical assistance mission for any additional measures that may be required to achieve this revenue target. At the same time, the intention is lJ The 1995 program called for freezing CFAF 1.3 billion of budgetary expenditures, pending discussions under the midterm review. 2J The disbursement of a grant of CFAF 10 billion from the European Union in September 1995 is earmarked for repayment of domestic arrears based on an audit of the current stock of domestic arrears. It was expected that these funds would be partially utilized before end-1995. 3J The authorities are currently identifying, for possible inclusion in the VAT base, services that have hitherto been difficult to tax. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public_ 8 . . to keep domestic expenditures at about 12.2 percent of GDP, which should lead to fiscal balance in 1996, compared with the deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP that was initially envisaged for 1996. In the monetary area, broad money is expected to increase by about 19 percent over the course of 1995, reflecting continued strong money demand. Bank credit to the economy should pick up through end-1995, while the stronger-than-expected fiscal position should lower the financing needs of the Government, with the result that the net domestic assets of the BCEAD should remain within the program limits. lJ The Burkinabb authorities intend to work within the regional monetary arrangement to introduce a market-based mechanism to absorb excess liquidity and supplement the existing government securities scheme. With regard to restructuring of the banking system, the authorities will ensure that the liquidation of the BND-B is completed on schedule, and intend to take a final decision on the privatization of the UREBA/BFCI/CAI bank group before end-December 1995. 2. Structural nolicies The authorities are aware of the delays that have been encountered with respect to some structural reforms. They recognize the critical importance of carrying out the measures contained in the 1995 program to improve economic efficiency. In this regard, the authorities indicated that a comprehensive plan is being prepared to reform the civil service into a cost-effective force. A wage control plan is to be finalized by end- December 1995, for implementation from 1996. The plan will seek to strike a balance between the agreed areas of priority recruitment in coming years, and areas where offsetting staffing reductions can be made to rein in the wage bill. With the completion of this plan, the authorities are committed to limiting the 1996 wage bill to CFAF 63 billion. They also intend to further improve expenditure control procedures by monitoring, on a monthly basis, the status of all expenditures from the commitment to the payment stages, in order avoid a possible buildup of domestic arrears. The authorities intend to accelerate the privatization effort. In this context, appropriations for the Privatization Committee will be fully committed, and fully utilized, for the review and approval of prospective bids for the purchase of public enterprises. The reorganization plan for Air Burkina will be completed shortly, in agreement with the World Bank. lJ The stronger fiscal position should offset to a large extent an expected shortfall of CFAF 6.6 billion in external adjustment assistance (excluding rescheduling) for 1995 as a whole. An expected shortfall of CFAF 9.4 billion in the World Bank's transportation sector credit as well as an expected shortfall of CFAF 2.2 billion in bilateral assistance will be offset by larger-than-expected disbursement of assistance (by CFAF 4 bil- lion) from the European Union.

As regards the marketing of sugar, the authorities will allow the private sector to import 10,000 tons of sugar starting July 1996, to supplement the output of the state monopoly, SOSUCO. The authorities intend to intensify efforts to promote regional trade and economic integration among the member countries of the West African Economic Monetary Union (WAEMU). In this context, a regional initiative is under way to harmonize customs tariffs and indirect taxation with assistance from the Fund. 3. Medium-term balance of oavments outlook The medium-term balance of payments projections that underlie the 1995 program were updated in light of developments during the first nine months of 1995 and the latest price projections of the World Economic Outlook. 1/ The external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, is now projected to remain virtually unchanged during 1995-96 from the level of some 14 percent of GDP reached in 1994, before narrowing to about 12 percent of GDP by 1997, as originally programmed, and further to less than 11 per- cent of GDP in 1998. The external current account deficit expected in 1995 reflects primarily the fact that transfers of salary remittances from Burkinabe workers, which were expected to more than double in 1995 in light of favorable economic trends in neighboring countries, have remained constant at their 1994 level. The trade deficit in 1995 is expected to be in line with the program, taking into account the net impact of the stronger recovery of both exports and imports in 1995. u Official transfers, including disbursement of project grants and budgetary assistance, are I/ Commodity price projections as of July 1995 and exchange rate projections as of September 1995, both as communicated by the Research Department. u Estimates of both export and import values for 1994 have been revised substantially downward from the estimates made at the time of the program negotiation. In particular, the value of gold exports has been revised, reflecting lower estimated unit values for gold in 1994. At the same time, the pickup in nontraditional exports turned out to be lower than expected in 1994. The lower imports in 1994 reflect mainly a downward revision to capital goods and petroleum imports. The trade figures in the 1995 program, in turn, were based on assumed growth rates over the initial 1994 estimates. Balance of payments projections for 1995 are now based on assumed growth rates over the revised 1994 levels. Revised 1995 balance of payments estimates also take into account, to the extent possible, available trade statistics for the first nine months of 1995; it should be noted, however, that severe communications problems lasting through October 1995 between customs and other government agencies has hindered the diffusion of external trade data.

The larger-than-envisaged official. transfers, however, are likely to be offset by shortfalls in official capital inflows, reflecting mainly delays in the disbursement of the World Bank's transport sector loan. The combination of these factors, together with continuing repatriation of flight capital, are expected to contribute to an overall balance of payments surplus of about CFAF 60-65 billion, slightly above program, and a sharp increase in external reserves. The. reduction of external payments arrears, however, will fall short of the program target, owing 'to delays in bilateral rescheduling negotiations with some non-Paris club creditors. u The authorities indicated that, over the medium term, they expect to make progress towards achieving a viabl" p external position buttressed by a significant improvement in the current account deficit. Export volume growth is projected at 6 percent (annual average) during 1996-98, as originally programmed, while export values are assumed to be slightly higher than in the program; and import volume is now projected to increase by 5 percent (annually) in the period, compared with 4 percent assumed in the program. The improved forecast for exports reflects stronger world market prices for cotton, which were previously expected to decline during the period, as well as efforts in the next two years to bring the cotton ginneries to full capacity. The forecast also takes into account the expected strong growth of nontraditional exports of textiles and other agricultural products. The authorities expected that the lower trend in private transfers of workers' remittances observed in 1995 would persist through 1998, and that the level of net official flows (including grants and c,apital inflows) would decline gradually over the medium term, resulting in overall balance of payments deficits averaging CFAF 18 billion annually during the period. On the basis of these trends, financing gaps averaging CFAF 15 billion per year would emerge during 1996-97, declining to CFAF 5.4 billion in 1998. The authorities expect to cover these gaps through concessional financing to be secured from donors and through a stock-of-debt operati.on with Paris Club creditors as well as through comparable debt relief from other bilateral creditors. Burkina Faso's external debt service obligations over the medium and long term appears to be sustainable relative to projected exports of goods and nonfactor services, and with respect to projected government revenue. The debt stock at end-1994 was CFAF 760 billion (74 percent of GDP), of which 75 percent was owed to multilateral creditors; and following rescheduling arrangements with Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors which L/ Of the CFAF 11.1 billion ir L external arrears reduction programmed in 1995, the authorities have settled CFAF 4.6 billion through cash payments. As for the remaining CFAF 6.5 billion in arrears to be rescheduled, substantial progress has been made with Russia (arrears of CFAF 3 billion on principal and interest), while bFlatera1 discussions with Libya to reschedule arrears of CFAF 3 billion are to start soon.

Assuming average export volume growth of about 4 percent over 1996-2005, total debt service as a percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services is expected to remain below 22 percent from 1995 onward, dropping to below 17 percent by 2005 (Appendix I, Table 8). l-J Given the authorities' objective of increasing government revenue by about 0.6 percentage points of GDP annually to 18 percent of GDP by 2005, total debt service as a ratio to government revenue is expected to decline from 29 percent in 1994 to below 14 percent in 2005. However, under this scenario, Burkina Faso would continue to need exceptional financing over the medium- and long-term, to which a stock-of- debt operation could contribute. Simulations of the changes in debt profile that could result from a stock-of-debt reduction operation show reduced debt service obligations, and improve the prospects for external viability. Specifically, under this scenario, creditors who previously rescheduled their debt service obligations under Paris Club I and II are assumed to reduce the outstanding stock of debt owed to them as of end-1995, according to Naples terms. Other bilateral creditors are also assumed to write-off a portion of the debt stock owed to them as of end-1995, also according to Naples terms. With the reduced stock of debt owed to both Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors, Burkina Faso's total debt service as a percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services would fall to below 13 percent by 2005; as a ratio to government revenue, total debt service would fall to below 11 percent in 2005. In particular, it is the reduced stock of debt owed to creditors not previously rescheduled and non-Paris Club creditors (which represented 20 percent of the total debt stock at end-1994) that would have the largest impact on the lower debt service; 2J only 5 percent of total debt stock at end-1994 was owed to creditors who participated in previous Paris Club rescheduling. For more details on the impact of a stock of debt reduction on Burkina Faso's medium- and long-term debt service, see Appendix V. Debt service to multilateral creditors accounted for about 58 percent of total external debt service in 1994, and is expected to decline slightly to 51 percent by 2005. Because of a heavier repayment schedule in later years, however, scheduled debt service obligations to multilateral creditors would increase to about 90 percent of total debt service beginning in 2010. 3J Burkina Faso's obligations to the Fund will peak in 2001 at l.J Average export volume growth is projected to be above average through 1998, as cotton export growth remains strong, and then to level off at just below 4 percent annual growth thereafter. 2J The non-Paris Club creditors include Russia, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Togo, Ghana, and Algeria. 3J Including debt service on new borrowing after 1995 which is assumed to come from multilateral creditors.

Debt service to the Fund will average 9.4.percent of total debt service obligations during 1995-2004. With respect to the exchange system, the authorities indicated that the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions would remain free of restrictions, and that the limits on travel allowances would continue to be liberally administered. In consultation with other members of the regional monetary arrangement, Burkina Faso intends to continue efforts to ensure an early acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. 4. Data issues While the authorities regularly provide core economic data to the Fund (Appendix VI, Attachment), they agreed that sound economic management in the period ahead would be greatly helped by improvements in the timeliness and quality of key macroeconomic statistics. The existing shortcomings, particularly with respect to public finances, national income accounts, and price statistics, were highlighted in a recently completed multisector STA mission, and recommendations have been made for both short- and medium-term corrective action. Specifically, the compilation of statistics in Burkina Faso suffers from a lack of adequate financial and human resources, as well as from insufficient coordination among the various agencies responsible for key statistics, which in turn affect the timeliness and reliability of data. The quality of source data- -including an outdated consumption basket for the consumer price index--also needs to be improved. Finally, the long lags in publishing official statistics has complicated or delayed decision making by private operators. The latest available official balance of payments (for 1991), for example, was published in 1994, while monetary data are generally available with a three-month lag followed by frequent revisions. Steps have already been taken to improve price indicators, in the context of a regional initiative to introduce a new consumption basket and index in 1996. Pla.ns are also in place to develop a manufacturing production index over the next two years. The STA mission further recommended the following steps: (i) estab- lishing a committee to coordinate, on a monthly basis, public finance statistics from various institutional sources; (ii) providing adequate resources to produce the new consumer price index (planned at the regional level) on a regular and timely basis; (iii) preparing a producer price index; and (iv) creating a statistical council with participation of all agencies involved in the production of macroeconomic data, and the subse- quent preparation of a medium-term program to create a new framework for national income accounts. The authorities will endeavor to implement these recommendations in stages, and with technical assistance from donors, incIuding the Fund, as needed. As a start, the authorities will ensure sufficient financial resources in the 1996 budget to improve data collection and compilation.

Staff Aonraisal After some initial setbacks in implementing the program supported by ESAF arrangements during 1993-95, Burkina Faso has steadily improved its economic and financial performance since the devaluation of the CFA franc in early 1994. The appropriately restrictive accompanying measures put in place in 1994 have helped in strengthening the fiscal position, curbing inflation, and creating the conditions for a resumption of economic growth. The external position has also improved, reflecting strong export growth, low imports, and capital repatriation. The 1995 program sought to build on these gains to achieve significant per capita income growth, bring inflation closer to the low single-digit pre-devaluation level consistent with the pets, and further strengthen the fiscal and external positions, while allowing for higher investment-related imports to support the recovery of output. Thanks to a firm policy stance, performance under the program through end-September 1995 has been encouraging. Inflation has continued to fall, and the target of 4-5 percent real GDP growth for the year should be within reach. Government revenue performance was strong and expenditure commitments, including the wage bill, were contained within the program limits. As a result, the narrowly defined fiscal balance ended in a surplus (equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP), compared with a programmed deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP. The stronger fiscal position, together with the adjustment assistance received, facilitated a reduction in payments arrears in excess of program targets and helped to keep bank claims on the Government well within the program limits. The authorities should make every effort to preserve these gains and to ensure that all the objectives and targets of the 1995 program as a whole are met. To this end, it is important that the momentum of government revenue collection be maintained and that tight control continues to be kept over outlays, while ensuring that appropriations for health and education are fully committed. The privatization committee must also be given the resources envisaged in the budget so as to allow for the sale of seven public enterprises before year-end, as originally intended. In the period ahead and to further consolidate progress made to date, special attention must be paid by the authorities to: 0 Assuming full ownership of the adjustment effort and strengthening the commitment to scale back the role of the Government in the productive sectors in favor of a larger responsibility for the private sector. l The need to continue strengthening fiscal performance, in 1996 and beyond, including avoiding a relaxation of the tax effort that has been realized in 1995. The authorities should be prepared to draw as needed on the-recommendations of the FAD technical assistance mission to ensure that the revenue/GDP ratio will reach at least 12.2 percent in 1996, and thus Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - allow for adequate provisions for the priority sectors while further reducing the fiscal deficit. A sustained revenue effort will also be critical to maintaining Burkina Faso's external debt servicing capability over the medium term. 0 The preparation of a civil service reform plan (on the basis of the recently completed census), to be used in 1996 and beyond to reinforce control over the wage bill, particularly with respect to recruitment and promotions. l The completion of the banking system restructuring through the accelerated liquidation of the BND-B, and the finalization of the privatization of the merged bank group BFCI/UREBA/CAI. The ongoing studies on the transformation of the postal checking system and the postal savings bank into institutions fully integrated into the financial system under the supervision of the Central Bank should also be expedited. l The provision of additional opportunities for private sector initiatives through the removal of monopolies on rice imports and on sugar imports and marketing (in consultation with the World Bank). l The maintenance of an exchange system that is free of restrictions on current payments and transfers, and a liberal administration of the limits applicable to travel allocations. l The undertaking of every effort within the common monetary cooperation framework for the acceptance, at an early date, of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. l A strengthening of the preparation and timely availability of the statistical data needed to monitor economic performance, drawing as needed on the recommendations of the recent STA multisector technical assistance mission. Priority should be placed on national income and balance of payments data. In view of Burkina Faso's encouraging performance under the 1995 program and the authorities' strong determination to stay the course and to make further progress in the period ahead, the staff recommends that the present midterm review under the third annual ESAF arrangement be concluded. The staff also is of the view that the authorities' request for further assistance after the current three-year arrangement--in support of their efforts to consolidate the gains achieved so far, and to deepen the structural reform program-- deserves favorable consideration. It is proposed that the next ‘4rticle IV consultation with Burkina Faso be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

On May 31, 1995, the International Monetary Fund approved the third annual arrangement for Burkina Faso under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), ,in support of its economic and financial adjustment program for 1995. In accordance with that arrangement, discussions for the midterm review were held with Fund staff. The focus was primarily on the progress made in implementing the program during the first nine months of 1995, and the prospects, as well as measures envisaged for the remainder of the year, to achieve the objectives set forth in the medium-term policy framework paper (PFP) and in the memorandum on economic and financial policies for 1995, both dated March 31, 1995. The Government of Burkina Faso is fully committed to the implementation of all the policies and measures described in this letter, which supplements the memorandum of March 31, 1995. 2. Owing to strong policy implementation during the first nine months of 1995, particularly in the area of fiscal policy, the authorities are poised to achieve the overall program objectives of increased economic growth, reducing the rate of inflation and strengthening the balance of payments. All quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks for end- September 1995 were met, with the results achieved so far in the fiscal area far exceeding program expectations for the period. 3. Inflation has slowed significantly in 1995. Between December 1994 and September 1995, consumer prices increased by 4 percent, compared with an increase of 29 percent for the corresponding period of 1994. On this basis, the 12-month target of 5 percent for 1995 as a whole appears well within reach. Real GDP growth of between 4-5 percent is projected for 1995, in line with the program, based on early indicators of agricultural output, namely a strong cotton harvest following the return of normal rainfall and favorable world market prices. There is also evidence of a continued rebound in private sector activity in 1995, notably import substitution activities. Reflecting increased confidence in the domestic economy, the return of flight capital combined with rising exports have contributed to a significant improvement in the external position, with net foreign assets of the banking system far exceeding the program expectation. Exports have continued to rebound in 1995, particularly cotton exports. At the same time, the recovery of imports in 1995 has been stronger than envisaged in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - APPENDIX II the program, albeit from a very low base in 1994; 1/ 1995 import growth is in line with the projected growth rate of GDP. Private transfers of workers' remittances, however, have not increased as expected, with the result that the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is now projected at 14 percent of GDP in 1995, a slight deterioration compared with the program target. Notwithstanding a small shortfall in external adjustment assistance projected for 1995 as a whole, the large build up in foreign reserves through end-September should contribute to a surplus in the overall balance of payments that exceeds the CFAF 25 billion targeted in the program. 4. With the implementation of tight fiscal policies, the narrowly defined fiscal balance u in the financial operations of Central Government for the first nine months of 1995 recorded a surplus of CFAF 2.3 billion (0.3 percent of GDP), a/ compared with a deficit of CFAF 12.3 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) targeted for the period. The improved fiscal outcome reflected primarily stronger revenue collection, which reached CFAF 104 bil- lion (11.8 percent of GDP) at end-September 1995, or 1.4 percent of GDP more than the program target for the period. With the exception of receipts from the marketing of petroleum products (CFAF 15.2 billion recovered instead of the program target of CFAF 15.8 billion), all categories of tax revenues exceeded program targets. The results achieved through end-September includes full recovery (0.4 percent of GDP) of revenue envisaged in the program from taxation of gains achieved during 1994 on (i) the margin between the notional and effective import cost of petroleum products marketed in 1994; (ii) profits from the cotton (SOFITEX) and gold (CBMP) export companies; and (iii) withholding on betting operations by the national lottery (LONAB) that had not been previously transferred to the Treasury. There was also a one-time improvement in corporate profit tax collection (about 0.3 percent of GDP higher-than-programmed) owing to windfall profits from revalued balance sheets following the devaluation. 5. However, improved tax and customs administration also played an important role in the stronger revenue performance, as reform measures introduced since 1993 took hold. During 1995 these measures included stricter control of exemptions, limitation of exemptions granted to public enterprises, automated processing of monthly assessment and collection of taxes owed by large enterprises, and computer-generated reminder notic'es automatically sent for late payments. At customs, supervision and discipline of customs officers has been further enhanced. Inspection of imports has also been strengthened through the reduction in the minimum lJ Import volume declined sharply in 1994, particularly capital goods imports, as a result of devaluation-induced delays in carrying out the public investment program. 2/ Unless otherwise indicated, this is measured throughout this document on a commitment basis, excluding grants, foreign-financed investment expenditures, and restructuring operations. 3J All percentages of GDP are calculated on an annual basis.

With the improved adminis- tration, the authorities were able to fully take advantage of the high level of economic activity and taxable trade during 1995. 6. Expenditures were contained within the program target during the nine- month period ended September 30, 1995. Importantly, the wage bill was kept within the program limit, mainly as a result of the decision not to grant any general salary increase for 1995. Outlays for the priority sectors of health and education were in line with the program objectives; and water, electricity, and telephone expenditures (excluding third quarter consumption not yet committed) had been kept within the program ceiling. Current transfers increased to about CFAF 22 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) compared with CFAF 20 billion targeted for the period, while expenditure commitments for the Privatization Committee remained slightly below targeted amount. Investment expenditure, which has focussed on the priority sectors of rehabilitation and maintenance of existing infrastructure and basic social services, was slightly lower than targeted, owing to slow implementation of foreign-financed projects. 7. Notwithstanding much larger-than-targeted repayments of arrears, the cash deficit was limited to CFAF 77 billion at end-September 1995 (8.7 per- cent of GDP), or some 1.5 percent of GDP less than programmed for the period. The Government repaid nearly CFAF 18 billion in arrears, of which CFAF 16.7 billion were repayments of domestic arrears and CFAF 1.4 billion were repayments of external interest arrears, as compared with CFAF 7.8 bil- lion and CFAF 0.5 billion, respectively, targeted in the program. The acceleration of arrears reduction was made possible by the stronger fiscal position, as well as disbursements of external adjustment assistance (excluding debt relief) that were consistent with program projections for end-September 1995. 8. The stronger fiscal position, combined with the disbursement of external adjustment assistance during the third quarter of 1995, allowed a reduction in both net bank claims on the Government, as well as net domestic assets of the Central Bank, to levels below the program ceilings for end- September 1995. L/ Credit to the economy was also lower than projected, partly reflecting weak credit demand. Broad money increased by 18.7 percent during the first nine months of 1995, allowing Burkina Faso to make a large contribution to the foreign reserve position of the regional Central Bank.

Important progress has been achieved in public enterprise and civil service reform. Tenders were issued before end-September 1995, as expected, for the sale of 7 enterprises, of which one enterprise (Societe des Huiles et Savons du Burkina --SHSB-CITEC) has already been sold and bids have been received for 4 other enterprises. Also, adequate budgetary resources were provided to the Privatization Committee to improve its effectiveness. Two - thirds of the CFAF 300 million allocated in the 1995 budget have already been committed; the remaining balance is to be committed before the end of the budgetary expenditure commitment period. With respect to civil service reform, the first phase of the reform, namely the completion of a census of the civil service, was carried out as planned. To prepare for the second phase, a preliminary draft study on the existing procedures for recruitment into the civil service 'has been prepared; the draft plan will be expanded to take more fully into account related budgetary constraints. As a major step to harmonize the personnel and payr,oll files, the authorities have also announced that as of end-November 1995, only those civil servants covered by the recent census will be included in the payroll. With these actions, all structural benchmarks f:or end-September 1995 have been observed. lJ 10. Accelerated efforts have been made since end-September 1995 to implement all structural reforms in the budgetary area, which are needed to strengthen budgetary procedures and efficiency and to sustain the improved fiscal performance. Since end-September, the authorities have completed: a) the draft 1996 budget on the basis of the new budget nomenclature; b) an exhaustive list of VAT and customs exemptions needed to prepare an audit of exemptions; c) an assessment of expenditures at each stage of payment, in order to avoid bottlenecks in payment procedures that could lead to ac,cumulation of arrears; and d) completion of the draft closed accounts for fiscal year 1993. Two other measures: (i) monthly reminder notices issued by the financial control directorate for late certification of delivery of goods and services; and (ii) monthly status of outstanding expenditures without prior commitment, by Ministry, have been prepared but they need to be updated on a regular basis. 11. . Progress with respect to other structural reforms, importantly in banking system restructuring, however, have continued to lag. Less than one third of the CFAF 1..2 billion allocated in the 1995 budget for banking system restructuring has been spent to date. While the liquidation of the National Development Bank (BND-B) is continuing, small depositors are slow in coming forward to collect their payments. In addition, I/ Although the 1995 program called for preparation of the draft closed accounts for 1994, the authorities began the exercise with the 1993 accounts, which has been completed, and the exercise to close the government accounts for 1994 has commenced.

As for the remainder of 1995, the strong fiscal performance through end-September should result in a fiscal outturn for the year as a whole substantially better than the program target. These prospects should allow the Government to commit budgetary expenditures amounting to CFAF 1.3 bil- lion (0.1 percent of GDP) that have been frozen pending the midterm review discussions. Notwithstanding such outlays, the fiscal deficit is projected to be equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP or less than one-half of the originally programmed deficit. The Government intends to enhance revenue collection efforts during the remainder of 1995, in order to secure the resources needed to fully achieve all of its fiscal objectives for 1995, which includes: limiting net recourse to bank financing; meeting the cost of public sector restructuring operations; repaying domestic arrears; and eliminating external payments arrears. Tax collection will be monitored closely during the final quarter, including through a reassignment of staff to the tax collection section so as to reduce the average number of taxpayers per collection agent. In addition, computerization of tax collection, as well as computer training for tax collectors, is proceeding at both customs and tax departments. At customs, internal controls for customs units will continue to be strengthened, while exemptions will be strictly limited, and additional resources will be provided to combat evasion. With these actions, total revenues could reach a level equivalent to 11.6 percent of GDP, or 0.9 percent of GDP higher than programmed. 13. After commitment of the previously frozen expenditures, govern- ment outlays (excluding restructuring operations and foreign-financed investments) should remain at about CFAF 143 billion (12 percent of GDP) as originally programmed. Wages should not exceed CFAF 61.7 billion. The ceiling on non-wage current expenditures should also be adhered to, taking into account the commitment of programmed expenditures on goods and services for the health and education sectors, and transfers for the purchase of generic drugs. Also included in the ceiling are outlays on utility consumption for the second half of the year, which will be committed prior to the end of the budgetary expenditure commitment period. Expenditure savings will be made on external interest payments, reflecting exchange rate developments in the currencies of Burkina Faso's creditors; these savings will offset higher current transfers, mainly the outlays of previously frozen expenditures. In order to ensure that the outlays remaining in 1995 are made without exceeding the ceiling for total expenditures, the Government will continue to subject all expenditure commitments to existing budgetary procedures. 1./k. As in the first nine months of the year, monetary policy will continue to be prudent. Broad money growth is projected at 19 percent for 1995.

Credit to the private sector, which has stagnated since the first quarter of 1995, is expected to pick up somewhat by year-end. The Govern- ment will take the measures required to liquidate the BND-B by February 1996, as initially envisaged, and will make a final decision on the privatization of the UREBA/BFCI/CAI bank group before end-December 1995. With regard to other reforms of the banking system, the study of the postal checking system (CCP) and the postal savings bank (CNE) will be completed by end-December 1995. 15. The structural reforms envisaged for the remainder of the program period will be vigorously pursued. In the area of public enterprise privatization, the full disbursement of budget allocations to the Privatization Committee during 1995 should allow tenders to be issued for evaluation of an additional 11 enterprises before end-1995; bids for their sale should follow in 1996. With respect to public enterprise restruc- turing, a reorganization plan for Air Burkina that is acceptable to the World Bank is currently under discussion and is expected to be agreed shortly. 1/ In order to further develop the private sector and promote competition and efficiency, the Government will abolish the protection tax (TDP) b'y end-1995, as programmed, and, beginning in 1996, the private sector will be allowed to engage in importing rice on the basis of procedures to be worked out in consultation with the World Bank. As regards the marketing of sugar, plans are under way to allow the private sector to import 10,000 tons of sugar beginning July 1996 to supplement local production by SOSUCO. 16. In the external sector, the authorities will continue to seek debt rescheduling with non-Paris Club creditors on terms at least comparable with those provided by Paris Club creditors in the 1993 rescheduling agreement. Negotiations with the Libyan Government to reschedule CFAF 3 billion in arrears are expected to commence soon. The Government hopes to complete negotiations with the Russian authorities to reschedule CFAF 3 billion in arrears shortly. The authorities are also anxious to initiate negotiations to reschedule debt service with the remaining non-Paris Club creditors, namely China and Kuwait, without delay. The shortfall in disbursement of World Bank adjustment assistance during the period through end-September w.as largely offset by higher disbursement by the European Union. The Government expects that the restructuring plan that has been prepared for Air Burkina will meet with the Bank's approval and lead to the disbursement of the sector adjustment loan in the near future. In addition, the authorities are determined to intensify their efforts to ensure that external adjustment assistance already committed by donors is fyully disbursed before year-end. The Government will pursue a cautious external debt policy, including a careful monitoring of external debt service so as to keep it at a level not 1;/ Completion of the reorganization plan will facilitate disbursement of the second tranche of the World Bank's transport sector adjustment loan.

Policies for 1996. The authorities intend to intensify their efforts in 1996 to further improve public finances, continue to strengthen govern- ment savings, mainly through revenue enhancement measures, accelerate the pace of structural reform and make adequate provisions for the requirements of the social sectors and for utilities consumption. To strengthen the fiscal adjustment, a number of new tax measures have already been proposed in the draft 1996 budget, including: (a) a change in the method of calculating the VAT, using as the base the c.i.f. value plus all relevant duties and taxes; (b) extension of the base for taxes on wages and salaries to include all benefits; (c) expanding the taxation of beverages to include non-alcoholic beverages; and (d) raising the tax rate on locally produced tobacco products to 13 percent and to 95 percent for imported items, from 10 and 80 percent, respectively. The authorities intend to raise the tax effort to about 12.2 percent of GDP in 1996, an increase of about l/2 per- centage points of GDP over the 1995 projected outcome. Concurrently, domestic expenditures in 1996 will be contained at about 12.2 percent of GDP, thereby achieving fiscal balance, compared with a deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP initially envisaged for 1996. 18. The management of government finances will also continue to be improved during 1996. The draft 1996 budget has been produced on the basis of a new budgetary nomenclature, which should allow for more efficient monitoring of expenditures by functional classification. In addition, the harmonization of personnel and payroll files should facilitate improved control of the wage bill. Finally, a committee will be set up by end-1995 to reconcile, on a monthly basis, public finance statistics from various institutional sources. 19. Within the framework of the WAEMU, the Government will continue to work toward achieving the harmonization of tax and customs duties and reducing duties levied on goods from other member countries. Within the WAMU, it will work toward acceptance at an early date of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections (2), (3), and (4) of the Articles of Agreement. 20. Finally, the Government will intensify its efforts to improve its macroeconomic statistics. These efforts include: (i) provision of adequate budgetary allocations in 1996 to produce the new consumer price index (CPI) planned at the regional level on a regular and timely basis, as well as to collect and process balance of payments data; (ii) preparation of a producer price index; (iii) creation of a statistical council by December 31, 1995; (iv) regular dissemination of customs statistics to potential users; and (v) preparation of a medium-term program to create a new framework for national income accounts statistics. In this endeavor, the authorities will draw on the recommendations of a recent multisector technical assistance mission from the IMF.

The Government is committed to implementing all the macroeconomic and structural measures needed to achieve the program's objectives, and will take all measures deemed necessary to ensure that the third annual program continues to be properly implemented for the remainder of the program period. The quantitative and structural benchmarks for end-December 1995, and end-March 1996 are shown in Tables I. and 2, respectively. 22. The Government of Burkina Faso believes that the reforms and measures set forth in this memorandum, which supplements the memorandum of March 31, 1995, are adequate to achieve the objectives of the 1995 program. For the period through March 31, 1996, the Government of Burkina Faso will consult with the Managing Director of the Fund either at its initiative or whenever the Managing Director requests such consultations. Moreover, after the period of the third annual arrangement, and while Burkina Faso has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund arising from loans made under that arrangement; the Government will consult with the Fund from time to time, at the initiative of Burkina Faso or whenever the Managing Director requests consultation, on Burkina Faso's economic and financial policies. The Government will provide the International Monetary Fund with such information as it may request on progress made by Burkina Faso in implementing the economic and financial policies and in achieving the objectives of the program.

Article IV Consultations Burkina Faso is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The 1994 Article IV discussions were held during the period July 25-August 8, 1994 in Ouagadougou, in conjunction with the negotiations of the midterm review under the second annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility. The staff report (EBS/94/189) and the background paper on recent economic developments (SM/94/260) were considered by the Executive Board on October 17, 1994. The decision adopted was as follows: 1. Burkina Faso has consulted with the Fund in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of the second annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) for Burkina Faso (EBS/94/43, sup. 1, 3/14/94). 2. The letter of the Minister of Economy, Finance and Planning of Burkina Faso dated August 15, 1994, together with the memorandum attached thereto, shall be attached to the second annual arrangement under the ESAF for Burkina Faso, and the letter dated February 28, 1994 shall be read as supplemented and modified by the letter of August 15, 1994. 3. Accordingly, the indicators referred to in paragraph 2(a) of the second annual arrangement shall include the benchmarks for December 31, 1994 set out in paragraph 21 of the memorandum annexed to the letter dated August 15, 19'94. 4. The Fund determines that the midterm review specified in para- graph 2(c) of the second annual arrangement under the ESAF for Burkina Faso has been completed, and that notwithstanding the nonobservance of the quantitative performance criteria referred to in subparagraphs 2(a)(ii) and 2(a)(iii) of the second annual arrangement for end-June 1994, Burkina Faso may proceed to request the disbursement of the second loan under the arrangement.

Introduction An assessment has been made of Burkina Faso's debt service capacity in the context of 20-year projections for the balance of payments. L/ On the basis of scheduled debt service in line with rescheduling arrangements already agreed with Paris Club creditors, Burkina Faso's debt service appears sustainable, although continued exceptional financing would be needed throughout the period. A stock-of-debt operation on Naples terms b:y Paris Club creditors, together with comparable action by other bilateral creditors, would serve to improve Burkina Faso's prospects for external viability over the projection period, while at the same time minimizing the debt service burden on government resources. 2. External debt. and debt service burden The stock of Burkina Faso's external debt at end-1994 stood at CFAF 760 billion (USS1.4 billion), or about 500 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services. The bulk of this debt (75 percent of the total) was owed to multilateral creditors; 2/ with more than 50 percent of outstanding multilateral debt owed to the World Bank, 22 percent owed to the African Development Fund, and 3 percent owed to the IMF (Appendix V, Table 1). The remaining debt (CFAF 194 billion) was owed to official bilateral creditors, 20 percent of which was rescheduled by Paris Club creditors in 1991 (on Toronto terms) and in 1993 (on London terms); u 40 percent of bilateral debt was pre-cutoff-date debt and has not been previously rescheduled; 4J 40 percent of bilateral debt was owed to non- Paris Club creditors. The total debt stock at end-1994 was equivalent to 74 percent of GDP. In 1994, scheduled external debt service was equivalent to about 22 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services and 29 percent of government revenue. 1/ The assumptions and analysis of Burkina Faso's debt sustainability have been reviewed by the World Bank staff who agree with the assessment. 2/ Throughout the text, references to multilateral organizations include the IMF. 3J These rescheduling operations involved rescheduling of debt service obligations and outstanding arrears of pre-cutoff debt on Toronto terms (1991) and London terms (1993). 4J Due to data limitations, there is some uncertainty regarding the creditors involved, but for the purpose of this analysis, they were presumed to be official creditors.

Medium-term balance of pavments APPENDIX V A long-term balance of payments scenario was developed with forecasts through 2015. Caution is required in evaluating the balance of payments, given the poor quality of the data in Burkina Faso. With official data available only through 1991, projections for subsequent years are tentative and subject to revision. The macroeconomic framework for the baseline scenario assumes that export volume grows at an annual average rate of less than 4 percent during 1996-2015 (Appendix V, Table 2). Within this period, export volume is assumed to grow by about 6 percent annually through 1998, with the growth rate declining to about 4 percent during the period 1999-2005, before leveling off at 3 percent throughout the remainder of the period. The growth in exports is driven by the continued strength in cotton exports through 1998, when Burkina Faso's cotton ginneries are expected to reach full capacity; thereafter cotton exports should grow at a slower pace. In addition, export growth will also be driven by: (1) gold exports, which are expected to remain strong in light of renewed interest by foreign firms; (2) leather exports, which are expected to include more items with higher value added; and (3) other nontraditional exports, which are expected to reach 4.5 percent growth in volume terms in 1998, and remain constant thereafter. Import volume is assumed to increase by about 4 percent per annum during 1996-2000, slightly below projected real GDP growth in the period; import volume growth falls slightly to about 3 percent per annum through 2005. Nominal GDP is assumed to grow by 9 percent per annum (which is higher than projected population growth), or about 6 percent per annum in real terms during 1996-2015. Government revenue is projected to increase by 0.6 percentage points of GDP per annum through 2005 in line with the authorities' objective of achieving a tax effort equivalent to 18 percent of GDP by 2005. 4. Baseline scenario In this baseline scenario, the current account (excluding official transfers) remains in deficit through 2005, but improves from 14 percent of GDP in 1995 to close to 5 percent in 2005 (Appendix V, Table 3). The overall balance turns into a deficit in 1996 and thereafter; the overall deficit worsens in 1998 as large amortization payments fall due on external debt offsetting the improvement in the current account balance in the period. Under this scenario, the overall balance of payments deficit rises from CFAF 11 billion in 1996 to CFAF 25 billion in 2000 before declining to CFAF 19 billion in 2005. The financing of these deficits could be met in part by a drawdown of foreign reserves, or through additional donor Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX V support. l-J Alternatively, the financing requirement could be partially met by debt relief generated through a stock-of-debt operation as discussed below. Debt service on new borrowing is based on a continued inflow of program and project loans through 2015. Recourse to foreign borrowing is assumed to fall off slightly from its 1995 level, to about CFAF 10 billion and CFAF 51 billion for program and project loans, respectively, by 1998; project loans will remain at about these levels through 2005 while program loans are assumed to fall to zero by 1999. After 2005, budgetary recourse to foreign borrowing is assumed to decline sharply, allowing for lower debt service on new borrowing. Under the above assumptions, Burkina Faso's ability to service its external debt over the 20-year horizon appears encouraging. Total scheduled debt service, as a percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services, remains at 22 percent in 1995, but then declines to about 19 percent in 1996, to less than 17 percent in 2004, and to less than 10 percent by 2015 (Appendix V, Tables 4 and 5). 2J During the forecast period, debt service to multilateral creditors averages 56 percent of total debt service during 1995-2000; declining slightly to 51 percent by 2005, but then rises to about 90 percent by 2010, owing to the fact that payments to multilateral creditors, particularly IDA repayments, fall more heavily in the latter part of the projection period. 3J Burkina Faso's debt servicing obligations also appear sustainable relative to projected fiscal performance over the medium and long term. Total scheduled debt service, as a percent of government revenue (before grants), falls from 27 percent in 1995 to below 14 percent in 2005, declining at a slightly slower pace in the latter half of the projection period in line with projected slower assumed growth in government revenues after 2005. Similarly, the ratio of multilateral debt service obligations to government revenue is 14 percent in 1995 and 4 percent by 2015. Burkina Faso receives a large amount of foreign grants (more than 10 percent of GDP in 1995); if foreign grants are taken into account, the burden of Burkina Faso's external debt obligations over the medium term lightens significantly. During the period through 2000, foreign grant receipts are projected at an annual average of 165 percent of scheduled debt service, a reduction from an average ratio of 280 percent over the past 10 years. 4J lJ The terms of new borrowing for both program and project loans assumes interest rates of 0.8 percent and 2 percent, respectively, A grace period of 10 years, and 30-year maturity is assumed on new borrowing. 2J The baseline scenario incorporates the terms of the Paris Club rescheduling agreements on obligations to respective bilateral creditors. 3J Including debt service on new borrowing after 1995 which is assumed to come from multilateral creditors. &/ Foreign grants, excluding exceptional financing.

Stock-of-debt operation An alternative scenario (Scenario A) was developed, involving a stylized stock-of-debt reduction operation in 1996, as provided for by the 1993 Paris Club Agreement, and in support of a possible successor ESAF arrangement. IJ Under this scenario, it is assumed that debt to Paris Club creditors previously rescheduled on Toronto terms (Paris Club I) would be reduced by 50 percent, debt previously rescheduled on London terms (Paris Club II) would be reduced by 33 percent, while other bilateral creditors would reduce the outstanding stock of debt owed to them by 67 percent (for not previously rescheduled debt) and by 50 percent for previously rescheduled debt (Appendix V, Table 6). It is further assumed that the interest rate on future debt service obligations will be no less favorable than that obtained in the previous rescheduling exercises (3 percent on average). On the basis of such debt relief, total debt service as a percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services would be reduced to below 13 percent in 2005 and to just 10 percent in 2015 (Appendix V, Table 7). As a percent of government revenue, total external debt service would decline to about 10 percent by 2005 and to 8 percent by 2015. 2J The lower debt service, in turn, would reduce the overall balance of payments by about one- half (Appendix V, Table 8). The financing of the overall balance of payments during 1996-2000 would be reduced to CFAF 51 billion, compared with CFAF 102 billion before the stock of debt operation; during 2001-2005 the financing requirement is reduced to CFAF 59 billion compared with CFAF 110 billion before rescheduling. 6. Sensitivity analvsis The medium-term outlook is sensitive to the assumptions made about key external variables, including export volume growth and the concessionality of new external financing. An attempt has been made to evaluate the effect on Burkina Faso's debt servicing capacity of possible changes in these key assumptions. A scenario (Scenario B) was developed based on poorer performance in the cotton sector, Burkina Faso's predominant export. During the period 1997-2005, the volume of cotton exports was assumed to be 20 percent lower than the baseline scenario; thereafter through 2005, the growth in overall exports of goods and nonfactor services is assumed to be 5 percent per annum, compared with 6 percent per annum in the baseline scenario. In this scenario, the improvement in the current account deficit is slightly L/ This operation is assumed to be implemented through the debt reduction option. 2/ The greatest impact on lowering debt service obligations derives from the stock-of-debt reduction of non-Paris Club creditors and other bilateral debt presumed to be owed to official creditors which was not previously rescheduled (which at end-1994 represented 20 percent of outstanding debt stock); debt stock owed to Paris Club creditors represented only 5 percent of total outstanding debt at end-1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDIXU delayed; the current account deficit would be 5.5 percent of GDP in 2005, compared with the 5.2 percent of GDP in the baseline scenario. Likewise, the overall deficit by 2005 would slightly exceed 1 percent of GDP under the alternative scenario, compared with the baseline scenario where the overall deficit is equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP. Under this scenario, total debt service as a percent of goods and nonfactor services is only slightly higher throughout the period. A further scenario (Scenario C) was developed assuming that new borrowing after 1995 was on nonconcessional terms. IJ Total debt service in this case would be higher by CFAF 272 billion in 2001-2005, after the assumed grace period is over. The higher debt service, in turn, would worsen the debt service burden as a percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services to 24 percent in 2000, and further to 36 percent in 2001-2002, before declining to below 18 percent in 2015.

Real sector While the general framework of the national accounts is rather complete, there are substantial problems with the source data for the national accounts at current prices, and the price statistics used as deflators. In addition, the national accounts suffer from methodological problems, particularly valuation of changes in inventories. To overcome these problems, additional resources need to be provided, and a reallocation of staff within the statistical system, especially the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD), needs to take place. In addition, the July 1995 multisector mission recommended a medium-term program to set up a new basis for the national accounts, to be consistent with the 1993 SNA. The CPI is based on outdated weights and suffers from various methodological problems. Burkina Faso is participating in a regional project financed by the European Union and France to improve the CPI. A new index should be ready for publication by July 1996. No producer price index (PPI) exists. However, a two-year project to develop an industrial production index (IPC) has recently been approved by the European Union, and could possibly be extended to include the development of a PPI. b. Government finance After a four-year hiatus, Burkina Faso has recently resumed reporting GFS data for publication in GFSY. However, the reported data, which are compiled from the Balance G&k-ale des Comptes du Trksor (BGCT) and cover the period 1988-93, still suffer from lack of coordination among source fiscal agencies impacting both the reliability and timeliness of these data. The multisector statistical mission that visited Ouagadougou in July 1995 recommended that a working group be established comprising all concerned parties and headed by the Treasury with the objective to develop a workable and efficient system of deriving public finance statistics. The authorities plan to establish a committee to coordinate public finance statistics by end-1995. C. Monetary accounts The 1995 multisector mission recommended a better sectorization of public institutions in the monetary accounts, which would facilitate a reconciliation of credit data to the public sector with the corresponding financing data of the fiscal accounts. The mission also suggested the inclusion of other banking institutions in the compilation of monetary statistics in order to prepare a banking survey and made recommendations for improvements in the application of the residency criterion to money market transactions.

For WAEMU countries, the main statistical issue in the field of monetary statistics arises from banks that are in a process of liquidation and whose assets and liabilities should be properly reclassified in the monetary statistics tables. Monetary statistics include assets and liabilities of banks that have long ceased banking operations but whose liquidation has never been completed. Another statistical issue arose in the wake of the devaluation of the CFA franc on January 12, 1994, related to the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. d. Balance of oavments Data continue to be compiled with long delays and are not always reliable, owing mainly to the lack of resources devoted to balance of payments tasks by the BCEAO and the failure to implement a reform in compilation procedures introduced by the BCEAO in 1982. Also, significant discrepancies may appear between provisional estimates and final figures, which are published with a delay of about three years. In addition, the identification of exceptional financing transactions is a rough approxima- tion (insufficiently detailed and sometimes without a breakdown between interest and capital).
