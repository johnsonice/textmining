This largely reflects failure to achieve macroeconomic stability and large losses incurred by the state enterprises, notably the state-owned mining company. 0 The privatization of the mines in 2000 has acted as a catalyst to improve substantially Zambia’s overall economic performance. Real GDP grew by 3.6 percent and 4.9 percent respectively in 2000 and 200 1, and inflation declined from 30.1 percent to 18.7 percent. l In 2002, Zambia’s economic prospects have been adversely affected by the withdrawal of Anglo-American, declining world copper prices, and a severe drought which have lowered economic growth and increased inflationary pressure. l Despite these difficulties, Zambia met all the quantitative and structural performance criteria for end-June, 2002 and all but one of the benchmarks. However, there is strong concern about the composition of expenditure as overruns in the wage bill reflecting mainly wage awards to defense forces were offset by cuts in other expenditure, including social sector outlays. Medium-term outlook and overview of key issues 0 The government’s medium-term macroeconomic strategy for 2002-04, as articulated in the PRSP, targets real GDP growth of about 4 percent annually, a reduction in the rate of inflation to single digits by 2004, and a buildup of gross official foreign reserves to about 2.3 months of import cover. 0 Despite recent improvements, Zambia remains vulnerable to external shocks, such as lower copper prices and reduced external assistance. The authorities are committed to undertake required policies and adjustments to achieve higher growth and macroeconomic stability. l Structural reforms and governance measures are geared towards improving economic efficiency and accountability of public finances as well as enhancing credibility of government policies. Key measures include further privatization, financial sector reform, and improving public expenditure management.

Although there is concern about the composition of expenditure, the overall fiscal outturn for 2002 is expected to be on track based on the corrective measures undertaken by the authorities. 0 To strengthen macroeconomic stability and achieve the fiscal objectives, the government is also committed to undertake necessary fiscal adjustments in 2003, including limiting the wage bill to 8 percent of GDP, increasing revenue efforts, and scaling down nonessential expenditure while making efforts to mobilize additional external assistance. Given the shortfalls in spending on social programs in 2002, the government is committed to protecting HIPC spending in 2003. Issues raised in the staff appraisal l There is strong concern about the composition of expenditure in 2002, even though the overall fiscal stance remains appropriate. Staff stressed that effective control of public expenditure, including the wage bill is critical to achieve program’s fiscal policy objectives. l Zambia’s economic situation remains difficult and there remain significant risks to the program and macroeconomic stability, including slippages in fiscal policy and deterioration of the external environment, most notably in world copper prices and in the level of donor assistance. 0 The authorities have demonstrated their commitment to the policy framework supported by the PRGF to address the risks and their performance so far justifies continued Fund support, including the provision of interim HIPC assistance from the Fund for 2003.

Discussions with the Zambian authorities on the 2002 Article IV consultation and the fifth review of the PRGF-supported program were initiated in Lusaka during July 8-20, 2002 and concluded in Washington, D.C. during September 23-October 3.’ The Zambian representatives included Mr. Kasonde, Minister in charge of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP); Dr. Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ); Mr. Diangamo, Secretary to the Treasury; and other senior officials. The mission met with President Mwanawasa and with members of parliament, representatives of the private sector and civil society, and members of the diplomatic and donor community. The mission also visited the Copperbelt and met with executives of the major mining companies. The mission’s work was closely coordinated with the World Bank staff. 2. In the attached letter of intent (LOI) to the Managing Director (Appendix I), the Minister of Finance reviews performance under the 2002 program, describes the objectives and policies for the remainder of the year, and outlines the government’s policy framework for 2003. The Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) is provided in Appendix II. The economic program is broadly on track, and the quantitative and structural performance criteria for end-June were all observed. Most benchmarks were also observed. Access under the PRGF program is equivalent to SDR 278.9 million (57 percent of quota), of which SDR 154.7 million has been disbursed. Upon completion of the fifth review, Zambia would be eligible to draw SDR 41.4 million related to the end-June 2002 performance (Table 1). The government is also requesting the last tranche of SDR 117.2 million of interim debt relief under the HIPC Initiative from the Fund for 2003 (Table 2). 3. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on November 7,200l. At that time, Directors noted the improvement in economic performance, but stressed that the economic situation remained fragile. They emphasized the importance of strengthening the fiscal and monetary policy stance and mobilizing financial assistance from the international community. They underlined the importance of deepening structural reforms, and improving governance, strengthening public expenditure management and HIPC expenditure tracking, and pursuing a coherent strategy to reduce poverty in the context of a full PRSP. In approving the PRGF- supported program for 2002 on May 29,2002, Directors commended Zambia’s continued progress, notwithstanding fiscal slippages in the fourth quarter of 200 1. They expressed concern about economic prospects following the announcement by Anglo-American plc (AA) ’ The mission teams comprised Mr. Sharer (head), Mr. Thugge, Mr. Hossain, Mr. Poddar-EP (all AFR), Messrs. Monroe and Staines (PDR), Messrs. Mathai and Fassina (FAD), and Mr. Ellyne, (Resident Representative). Mr. Sharer and Mr. Ellyne attended the Consultative Group (CG) meeting in Livingstone during July 7-l 1. In July, a joint World Bank-IMF mission also visited Lusaka to complete the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) that had been initiated in May 2002.

Directors strongly endorsed the authorities’ commitment not to take over ownership of the mines and to find a viable solution consistent with sound government finances. They stressed the critical importance of adhering to the 2002 budget targets and maintaining an appropriately tight monetary policy stance in order to sustain the gains in macroeconomic stability and growth. Directors urged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms, invest in productive infrastructure and human capital, and improve transparency and governance. 4. Zambia’s core economic database is largely adequate for program monitoring, although the quality and timeliness of key monetary and fiscal data need to be improved. Zambia’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are summarized in Appendices III and IV, respectively. Statistical Issues are described in Appendix V, and social and demographic indicators are provided in Appendix VI. 5. Zambia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. Zambia maintains an exchange restriction arising from the external payment arrears accumulated prior to October 1985, and a multiple currency practice arising from the spreads between the dealing window and interbank rates (Appendix III), which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 (EBD/02/76). II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM 6. Zambia’s economic record over the past two decades has been poor, characterized by persistent high inflation, averaging over 50 percent per annum, and low growth, leading to a steady decline in per capita income and growing poverty. Social indicators have deteriorated and are below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Inconsistent policy implementation, macroeconomic instability, the persistent drain on the economy from the weak management of state enterprise, particularly the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), and a pronounced weakening of the terms of trade have been at the heart of the deterioration. Moreover, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to exert a heavy economic burden. 7. In 1999 the government sought to reverse these trends by sharply improving macroeconomic management, and enhancing the role of the private sector. Critical to this was the privatization of ZCCM. GDP growth of 4-5 percent per annum was targeted for the following three years, with inflation declining steadily to single digits. In the event the economic program was quickly derailed, mainly on account of ongoing delays in concluding the privatization of ZCCM, together with continued weakness of public expenditure control and fiscal management. 8. In March 2000, ZCCM was finally privatized, leaving the government with substantial financial obligations. This acted as a catalyst to enhanced efforts to reverse Zambia’s economic decline. In June 2000 the government adopted a program aimed at achieving economic stabilization and reviving medium-term growth through substantially Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- improved fiscal and monetary management and accelerated structural reforms aimed at privatization, addressing weakness in the financial sector, particularly the deteriorating finances of the Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB), improving public expenditure management and enhancing transparency and governance. The government also pursued discussions with stakeholders to draw up a full PRSP and a strategy to reduce poverty. 9. Zambia’s overall economic performance has strengthened since mid-2000. This reflects sharply improved fiscal and monetary policies, and progress with structural reforms, albeit with persistent weakness in public expenditure management. The staff believes that the authorities have been responsive to policy advice and have made strong efforts to implement the program. Real GDP grew by 3.6 percent in 2000 and 4.9 percent in 200 1, reversing the declining trend in per capita income. Inflation declined to 18.7 percent by end- 2001, the lowest level in twenty years. 10. Despite the gains of the past two years, Zambia is facing very difficult economic circumstances. AA’s announced withdrawal has raised major uncertainties and weakened business confidence. The withdrawal was finalized through an agreement with AA (as discussed below) that would allow Konkola Copper Mines @CM) to remain open (LOI, para. 6).2 The difficulties of the copper sector have been compounded in recent months by further declines in world copper prices, which are now only slightly more than half of the level in 1980, albeit a peak year, and less than 30 percent in real terms (Figure 1). 11. Zambia was also affected by a severe drought during the first half of 2002, resulting in a shortfall of some 600,000 tons of maize. Humanitarian assistance through the World Food Program (WFP), to be distributed free to the most seriously affected Zambians, together with private sector imports, is expected to cover most of the shortfall, with the remainder covered by government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (LOI, para. 9). However, humanitarian assistance may be lower as a consequence of the government’s health concerns and subsequent ban on imports of genetically modified (GM) maize. 12. Reflecting mainly the impact of the drought on agricultural output, projected GDP growth for 2002 has been lowered from 4.3 percent to 3.7 percent. Similarly, higher-than- expected food prices increased the 12-month inflation rate to 23.9 percent in September, compared with 15 percent projected earlier. However, nonfood inflation was 16.1 percent. During January-September 2002, the kwacha depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 19 percent in nominal terms, and about 7 percent in real terms, reflecting the expected impac of the food crisis on imports, as well as the decline in world copper prices. :t 2 The World Bank has provided substantial technical support to the government in addressing the withdrawal of AA and restructuring KCM to maintain its commercial viability.

However, there were significant overruns in the wage bill, mainly on account of increases given to the defense and security forces shortly before the end-2001 elections. These wage increases were partially offset by lower-than-anticipated domestic interest costs. In addition, HIPC-financed expenditures were lower-than-expected owing to capacity constraints in line ministries, as well as delays arising from an intensification of the monitoring process for PRSP implementation.3 14. Broad money rose by about 13 percent during January-June 2002, compared with the program target of 5 percent, largely reflecting the impact of the kwacha depreciation on foreign currency deposits (LOI, para. 4): However, the expansion of commercial bank credit to the private sector was lower than projected, as bank lending rates remained high despite a decline in the yield on treasury bills from nearly 50 percent at end- December 2001 to around 30 percent at end-June 2002.5 This decline reflected a lagged adjustment to a reduction in inflation in 2001, and to a change in the reserve requirement rule to allow banks to hold cash reserve requirements for foreign currency deposits in foreign currency, rather than in kwacha. 15. External sector developments were somewhat more favorable than programmed, due to robust growth in copper production. Meanwhile, imports fell by more than expected, owing to lower-than-projected activity in the nonmetal sector and the postponement of investments by some mines. As a result, there was an accumulation of gross official reserves of US$65 million during the first half of the year that was slightly above the program target. 16. In sum, Zambia met all the quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for end-June, except for the benchmark on the reduction of domestic arrears. The end-May and end-September 2002 structural performance criteria were also observed. Preliminary data indicate a buildup of domestic arrears estimated at K 40 billion during the first half of 2002, reflecting mainly interest and penalty charges on the substantial outstanding arrears stock. As noted in the LO1 (paragraph l), the government is finalizing a comprehensive database of domestic arrears. 3 The institutional framework for implementing the PRSP involves the MoFNP, which is responsible for overall coordination; the eight technical committees created during the preparation of the PRSP; and a HIPC monitoring committee. 4 Excluding the impact of kwacha depreciation on dollar denominated deposits held by commercial banks, the increase in broad money was only 6 percent. 5 The volatility of treasury bill rates in recent years reflects inconsistent application of financial policies and uncertainty in the general economic environment.

Following the issuance of an international advertisement for the sale of 5 1 percent share of the ZNCB in May (a performance criterion), the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) Board appointed a team with authority to negotiate a contract for sale with short-listed potential buyers. The end-May benchmark for publishing an annual report on the use and tracking of HIPC Initiative resources was observed with some delay, as was the benchmark on preparation of budget reports for the Secretary to the Treasury and for publication. The work of the task force on streamlining the BoZ mechanisms for financing government operations is on track. In September, the government decided on a strategy for implementing a revised system to facilitate more effective conduct of monetary policy (a structural performance criterion). The Accountant General submitted the 2001 government accounts to the Auditor General (a structural benchmark). Progress has also been made in implementing the envisaged measures to improve public expenditure management. 18. Political developments in Zambia are encouraging, with strong public support for President’s Mwanawasa’s vigorous anticorruption drive,6 which has also strengthened Zambia’s relations with the donor community. On July 11, the President addressed an extraordinary session of parliament, in which he revealed apparent corrupt practices and abuses of public office by former President Chiluba and senior officials of the Chiluba administration. Parliament subsequently voted to lift the former President’s constitutional immunity. A large number of senior public officials have now been charged with corruption or have left office pending investigation. These include the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Chief Justice, the Ambassador to the United States, several senior officials of the defense and security forces, heads of several major state enterprises, and other senior government officials. These developments, however, have distracted senior officials from day-to-day economic management; many of the key officials in the Ministry of Finance are new and inexperienced. III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS A. Medium-Term Outlook and Overview of Key Issues 19. Zambia’s key medium-term economic objectives are: increasing significantly the rate of economic growth; reducing inflation to single digits; achieving fiscal sustainability while reorienting expenditures toward poverty reduction; improving external sustainability; raising the efficiency of the financial sector to promote investment and productive activity; and improving governance, with a view to enhancing the credibility of government policy. 6 Mr. Mwanawasa’s election was contested by the rival candidate in court on grounds of voting irregularities. The High Court is expected to give its ruling soon.

The new government’s medium-term macroeconomic strategy, as articulated in the PRSP, has been developed against the backdrop of a very difficult economic environment, namely the difficulties in the copper sector, the drought, and the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on labor productivity, savings, and investment (Box 1). The framework for 2002-04 targets real GDP growth of about 4 percent annually, lowering inflation to 5 percent, and increasing gross official foreign reserves to about 2.3 months of import cover. (Table 3). Investment should rise modestly to about 19 percent of GDP over the medium term, driven by an increase in private investment that is financed largely by domestic public savings, consistent with reducing the domestic public deficit. 21. The growth projection is based largely on prospects for the mining and agricultural sectors. Mining output is expected to grow by about 14 percent per annum during 2002-03, and to taper off thereafter.7 After a decline of about 4 percent in 2002, agricultural output is expected to grow by 4-5 percent per annum, following a recovery from the drought and planned improvements in infrastructure and the supply of inputs. Other sectors are projected to grow by about 3-4 percent during 2002-04. The staff believes that the authorities’ growth targets are attainable, albeit vulnerable to further external shocks. The staff and the authorities agreed that sustained macroeconomic stability and an improved business environment would substantially strengthen growth prospects. The staff further stressed that consistent implementation of policies, particularly improved public sector resource management, would enhance the efficiency of project implementation, increase donor support, and generally reinforce growth prospects. 22. Zambia’s competitiveness, as measured by the real effective exchange rate (REER), has remained broadly unchanged since the mid- 1990s despite a deterioration in the terms of trade and large external current account deficits (Figure 4). The authorities have made efforts to restructure the economy, and the implementation of structural reforms has helped to increase economic efficiency. Reforms in the copper sector, particularly the privatization of ZCCM, and the current efforts to increase productivity have resulted in a substantial increase in copper production, and additional mines could be developed in the near future. Nonmetal export volumes have also continued to rise, supported by the recovery in export prices since 200 1, and are expected to be in line with the program in 2002. The 7 The growth projection is based on information on investment, production and exports provided by senior executives of the KCM and Mopani Copper Mines, which together account for about 94 percent of the total copper production.

HIV/AIDS in Zambia] Prevalence of AIDS Zambia is among the African countries hit hardest by the HIV virus, with an infection rate of about 20 percent of its adult population. Life expectancy at birth declined from 50 years in 1990 to 37 years in 2000. The disease currently imparts a tremendous strain on all social and economic institutions in Zambian society. Seventy-five percent of Zambian households are caring for at least one orphan. In Lusaka, 60-80 percent of all hospital admissions are AIDS related. Economic impact of AIDS The major channels through which AIDS affects the economy are as follows: . Labor supply. Growth in the labor force is likely to slow at least as much as population growth. There will be a loss of skilled labor, which is a particularly serious concern, given chronic skills shortages. . Productivity. AIDS-related health problems will cause productivity to suffer, owing to increased sick leave, reduced work intensity, and increased labor turnover, and as individuals take time away to care for sick relatives and attend funerals. . Saving and investment. With increased expenditure on AIDS-related care, both consumption and saving will be reduced. Hence, capital accumulation will also be reduced. The overall projected decline in potential economic growth due to AIDS is approximately 1.5 percentage points per annum over the period 2002-10. Measures to combat AIDS The current framework for combating the pandemic is being coordinated by the National HIV/AIDS Council and follows a multisectoral approach. Interventions as outlined under the PRSP are divided into two levels. The First-Level Priority Program focuses on: . reducing new HIV infections by implementing behavior changing communication campaigns and improving the distribution of free condoms; and . reducing the socioeconomic impact of AIDS by expanding access to voluntary counseling and testing; strengthening community home-based care; and providing an antiretroviral treatment . The Second-Level Priority Program focuses on children, youth, and women who are at risk from HIV transmission. The measures include: . improving management and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI); . expanding access to quality prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs; and . expanding existing programs targeting high-risk groups. Currently, the government is implementing a World Bank-supported project to combat HIV/AIDS along the lines noted above. Resources required for combating AIDS The National Aids Councils and the Ministry of Health estimate that the resources required to undertake all the interventions for a period of three years is US$560 million. Out of this, a total commitment of US$356 million has already been made, of which the Government has committed to US$l50 million; cooperating partners, US$ 114 million, and the Global Fund, US$92 million. There is a shortfall of US$204 million. ’ Sgherri and K. Douoguih. The Implications of HIV for the Zambian Economy,’ in “Zambia: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix” (SM/O1/3 19; 10/22/01).

Nonetheless, the sustainability of these large deficits and the recent deterioration in the terms of trade is a cause for concern, and significant efforts are needed to promote domestic savings and export diversification. 23. In this regard, the staff welcomed the recommendations of the recent international workshop on diversification (Box 2) aimed at enhancing the business environment and strengthening competitiveness. The authorities stated their determination to maintain market determined exchange rate and indicated that structural reforms would continue to focus on privatization, improving the performance of the financial sector (building on the proposals of the FSAP), strengthening public expenditure management and control, and enhancing transparency and governance. The staff added the need to avoid distortionary government interventions aimed at particular activities or sectors; to improve fiscal sustainability; and to accelerate the ongoing structural reforms. Fiscal outlook and sustainability 24. Consistent with the PRSP, the authorities are committed to achieving fiscal sustainability by maintaining a strong revenue effort and containing overall expenditures, while reorienting outlays toward infrastructure and poverty-reduction. Under the fiscal framework presented in the PRSP, the overall deficit is projected to decline, and the government intends to constrain further the domestic financing of the budget during 2003-04 from the 2.1 percent of GDP projected in 2002 (Tables 4 and 5). 25. The staff expressed concern at the substantial pressure on budgetary expenditure stemming from the wage bill, the cost of servicing a growing stock of domestic debt, the demands on social and infrastructure expenditure stemming from the goals of the PRSP, and the unfunded liabilities of pension funds and publicly owned financial institutions. Moreover, the impact of the drought may add further fiscal pressures in 2003. These pressures, combined with a narrow revenue base and limited external budget support, threaten medium- term fiscal sustainability. 26. The authorities acknowledged the current pressures on the budget, and expressed their firm commitment to contain and, to the extent possible, reduce the wage bill in relation to GDP, limit the growth of domestically financed capital expenditure and raise the revenue-GDP ratio by broadening the tax base, and by taking discretionary measures if necessary. On wages, the authorities reported that in August the cabinet had approved a medium-term public service pay reform strategy prepared in consultation with the World Bank staff, aimed at reducing the size of the payroll, decompressing the wage scale, improving performance incentives, and consolidating into salaries a range of allowances that are difficult to control. To support the fiscal restructuring, a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) has been developed, and is expected to be Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- Box 2. Diversification The July 2002 High-Level Workshop on Diversification identified several factors that have inhibited diversification of production and exports in the past, including the following: macroeconomic instability, characterized by high inflation, high interest rates, and a volatile exchange rate; and structural factors, such as inadequate infrastructure and utility services,l and lack of an investor-friendly environment. Participants in the workshop pointed out that, despite far-reaching economic liberalization during the past decade, Zambia’s policy framework is subject to frequent changes and thus sends mixed signals to investors; also the provision of basic services and infrastructure remain inadequate, and there are substantial layers of bureaucratic control and “red tape.” Drawing from international experience, a number of priority sectors have been identified as having maximum impact and potential for diversification: agriculture; tourism; gemstone and noncopper mining; and manufacturing in textiles, wood products, and agro-processing. Given Zambia’s abundant arable land and availability of underground and surface water, the country has the potential to export to the regional market food crops, as well as cash crops, like coffee and specialty vegetables, to international markets. Outgrower schemes have already proved very beneficial and should be encouraged. Given the country’s natural attractions, Zambia has the potential to exploit this comparative advantage in tourism and increase employment, as the sector tends to be labor intensive. Zambia also has large reserves of numerous gemstones, many of which are known internationally for their high quality, most notably emeralds. Encouraging more domestic processing could greatly increase the value added of this sector. Zambia was also urged to take advantage of the duty and quota-free access of textiles exports to the U.S. market made possible by the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Trade and Development Act. To increase the momentum toward diversification, the workshop identified a number of short- and medium-term actions, including the following: upgrading the Zambian Investment Center to become a one-stop shop to facilitate foreign investment; expediting the establishment of tax-free export processing zones to both encourage exports and stimulate sluggish regional centers; raising investment to improve key infrastructural services, like roads, telecommunications, power, etc; reviewing the land tenure act and property rights to facilitate the buying and selling of land; and, perhaps most important of all, finding an innovative solution to provide long-term, concessional finance to small businesses and export-oriented agriculture. ’ Zambia has one of the cheapest electricity production costs in the world, but investors noted that this was not reflected in the domestic price structure.

In this regard, the staff stressed the need for the introduction of reforms that ensured observance of budget limits and improved expenditure control. The staff also stressed the need to complete the privatization agenda. 27. Attaining the program’s objectives for poverty reduction will depend critically on achieving the targets for growth and inflation as well as effective implementation of public expenditure programs consistent with the priorities in the PRSP. Thus, strengthening public expenditure management and addressing the overruns in the government wage bill are essential. In light of the lower-than-programmed HIPC- financed expenditures in 2002, the staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to protect HIPC spending and to maintain it at the programmed level of about 2.2 percent of GDP in 2003 (LOI, para. 14). Monetary policy 28. Monetary policy aims at controlling broad money using reserve money as the intermediate target; it relies on the following instruments: cash reserve requirement (CRR); minimum liquid asset requirement (MLAR); term deposits; credit auctions; discounting; and sales and purchases of government securities. Over the past year, there has been a substantial improvement in the operations of the treasury bill market, including the issuance of new auction guidelines, and introduction of a multiple pricing format for treasury bills. The BoZ operations would benefit from improved liquidity forecasting through more effective coordination between the BoZ and the MoFNP regarding government operations. The authorities recognize the need to improve the effectiveness of existing instruments (LOI, para. 6), including by simplifying the penalty on the discount facility, and introducing averaging provisions for the CRR and MLAR, as recommended by MAE. Implementation of these reforms could reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates. External outlook and sustainability 29. Zambia’s external outlook is expected to improve on the basis of higher copper prices, consistent with WE0 projections, and because of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. It, nevertheless, remains highly vulnerable to external shocks. The volume of exports is projected to grow by about 8 percent annually during 2002-04, albeit with a downward trend;’ import volume rising by about 4 percent annually, reflecting economic growth and mining sector investment (Table 8). The current account deficit would narrow from 18.6 percent of GDP in 2002 to 16.3 percent in 2004, and is expected to be financed by private capital inflows, net official loans and grants, and debt relief. However, ’ The downward trend reflects the decline in copper production from KCM as it approaches the end of its economic life. The projection does not include potential new mines expected in the near future.

Staff have identified possible sources of financing sufficient to cover the gap for 2003, including a prospective new PRGF arrangement, additional balance of payments support from the World Bank, the EU, and other donors, and bilateral debt relief beyond the enhanced HIPC Initiative.’ 30. Zambia will face difficulties in achieving debt sustainability at the completion point under the HIPC Initiative, largely because copper prices are projected to be lower than envisaged at the time of decision point. The NPV of external debt to exports ratio at the completion point is now projected at about 200 percent, compared with 161 percent projected at the time of decision point (Table lo).” It is therefore anticipated that Zambia will require significant debt relief beyond that provided under the HIPC Initiative to achieve debt sustainability. Looking beyond the completion point, the NPV of debt and debt service to export ratios are projected to remain high during 2004-05 reflecting large payments due to the Fund, but would decline to more sustainable levels thereafter. Medium-term outlook, risks and vulnerabilities 31. On the internal side, the most significant risk stems from the expenditure pressures noted above, and weaknesses in expenditure control that threaten fiscal and macroeconomic stability and undermine the poverty reduction objectives. On the external side, Zambia is particularly vulnerable to developments in the copper sector and is highly dependent on donor assistance. A 10 percent decline in copper prices” compared with the baseline scenario would increase the current account deficit by 1.2 percent of GDP (about US$40 million) a year, and the NPV of debt to exports by about 10 percentage points above the baseline of 200 percent at the completion point. Moreover, external net resource inflows-grants and loans less debt service after debt relief-cover about a third of imports as well as about a third of total budgetary expenditures. Trade policy, regional integration initiatives, and exchange system 32. The staff commended Zambia for maintaining a liberal trade regime with three nonzero tariff bands, an average tariff of 13.4 percent, and few nontariff barriers. 9 At the recent Consultative Group meeting, a number of donors were sympathetic to provide increased budget support on the basis of government efforts to improve governance and economic performance. lo If world prices had attained the level projected at the time of the decision point, the 2003 NPV of debt to exports would be 177 percent. l1 Copper prices are projected to average about US75 cents per pound in 2003 and US86 cents per pound in 2004. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- Zambia has a rating of “2” (open) on the Fund’s lo-point index of trade restrictiveness. Zambia is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), but obstacles to regional integration remain. The government temporarily banned the importation of 14 products from Zimbabwe as an antidumping measure in response to complaints by local producers. COMESA has proposed the use of WTO-consistent countervailing duties in place of the import ban, which is being reviewed. A ban on the export of maize, imposed as a result of domestic food shortages, also remains in place. Recently Kenya and Malawi, both members of COMESA, have imposed nontariff barriers on textiles and sugar imports that will undermine Zambia’s nontraditional exports.12 33. Zambia maintains a liberal exchange system and has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, despite the existence of a MCP and exchange restriction arising from small external payments arrears. The authorities indicated that they intend to eliminate the MCP by moving to an inter-bank foreign exchange system in 2003, with technical assistance (TA) from the Fund (LOI, para. 21). Regarding the external payments arrears, they explained that negotiations were underway to verify and settle the claims from small creditors while seeking HIPC terms from institutional creditors.13 Financial sector issues 34. Zambia’s financial markets are relatively thin, financial intermediation is low, and the banking system provides services to only a small segment of the population. The recent FSAP mission found that banks face a number of potential risks, although none are systematically important in the short term. While all major banks, other than the state-owned ZNCB, show high capital ratios, satisfactory liquidity and profitability, and moderate nonperforming loans, a major risk to the system arises from the continued losses and insolvency of ZNCB.14 Other risks stem from adverse developments in the copper sector, difficulties of public enterprises in servicing their debts, and unforeseen shocks to interest and exchange rates. Looking at the state-owned nonbarik financial institutions (NBFIs), the report noted that they are insolvent and inactive but several continue to make losses, posing risks to the financial system, as well as to the government budget through its contingent I2 Kenya imposed a 15 percent levy on imports, and Malawi introduced a quota and requirement for use of the port of Dar-es-Salaam. Zambia is seeking to resolve these issues through the dispute settlement mechanisms of the SADC and COMESA. l3 These claims are also complicated by a lack of records. l4 Financial soundness indicators for the banks (other than the ZNCB) indicate risk-weighted capital ratios of 30-40 percent, nonperforming loans averaging 9 percent of total, returns on assets of 20-40 percent, and ratios of liquid assets to total assets of about 40 percent.

The authorities agreed with the conclusions of the FSSA report and are addressing the risks mainly through halting the financial deterioration and through the speedy privatization of the ZNCB, careful monitoring of smaller vulnerable banks, and macroeconomic stabilization to reduce volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. They underlined their intention to continue to collaborate closely with the Fund and World Bank staff, and have requested assistance to develop a strategic plan to address the weaknesses of the financial system, particularly the NBFIs, and to design institutional structures for providing financial services to rural areas. The authorities noted that they have allocated more resources to improve supervision of banks and the NBFI’s. The staff concurred with the authorities approach, stressing that the speedy privatization of the ZNCB, as intended, and actions to limit the losses of NBFIs, are critical priorities. Governance and transparency 36. Improving governance is a major challenge in Zambia. The PRSP articulates a broad agenda, including the efficient and transparent management of public services, and a reduction in corruption. In this context, the anticorruption drive initiated by the President and the removal of (allegedly) corrupt officials is commendable. Governance issues are addressed in the PRGF-supported program through a number of measures, including the completion and publication of the report on cobalt sales (LOI, para. 32), the strengthening of parliamentary oversight of the government budget, the publication of budget data, and a HIPC tracking report (LOI, Table 2). In addition, a safeguards assessment and Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (fiscal ROSC) were completed and the authorities are implementing measures to improve public expenditure management and the supervision of the financial system, including enacting of an Anti-Money-Laundering Act. 37. These measures have received considerable public support, and the authorities intend to intensify their efforts to improve the accountability of public finances. They reiterated their commitment to implement measures to improve public expenditure management, and to provide resources to strengthen the offices of the Auditor General, the Accountant General and the Anti-Corruption Commission. The staff and the authorities concurred that the privatization of public entities would help eliminate a major source of governance problems in Zambia. I5 The deficit of the public financial institutions, including the ZNCB, is estimated at the equivalent of about 3 percent of GDP.

In light of the adverse exogenous changes noted above, the macroeconomic objectives for 2002 were modified as follows: (i) GDP growth of 3.7 percent (4.3 percent previously); (ii) a 12-month inflation target of about 16 percent (13 percent previously); and (iii) a buildup of gross international reserves to US$226 million (broadly unchanged). 39. The staff commended the authorities for satisfactorily concluding the agreement with AA. The authorities explained that the US$lOS million financing arrangement (LOI, para. 6), combined with the ongoing restructuring of KCM and intensive efforts to cut costs, was expected to cover any losses during 2002-03 while the search for a new strategic partner is underway.16 While the recent decline in copper prices increased the vulnerability of KCM, the authorities reiterated the commitment of their Letter to the Managing Director of May 9,2002 that, in the event government support became unavoidable, the government would first seek external concessional financing and if such financing were insufficient, it would implement further fiscal measures, including broad- based tax measures, to cover the financing gap. 40. Regarding the food situation, donor assistance may be significantly reduced because of government safety concerns about GM maize and the subsequent import ban. The government is committed to providing adequate food supplies for all Zambians and to maintaining the free distribution of maize for the poorest Zambians. As a consequence, government expenditures will be higher in 2002-03, as noted below. Fiscal policy and prospects 41. The key objective of fiscal policy in 2002 remains to reduce the budget deficit consistent with the inflation target. Revenues are expected to be slightly weaker than the original program target, due to a shortfall in VAT collections reflecting a number of unanticipated VAT refunds to the mines, and lower imports of higher priced finished petroleum products as the refinery has come back on stream. 42. The staff expressed strong concerns about the shift in the composition of expenditures, as large overruns in the wage bill, mainly for the defense and security l6 The process has been slow to start, since AA would not agree to inspection by prospective bidders until the transition agreement had been signed.

The authorities noted that to limit the rise in the wage bill, they have taken a number of actions (LOI, para. 12), including: moving the defense and security forces to the public service payroll under the supervision of the MoFNP; canceling the already announced housing allowance; suspending leave and overtime benefits; and instituting a hiring freeze through the end of this year.18 They will also consolidate all allowances into the basic salary structure in 2003 in order to strengthen the administrative control of the far-reaching system of allowances. Regarding the HIPC-financed expenditures, they explained that the shortfall through end-June 2002 was caused mainly by capacity constraints and was not a deliberate policy to reduce spending on social programs. They noted that the projected spending on HIPC-financed projects for the second half of 2002 would be in line with the original program target 43. To further reduce the impact of wage overruns, the staff proposed a number of additional measures, including laying off all workers hired since January 2002, reversing the wage awards given to the defense and security forces, eliminating the purchase of vehicles by the National Assembly, and raising the top pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax rate to 35 percent in line with the corporate tax rate. The authorities, however, ruled out these measures as not politically feasible at this time. Alternatively, beginning early September, they instituted a cut in foreign travel, telephone usage, and other recurrent departmental charges (RDCs); and a reduction in transfers to grant-aided institutions outside the social sectors. 44. There are also additional costs to the budget arising from the drought. The importation of maize by the government to supplement donor and private sector imports would lead to an additional cost to the budget of about 0.5 percent of GDP in 2002. If the ban on GM maize imports is not modified and donor assistance does not materialize, it would entail an additional cost of up to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003. 45. Taking into account the above actions, and cuts in capital expenditure and a higher level of grants that will more than offset the increase in the wage bill, the fiscal program for 2002 is expected to remain on track. The overall fiscal deficit (including l7 With this increase, military expenditure in Zambia is about 0.5 percent of GDP higher than the average for selected regional comparators (Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). I8 This freeze would exclude the hiring of teachers, doctors, and nurses. The implementation of the measures began in early August 2002. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- Box 3: Public Sector Wage Developments The wage bill in 2002 is projected to be about 1 percent of GDP higher than the original program target. The authorities explained that roughly half of the overrun resulted from underbudgeting of military wage awards given in late 200 1 by the previous government shortly before the elections, the rest was due to additional hiring (mainly teachers and nurses), and weak administrative controls of the far-reaching system of allowances. They noted further that the 2002 budget did not fully reflect the wage increases awarded to defense services because the military payroll was processed outside the MoFNP, and detailed information on the award, including allowances, was not available. As a consequence, and given that implementation of the award began late in the second quarter of 2002 (including arrears payment for the increase made effective from January), the till impact of the increase on the 2002 wage bill was not reflected in the PRGF-supported program approved in May 2002.

The difference in the latter is accounted for entirely by the unanticipated expenditure on maize imports. This expenditure, together with a shortfall in donor budgetary support of US$l5 million, or about 0.4 percent of GDP, would raise domestic financing by some 0.9 percent of GDP above the original program.

Given that in the absence of further corrective action, the wage bill would reach 8.6 percent of GDP they stressed their commitment to constrain it to 8 percent of GDP (LOI, para. 13). The staff noted that further fiscal adjustment was necessary to help close the prospective financing gap of some 3.7 percent of GDP. The staff stressed the importance of scaling down nonessential expenditure to restore social spending. 47. The authorities indicated their firm resolve to take all necessary actions to cover the financing gap. They are actively considering revenue measures to improve efficiency and broaden the tax base which could generate up to about 1 percent of GDP. In addition, the authorities are identifying measures to reduce RDCs and transfers to state- owned entities and to streamline domestically financed capital expenditure consistent with capacity constraints in the ministries. They noted that their policy towards GM maize was being reviewed and could be modified, and that the government is consulting closely with donors to obtain additional assistance. Moreover, they noted that the projections of budget support were conservative, and that a number of donors had indicated intentions to provide additional budget support. With improved economic performance and policies, continuation of the anti-corruption campaign, and efforts to improve governance, they were hopeful that budget support from donors could be restored to previous levels. l9 Monetary and exchange rate policies 48. Monetary policy aims to contain inflationary pressure and to achieve the international reserves target. Accordingly, broad money is targeted to increase by 16 percent during 2002 (Table 6), compared with the program target of 15 percent. Credit to public enterprises is projected to increase marginally, reflecting mainly higher-than-projected borrowing by ZESC0.20 The volume of new credit to the private sector will be somewhat lower than anticipated earlier, mainly because of continuing high lending rates. To improve the liquidity management of banks and operations of the treasury bill market, the authorities are implementing a number of measures, including reviewing the reserve requirement and rules of tender and off-tender sale of treasury bills outlined in the LO1 (para. 6). The staff urged the authorities to continue adhering to the treasury bill auction guidelines in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the treasury bill market. l9 In EBS/02/81 (5/10/02), the staff had cautiously projected budget support for 2003 of US$70 million, or 1.7 percent of GDP, which represents a sharp reduction, compared with 4.1 percent of GDP anticipated in the 2002 budget and about 6.5 percent of GDP in each of the two preceding years. 2o Including the government bond issue of K 250 billion for recapitalization of the ZNCB.

The authorities reiterated that they would continue to maintain a market- determined exchange rate regime, with central bank intervention aimed at meeting the international reserves target and smoothing short-term fluctuations. They noted that the recent real depreciation of the kwacha reflected uncertainties in the copper sector and expectations of increased maize imports, and that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate. The authorities stated their intention to move to a broad-based interbank foreign exchange market during 2003 (LOI, para. 21). External sector outlook and policies 50. The recent decline in copper prices, combined with the higher demand for food imports, has weakened external prospects for the remainder of the year. Copper production and exports are expected to be about 18 percent higher in 2002, but this would be more than offset by lower copper prices and higher metal sector and maize imports. Consequently the external current account deficit is projected to reach 18.6 percent of GDP, compared with the 17.2 percent of GDP projected earlier. Higher project grants and private capital flows would cover the larger current account deficit and, together with HIPC assistance, would allow for a buildup in gross reserves of US$112 million in line with the program target. In April 2002, the Paris Club agreed to top up the 1999 Naples flow rescheduling to Cologne terms. The agreement will facilitate provision of interim assistance by bilateral creditors. C. Social Sector Policies, HIPC Initiative Spending, and Tracking 51. The government has incorporated part of the PRSP priority expenditures in the 2002 budget under “poverty reduction programs” and efforts are being made to monitor implementation of the PRSP (LOI, para. 31). The authorities noted that a number of measures had been undertaken to this end, including the use of a separate budget code and bank account, the preparation of special reports on the use of HIPC resources, and the involvement of external stakeholders in monitoring HIPC projects. In addition, the government is piloting an activity based budget so as to allow monitoring of expenditure on a functional basis (Box 4) and tracking all poverty-reducing expenditure. A report on the use of HIPC resources was published in August 2002. The staff welcomed these steps and emphasized the need to broaden the pilot program and introduce comprehensive tracking of all poverty reducing expenditures.

The authorities have requested the third, and last, tranche of HIPC interim assistance from the Fund to support poverty reduction efforts within the 2003 budget.21 This tranche of SDR 117.2 million would cover 69.5 percent of principal obligations falling due from January 1,2003 to December 3 1,2003 (Table 2). In light of the cumulative impact of excessive wage increases over the past three years, the government is firmly committed to limiting the wage bill to 8 percent of GDP in 2003, or slightly below the estimated outturn for 2002, and has already taken measures to achieve this target (LOI, para. 13). Furthermore, the government is committed to restore HIPC-spending to the programmed level of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2003 (LOI, para. 14) and in a manner consistent with the PRSP priorities. The extension of interim HIPC assistance at this time would also better enable the authorities to prepare their 2003 budget and later to execute their spending plans, particularly HIPC-related expenditures. D. Structural Reforms22 Privatization and banking reform 53. The authorities have also made progress in the privatization of oil sector entities, ZESCO, and Zambia Railways, in cooperation with the World Bank (LOI, para. 25). As the Indeni oil refinery has become operational, the government is in the process of reducing the import tariff on petroleum products to 5 percent, with a view to limiting monopoly pricing. Despite initial progress, delay has been experienced in implementing the work program for the concessioning of ZESCO, partly reflecting delays in securing technical assistance funding from a key donor. Noting that concessioning of ZESCO was a trigger for reaching the HIPC completion point, the staff urged the authorities to expeditiously implement the revised timetable. 54. The authorities stated that all technical work had been completed for streamlining the BoZ’s existing mechanism of financing government operations, and they reiterated their commitment to implement the strategy by December 2002 (a performance criterion). The key recommendations include: abolition of the BoZ forex bridging loan and use of overdraft facility, treasury bills, and government bonds as the primarily tools for financing government operations. 21 The Board last granted HIPC interim assistance to Zambia on May 29,2002 for the 7- month period covering June 2002-December 2002 (see EBS/02/8 1). This request was delayed owing to complications with a Paris Club creditor. As only a very small payment fell due prior to June, HIPC interim assistance was effectively granted for a 12-month period. 22 Structural conditionality is elaborated in Box 5.

Structural Conditionality Coverage of structural conditionality in the current program The structural performance criteria and benchmarks (Appendix I, Tables 1 and 2) focus on areas that are critical for achieving the program’s macroeconomic objectives. They include the following: privatization--the sale of 5 1 percent of the ZNCB shares; instruments of government financing--the streamlining and consolidating of the BoZ’s existing mechanism for financing government operations to comprise (i) an overdraft account with the BoZ; (ii) treasury bills; (iii) treasury bonds; and (iv) agreement on the terms and conditions for the restructured BoZ claims on government. public expenditure management-including (i) initiation of procurement of hardware and software for IFMIS; (ii) development of a database of individual domestic payments arrears; (iii) publication of monthly revenue and central government expenditure reports, along with data on cash releases in macroeconomic indicators; and (iv) measures to control new arrears, including clarifying the financial regulations, introducing a commitment control system at the line ministries, establishing an expenditure-monitoring unit at the Ministry of Finance, and introducing quarterly expenditure ceilings. discretionary tax exemptions--the abstention from new tax reductions, exemptions, rebates, or any other preferential tax treatment. governance and transparency-submission of 2001 accounts by Accountant General to the Auditor General to facilitate timely preparation of final audited accounts as required by law; publication of an annual report on the use and tracking of HIPC Initiative resources during 200 1 and allocation for 2002; and fiscal sustainability--the hiring freeze throughout government ministries and agencies. Status of structural conditionality in earlier programs The status of structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the 200 1 annual program is presented in Table 2 of Appendix I (EBS/02/81; 5/10/02). All the structural performance criteria and benchmarks through end-June 2002 were met, except on the reduction in domestic arrears. Some others were met with a slight delay. Structural areas covered by World Bank lending and conditionality Following the implementation of the World Bank-supported policy reforms in the oil sector, the Bank released US$50 million in June 2002 under the floating tranche of its Fiscal Sustainability Credit. The World Bank is continuing to discuss issues related to the oil sector with the authorities, as well as other issues, as follows: l Privatization and reform of oil sector entities. This includes securing cabinet approval of the ZPA proposal on the concessioning of the Tazama pipeline and Ndola storage facilities. l Privatization of railways. The concessioning of the freight services of Zambia Railways was completed in September 2002. l The ZPA will invite international bids (expression of interest) for concessioning of the state electricity company, ZESCO. This is a HIPC Initiative trigger and a particularly important structural reform, owing to the impact of electricity prices on the economy, as noted in Box 2.

Progress in implementing public expenditure management reforms has been mixed, and the staff stressed that firm control on public expenditure is critical to achieving the fiscal objectives and to prevent the accumulation of domestic arrears. The authorities explained that the planned reduction in domestic arrears of K 20 billion during the first half of the year did not materialize, despite payments of K 17 billion, because of the accumulation of additional arrears of K 58 billion, which largely reflected the impact of the kwacha depreciation as well as interest and penalty payments on the arrears stock. The authorities are now implementing measures to enforce a more effective commitment control system following recommendations by an FAD TA mission; to identify new arrears due to current year’s commitment; and to draw up a three-year plan for arrears clearance. The anticipated database of individual domestic payments arrears and the new computerized general ledger and reporting system (the Financial Management System-FMS) currently being piloted in several ministries are expected to improve the timely submission of monthly reports and commitment controls at the line ministries. To assist the authorities, FAD provided a PEM advisor who is focusing his efforts on strengthening commitment controls and regularizing the filing of monthly expenditure reports. 56. Notable progress has been achieved in implementing the IFMIS work program and developing a MTEF (LOI, paras. 29 and 30). Key members of the IFMIS project management team were appointed in August 2002, and nine firms have been short listed for the long-term IFMIS consultant to be funded by the World Bank. It is expected that the consulting firm will be in place by December and that work on procurement could begin so that the IFMIS pilot could begin during the second half of 2003. The World Bank consultants are assisting the MoFNP in developing a preliminary MTEF, which is expected to be presented to the cabinet along with the proposed 2003 budget. E. Technical Assistance, Data Issues, and Safeguards Assessment 57. Zambia continues to receive extensive TA from the Fund and other donors, but implementation of the recommendations has sometimes been slow. Efforts are being made to improve the utilization of TA. In recent years the authorities have received TA in the area of public expenditure management, banking and financial sector issues (LOI, para. 33). FAD has a long term expert in the MoFNP focusing on PEM, and MAE is working with the BoZ to introduce a broad-based interbank foreign exchange system. 58. The weak quality of the national accounts data continues to hamper assessment of economic conditions in Zambia. In addition, weaknesses persist in the timely compilation of monetary data. The government agreed to follow the recommendations of the recent TA mission on national accounts, including channeling more resources to complete periodic surveys and revise the methodology for compiling national accounts.

The first such assessment, completed in July 2001, concluded that the BoZ’s external audit mechanism was adequate. IV. CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND AND RISKS 60. Zambia’s capacity to meet its debt-service obligations will depend critically on the continued delivery of HIPC assistance as well as on significant external balance of payments support. Even after HIPC relief of about US$260 million each year through 2005, Zambia’s debt service obligations will remain significant through the medium term (Table 9). The debt service-to-export ratio is projected to increase from 14.3 percent in 2002 to 15.7 percent in 2004 but to decline sharply after 2006. This trend largely reflects a bunching of debt-service payments due to the Fund, which increase from about 6.2 percent of exports in 2002 to about 8 percent of exports during 2004-05. Zambia’s progress toward external sustainability will require firm implementation of the program’s policies, and vigilance to ensure that new borrowing is used for key priorities. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 61. In 2002 Zambia suffered from crises in the copper and food sectors that reduced prospects for economic growth and increased inflationary pressure. The authorities responded well to these crises by continuing to focus on pursuing appropriate financial policies while implementing the broad-based reform agenda. This is underscored by Zambia’s observance of all performance criteria and all but one of the benchmarks under the 2002 PRGF program. However, distortions in the distribution of public expenditures emanating from poor expenditure management and control remain a key concern. Overruns in the wage bill, mainly for the defense and security forces, were partly offset by regrettable reductions in domestic capital expenditures, including social outlays. The authorities are implementing corrective fiscal measures to achieve the macroeconomic targets for 2002. 62. As indicated in the PRSP, the medium-term policy challenge facing Zambia is to accelerate growth and thereby reduce poverty in the face of periodic external shocks and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Success in meeting these goals hinges on implementing a broad diversification strategy while maintaining a sound and stable financial environment along with a liberal trade and foreign exchange system. In this regard, there is need to address structural barriers to investment and productivity while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The authorities should also vigorously implement, as intended the prevention and curative programs supported by the donors to lessen the impact of HIV/AIDS. 63. The key macroeconomic policy challenge facing Zambia is to achieve a sustainable fiscal position and reduce inflation rate. In the past, inflation emanating from fiscal policy failures had caused high real interest rates and had undermined investment and growth for many years. Even though the authorities have taken corrective fiscal measures to achieve the 2002 program target, the staff is concerned by the large wage overruns. Thus, in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - the context of the 2003 budget, the staff welcomes government’s commitment to increase revenue efforts, strictly limit the size of the wage bill by adopting the public service pay reform program, improve policy implementation to mobilize additional external budget support, and to undertake such further measures as necessary to cover the financing gap. Given the shortfalls in social spending in 2002, the staff also welcomes the authorities’ commitment to increase spending on HIPC-financed programs in 2003. 64. While reducing the fiscal deficit and government domestic financing remains key, staff urges the authorities to maintain an appropriately tight monetary policy in order to achieve the inflation objective of the program. Improved coordination of monetary and fiscal policy would help in this process. The maintenance of a market determined and flexible exchange rate policy, with central bank foreign exchange intervention policy aimed at attaining the external reserve target, remains appropriate. 65. Effective control of public expenditure commitments will be essential to ensure adherence to spending priorities in favor of economic infrastructure, social sectors and poverty reduction as well as to avoid accumulation of payments arrears. The staff urges the authorities to vigorously implement the commitment control measures, including through effective use of the technical assistance provided by the Fund and other donors. Staff will monitor closely the implementation of these measures along with the plan for the phased introduction of an IFMIS. 66. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to continue to implement key structural reforms in 2002 and beyond. Continued political commitment to the privatization program is essential to avoid slippages and in this regard speedy privatization of the ZNCB remains a priority. The staff is encouraged by the authorities’ resolve to address the financial sector problems, particularly in the state-owned NBFIs, in the context of a medium-term financial sector development strategy. 67. The staff commends the authorities for the anticorruption drive initiated by the President, and for their commitment to implement governance and transparency measures under the program. These include publishing the report on cobalt sales, regular publication of the government budget and HIPC tracking report, and timely preparation of government accounts. Improvements are needed in the quality and timeliness of Zambia’s data. The staff urges the authorities to continue efforts to improve the effective utilization of TA. 68. Zambia’s economic situation remains difficult and there remain significant risks to achieving the authorities’ policy objectives. In particular, Zambia will continue to face an uncertain economic environment, most notably in world copper markets, food supplies, and its dependence on foreign aid. In these circumstances, the authorities will need to strengthen the adjustment effort and avoid expenditure overruns that pose a threat to macroeconomic stability and attainment of the authorities objectives for growth, diversification and poverty reduction set forth in the PRSP. The completion of the sixth and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - final review of the PRGF program will require a satisfactory understanding on an appropriate macroeconomic framework and a sustainable fiscal position for 2003 and beyond, while ensuring that resource allocation is consistent with poverty reduction objectives. The staff believes that while risks remain, the authorities have demonstrated their commitment to the policy framework supported by the PRGF. In view of the broadly satisfactory performance under the PRGF program, the staff recommends completion of the fifth review and the extension of additional interim HIPC Initiative assistance from the Fund for 2003. 69. Regarding the exchange restrictions evidenced by the multiple currency practice and existence of external arrears, the authorities are committed to move to an interbank foreign exchange market that will eliminate the multiple currency practice and have developed a plan to deal with the arrears. The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15,2002.

Dear Mr. Kiihler, In this letter, we review progress in implementing our 2002 program, which is supported by a PRGF arrangement, and describe our key economic and financial policies for the remainder of the year. The letter summarizes the recent agreement with Anglo American plc (AA) which will allow the Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) to remain open, and outlines the government’s response to the drought that has affected Zambia. The letter requests completion of the fifth review under the PRGF arrangement and the ninth disbursement under the arrangement. As the overall program remains broadly on track, the government is also requesting additional interim HIPC debt relief from the Fund for 2003 equivalent to SDR 117.2 million, which would cover 69.5 percent of principal obligations falling due to the Fund between January 2003 and December 2003. The attached tables report on developments and prospects with regard to performance criteria and benchmarks until end- September 2002, and propose performance criteria and benchmarks through end-December 2002. I. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 1. All of the program’s quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2002 were met, as were the end-May and end-September structural performance criteria (Tables 1 and 2). In addition, all the benchmarks were met, except that regarding the phased reduction of domestic arrears.’ The continuous structural performance criterion and benchmark were also observed. The government is finalizing a comprehensive database of domestic arrears (a benchmark for end-December 2002) and has taken actions to improve expenditure management (LOI, paragraphs 26-28).2 i There was some delay in meeting the benchmarks on publishing a report on the use of HIPC resources, and on appointing a negotiating team for the privatization of ZNCB owing to the delay in donor funding for the engagement of the transactions advisor. 2 The accumulation of arrears during the first half of 2002 was mainly because of penalty interest on late payments, and the effects of the depreciation of the kwacha. The accumulation also reflected the unpredictable nature of cash releases which the authorities (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - APPENDIX I 2. Economic developments are being adversely affected by the regional drought. The government estimates that the 2002 output of maize was about 25 percent below last year’s output and about 40 percent below the normal crop year of 2000. In contrast, however, data for the first half of 2002 show that copper production increased by 14 percent, substantially above the 1.9 percent increase projected for 2002. The 12-month inflation rate through August rose to 23.7 percent, mainly because of the higher than anticipated food prices due to the drought. Between end-December 2001 and end-June 2002, the Kwacha depreciated by about 17 percent against the U.S. dollar, largely reflecting continuing uncertainties in the copper sector and the expectation of an increase in the demand for foreign exchange for food imports. However, the rate has remained broadly unchanged since end-June 2002. 3. Fiscal performance through end-June 2002 was broadly on track, but the composition of expenditure and the continuing accumulation of domestic arrears were worrisome. Furthermore, spending pressures are expected to mount in the second half of the year. The wage bill through end-June 2002 was higher than programmed, reflecting payments for arrears on a 2001 wage award to the defense and security forces, as well as lapses in financial controls. Recurrent departmental charges were also slightly higher than expected. These overruns were in part offset by lower spending on HIPC Initiative financed programs, owing to capacity constraints in the line ministries, and in retrenchment payments. Revenues were slightly higher than targeted. 4. Monetary data for the first half of 2002 indicates that broad money rose by over 13 percent compared with a program target of 5 percent. However, excluding the impact of the kwacha depreciation on commercial banks holdings of dollar denominated deposits, the increase in broad money was 6 percent, broadly in line with the program. Owing to the reduction in inflation since end-2000, the yield on 91-day treasury bills has declined from nearly 50 percent at end-December 2001 to around 30 percent at end-August 2002. The BoZ’s authorization to allow banks to hold their cash reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits in foreign currency has reduced intermediation costs to banks, and the release of the domestic currency resources previously committed to serve as reserves on FCDs may also have helped increase demand for treasury bills. Unfortunately, commercial banks lending rates have not declined in line with the yields on treasury bills. As a result, the volume of new commercial banks credit to the private sector through end-June was lower than programmed. 5. Balance of payments develop’ments for the first half of 2002 were better than expected. The volume of copper exports grew significantly faster than anticipated notwithstanding Anglo’s announced withdrawal from the sector, while non-traditional exports grew in line with program estimates. Merchandise imports declined faster than expected as the metal and other sectors responded to the uncertainty created by the copper are now addressing by introducing quarterly ceilings on cash releases and communicating these to the line ministries.

With the release of non-Fund interim debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative amounting to US$114 million, plus US$152 million of interim relief from the Fund, as well as World Bank disbursements of US$56 million, the BoZ was able to build up gross international reserves to US$166 million at end-June 2002 compared with an adjusted program target of US$l59 million. 6. Regarding the copper sector, we have concluded an agreement with AA that will enable KCM to operate as a going commercial concern and to remain in the private sector. AA has agreed to leave in place its management team while an orderly transition is being arranged, and will continue to provide KCM with procurement and marketing arrangements until at least end-March 2003. AA has agreed a financing package estimated at US$lO5 million which covers virtually all of KCM’s expected operating deficit for 2002-03. The financial package includes: (i) an exit fee of US$30 million; (ii) an advance from AA to KCM of US$l8 million secured by KCM’s insurance claim in respect of the Nchanga open pit cave-in; (iii) a loan of US$S.S million from AA, which matches a loan of the same amount from the government; (iv) an acceleration of payments of US$20 million from KCM’s key customers; and (v) a US$20 million bank overdraft collateralized by receivables. It is expected that KCM will become profitable beginning 2004, although the impact of the recent fall in copper prices on KCM’s finances gives cause for concern and government is closely monitoring developments in this area. 7. Regarding structural reforms, the ZPA advertised the sale of 51 percent of ZNCB shares, and in September it appointed a team with authority to negotiate the sale of the bank. The government also implemented the oil sector reforms agreed with the World Bank, and the related disbursements from the World Bank of US$50 million were made in June 2002. Consistent with the program’s objectives, in July 2002 the task force formed to review and streamline BoZ’s mechanism for financing government operations prepared a proposal on modalities, including listing of all outstanding BoZ credits to GRZ and GRZ securities issued to the BoZ, all of the GRZ’s dormant accounts at the BoZ, and the appropriate instruments to securitize the government’s indebtedness to BoZ while ensuring an appropriate income stream to the BoZ. Based on this proposal, the government has already decided on a strategy which it intends to implement by end-December 2002. II. THEPROGRAMFORTHEREMAINDEROF 2002 A. Macroeconomic Policies 8. Reflecting mainly the impact of the drought, the macroeconomic objectives under the 2002 program have been revised as follows: (i) achieve real GDP growth of about 3.7 percent; (ii) reduce the 12-month inflation rate to 16 percent; and (iii) build up gross international reserves by US$ll2 million. Achieving these objectives will require continued implementation of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, implementing key structural reforms, and improving public expenditure management and governance. 9. As noted earlier, Zambia faces a maize shortfall which is estimated at up to 600,000 metric tons during the 2002/03 crop season. Of this amount, the World Food Program (WFP) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - APPENDIX I was expected to cover some 150,000 tons (to be distributed free to the most adversely affected Zambians). A further 300,000 tons was to be imported commercially by the private sector, leaving about 150,000 tons to be covered by the government, NGOs, and additional bilateral assistance. The government has committed to the private sector not to distort market prices. However, owing to the government’s concerns regarding importing genetically modified (GM) maize and subsequent import ban, the WFP imports are likely to be sharply reduced. In the circumstances, the government has imported some 65,000 tons of non-GM maize, of which 40,000 tons will be for free distribution to the most adversely affected areas. The cost of these policies will exceed the amount provided in the budget by about K 80 billion or 0.5 percent of GDP, with additional costs, presently estimated at up to K 125 billion, to be incurred in 2003, if the donor assistance through WFP does not materialize. The government, through the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), intends to retain a modest stock of maize reserve in storage if sufficient financing is available. B. Fiscal Policies, External Resources, HIPC, and PRSP 10. Revenues for 2002 are expected to be broadly in line with the program target. Direct taxes have been performing well, but the prospects for import VAT are weaker now than initially expected. This is largely due to the coming online of the Indeni refinery. To protect the revenue base and help maintain a transparent tax regime, the government will continue to abstain from introducing new tax reductions, exemptions and rebates. 11. Budgetary support from Zambia’s cooperating partners during 2002 is projected to be some US$15 million lower than the program estimate of US$160 million. The EU has increased its commitment of support, but the World Bank disbursements of program loans are less than anticipated, as the Bank has not yet proceeded with a new adjustment credit. In response to our request for emergency assistance, the World Bank is expected to disburse US$50 million over a two-year period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002, about half of which will be tied to new spending. External budgetary debt service is expected to remain broadly in line with the program estimate of 2.4 percent of GDP, after interim debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative of about US$ll4 million (excluding relief from the IMF). This amount is being used to support the government’s plans to orient the budget toward poverty reduction. 12. In the absence of corrective measures, the program target for the domestic budget balance would be exceeded by about 1 percent of GDP (excluding the additional cost of 0.5 percent of GDP on account of the drought). This increase reflects mainly the impact of the large wage increase granted to the defense and security forces by the previous administration in the run-up to the December 2001 elections, as well as wage increases given to teachers as well as the hiring of additional teachers in 2002. The current administration is strongly committed to restraining the wage bill, and to offset the wage overruns has taken the following measures: (1) payroll processing for the Defense and Security forces, and the National Assembly has been transferred to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP), under the supervision of the Accountant General and the Centralized Computer Services Department, as is already the case with the rest of the civil service; (2) the recently announced housing allowance has been cancelled; (3) all payments in lieu of leave and all Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIX I overtime payments have been suspended through end-December 2002; (4) a freeze on all civil service hiring will be implemented and strictly enforced effective end-August;’ (5) cuts in foreign travel, communications, and other RDCs will be instituted to save K 25 billion for the remainder of the year; (6) a reduction by K3 1 billion in non-HIPC financed payments to grant-aided institutions; (7) cuts in domestically financed non-HIPC capital expenditure to save K 44 billion4 and (8) cuts in HIPC-financed capital expenditure amounting to K 3 1 billion of which K 9 billion is contingency expenditure. These measures will provide savings of K 173 billion and will close the corresponding financing gap. On this basis, the overall deficit in 2002 is projected to be 6.1 percent of GDP and the domestic balance would be 3.6 percent of GDP. Excluding the impact of the unanticipated expenditures on maize imports, the domestic balance is in line with the program. The overall deficit will largely be covered by external resources, and domestic financing will be higher than initially programmed by 0.9 percent of GDP, reflecting the shortfall in external budgetary support, and the additional financing for food imports. 13. On the basis of a passive projection, there would be a substantial financing gap in the 2003 budget. This reflects, in part, the cumulative impact of excessive wage increases over the past three years (which have raised the wage bill from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 8.6 percent projected for 2003), as well as the need to address the stock of domestic arrears, and the potential additional cost of maize imports. The government recognizes that in the absence of strong actions to reverse the trend, it will be difficult to have a meaningful increase in spending on the social sectors and for poverty reducing programs, without triggering renewed inflationary pressures that have undermined Zambia’s economic development for many years. Thus, in order to address the fiscal situation and taking into account the very large increase in real public service wages over the past three years, the government is firmly committed to limiting the wage bill to 8 percent of GDP in 2003, slightly below the estimated outturn for 2002. To achieve this goal, the government is making strong efforts to reduce the size of the public service and to implement the recently adopted medium-term pay reform strategy. This will include, for 2003, a consolidation of all allowances into basic salary and undertaking a comprehensive audit of all payrolls, with a view to introducing a personal identification code and removing all “ghost workers” from the payrolls. Once the savings generated by implementing these and other measures materialize, the government will proceed to agree and fund performance-related pay enhancements. The government is fully committed to taking additional fiscal measures to ensure that the program’s macroeconomic targets are achieved. It also intends to continue to pursue structural reforms in key areas. 3 Excluding teachers, doctors, and nurses as indicated in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. ’ Most of these measures relate to projects which have not yet started, and consequently, the cancellation of the corresponding budgeted cash releases will not generate arrears.

Regarding the PRSP priority expenditures designated “poverty reduction programs” and funded by HIPC Initiative resources, government intends to spend K 27 1 billion equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2002, compared with the program target of 2.2 percent of GDP. This shortfall, which had already taken place before end-June 2002, reflects mainly capacity constraints at the line ministries, an intensification of the process for monitoring HIPC Initiative financed expenditures, as well as the need to contain inflationary financing in the second half of the year. However, the government is committed to restore HIPC spending to the programmed level of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2003. The government also intends to adhere to its operational rules to ensure that cash releases are consistent with budget allocations in priority areas. The government will continue to improve its monitoring and tracking of HIPC Initiative resources, which could serve as a model for improved management and control of all PRSP expenditures in the future. To this end, the government is modifying its computer systems to enable analysis of cash release data on a functional basis. In the meantime, an annual report on the use of HIPC Initiative resources during 2001 has been prepared and published. C. Monetary Policy 15. Monetary policy during the second half of 2002 will aim to achieve the program’s targets on growth, inflation and international reserves. Broad money is expected to increase by 16 percent during 2002, broadly in line with the original program rate of 15 percent. Achieving the monetary target will be facilitated by continued use of indirect monetary instruments. The BoZ will continue to adhere to the Treasury bill auction guidelines in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the treasury bill market. Overall credit expansion to the private sector is expected to be in line with the program, although part of the increase reflects the impact of the kwacha depreciation on foreign currency denominated loans, as the demand for kwacha denominated loans was lower than projected mainly on account of the smaller than expected reduction in commercial bank lending rates. Meanwhile, credit to public enterprises, including the government bond issue of K 250 billion to ZNCB on behalf of ZNOC (paragraph 22), is projected to increase marginally reflecting largely the valuation impact of the higher-than-expected depreciation of the Kwacha, and somewhat higher than projected borrowing by ZESCO. 16. Although there has been a substantial reduction in yields on treasury bills, the government is concerned that commercial bank lending rates have not declined significantly and that their high level will continue to have a negative impact on economic performance and on the prospects for diversification. To address this concern, the government intends to maintain prudent financial policies to contain and, if possible, reduce the stock of domestic debt, and generally address persistent inflationary expectations. To further facilitate banks liquidity management, the BoZ will: (i) continue to increase the proportion of banks’ cash reserve requirement for foreign currency deposits that can be held in foreign currency; (ii) review the current volume and price penalties put in place on rediscounting of treasury bills with a view to providing banks with greater flexibility in their cash management; (iii) continue to improve the effectiveness of tender and off-tender sales of government securities; (iv) review the current statutory cash reserve requirements policy to facilitate greater flexibility in cash management; and (v) widen the treasury bill market to encompass a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 55 - APPENDIX I larger segment of the population with a view to providing high yield savings instruments while reducing the overall cost of government borrowing. Finally, with respect to the pilot scheme to exempt the amount commercial banks lend to the agricultural sector from the calculation of their statutory reserve requirements, we delayed implementation while discussing ways to avoid distortions and to focus attention on productive lending. The scheme was introduced in September on a voluntary basis and we will carefully monitor its implementation. 17. A joint team from the IMF and the World Bank recently conducted a comprehensive assessment of the financial system under the Financial System Assessment Program (FSAP). The team’s preliminary findings were that the quality of banking supervision is adequate, and with the exception of the state-owned ZNCB, the overall banking system was satisfactorily capitalized, liquid, profitable, and with moderate nonperforming loans. Although there is no immediate risk of insolvency of the banking sector, given the high capitalization, the mission found that banking profitability was susceptible to a reduction in interest rates and in foreign exchange-related revenue, which could become a source of systemic risk in the medium term. We agree with the report’s conclusion that a number of state-owned financial institutions are insolvent and pose substantial risk to the financial system and to the budget on account of the contingent liabilities for the government. The BoZ is immediately enhancing its supervision and monitoring of these institutions. The report also found that banks provide services to only a small segment of the population supporting the claim that lack of access to finance and its high cost are major impediments to growth and diversification. As an initial step, the government is requesting technical assistance from the Fund and the Bank to design a medium-term financial sector development plan to address these issues. 18. The government has made significant progress towards streamlining the diverse range of instruments it uses to borrow from the BoZ with a view to improving monitoring and the transparency of the banking system’s net credit to government. On the basis of a joint task force proposal prepared in July, government has decided on a strategy which will be implemented by end-December 2002. The streamlining will result in a simplified mechanism for financing government operations consisting of three elements: treasury bonds, treasury bills, and an overdraft account at the BoZ. All government debt instruments held by the BoZ, including the foreign exchange bridge loan account, will be consolidated into an interest bearing bond. D. External Sector and Exchange Rate Policies 19. Zambia’s external current account deficit (excluding grants) is projected to narrow to 18.6 percent of GDP in 2002, compared with 20.2 percent of GDP in 2001. The wider deficit compared with the program target of 17.2 percent, mainly reflects the substantial increase (6.8 percent) in merchandise imports during the second-half of 2002, on account of the higher food imports noted above. Total merchandise exports receipts are projected to increase by 6.9 percent, compared with a small programmed decline, mainly because of the higher-than-expected volume of copper exports so far this year, which has offset the lower-than-expected copper prices. The improved current account deficit is Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 56 - APPENDIX I expected to offset the substantially lower net capital inflows and therefore result in a smaller- than-programmed overall balance of payments deficit. In July 2002, Zambia held a Consultative Group meeting where cooperating partners renewed and expanded their commitments to provide financial support. Thus, taking into account these commitments, external concessional loans, and interim HIPC debt relief, gross international reserves are projected to increase by US$ll2 million, broadly in line with the program target. 20. Between end-December 2001 and end-August 2002, the Kwacha depreciated by 17 percent in nominal terms against the U.S. dollar and by about 9 percent in real terms. At the same time, the spread between the BoZ and the average bureau exchange rate has narrowed sharply. The major underlying cause for the depreciation has been the uncertainties in the foreign exchange market arising from developments in the mining sector and expectations of increased maize imports. We believe that with the conclusion of the agreement with AA, the uncertainty will be progressively reduced. We also believe that the current level of the real exchange rate is broadly appropriate to maintain Zambia’s competitiveness and to encourage diversification. The BoZ is committed to allow the rate to continue to be market-determined with intervention limited to meeting the international reserves target and to smoothing short-term fluctuations. The government continues to be committed to an open trade regime and to strengthening the regional trading arrangements. However, on account of the adverse impact of regional developments on Zambia, we have enacted a temporary ban on 14 imports from a neighboring country. We intend to review this ban with a view to make it consistent with our commitments under the WTO and COMESA. 21. To increase the efficiency of the foreign exchange market, the government intends to introduce a unified inter-bank foreign exchange market during 2003 and in September 2002 received technical assistance from the Fund for this purpose. This reform will eliminate the existing auction system run by the BoZ and will preclude the potential of a continuation of the multiple currency practice. This will, however, require additional technical assistance from the Fund, in order to work out a detailed timetable for implementation including the necessary market infrastructure, the ability of the small banks to access foreign exchange in the new system, and in specifying the role of the BoZ. Given the current low level of international reserves and the uncertainty in the copper sector, and to avoid possible volatility in the exchange rate, we would prefer the transition to the inter-bank market to coincide with additional balance of payments support. E. Structural Reforms, Public Expenditure Management, and Governance Structural Reforms 22. The sale of the government’s majority controlling interest in the ZNCB is a key element of our privatization and financial sector reform program and is intended to improve the investment climate and management of public finances. In response to ZPA’s advertisement of the sale of 5 1 percent of ZNCB, several international banks have expressed interest in buying ZNCB. In September, the ZPA Board appointed a negotiating team with authority to negotiate the contract for sale of the bank. The Banking Supervision Department of the BoZ will conduct ‘fit and proper’ screening of potential buyers before bids Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 57 - APPENDIX I are evaluated. It is expected that the ZPA Board will conclude the evaluation of bids and approve negotiations with preferred bidders by end-November 2002, which will be monitored as a program benchmark. In addition, it is expected that negotiations and a final sales contract with the successful bidder will be completed by end-December 2002 which would enable the privatization process to be completed shortly thereafter. To facilitate the privatization process, the government has cleaned up the balance sheet of the bank and issued a bond valued at K 250 billion to recapitalize the bank consistent with regulatory requirement. Interest on the bond will become payable only at the time of privatization. The bond is to cover the liabilities to ZNCB of ZNOC and Roan Antelope Mining Company of Zambia (RAMCOZ).’ The contingent liabilities of a legal action by some ex-employees of ZNCB will also be covered by government. However, the government will not meet any of ZNOC’s liabilities for which it is not legally liable. In addition, the buyer of ZNCB will not be required to maintain any non-viable rural branch for more than two years. 23. As discussed above, the government, jointly with the staffs of the World Bank and the IMF, plans to develop a strategic plan on financial market development that will consider the future of the rural branches and design an appropriate institutional structure for providing rural service. Technical and financial assistance from donors, including the World Bank, will be sought for this purpose. Given the need to encourage private sector investments, a key element for sustained medium-term growth and poverty reduction, the government will maintain a liberal environment for investment and will consult fully with all key stakeholders including our development partners before making any changes to the Investment Act. Also, to improve the business environment, the government will review existing labor laws with a view to identifying needed reforms. 24. The management of ZNCB is cooperating fully in preparing the bank for privatization and will agree on a plan with the BoZ to reduce costs and to halt further deterioration in the financial position of the bank. The ZNCB is complying with directives issued by the BoZ, including stopping the recognition of unrealized exchange gains, and continuing to strictly limit new lending. In addition, the BoZ has also undertaken measures to improve the supervision of financial institutions, including creating a special unit to deal with distressed banks and improving reporting requirement for non-bank financial institutions. In further efforts aimed at strengthening the overall financial system, in July the operations of United Bank of Zambia were suspended because of its failure to recapitalize and to bring in new shareholders as agreed earlier. With regard to anti-money laundering, the Zambian Parliament passed an Act on Prohibition of Money Laundering in November 2001 and guidelines are being prepared to implement the Act. 25. Regarding the oil sector, as indicated earlier, substantial progress in completing the reform program has been made, consistent with our commitments under the World Bank’s Fiscal Sustainability Credit. Retail prices of petroleum products have been liberalized, and all oil marketing companies are free to import petroleum products directly. 5 The government intends to expedite the sale of RAMCOZ, which is under receivership. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 58 - APPENDIX I ZNOC, which has been responsible for huge losses and high energy costs in the country, has been put under liquidation. The remaining steps in this area will be implemented in consultation with the World Bank staff. In line with our previous commitments, and as the Indeni refinery has now become operational, the government is in the process of reducing the import tariff on petroleum products to 5 percent. This will limit monopoly pricing, and increase efficiency in the oil sector and, more broadly in the economy. Regarding ZESCO, in March 2002, ZPA received expression of interest from consulting firms to provide transactions advisory services for concessioning of ZESCO and prepared terms of reference for the advisors. It is expected that the ZPA will complete evaluation of technical proposals for the hiring of consultants by end-December 2002. We intend to proceed expeditiously with the concessioning of ZESCO, which is a trigger for reaching the HIPC completion point. Public Expenditure Management 26. The government is making progress in strengthening public expenditure management to enhance efficiency and to avoid a further accumulation of domestic payments arrears. In this context, the Accountant General (AG) and Controller of Internal Audit, are finalizing a comprehensive database of individual arrears as of end-March 2002. In addition, we will provide on a regular basis in the quarterly audit verification of domestic arrears, an analysis distinguishing between additional arrears generated by overdue payments on pre-2002 commitments and additional arrears due to current year commitments. By end- March 2003, we will also draw up a three-year plan for clearing these arrears. Starting in January 2003, line ministries will be required to document which arrears in the database were paid with any funds released by MoFNP for arrears clearance. At the same time, in order to prevent the accumulation of new arrears, the government has established an Expenditure Monitoring Unit (EMU) in MoFNP, introduced quarterly expenditure ceilings, and made progress toward establishing a Commitment Control System (CCS) in line ministries. Specifically, the government issued a treasury circular requiring each line ministry to appoint a Commitment Control Officer responsible for limiting commitments to the quarterly expenditure ceilings and cash releases provided by the Budget Office. The CCS will be introduced in the MoFNP, Judiciary, Ministry of Local Government and Housing, and Ministry of Works and Supply with effect from November 2002 and in the other line ministries from January 2003. The CCS will be enhanced by a new computerized ledger and reporting system (see below). The EMU will verify the consistency between arrears documented in the monthly expenditure reports (MERs) and arrears audited by the Controller of Internal Audit (see below). 27. The government will strengthen its efforts to receive MERs (within 15 days from the end of each month) from all budget units, documenting commitments, expenditures, and arrears. The MERs will be used as the basis for arrears monitoring, and regular quarterly audits by the Controller of Internal Audit. The new computer-based ledger and reporting system, the Financial Management System (FMS), was developed internally by the Centralized Computer Services Department in liaison with the AG’s office, and is being piloted in 4 ministries and will gradually be rolled out to the entire government. The system will feed directly into the planned IFMIS. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59 - APPENDIX I 28. The government has taken steps to improve the cash release and cash management processes. In September, the government issued a treasury circular detailing the following points to Controlling Officers in the line ministries: (1) commitments are to be kept within quarterly expenditure ceilings allocated for each budget line, even if this is smaller than the pro rata budget appropriation; (2) virement between budget subheads requires ex ante, written, approval from the Secretary to the Treasury (ST) and in the event that ex-ante Treasury authority is not sought, expenditures will be regarded as unauthorized and further funds will not be released; (3) requests for “special funding” above appropriations will not be entertained (except in cases of national emergencies); and (4) strict sanctions, including refusal to disburse future cash, will be imposed on Controlling Officers who fail to comply with the monthly reporting requirements, or with their financial responsibilities. Cash releases are being published in the Macroeconomic Indicators. A mid- term budget review was performed by end-August 2002. Line ministries are now being required to submit cash flow projections to MoFNP, to permit rephasing of expenditures in light of revenue forecasts and, thereby, minimize costly borrowing. With these reforms, and tightened approval procedures at the Zambia National Tender Board (whose tender committee is chaired by the ST), we believe that public expenditure management will improve and the trend of arrears accumulation reversed. 29. With regard to the longer-term introduction of an IFMIS to improve government financial control, a short-term consultant has been working with government officials since February 2002. The government has issued the Request For Proposal for the main consulting firm (expected to be hired by December 2002) to help design and pilot the IFMIS project, including hardware and software requirements. Procurement is expected to start by December 2002, and a pilot program should be launched in at least three ministries during the 2003 budget year, a condition for reaching the completion point under the HIPC Initiative. 30. Government is developing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) that will guide annual budgets from 2004 onward, to serve as a bridge between the broad policy priorities outlined in the PRSP and the annual detailed budgeting exercise. In the meantime the budget framework paper will be submitted to the cabinet for approval by the end of October 2002. Moreover, the government will improve transparency in the presentation of the annual budget by henceforth employing the standard international presentation of GFS. The government has taken steps to improve its capacity to plan, to coordinate and to monitor its programs through the newly established Planning and Economic Management Department. This Department is responsible for macro-economic planning, the development of the MTEF, and coordination of monitoring PRSP implementation. 31. Zambia’s PRSP, which was endorsed by the Fund and Bank in May 2002, was commended for the wide consultation process that was undertaken. The government has already incorporated part of the PRSP priority expenditure in the 2002 budget under “poverty reduction programs”. The monitoring of the PRSP and of the HIPC Initiative financed programs is being coordinated by MoFNP who have appointed a HIPC Monitoring and Tracking Team. In addition, civil society groups have organized themselves to monitor HIPC Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - APPENDIX I and PRSP Initiatives. The government has made progress in implementing the triggers for reaching the HIPC completion point in 2003. In particular, progress has been made in implementing macroeconomic and structural reforms as well as social sector programs. The government is now focusing on areas which require additional efforts for timely implementation, namely privatization/concessioning of ZESCO, preparation and implementation of an MTEF, implementation of an IFMIS on a pilot basis and remaining measures to complete the agreed education, health and HIV/AIDS and poverty monitoring programs. Governance 32. In line with government priorities spelled out in the PRSP, government is fully committed to improving economic governance, and has stated a zero tolerance policy towards corruption. Measures have been taken to strengthen the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), and other relevant government institutions. In his July 2002 speech to the Parliament, President Mwanawasa highlighted a number of high profile corruption cases involving high ranking officials, and political and business leaders, and indicated government’s resolve to prosecute these and other cases. All the officials involved were removed from their positions. In addition, as a sign of our commitment to improve governance, we intend to publish the final report on ZCCM cobalt sales shortly, and refer it to the appropriate legal authorities for further action. The government is strongly committed to making efforts to recover funds and assets acquired through corrupt and unlawful practices and will seek assistance from cooperating partners in this regard. Steps are also being taken to enhance transparency and accountability in the management of public resources, and as such, government is complying strictly with Zambian law that the Accountant General submits government accounts of the preceding year to the OAG by end-September and that the annual audited government accounts be submitted to Parliament by end-year. Moreover, given the need for public officials to be held accountable to the Zambian public for their actions and the large loss in the operations of ZNOC, we intend to seek donor financing to initiate a forensic audit of the purchase and sale of oil and of ZNOC’s operations. III. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DATA ISSUES 33. Zambia continues to require technical assistance (TA) in the areas of public expenditure management, monetary operations and liquidity management, restructuring of state-owned financial institutions, and in setting up a broad based inter-bank foreign exchange market. Considerable delays continue to be experienced in producing monetary statistics, particularly the monetary survey, despite BoZ’s best efforts to resolve the problem. The report of the recent TA mission indicated that the quality of basic source data for national accounts estimates has been eroding in recent years, in addition to not keeping up with major structural changes that have occurred in the economy. We recognize that weaknesses in basic survey data and methodology, the use of outdated weights, long delays in compiling actual data, and frequent revision in the estimates undermine government’s ability to monitor economic developments and formulate policies on a timely basis. The government will follow through with the recommendations of the TA mission and provide Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-61 - APPENDIX I more resources to the Economic Statistics Division of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to perform their tasks more effectively as a matter of high priority. The government intends to request additional follow-up TA in these areas in the context of the General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS). Meanwhile, we have completed preparation of the metadata to comply with the requirements for participating in the GDDS. Further assistance to introduce the IFMIS on a pilot basis in a number of ministries will be required. IV. PROGRAM MONITORING 34. For end-December 2002, the implementation of the program will be monitored on the basis of the quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks indicated in Tables 1 and 2. These are defined in the attached revised Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The sixth and final review under the PRGF arrangement, to be completed no later than end-March 2003, will be a condition for the eleventh disbursement and will be conducted based on performance through end-December 2002. It will include understandings on an appropriate macroeconomic and financial framework for 2003. Yours faithfully, IS/ Hon. Emmanuel G.

This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Zambian authorities and the International Monetary Fund regarding the definitions of the quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the program supported by the PRGF arrangement, as well as the related reporting requirements. The definitions are valid at the start of the program, but may need to be revisited during the program reviews to ensure that the memorandum continues to reflect best understanding of the Zambian and Fund staff to monitor the program. II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS: DEFINITIONS AND DATA SOURCES A. Net Domestic Assets of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) 2. NDA of BoZ is defined as the monthly-average (based on daily data), during the month of the test dates, of the reserve money less net foreign assets calculated at end- December, 200 1 BoZ mid-exchange rates (program exchange rates). ’ Reserve money includes currency in circulation, required reserves on kwacha deposits, required reserves on foreign currency deposits, positive current account balances of banks with the BoZ and deposits of non-central government institutions. Net foreign assets of the BoZ are defined as gross international reserves (defined below) plus any other foreign asset, including the IMF interim assistance and the US$25 million blocked reserves at the former Meridien Bank, minus foreign liabilities (defined below). The kwacha figures are derived from the U.S. dollar values using the program exchange rate of K 3,830 per U.S. dollar. 3. Foreign liabilities are defined as short-term (one year or less in original maturity) foreign currency-denominated liabilities of the BoZ to nonresidents and outstanding use of Fund credit.2 4. The ceilings on NDA will be adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall of balance of payments support net of debt service as indicated in Table 1 of the letter of intent, up to a maximum of US$45 million for the program year. External disbursements that occur- any time during the month of the test date will be treated as if they were disbursed on the first i Unless otherwise defined, program exchange rates for 2002 between the U.S. and other (non-kwacha) currencies, including the SDR, will be equal to the end-2001 rates. Any other assets (e.g. gold) would be revalued at end-2001 market price. 2 The liability to Camdex will continue to be treated as a short-term foreign liability of the BoZ. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - APPENDIX II day of the month.3 In the event of excess balance of payments support net of debt service, the ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the additional excess support. However, if part of the excess support is used to reduce treasury-bills held by commercial banks and the non-bank sector, then the programmed NDA will be adjusted upward by that amount. The kwacha value of the cumulative shortfall/excess will be calculated at the program exchange rate. 5. The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward/upward to reflect decreases/increases in the legal reserve requirements. The adjustor will be calculated as the percent change in the reserve requirement multiplied by the actual amount of reserves (kwacha and foreign currency denominated) at the end of the previous calendar month. 6. The ceiling on NDA will also be adjusted upward by a maximum of K 80 billion to reflect the government’s cash cost arising from the privatization of ZNCB. B. Net Bank Claims on Government (NCG) 7. as: NCG refers to the net banking system’s claims on Central government and is defined 6) the net position of the government with commercial banks, including: (i) treasury bills; (ii) bonds issued by the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ); (iii) loans and advances; less (iv) support to Meridien Bank (MBZ); and less (v) Central government deposits (defined to include account balances under the authority of controlling officers); plus (ii) BoZ holdings of GRZ statutory bonds; ordinary GRZ bonds; bonds in respect of loans to former parastatals; treasury bills on the trading portfolio of BoZ; treasury bills issued for interest on the BoZ foreign exchange bridging loan to GRZ; other government stock; and the BoZ Kwacha bridging loan to GRZ (including the GRZ’s revolving fund under the Fiscal Sustainability Credit), less government deposits at the BoZ; plus (iii) The BoZ foreign exchange bridging (forex) loan to the GRZ less donor suspense account balances. This will be calculated by taking the beginning period stock of the forex loan expressed in kwacha and then adding net external balance of payments support valued at current exchange rates. 8. The ceiling on the increase in NCG will be adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall in balance of payments support net of debt service as indicated in Table 1 of the 3 This implies that for purposes of monitoring the NDA, disbursements during the month of the test date will not be subject to averaging and the targeted NDA will be adjusted to reflect the full amount of the disbursement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - APPENDIX II letter of intent, up to a maximum of US$45 million for the program year. In the event of excess balance of payments support net of debt service, the ceiling on NCG will be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the additional excess support. However, if part of the excess support is used to reduce treasury-bills held by the non-bank sector, then the NCG would be adjusted upward by that amount. The kwacha value of the cumulative shortfall/excess will be converted at the program exchange rate. 9. The ceiling on NCG will also be adjusted upward by a maximum of K 80 billion to reflect the government’s cash cost arising from the privatization of ZNCB. Any bond issue in the context of ZNCB privatization will be excluded from NCG. 10. The data source for the above will be the “Net Claims on Government Table” produced by BoZ Economics Department, submitted on a weekly basis, and reconciled with the monetary survey. C. Gross International Reserves of the BOZ 11. Unless otherwise noted here, gross international reserves of the BoZ will be defined as reserve assets of the Bank of Zambia (Appendix II, Table 2). Reserve assets are defined in the IMF BOP manual (gth edition) and elaborated in the reserve template of the Fund’s special data dissemination standards (SDDS). They exclude, for example, foreign assets not readily available to or controlled by the monetary authorities, and foreign currency claims on Zambia residents. 12. Gross international reserves consist of(i) monetary gold; (ii) foreign currency in cash; (iii) Unencumbered foreign currency deposits at non-resident banks; (iv) foreign securities and deposits; (v) SDR holdings and Zambia’s reserve position with the Fund; and (vi) balances in the BIS account related to debt service to Paris Club creditors. Gross reserves will exclude non-convertible currencies, pledged, swapped, or any encumbered reserves assets including but not limited to reserve assets used as collateral or guarantees for third party external liabilities, commercial banks reserve requirements in foreign currency, and will exclude the US$25 million deposit in Meridien Bank which is under liquidation, and the IMF’s interim assistance. 13. The floor on gross international reserves will be adjusted: (i) downward by the amount in U.S. dollars of the shortfall in balance of payments support net of debt service as indicated in Table 1 of the letter of intent, up to a maximum of US$45 million for the program year; (ii) upward by 100 percent of the cumulative excess balance of payments support net of debt service (iii) downward/upward for any shortfall/excess in the U.S. dollar value of disbursements from the IMF under the PRGF arrangement; and (iv) downward for any increase in BoZ short-term foreign currency denominated debt (to resident and nonresidents), using the definition of short-term debt below. 14. The floor on reserves will be adjusted downward by a maximum of US$21 million to reflect the government’s cash cost arising from the privatization of ZNCB.

For the purpose of this performance criterion, as well as those for external debt and arrears, valuation will be in U.S. dollars using the program exchange rates. 16. Data on gross international reserves including its components will be reported by the BoZ on a weekly and end-month basis. D. External Payment Arrears 17. Official external payment arrears are defined as the stock of external arrears on debt repayments by the central government and BoZ, except on debts subject to rescheduling. 18. Data on arrears are compiled jointly by the MoFNP and BoZ and will be reported by MoFNP on a quarterly basis. E. Official Medium- and Long-Term Concessional Debt 19. This is defined as all forms of official debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government and BoZ having a grant element of more than 40 percent, but excludes debts subject to rescheduling. This includes loans, supplier’s credits and leases, that constitute current, i.e. not contingent liabilities, which are created under a contractual arrangement or guarantee through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which require the government or BoZ to make one or more payment in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Under this definition, such debt includes arrears, penalties, and judiciary awarded damages arising from the failure to make payments under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt as specified above. The grant element is to be calculated by using currency-specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) reported by the OECD); for maturities of less than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on six-month averages of CIRRs, and for maturities longer than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on 1 O-year averages. Adjustment lending from the World Bank and IMF will be excluded. 20. The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit, is set out in Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), Point 9, as revised on August 24,200O (see Annex below). This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. 21. Detailed data on all new concessional and non-concessional debt contracted or guaranteed will be provided by MoFNP on a quarterly basis. F. Official External Short-Term Debt 22. This is defined as the outstanding stock of external debt (as defined above) with a maturity of less than one year contracted or guaranteed by the central government, and BoZ. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - APPENDIX II For this purpose short term debt will include forward commodity sales but will exclude normal trade credit for imports. There will be no new official external short-term debt during the program period. 23. The data will be reported by the MoFNP and BoZ on a quarterly basis. G. Collateralizing/Guaranteeing of Loans to ZESCO and ZNOC 24. The government and the Bank of Zambia shall not extend or guarantee any new debts to ZESCO or ZNOC, including in the form of loans, suppliers credits and loans. H. Domestic Arrears of Government 25. Domestic arrears are defined as: (i) any bill that has been received by a spending Ministry from a supplier for goods and services delivered (and verified) and for which payment has not been made within 30 days; (ii) wage and salary arrears that were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 1 5’h of the following month; and (iii) interest or principal obligations which remain unpaid 30 days after the due date of payment. 26. The information is to be compiled through audits of the accounts of spending Ministries and agencies, conducted by the Internal Audit division of MoFNP. The audits will be completed and data submitted to Fund staff by the Commitments Monitoring Unit within 6 weeks of the end of each quarter. III. STRUCTURALPERFORMANCECRITERIAANDBENCHMARKS A. Monthly Revenue and Expenditure Reports 27. The Central Computer Services Department (CCSD) shall process monthly FMS reports from the line ministries, so as to enable the Accountant General to submit a consolidated summary of monthly government expenditure, along with revenue collections, to the Secretary to the Treasury (ST) as a management tool. This report should show expenditure by subhead for each spending agency, and should also include a summary for government as a whole. The report should be published, along with data on cash releases, with a lag of less than two months, either on the government’s website or in Macroeconomic Indicator-s. As the quality of the Monthly Expenditure Returns improve--or, alternatively, as the FMS reports are modified to include more information-additional data on commitments and arrears shall be included in the report. B. Database on Domestic Arrears 28. The Controller, Internal Audit shall, using the results of quarterly audits of arrears at spending agencies, construct a database containing records for each individual unpaid bill Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 69 - APPENDIX II owed by government. Once constructed, this database will allow the Ministry of Finance to hold line ministries accountable for their requests for funds for arrears clearance. Such requests must identify the particular arrears to be cleared, and the corresponding records in the database will be deleted upon verification from the line ministry. C. Submission of Audited Government Accounts 29. “Accounts for 2001” are defined as the 2001 annual financial statements, as prescribed in the Finance Act and Regulations thereunder. “Timely preparation of final audited accounts as required by law” is taken to mean that the Auditor General will audit the accounts for 2001 in sufficient time to allow the Minister of Finance to present the Financial Report to Parliament within twelve months of the end of the year, i.e., by December 2002. D. Procurement of Hardware and Software for IFMIS 30. Once the long-term IFMIS consulting firm is in place, it will help design the hardware and software requirements for the process. Procurement of hardware and software should commence-i.e., tender documents should be issued-by December 2002. E. HIPC Reporting 31. The benchmark on publishing an annual report on the use of HIPC debt savings during 2001 and allocations for 2002, will be met following the publication of a report detailing: (i) debt relief received during 2001 and the amounts credited to the MoFNP account 49 at the BoZ; (ii) programs to which HIPC resources were allocated in the budget during 2001, together with the amounts allocated from the non-HIPC budget to these programs; (iii) cash releases to line ministries and expenditures for these programs; (iv) progress with public monitoring of HIPC resources, and any other related activities (e.g. training workshops, dissemination); and (v) the list of programs to receive HIPC resources for 2002. F. Privatization of Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) 32. The performance criteria on the privatization of the ZNCB will be met on the day the Zambia Privatization Agency (or other designated agency): advertises the sale of at least 5 1 percent of ZNCB along with the relevant terms and conditions in national and international newspapers/newsweeklies. 33. The benchmark on the appointment of the negotiating team will be met on the day the ZPA Board appoints a negotiating team with full authority to negotiate a contract for sale and related matters consistent with existing rules and practices. 34. The benchmark on the evaluation of bids and approval of negotiations and final sale contract will be met on the day the ZPA Board formally concludes the evaluation of bids and approves negotiations and final sales contract with the successful bidder.

The benchmark and performance criteria on streamlining and consolidating the BoZ’s existing mechanisms for financing government operations to comprise three elements: an overdraft facility with the BoZ; treasury bills and treasury bonds, will be met once the following three steps are completed: (9 The joint task force comprising MoFNP and BoZ staff submits its proposals on the modalities and timetable for streamlining and consolidating government accounts (along the lines indicated above) to the authorities in MoFNP and the BoZ. (ii) The MoFNP and the BoZ authorities formally decide on a strategy (mode and timing of streamlining and consolidating the accounts) and a decision is communicated in writing to all concerned officials. (iii) The revised system becomes operational and the BoZ issues the first weekly/monthly report indicating the position of all government accounts in the BoZ under the new system. H. Abstention from Tax Reductions and Other Measures 36. The government shall refrain from introducing any additional tax exemptions beyond those already included in the 2002 budget and all expiring tax exemptions will be allowed to lapse. The zero-rating for VAT for hotel accommodation in the Livingstone area is carried over until end-2002. 37. The benchmark will be met when a hiring freeze is implemented throughout the government sector (including the Ministry of Defense and other payrolls recently moved to MoFNP), so that the headcount in each grade stays at or below the end-August 2002 level. Thus new hiring will only be permitted to offset reductions due to other reasons. Hiring teachers, doctors, and nurses will not be covered by the benchmark.

(a> For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i> loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Zambia is subject to transitional procedures with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on March 25, 1999, which is scheduled to expire on March 28,2003. The transitional procedure requires a review of only the Bank of Zambia’s external audit mechanism. This assessment determines whether the Bank of Zambia publishes annual financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with internationally accepted standards. The external audit assessment was completed on July 2,200l. The assessment concluded that Bank of Zambia’s audit mechanism was adequate, as reported in EBS/O1/178 (10/24/01). i NPV terms at the decisions point under the enhanced framework. 2 Including an additional grant contribution of SDR 16.4 million by the Netherlands to Zambia in the context of the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 3 The amount applied against Zambia’s obligations includes interest income earned on resources while in Zambia’s subaccount within the Umbrella Account for HIPC Operations.

The official exchange rate quoted by the central bank is the marginal rate determined by auction at the Bank of Zambia’s wholesale foreign exchange window. Since end-March 200 1, business entities selling foreign exchange amounting to US$lOO,OO or more per week have been required to transact through auctions arranged by the Bank of Zambia. On the basis of the bids and offers received, as well as other considerations, the Bank of Zambia determines the amount of foreign exchange to be sold to, or purchased from, the market. On September 30,2002, the Bank of Zambia mid-rate was K 4,557.2 per U.S. dollar. On April 19, 2002, Zambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2,3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. However, the Fund urged the authorities to eliminate the exchange restriction evidenced by the accumulation of external payments arrears and the multiple currency practice arising from the spreads between the dealing window rate and the interbank rate, which are subject to approval by the Fund under Article VIII, as soon as possible. X. Article IV Consultations: Zambia will be on the standard 24-month Article IV consultation cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15,2002. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on November 7,200l. XI. FSAP Participation and ROSC: Zambia has agreed to participate in FSAP and an FSAP mission from the Fund and the World Bank is planned for 2002 to conduct a comprehensive external assessment of the financial system. The first FSAP mission visited Zambia during April 30-May 15,2002. The Zambian authorities have agreed to the preparation of a fiscal transparency module of a ROSC assessing compliance with the IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency-Declaration of Principles. Based on the findings of a mission that visited Zambia during May 23-June 5,2001, the fiscal module of the ROSC was issued to the Executive Board on October 3 1,200 1 (SM/O1/325). XII.

They noted that all the structural performance criteria and most of the program’s quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks were observed. However, they were disappointed by fiscal slippages in the fourth quarter of 200 1, notably the overrun in wages and domestic capital spending in the nm-up to elections in December 200 1. They, therefore, urged the authorities to implement strictly the fiscal policies agreed under the program. Directors also noted the considerable shortfall in donor budget support. Under these circumstances, timely disbursement by donors of pledged assistance will be important, and Zambia, for its part, must help make this possible, including by meeting all conditionality. This would help to avoid destabilizing the macroeconomic situation and compressing social sector spending. Directors took serious note of the potential and imminent threat of the regional drought on Zambia’s economic prospects in the period ahead, which will require assistance from the international community and needs to be kept under close review. Looking ahead, Directors expressed concern about Zambia’s economic and financial prospects following the announcement by Anglo-American plc that it would discontinue funding its mining operations in Zambia. In view of this development, Zambia needs to redouble its efforts to sustain recent gains in macroeconomic stability and growth. They endorsed the authorities’ firm commitment not to take over ownership of the mines and to find a financially viable solution consistent with sound government finances. The importance of finding a new strategic investor for the mines was underscored. They also noted that these developments underline the need to diversify the economy. In addition to maintaining macroeconomic stability, this will require accelerating structural reform, investing in productive infrastructure and human capital, and improving governance. In this context, they welcomed the recent re-advertisement inviting bids for an increase in the sale of the Zambia National Commercial Bank shares to 5 1 percent (a performance criterion under the 2002 program) and urged the authorities to conclude the sale as rapidly as possible, in order to improve financial sector efficiency and protect the public finances. They also emphasized the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 79 - APPENDIX III need to take decisive steps to improve transparency and governance in order to enhance business confidence and create an enabling environment for investment and growth. Directors stressed the critical importance of strictly adhering to the 2002 budget targets and maintaining an appropriately tight monetary policy to achieve the inflation target. Several Directors noted the increase in the stock of domestic debt and accompanying rise in interest payments, and stressed the importance of ambitious fiscal adjustment in the medium term to avoid a debt trap and to reduce real interest rates. Directors observed with satisfaction the increased allocation of public expenditure towards the social and economic sectors, consistent with Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) priorities. They also stressed the importance of implementing the plans to strengthen expenditure management. Directors endorsed the program for 2002 and approved augmentation of access under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program by 5 percent of quota. In view of the corrective steps taken by the authorities to date, including adoption of the 2002 budget consistent with program framework, they granted waivers for the nonobservance of the end- September 2001 performance criterion on domestic arrears and the end-December 2001 performance criteria on net domestic assets of the Bank of Zambia, net bank claims on government, gross international reserves, and nonaccumulation of external payments arrears. Consequently, Directors completed the fourth review of the PRGF program. They underscored the need for strong program ownership and improved program monitoring and implementation. In approving the extension of interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, Directors urged the authorities to further strengthen implementation and tracking of expenditure in order to ensure that HIPC debt relief will be used effectively. They welcomed the completion of a full participatory PRSP, including a poverty reduction strategy, which lays the foundation for future concessional assistance from the Fund. They urged the authorities to implement the key PRSP recommendations as well as other conditions for reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, especially those relating to increasing the amount and improving the quality of social sector expenditure.

Currently disbursing are 12 IDA projects (see table below). World Bank operations have supported all the main sectors in the economy. The main elements of the Bank’s strategy are to support efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability and sustainable and equitable growth; ensure sufficient access to imports and an adequate reserve cushion through maintenance of an appropriate exchange rate and other measures to encourage exports; improve the climate for private sector development through deregulation, provision of infrastructure, and privatization of parastatals; strengthen human resource capacity by rehabilitating the education and health infrastructure and improving the quality of education and health services; implement an effective environmental strategy; and mobilize external resources to support the country’s adjustment program.

While the new Government has stated that it remains committed to the privatization process, some of its recent announcements indicate possible policy reversals. The companies that have to be privatized in the near future include Zambia Railways (ZR concession); Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) (concession); Ndola Lime (sale to private sector operator); Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZANACO) (public sector share sale); and the oil sector institutions of Indeni refinery (public share sale), Tazama Pipelines (concession), and Ndola Storage tanks (private management)“. Most of these commitments center around the Bank adjustment credit (Fiscal Sustainability Credit) or investment operations (ZR Project and Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion Technical Assistance- ERIPTA) or as triggers for the HIPC completion point requirements (ZESCO, ZANACO). ZESCO: Restructuring and issuance of international bidding documents for the sale of a majority (controlling) interest in the power company, ZESCO is one of the triggers for Zambia to reach a floating completion point for HIPC, expected by end 2003. There have been conflicting signals on the privatization process of ZESCO recently. Under the previous administration, the Cabinet approved concession as preferred option for privatizing ZESCO and the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) was duly instructed to commence necessary preparations (which included obtaining no objection from the Bank supported ERIPTA to start necessary studies on the concession process). The new Minister of Energy has been quoted in the press that the matter of ZESCO privatization has been referred back to the new Cabinet. ZPA has, meanwhile, not been issued with new instructions by the Government and is therefore proceeding on the basis of the earlier concession decision and expects to advertise the ZESCO concession by October 2003. The Government needs to make a decision by October 30,2002 on a road map and time bound intermediate steps to implement ZESCO privatization/concession. ZANACO: National Commercial Bank privatization has also been slow. ZPA has sent information fliers to potential bidders to pre-qualify and start the necessary due diligence work on ZANACO. The response so far has been positive and ZPA Board will initiate negotiations with preferred bidder by November 2002. NDOLA LIME: The delayed privatization of this firm seems to be reaching its final conclusion. Bids are expected by 30 October 2002 and ZPA has so far received 6 tenders. ZAMBIA RAILWAYS LIMITED: The Government needs to sign the Concession Agreement with the preferred bidder in order for the bidder to take over the operations and management of 4 The Zambia National Oil Company (ZNOC) that is currently being liquidated owns Ndola Fuel Storage Tanks. The Storage Tanks are being sold by the liquidator to raise necessary resources to pay ZNOC creditors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 82 - APPENDIX IV the railways as early as possible. Currently, the Concession Agreement, finalized after a lengthy concessioning process and difficult and complex negotiations between the Government and the preferred bidder, is waiting for the approval of the Attorney General. The Agreement was first sent to the Attorney General on August 16,2002 and after incorporating his comments, was sent back to him on September 12,2002. There are indications that the Government is having second thoughts on this issue. OIL SECTOR COMPANIES: Under the Fiscal Sustainability Credit, the Government agreed to offer for sale a majority controlling interest in the INDENI refinery, TAZAMA pipeline, and the Ndola storage tank, in addition to liberalizing imports and retail prices of petroleum products and limiting the role of ZNOC to managing strategic reserves. Until June 2002, the Government had made good progress in all areas. On the basis of this progress, the Bank released the last tranche of the FSC in June 2002. INDENI REFINERY: In June 2002, the Government reduced its shareholding in INDENI, which is jointly owned by the Government and Total Elf Aquitaine (TFE), from 50% to 45%, and, after TFE’s waiver of the preemptive rights, offered these shares to the Zambia Privatization Trust Fund (ZPTF) for floatation to enable wider Zambian participation. However, the relationship between GRZ and TFE on INDENI has deteriorated. GRZ believes that TFE has exhibited monopolistic practices in the procurement and distribution of petroleum products but TFE feels that the current Government wants to renege on the deal it had reached with the previous administration. In August 2002, the Government wrote to TFE to the effect that the Government would like to take full control of the INDENI and offered to purchase TFE’s shares in INDENI, preferably at the price TFE paid to AGIP, so that the Government could assume control of the refinery management. TFE’s counteroffer in September was that it would reduce its shares in INDENI to 35% provided the Government does the same and that other oil marketing companies (OMCs) be allowed to obtain some stake in the company. Currently negotiations between GRZ and TFE are going on. TAZAMA PIPELINE: ZPA is proceeding with the concessioning process. Bidding documents for the concession of the pipeline have been issued and public notice to that effect had been published. The Governments of Tanzania and Zambia have set up a joint technical committee to co-ordinate the implementation of the concession process. NDOLA TERMINAL: The Ndola Fuel terminal is part of the assets of ZNOC that is currently under liquidation and the terminal will be transferred to the private sector.

Zambia’s GDDS metadata has been finalized and posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The present arrangements for the compilation of macroeconomic statistics involve duplication of effort and insufficient coordination among the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Statistical Office (CSO). The situation largely reflects resource constraints and organizational weakness within the CSO that have affected its ability to produce economic statistics on a timely basis. Real sector An IMF/DFID GDDS mission visited Lusaka from June 24 to July 5 to provide technical assistance to the CSO on national accounts, focusing on improving the source data (surveys); introducing the phased implementation of the 1993 Systems National Accounts (SNA); and in developing quarterly GDP estimates. The mission’s main findings are summarized below. The CSO has been compiling and disseminating annual national accounts estimates, using both the production and expenditure approaches, since its inception. The national accounts estimates are compiled according to the conceptual guidelines of the 1968 SNA, but a phased approach to the introduction of the 1993 SNA is planned. Currently, the estimates are released on the basis of a well-established schedule and cover, on the production side, 11 industry groups and 23 subgroups, and, on the expenditure side, the 6 main components, at both constant and current prices. For the production approach, 1994 is the latest benchmark year for value-added ratios. For many important industry areas, such as wholesale and retail trade, construction, business services and many other service industries consisting mainly of small- scale private service providers, there are no appropriate indicators. The data that are currently available are mostly quarterly volume or quantity indicators of production. These are used in the construction of quarterly indicators of GDP by economic activity/industry at constant prices. Data that would permit the compilation of the more comprehensive annual levels, such as data on total production and intermediate consumption of establishments, are not available. On the expenditure side, there are no current indicators of household consumption, and private final consumption expenditure is derived residually. Source data to estimate gross fixed capital formation and changes in stocks are incomplete. Current price estimates for both the production and the expenditure sides are derived from the constant price indicators by using wholesale price indices (WPIs) and consumer price indices (CPIs) as inflators. For the most recent period, the WPI was no longer available and the CPI components were used throughout the system. The basic source data for the national accounts estimates have been rapidly eroding in recent years, at the same time as major structural changes have occurred in the economy. This lack of adequate data to support the national accounts has, increasingly, placed the quality of the GDP estimates in serious jeopardy. Moreover, even some major methodological Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 84 - APPENDIX V improvements within national accounts, such as the adoption of the commodity flow approach to estimate some of the aggregates, have not been adopted. Further, the CSO has not used the results of the input-output table constructed for the period 1994-1999, to improve the estimation process. The authorities’ plan to implement the economic census project for 2002 constitutes a major breakthrough in the development of source data for the national accounts. Government finance Zambia has resumed compilation of government finance statistics (GFS) data, and it appears that the quality of the reported data has improved; Zambia’s GFS data have been updated to 1998 for final data and to 1999 for forecast data. However, the coverage of the data for 1989- 99 is limited to budgetary central government. The authorities report monthly budget data for the Fund’s operational use in a timely manner. However, data are often subject to substantial revisions later in the year. No monthly or quarterly fiscal data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (rFs). Local government fiscal data are not available. Monetary accounts There has been progress made in the compilation of monetary statistics, and the monetary survey is published on a monthly basis. The BoZ has also eliminated discrepancies between its own records of IMF accounts and data from the Treasurer’s Department of the IMF. Nonetheless, additional work is needed on monetary statistics. In particular, the BoZ needs to reconcile its data on government deposits and credit to government reported by banks with the information received by the Accountant General. Also, further improvements in accounting procedures and computerization are desirable to ensure that transactions and balances in foreign currencies are properly valued. The lag in the compilation of monetary statistics has increased owing to technical problems in the BoZ computer system. Although the BoZ authorities have indicated that they are addressing the problem, reporting to STA continues to be very irregular. The latest data received by STA for monetary authorities and other depository corporations are for the month of May 2002. Balance of payments In May, 2000 a STA mission found compilation of data imports, exports, and foreign direct investment to be inadequate and made a number of recommendations to improve the coverage of the data. Since then, the authorities have prepared a work plan to implement the recommendations of the mission, and some improvements have been made in the coverage of the customs data and the methodology for compiling some balance of payments components.
