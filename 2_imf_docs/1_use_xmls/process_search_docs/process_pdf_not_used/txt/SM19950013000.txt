Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Dominica were held in Roseau during March 22-April 6, 1995. The representatives of Dominica included Prime Minister Charles (who is also Minister of Finance); other members of the Cabinet; the Financial Secretary and other senior officials; and representatives of the private sector. The staff representatives were Messrs. Gons (Head), Duffy, and Tokarick, Ms. Frantischek, (all WHD), Mr. Backes (EP-TRE), and Ms. Aquino (Assistant-WHD). An economist from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and from the Caribbean Development Bank worked closely with the mission. Mr. Rainford, Advisor to the Executive Director for Dominica, participated in the final discussions. The discussions took place against the background of a prospective change in political leadership. Parliamentary elections will be held on June 12, and Prime Minister Charles, who has been in office since 1980, has chosen not to run for re-election. Dominica is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, and the previous Article IV consultation was concluded on June 15, 1994 (EBM/94/53). Executive Directors emphasized the need to increase public savings to finance higher levels of public investment, while avoiding borrowing on commercial terms and the accumulation of arrears. Directors also noted that in light of the reduction in Dominica's preferential access to the European banana market, there was a need to raise productivity in the banana industry and broaden Dominica's economic base. Dominica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Dominica's relations with the Fund are described in Appendix I. Statistical information on Dominica generally has been obtained during missions, except for consumer prices and monetary statistics which have been provided on a monthly basis with a lag of up to three months. I/ During the mission, it was agreed that the authorities will provide quarterly information on fiscal developments. The authorities noted that the Central Statistical Office (CSO) was seriously understaffed and was facing increas- ing difficulties in producing reliable and timely statistics, particularly in the areas of price, national accounts, and balance of payments data. The staff is examining the possibility of technical assistance for the CSO. 1/ .Appendix III provides a summary of statistical issues.

Backnround Dominica's output (and exports are concentrated in agriculture (mainly bananas), and to a lesser extent manufacturing (mainly soap). Because of its narrow agricultural base, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and tropical storms. In the absence of an international airport, adequate hotel accommodations, and attractive beaches, tourism has not developed to the same extent as in other Caribbean countries. Dominica shares a common currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar) and a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) with seven neighboring states and territories. The E.C. Idollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. Real GDP growth slowed from an average of 5 percent a year in 1986-90 to about 2.5 percent a Iyear in 1991-93 (Table 1 and Chart 1). The slowdown mainly reflected stagnation in banana output related to uncertainty about continued preferential iaccess to the U.K.. banana market, depressed export prices, and the depreciation of the pound sterling. I/ In addition, there was a substantial drop in public savings associated with large increases in the public sector wage bill and a deterioration in the finances of the banana marketing board that weakened investor and creditor confidence and forced a cutback in public investment. Output growth slowed further to 1 percent in 1994, reflecting a significant reduction in banana production following a drought early in the year and a tropical storm in September, which was only partially offset by growth in tourism and construction. Sluggish economic growth in 1991-94 was accompanied by moderate private sector wage increases, and the rate of inflation decelerated from more than 6 percent in 1991 to about 1.5 percent in 1993-94. The rate of unemployment rose from about 10 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 1994. However, employ- ers in both agriculture and manufacturing reported difficulties in attract- ing workers at going wage rates, which suggests that unemployment is partly of a structural nature. The finances of the consolidated public sector weakened considerably in the early 199Os, as reflected in ,a drop in public savings from an aver- age of 3.8 percent of GDP in FY 1990,/91 and FY 1991/92 to almost zero in u Before July 1, 1993 Dominica's banana exports enjoyed preferential access to the U.K. market. Effective that date, the European Union estab- lished a system of quotas and tariffs on its banana imports. Suppliers from African, Pacific, and Caribbean (ACP) countries received quotas based on their highest export levels of recent years, and pay no import duties. Dominica's quota is 71,000 metric tons. Non-ACP countries' banana exports to the European Union also are subject to quotas, but with an import duty of ECU 75 per ton. Although still enjolying preferential access, Dominica now must compete with suppliers that operate at lower costs and can compete in the market despite the applicable import duty.

Current revenue of the Central Government declined owing to the sus- pension of the banana export levy in 1992 and a decline in corporate income tax receipts associated with slower GDP growth. Meanwhile, current expen- diture rose by about 2 percentage points of GDP as a result of both a gen- eral salary increase and a restructuring of civil service salaries under the Administrative Reform Program (ARP). This program, which was initiated in 1987, seeks to achieve a net reduction in the civil service wage bill through a streamlining of public sector employment that would more than offset the cost of a restructuring in salaries. However, through FY 1993/94 the size of the civil service had increased rather than declined. In the rest of the public sector, the surpluses of the Dominica Social Security Scheme (DSS) declined from 2.5 percent of GDP in FY 1990/91 to 2.1 percent of GDP in FY 1993/94 as growth in its expenditures outpaced that of contributions. The current balance of the Dominica Banana Marketing Corporation (DBMC) moved from approximate equilibrium in FY 1990/91 to a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in FY 1992/93, but improved somewhat in the following year as banana prices began to recover. The mission's estimates indicate a rise in public sector savings to 2.5 percent of GDP in FY 1994/95. However, public investment was expected to more than double to almost 15 percent of GDP, and the overall public sector deficit (before grants) was projected to rise from 6.3 percent of GDP in FY 1993/94 to 12 percent of GDP in FY 1994/95, resulting in continued recourse to commercial borrowing and arrears accumulation. Central government dissavings are projected to decline from 1.8 per- cent of GDP in 1993/94 to 0.3 percent of GDP in FY 1994/95. While most of the revenue measures that had been envisaged in the budget have not been implemented, the authorities have reduced the size of the civil service through attrition by about 8 percent and have contained expenditure on goods and services. Thus far, no general wage increase has been granted in FY 1994/95. The DSS surplus would continue to shrink while the finances of the DBMC were projected to strengthen further as banana prices have contin- ued to rise somewhat and measures to improve its efficiency are beginning to yield results. These measures include staff reductions, shifting certain activities (e.g., spraying) to the private sector, and improving cost recovery. The sharp increase in public investment in FY 1994/95 reflects the bunching of two large projects (a cruise-ship jetty and a fish-landing site). About 50 percent of the value of all projects would be financed by grants (an historically high proportion). Public investment also includes 1/ Fiscal year starts on July 1.

Broad money increased by 4 percent in 1994 after remaining practically unchanged the year before (Table 3). Net credit to the nonfinancial public sector increased by about 14 percent in 1994 (compared with 2.5 percent in 1993). Meanwhile, the growth of credit to the private sector declined from about 10 percent in 1993 to 8 percent in 1994, reflecting the slowdown in activity. Interest rates ton bank deposits of up to six months rose from 4 percent in 1993 to 5 percent in 1994, while lending rates remained in the 9-15.5 percent range. As in 1993, commercial banks funded part-of the increase in credit by exte:rnal borrowing. The E.C. dollar depreciated in real effective terms by 6.5 percent in 1994 (as measured for Dominica), following a real appreciation of 16.6 per- cent in 1991-93 (Chart 2). The real depreciation in 1994 reflected the movement of the U.S. dolla:r against other major currencies. The balance of payments shifted into deficit in 1993 and weakened further in 1994. The current account deficf_t increased from 10.7 percent of GDP in 1993 to 12 percent of GDP in 1994, as a decline in the volume of banana exports was offset only in part by increased travel receipts (Table 4). The surplus in the capital account declined slightly to about 9 percent of GDP in 1994. Dominica's net imputed international reserves dropped by USS5.4 million :in 1994 (2.6 percent of GDP) and at the end of the year amounted to 1.7 months of imports. After declining in the early 199Os, public external debt rose from 45 percent of GDP in 1993 to 47 percent of GDP in 1994, reflecting valuation changes related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies (Table 5). The debt-service ratio increased to over 7 percent in 1993, but declined somewhat in 1994, owing to a reduction in principal obligations. In 1992 Dominica started accumulating external payments arrears, and by end-1994 arrears had risen to about 3 percent of GDP. Roughly two thirds of external arrears related to fees and other membership obligations to international and region,al organizations. JJ III. Short-Term Outlook and Policv Discussions 1.

I/ Together with continued growth in tourism and construction, this would result in real GDP growth of 4-4.5 percent in 1995 and about 3 percent in 1996. Inflation is projected to remain low in 1995. The external current account deficit would decline to about 10.5 percent of GDP in 1995, reflecting the positive developments in the banana sector. The overall balance of payments is expected to be in surplus. The details of the 1995/96 budget will be determined after the June elections and the mission's projections are based on estimates for the outcome of FY 1994/95 and the assumption of maintenance of current policies. More specifically, it is assumed that no revenue measures would be intro- duced, that expenditure controls would be maintained, and that no general civil service wage increase would be granted. The DSS surplus would decline further to about 1.5 percent of GDP, and the DBMC and the other public enterprises would generate small surpluses. On this basis, public savings were projected to increase to 3.2 percent of GDP in FY 1995/96. Public investment would decline to 8.5 percent of GDP and the overall public sector deficit (before grants) would be 5 percent of GDP in FY 1995/96. External grants and loans were projected to amount to 6.7 percent of GDP, and there appeared to be scope for some arrears reduc- tion in FY 1995/96. 2. Policv discuss- The consultation discussions built on earlier discussions with the authorities about economic prospects and policy needs, including during a staff visit to Dominica in August 1994. In the view of the authorities, a growth rate of real GDP of at least 4 percent a year would be needed to reduce unemployment to acceptable levels and have an appreciable effect on living standards over the medium term. The staff estimated that on the basis of current policies the growth of investment and output after 1995 would fall short of the authorities' objectives. To accelerate economic growth in the context of low inflation, the authorities would need to raise public sector savings and investment, and undertake structural reforms. The authorities agreed with the mission that public fixed capital formation would need to be raised to about 11 percent of GDP to be consis- tent with real GDP growth of 4 percent. On the basis of present policies, public sector savings were projected to remain virtually unchanged at just u In the course of 1995, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia, through the recently established Windward Island Banana Development Company (WIBDECO), are expected to sign a new contract with GEEST, a banana-marketing firm in the United Kingdom. Under the new contract, Dominica will receive a higher percentage of the landed price of exports. Although some issues are still pending, since February 1995 the parties involved have been applying the terms and conditions of the framework agreement.

With net external inflows amounting to 4.5 percent of GDP over th,e medium term, achieving the targeted public investment level of 11 percent of GDP would require additional sav- ings of about 3.5 percent of GDP a year. a. Fiscal ~olicv The discussions on fiscal issues focused on the measures needed to generate these additional savings. Assuming the measures were in place by early 1996, their revenue effect for FY 1995/96 would be about 1.5 percent of GDP. Because it would not be possible to increase public investment quickly owing to technical and administrative constraints, at least part of the additional savings could be used for arrears reduction in FY 1995/96. In considering fiscal measures, the mission noted that Dominica's tax ratio was relatively high (23 percent), and that the authorities should focus first on the expenditure side, particularly on the continuation of the policy of attrition in the civil service. This policy, which could yield savings of 0.6 percent of GDP on an annual basis, would need to be supported by the reallocation of staff to keep key positions filled and the elimina- tion of certain positions as they become vacant. The mission urged the authorities to hold the line in wage negotiat- ions, in light of the generous increase that was granted as part of the salary regrading under the ARP in May 1994. Such restraint also would signal the need for wage restraint in the private sector and help preserve Dominica's external competitiveness. The mission also recommended a broadening of the retail sales tax to include services and a reduction in import duty exemptions (with a yield of 0.5 percent of GDP-each), and the introduction of user fees for health and education services, except for low-income groups (1.6 percent of GDP). Most of these measures had been proposed in the 1994/95 budget, but were not implemented. Also, to reduce water con.sumption and help finance much needed investment in water and sewage systems, the mission recommended an increase of up to 50 percent in the rates charged by the water and sewage company (0.5 percent of GDP). Finally, the mission stressed the need to address the problem of shrinking surpluses of the DSS. Although a recent actuarial study recommends an increase in contribution rates by 1997, earlier action may need to be considered. The mission urged the authorities to use the improvement in DBMC's financi.al position to reinstate the banana export levy and to ensure that its arrears to the Central Government are paLd. This in turn would permit the Central Government to reduce its own arrears. In addition, the mission noted that the sale of state-owned assets (e.g., shares in the National Commercial Bank and the electricity company) would be instrumental in eliminating arrears. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - The authorities were in broad agreement with the mission's assess- ment of the need to raise public saving and the recommendations on arrears reduction. However, they indicated that actions along these lines could only be taken by the Government that will assume office after the elections. b. Monetary policy Broad money growth is projected to accelerate to almost 14 percent in 1995, reflecting the growth in nominal GDP and the effects on financial savings of the recent sale of the soap manufacturing plant to a multina- tional company. With some reduction in net public sector credit, this would allow for an increase in credit to the private sector of about 12 percent and a buildup of net foreign assets of the banking system. The authorities believe that the monetary and exchange arrangements of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union have served Dominica well. Against this background, the discussions in the monetary area focused on certain regulations affecting financial intermediation. The mission noted that the current 4 percent floor on savings deposits potentially could distort the financial market and contribute to high lending rates by banks and suggested that this regulation be abolished. The authorities noted that this could only be done in a regional context through the ECCB. C. Structural ~oliciss The mission discussed the need to re-examine the tax system with a view to simplifying its structure, increasing its buoyancy, minimizing distor- tions, and providing incentives for private savings while increasing revenue collections. Also, the mission discussed procedures to ensure effective control of public expenditure and avoid duplication and waste. Detailed recommendations on these issues were made by the FAD technical assistance mission that visited Dominica after the mission. With regard to the strategy for modernizing and diversifying the econ- omy , the authorities are guided by the policies laid out in the Medium-Term Economic Strategy Paper that was prepared with the assistance of the World Bank. The recently initiated program to restructure the banana sector, with financial and technical assistance from the European Union, focuses on about 2,000 of the largest, more efficient farmers. The objective is to raise productivity, mainly through training and extension services, from the cur- rent level of 7 tons per acre to 12 tons by 2002. In that year the Lome Convention will expire and preferential access of Dominica's bananas in the European Union likely will be phased out. Approximately 4,000 marginal banana growers will be given incentives to switch to alternative crops. For producers and workers that cannot remain in agriculture, employment would need to be created in manufacturing and services, whLch underscores the need to create the conditions necessary for increased private investment. The authorities explained that the DBMC was to be converted into a private entity owned by farmers, possibly in FY 1995/96, in the context of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- a - regional efforts to modernize the banana industry. Consideration also was being given to contracting out certain public services to the private sector, e.g., garbage disposal and road repair. The mission noted that the purchase of shares in the foreign-owned telecommunications company could be interpreted as signalling a shift in policy toward increased government involvement in the economy. The authori- ties, while confirming their commitment to private sector led economic development, stressed that this acquisition was to ensure a role for Dominica in the fast-growing telecommunications industry. At a later stage, the Government and the foreign owner would reduce their holdings to allow the local private sector to participate in the company. The mission discussed ways to improve the functioning of the labor market and reduce structural unemployment. The authorities noted that they were taking steps to expand vocational training and increase labor mobility within the OECS. The authorities indicated that remaining price controls generally are applied liberally. The import-licensing regime covers only a limited number of items and is geared to favoring imports from other CARICOM countries. Quantitative restrictions apply to the imports of beverages, flowers, and margarine. A decision about a further reduction in the Common External Tariff awaits the recommendations of a study carried out by the OECS Secretariat. An indicative limit on foreign exchange for private travel remains in effect but bona fide requests for amounts in excess of this limit are approved without delay. Dominica's external arrears reflect insufficient domestic resources of the Dominican Government and one public entity that does not form part of the Government's budgetary process. They do not represent a direct govern- mental limitation on the availability or use of foreign exchange as such, and do not constitute evidence of the existence of exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval. d. ne environment Dominica does not have serious environmental problems. The authorities currently are LmplementLng a National EnvLronmental Action Plan, which seeks to address certain issues regarding solid waste disposal, land use and deforestation, and degradation of the coastal zone.

Bedium-Term Scenario The medium-term projections assume that Dominica will continue to benefit from preferential access to the E.U. banana market and that the restructuring of the banana industry will be implemented successfully. The baseline policy scenario assumes that no additional revenue measures are taken and that the size of the civil service remains unchanged from present levels. On this basis, nonfinancial public sector savings are projected to increase only marginally over the medium term. Public sector investment would decline to less than 8 percent of GDP by 1997 and stay at that level thereafter (Table 6). In the absence of specific measures to improve the investment climate, private sector investment would recover only gradually from its low levels in 1993-95 and then remain at about 18.5 percent of GDP. Efforts to broaden Dominica's economic base would be limited by lack of investment funds. On this basis, economic growth of about 2.5-3 percent a year is projected for the medium term and the unemployment rate would continue to rise. The external current account deficit is projected to remain at about 10.5 percent of GDP over the medium term. Net official capital inflows (including capital grants) would amount to about 4 percent of GDP a year, which would be in line with the general trend toward lower concessional aid flows, while private capital inflows also are projected to decline somewhat. The overall balance of payments would improve significantly in 1995 and then move gradually to a deficit position by 1998. An alternative scenario incorporates the effects of fiscal measures of 3.5 percent of GDP to increase public savings to 6.5-7 percent of GDP as recommended by the mission, as well as structural measures aimed at improv- ing the overall efficiency of the economy. Under this scenario, public investment would rise to about 11 percent of GDP, which in turn would foster higher private investment than in the baseline scenario. After dropping to 9 percent of GDP in 1996 (the year when most of the adjustment measures are assumed to be taken), private savings would recover steadily to more than 14 percent of GDP by 2000. The external current account deficit is pro- jected to be larger than in the baseline scenario in the early years of the projection period as the increase in nontraditional exports is expected to be more than offset by increased imports of capital goods. To finance part of private investment, private capital inflows would increase while official capital is assumed to remain unchanged. Under the alternative scenario, Dominica's economic base would broaden and real GDP growth would accelerate to 4-4.5 percent. The unemployment rate would decline gradually.

Staff Annraisal Since 1991 Dominica has experienced sluggish economic growth and a rise in the unemployment rate, reflecting stagnation in banana output as well as a substantial drop tn public sector savings and investment. Adverse weather conditions in 1994 nearly brought output growth to a halt. The authorities have aimed to restore economic growth by improving infrastructure, modernizing the banana industry, and broadening the economic base. The major obstacle to the attainment of these objectives has been the low level of national saving. Moreover, in line with worldwide trends, grants and concessional loans from abroad have tended to decline. In F'Y 1994/95 the authorities started to implement measures aimed at increasing public savings, mainly by reducing the size of the civil service through attrition. In addition, the fjinances of the Dominica Banana Marketing Corporation have improved, partly because of favorable exogenous market developments and partly because the authorities have moved decisively to increase its efficiency and improve cost recovery. The staff welcomes the actions that have been taken in the present election year, which have resulted in a significant increase in public savings. However, there has been a sharp increase in investment and the public sector has needed to seek further recourse to commercial bank bor- rowing and arrears accumulation. To lay the foundation for a sustainable high level of public investment which, in turn, could be expected to lead to increased private investment, the authorities will need to increase llomestic savings. The new Government that will be elected in June will have to face this task. The staff has recommended fiscal measures equivalent to about 3.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis. As the present tax ratio) is relatively high, priority should be given to continued efforts to control expenditure, especially through a reduction in the size of the civil service. In addition, the pursuit of public sector wage restraint will contribute to a stronger fiscal position and would have a positive effect in signalling the need to limit wage increases in the private sector. The authorities also should aim to reform the tax system with a view to making it more transparent, improving its administration, and broadening its base. The potential for these measures to raise revenue is considerable which, together with the introduction of user fees in health and education (except for low-income groups) and the expenditure-control measures indi- cated above, would constitute an appropriate package of measures to raise public saving. The authorities also need to address the trend of declining surpluses of the social security system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - Dominica has accumulated external and domestic arrears with a number of creditors. The staff urges the authorities to clear these arrears as soon as possible on the basis of fiscal measures included in the 1995/96 budget and through the use of proceeds from the sale of state-owned assets. On structural issues, the authorities will need to modernize Dominica's banana industry in light of the likely reduction of its preferential access in the E.U. banana market after the expiration of the Lome treaty in 2002. In this regard, the program to raise the productivity of the largest farmers with assistance from the European Union is key. The staff welcomes the intended conversion of the Dominica Banana Marketing Board into a private entity owned by farmers. To contribute to the economy's overall efficiency, the authorities should intensify their efforts to contract out certain public services to the private sector. In this context, the staff is concerned that the Government's recent purchase of shares in Dominica Telecommunications could be perceived as a shift toward an increased role for the public sector in the economy. The staff would encourage the authorities to eliminate remaining controls on prices and foreign trade. Effective Fund surveillance is hampered by the lack of economic data on a regular basis. However, the authorities recently indicated that they will provide quarterly data on fiscal developments, and the staff will continue to explore ways to improve the coverage and timeliness of economic data in Dominica, especially those concerning external developments and the national accounts.

Only the balance sheet of the consolidated commercial banks, the balance sheet of the Central Bank, and the consumer price index are provided on a regular basis, with a lag of about two to three months. Data on other key indicators, such as exports, imports, the current account, fiscal operations, and GDP are usually provided during missions. 1. Peal sector The latest real sector data reported to the Department of Statistics is for December 1992. Trade and national accounts data also are not current. Data on GDP (on a sectoral basis) are usually available with a lag of more than a year. Also, there are no official data on employment, producer prices, and wages in the private sector, and there are doubts about the accuracy of the consumer price index. 2. Government finance Dominica has fallen considerably behind in reporting government finance statistics. Some data on government finances were submitted by the authorities in 1993, but the data do not conform to the GFS methodology. The authorities have agreed in principle to provide data on central govern- ment revenue and expenditure (both current and capital), on a quarterly basis. Information on the performance of the public enterprises on a quar- terly basis has been requested. A major issue that needs to be addressed concerns the lack of consistency between data produced by the Ministry of Finance and the unit responsible for the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) data. 3. Balance of navments Balance of payments data for Dominica are provided by the ECCB during missions. Concerning data on external debt, the authorities have agreed to provide actual and projected debt figures on a quarterly basis. There is a major problem in obtaining current data on trade flows (exports and imports), which reflects technical difficulties in transferring information between the Customs Department and the Central Statistical Office.
