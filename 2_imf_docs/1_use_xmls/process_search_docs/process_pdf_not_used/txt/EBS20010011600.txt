The team met with Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra; Finance Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, then Bank of Thailand Governor M.R. Chatu Mongol Sonakul; and the new Governor M.R. Pridiyathom Devakula (then EXIM Bank President); Minister at the Office of the Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang; other senior government and central bank officials; representatives from research institutes, domestic and foreign financial institutions, and market participants; and with World Bank and AsDB staff. . The team comprised Messrs. Moghadam (Head), Schwartz, Haksar, Jonsson (all APD), Bamett (FAD), Hagan (LEG), Josefsson (MAE), and Giorgianni (Resident Representative). Mr. Djojosubroto and Ms. Manivat (both OED) also attended some of the meetings. Mr. Horiguchi visited Bangkok during May 2 l-23 to meet Prime Minister Thaksin and the new economic team. Mr. Shastry (EXR) joined the mission during May 2 l-24 to coordinate media contacts. Some members of the team had discussions with market participants in Singapore on May 8 to gauge reactions to the new government’s policies. D A 34-month, SDR 2.9 billion (268 percent of quota, equivalent to $4 billion) Stand-By Arrangement for Thailand expired on June 19,200O. The arrangement was part of a $17.2 billion official financing package from multilateral institutions and bilateral contributors ($14.3 billion of which was drawn). Outstanding obligations from the financing package amount to $12.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion is to the Fund. Scheduled repayments to the Fund began at the end of last year and have so far amounted to about $800 million (repayments to the bilateral creditors have also amounted to $800 million). l At the conclusion of the last Post-Program Monitoring Board discussion in December 2000, Directors urged the authorities to accelerate corporate debt and bank restructuring. They also agreed that supportive fiscal and monetary policies remained appropriate. 0 Thailand has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The 1999 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 12,200O. 0 Thailand’s statistical base is adequate to conduct effective surveillance. The provision of economic data, both to the Fund and the public, has improved markedly since the crisis. Data issues are discussed in Section IV and Annex V. 0 The staff report was prepared by a team led by Reza Moghadam and Stephen Schwartz.

INTRODUCTIONANDBACKGROUND 1. The Article IV consultation and Post-Program Monitoring discussions provided an opportunity to assess Thailand’s progress in sustaining its recovery from the crisis. . A supportive macroeconomic policy framework and, until recently, strong external demand, have fostered an economic recovery since late 1998. However, the recovery has been fragile, and is now threatened by the weakening global environment. Moreover, the recent decision to increase interest rates has created policy uncertainty that could undermine the recovery. Fiscal policy remains supportive of economic activity, but fiscal expansion needs to be balanced against market concerns regarding public debt, which has increased substantially since the crisis. . Progress in financial sector reform has been undermined by the slow pace and questionable quality of corporate debt restructuring. The highly leveraged corporate sector, and concerns about bank profitability and capital adequacy, have weighed heavily on confidence, especially in view of the weakening recovery. In this regard, a key question is whether the newly established Thai Asset Management Corporation (TAMC) can catalyze corporate debt restructuring. . External vulnerability has been substantially reduced since the crisis. Total external debt, especially short-term, has declined, and reserves remain comfortable. Nevertheless, risks remain. In particular, a further slowdown in world growth could undermine the recovery, persistent weakness in regional currencies could exacerbate pressures on the baht, and large repayments of the financing package will dent reserves. 2. The discussions also provided an opportunity to establish a substantive policy dialogue with the new government. . Having won a commanding majority in January’s Parliamentary elections, the new government has come to office with a strong electoral mandate. The new government’s campaign rhetoric, and some of its policy statements since then, have generated market concerns about isolationist policies and financial discipline. In response, the authorities have emphasized fiscal prudence and have softened some of their campaign promises. . Prime Minister Thaksin is fully engaged in economic policy-making, and has already demonstrated an ability to act decisively and with speed. However, the dismissal of BOT Governor Chatu Mongol in late May, following a dispute on the direction of monetary policy, has undermined BOT independence and added to policy uncertainty. . The Constitutional Court is in the final stages of hearing the case against Mr. Thaksin for failure to disclose fully his assets during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister in 1997. If found in breach of the Constitution, Mr. Thaksin, who enjoys considerable public support, could be barred from office. This has led to political uncertainty, and has further undermined confidence.

Four years after the onset of the crisis, the recovery remains fragile (Figure 1 and Table 1). While real GDP grew by 4% percent for the second consecutive year in 2000, the rebound from the steep output decline of 1997-98 has been much weaker than for other countries in the region, notably Korea (Text Figures). In Thailand-where the output decline began much earlier-GDP has yet to recover to pm-crisis levels. This reflects in part the extent of the initial imbalances in Thailand, where the current account deficit, asset price bubble, and degree of over-investment, were all large in the lead-up to the crisis. It also reflects the sluggish return of consumer and investor confidence, ongoing political uncertainty, and the unfinished reform agenda, especially the need to accelerate corporate debt and bank restructuring. 130 Real GDP Levels tz5 @zzwnally adjusted, 1996=100) 120 - 115 80 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I , 8o 199741 199891 199991 ZOOOQl 2001Ql 15 10 5 0 -5 -10 -1s hnual GDP Growth 2001 bawd on WE0 pmjectio 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 4. The recovery was led, until recently, by rapid export growth, while the revival of domestic demand has been weaker. Driven by strong external demand, exports in 2000 surged by nearly 20 percent in U.S. dollar terms. The growth of exports was led by “high-tech” products (including computer parts, electrical products, and vehicles), which account for almost two-thirds of total exports.

With external demand now weakening, export growth has fallen sharply since the end of 2000, in line with trends elsewhere in the region (Text Figure). In the first four months of the year, exportsfiZZ by almost 3 percent in U.S. dollar terms (year-on-year). While nearly all export categories have weakened (with the exception of the auto sector), electronics, computer parts, and garments have been particularly hard hit. The slowdown has been especially pronounced to the U.S., while exports to the EU and, surprisingly, Japan, have performed somewhat better. 6. With the decline in exports, output growth is weakening (Text Figure). Recently released data show that four-quarter GDP growth slowed to 1% percent during the first quarter of 200 1 (seasonally adjusted quarterly growth was in fact negative % percent during the first quarter). In addition to the fall in net exports, domestic demand has weakened, with both private consumption and investment declining in the first quarter (seasonally adjusted basis). Capacity utilization averaged only 55 percent through the first five months of 2001, still well below its pm-crisis average of 75 percent. 7. The recent rise in domestic bond yields reveals market concern about the direction of policy. After having fallen steadily for over 18 months, bond yields began shifting upward in late February, due partly to a correction after the previous steep fall in yields, but also because of rising market concerns about future debt levels (Text Figure). The upward shift accelerated at the end of May-bond yields rose by 80-140 basis points-with the dismissal of the BOT Governor, and the reorientation of monetary policy toward a tighter stance. ’ 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 39ql 99q2 99q3 99q4 OOql oOq2 0093 oOq4 Olql 10 5 0 -5 -10 -15 Real GDP Growth, 1997ql-2OOlql (Pment change) - -5 -10 I - ’ -1s 97ql 97q3 98ql 98q3 99ql 99q3 OOql oOq3 Olql 9 I I 9 Government Bond Yields, September 1999-2001 June t- b i8 1 9115199 lZlSl99 3IlSIOO 6/15/00 9/15/00 L?/lS/OO 3/15/01 6/15/01 ’ Sovereign spreads are low and have moved in a relatively narrow range (150-l 80 basis points) since early 2000. However, as Thailand does not rely on external bond financing, the sovereign bond market is very thin, and market participants generally believe that any new issue would carry a much larger premium.

Fragile market sentiment has also been reflected in a weakening of the baht since mid-2000 (Figure 2 and Table 2). Political uncertainty ahead of the elections was a key factor contributing to the weakness of the baht. However, fundamental factors have also been at work, including persistent portfolio outflows and ongoing prepayment of external debt in view 110 110 of the relatively low domestic interest rates. Exchange Ftate Developments (Jan 1,2001= 100, increase denotes appreciation) The depreciation against the dollar accelerated ,05 _ - 105 during March/April of this year (bringing the Nominal Effective baht to its lowest value against the dollar in over two years), but this largely reflected 100 movements in regional currencies (particularly the yen), and the nominal 95 - effective exchange rate has been broadly stable throughout the first half of 2001 (Text Baht per dollar Figure). The BOT has thus far largely 9. ’ 90 h.Ol Fcbm MC0, *pr-ot Mi%py-Ol hat M-01 refrained from intervening to support the baht, allowing the currency to float freely. 9. The depreciation of the baht has led the authorities to step up enforcement of existing capital controls (Box 1). Following a series of “clarifications” issued since 1999, the authorities have imposed stricter reporting requirements (since August last year), as well as fines on financial institutions found to be violating baht lending limits to nonresidents without an underlying transaction (B 50 million, about $1.1 million, per counter part~).~ 10. With large current account surpluses facilitating a reduction in external debt and rebuilding of reserves, Thailand’s external vulnerability has been much reduced (see Section IIIA below). The current account surplus amounted to 7% percent of GDP in 2000 (compared to a little over 10 percent in 1999), and would have been larger were it not for the relatively high level of oil prices (Figure 3 and Table 3). The current account surplus has narrowed with the slowdown in exports during the first quarter, but is still positive. Such surpluses have facilitated a payoff of private sector external debt over the past few years, particularly short-term. At present levels, reserves are more than adequate to cover the stock of short-term debt (on a residual maturity basis). Thus, Thailand’s external vulnerability has been significantly reduced since the onset of the crisis. 11. In the three-year period from mid-1998, the BOT progressively eased, and then maintained an accommodative monetary stance (Figure 4, and Tables 4 and 5). In the context of its inflation targeting framework, and given low capacity utilization and the absence of inflationary pressures, the BOT had kept the 14-day repurchase rate (its key policy rate) at 2 Clarifications have served to define that a “counter party” consists of each financial institution, rather than individual branches of institutions. The most recently announced measure, requiring banks to report information on transfers between non-resident baht accounts, had been scheduled to take effect on July 2, but was at least temporarily withdrawn out of a concern that the reporting forms were too onerous.

THAILAND'S CAPITAL CONTROLS: 1997-2001’ In recent years, the Bank of Thailand has adopted a number of measures to limit offshore use of the baht, in an effort to curb currency speculation. Prior to the crisis of 1997-98, nonresidents were able to obtain baht credit from domestic banks, and operated in well-developed spot and forward markets. When the exchange rate peg came under pressure during 1996-97, the ample supply of baht in the offshore market facilitated a build up of speculative positions against the baht. In response, in May 1997 the authorities imposed a number of selective exchange controls, aimed at curbing the availability of baht offshore, thus penalizing nonresidents with uncovered short positions. The controls, however, did not apply to bona fide commercial and financial transactions (i.e., they did not apply to current transactions, FDI, and portfolio flows). The BOT’s measures can be categorized into three phases: l May-December 1997: To stem speculative pressures against the peg, in May 1997, the BOT prohibited resident financial institutions from providing baht to nonresidents through spot, swap, and forward transactions, or any other baht credit facility, unless supported by underlying trade and investment activities. The BOT also prohibited nonresidents from repatriating in baht the receipts from sales of baht-denominated securities and stocks (although nonresidents were free to repatriate funds in foreign currency). These measures effectively segmented the onshore and offshore currency markets. D January 199g-February 1999: To restore confidence in the floating regime, in January 1998 the BOT “reunified’ the onshore and offshore spot foreign exchange markets by lifting some of the earlier controls. Specifically, financial institutions were permitted to engage in spot transactions with nonresidents, and all restrictions pertaining to the transfer of baht by nonresidents from the sale of domestic securities were lifted. Also, the prohibition regarding the extension of baht credit facilities (including, through swaps and forwards) was replaced by a maximum outstanding limit of B 50 million ($1.1 million) per nonresident counterparty. Transactions involving an underlying trade or investment activity continued to be exempt. B March 1999-June 2001: To prevent leakage of existing controls in the face of a weakening baht, beginning in March 1999 the BOT sought to clarify, and later tighten (beginning in August 2000), the monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations. Circulars were issued to clarify the regulations, including that the B 50 million per counterparty credit limit applied to each financial institution, rather than individual branches of institutions. The authorities also took a number of steps to enhance compliance with the baht lending limits to nonresidents These included: (i) higher penalties on domestic institutions in non-compliance with regulations, (ii) tighter implementation of documentation requirements on banks’ clients to ascertain the nature of the underlying transaction, and (iii) new reporting requirements on banks regarding purchase, sale, deposit, or withdrawal of foreign exchange and the sources of baht, from nonresident accounts, used to purchase foreign exchange. More recently, the BOT called off a plan to introduce more detailed reporting requirements on domestic financial institutions’ transactions of nonresident baht accounts. The measures adopted by the Thai authorities since the crisis are not “classical” capital controls designed to enhance the autonomy of monetary policy. For example, the use of baht for trade settlements was left unrestricted, no controls were imposed on baht credit from nonresidents to residents; no requirement was introduced to bring 2s * 25 offshore baht onshore; and no new controls were One-month Swap Premia 20 _ (in percent) imposed on capital outflows by residents (although, pre- I - 20 existing regulations made it difficult for residents to IS t acquire foreign assets). The measures introduced in n 1” Thailand mostly aim at limiting the ability of 10 10 nonresidents to speculate against the baht. 5 5 It is difftcult to measure the effectiveness of the controls in limiting exchange rate weakness and 0 0 volatility. However, the controls have clearly had an -5 -5 effect in reducing offshore baht liquidity, as evidenced onohore by a persistent divergence between onshore and offshore .lO -I( swap rates (Figure). However, to maintain the 09199 12199 03/00 06100 09/00 woo 03/01 06101 effectiveness of the controls, the authorities have had to tighten enforcement periodically, suggesting that over time the controls lose their effectiveness as traders find ways to circumvent them. ‘This box draws on Ishii et al. “Measures to Limit Offshore Use of Currencies: Pros and Cons” IMF WP/43/0 1.

Moreover, the accommodative stance of monetary policy has not yet led to a significant revival of private credit given still weak investment demand and risk aversion by banks4 12. The BOT reversed course, however, in early June and raised interest rates. Under its newly appointed Governor, the BOT raised the 14-day repurchase rate by 100 basis points, to 2% percent in early June. Given their large liquid position, banks have so far resisted raising deposit and lending rates but any further increase in policy rates is likely to put pressure on them to raise their rates (see Section IIIB below). 13. Although the authorities have intended to use fiscal policy to support domestic demand, fiscal outturns have consistently undershot planned deficits (Text Table, Table 6). In 1998/99 and 1999/2000 the shortfalls were especially large, at more than 2 percentage points of GDP.

The pattern of deficit undershooting continues, judging by developments through the first half of the current fiscal year. The deficit of the central government was broadly on track, with expenditure and revenue in line with targets. However, the balance of the non- financial public enterprises (NFPEs) was in surplus by almost % percent of GDP, relative to a targeted deficit for the year of about 1 percent of GDP. 15. The government’s social safety net programs have been successful in containing the social costs of the crisis, according to the World Bank. In particular, the Miyazawa Initiative and other programs, such as the World Bank’s Social Investment Program, have generated 3Core inflation remains around 1% percent, even though headline inflation increased in April/May to above 2% percent. 41n part, sluggish credit growth also reflects some disinter-mediation given the pick-up in domestic bond market activity due to still large lending spreads associated with banks’ high levels of nonperforming loans (NPLs). The stock of corporate bonds at end-2000 stood at B 500 billion (11 percent of private sector credit), up from only B 180 billion at end-1998 (3 percent of private sector credit).

Nonetheless, the crisis has interrupted the remarkable progress made in reducing poverty over the last two decades. The poverty rate increased from 11 percent in 1996 to 16 percent in 1999. Preliminary World Bank estimates suggest that this rate has now fallen below 15 percent, but that poverty rates are not expected to fall back to pm-crisis levels before at least 2002. B. Corporate and Financial Sector Developments 16. The corporate sector remains highly leveraged. Both aggregate and firm level data reveal that domestic corporate debt has fallen little since 1997. The debt-equity ratio for listed firms is high, at close to 300 percent (Figure 5). There are, however, marked variations across sectors. Debt-equity ratios are particularly high in non-tradable sectors such as transportation and property, but remain much lower in tradable sectors such as electronics and food.

Rising NPLs, combined with large provisioning requirements, led to substantial losses for banks through mid-2000. However, bank operating income has gradually turned around with the stabilization in interest margins, and private banks made a modest net profit in the last quarter of 2000, for the first time in almost three years. 19. Progress in debt restructuring has been hampered by inadequate bankruptcy and foreclosure laws (see Section IIIC for a discussion of the legal framework). Faced with these difficulties, banks have set up their own AMCs and utilized the facilitating framework of the BOT-led Corporate Debt Restructuring Advisory Committee (CDRAC). By the end Breakdown of LOan Redtrwturiag Methods for Thai Banks, 2000 @scent of wses using at leasI me of tk below mthds) of 2000, the majority of private banks had set up their own AMCs, though most have not transferred a significant value of assets. Meanwhile, the CDRAC process has now run its course, with half of the cases under consideration having been restructured (Figure 6). However, the remainder, worth some 25 percent of GDP, is being sent to the court system, adding to the already substantial backlog Sauec:-dTh*lnd of commercial cases. Questions also remain about the quality of debt restructuring by domestic banks, which appears to consist, for the most part, of rescheduling, with little de-leveraging of the corporate sector. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks 20. With external demand deteriorating, and domestic demand also showing signs of weakening, GDP growth in 2001 is projected to fall to 2 percent. On top of the weak growth outturn for the first quarter, a number of indicators (exports, manufacturing production, and various consumption indicators) point to continued weakness during the second quarter. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13- authorities thought that higher fiscal spending during the second half of the year and an acceleration of financial sector reform policies, together with an expected pickup in world demand, could facilitate a growth outcome in excess of 2 percent. The staffs projection, however, already envisages a strong pickup in growth during the second half of the year on the assumption that external demand begins to recover. 21. There was broad agreement on the short-term balance of payments outlook. The decline in external demand is contributing to a somewhat faster than expected reduction in the current account surplus. Exports are projected to decline modestly (1 percent in U.S. dollar terms) in 2001, even with some pickup in export growth during the second half of the year based on a recovery of external demand. Given the high import intensity of Thai exports and lackluster domestic demand, import growth is also expected to slow sharply, to about +5X percent. On this basis, the current account surplus would decline to about 4% percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the capital account is expected to remain in deficit, due to a continued, albeit declining, pay down of external debt by the private sector, and some decline in new credit inflows in light of the difficult external environment and the ongoing shift to domestic financing. Likewise, FDI and portfolio flows are expected to remain weak. After scheduled repayment of the official financing package, reserves are expected to fall to around $3 1 billion at end-200 1, and decline further to $29% billion in 2002. At these levels, however, reserves would remain more than sufficient to cover the stock of short-term external debt. 22. There are, however, a number of risks and vulnerabilities (Box 2 and Table 7). These stem mainly from domestic rather than external sources. Though the capital account has pressure points and the economy is vulnerable to a withdrawal of Japanese capital, reserves are adequate and, given the considerable reduction in external debt over the last four years, external vulnerability is Iow.~ The main source of vulnerability is the highly leveraged corporate sector (see Section III3 above), which remains exposed to new shocks to the global economic outlook and the slowing recovery. Political uncertainty and risks of policy reversals also add to vulnerability.6 Should the expected pickup in external demand fail to materialize, or the domestic policy environment deteriorate, a more pronounced weakening of domestic growth could lead to a vicious circle of deteriorating corporate performance, rising NPLs, and declining confidence. Although the scope for capital outflows is limited, deteriorating confidence could put pressure on the exchange rate. Slow growth and increases in the fiscal cost of financial sector restructuring could also add to concerns about the sustainability of public debt. These risks underline the importance of structural reforms to accelerate corporate debt restructuring. Thus, policies to 5 The government also does not rely on capital market financing and is thus somewhat sheltered from spillovers from other emerging markets. 6An additional complication arises from delays in amending the Currency Act. The existing law requires at least 60 percent of currency in circulation to be backed by reserves (approximately $6 billion); the law also requires accumulated foreign currency profits and valuation gains to be set aside (about $17 billion). Thus, at present two-thirds of the BOT’s reserves must be set aside to comply with the Currency Act. However, in an emergency, the Act can be amended by a Government Decree. The BOT has initiated a process to bypass the Act by effectively substituting government securities for foreign exchange reserves that are set aside.

ANASSESSMENTOFEXTERNAL VULNERABILITY rhailand’s external vulnerability has been substantially reduced over the last few years. Reserves tave been restored to comfortable levels, the BOT has educed its outstanding forward/swap position, and large urrent account surpluses have facilitated a decline in n-ivate external debt, particularly short-term debt. doreover, modest holdings of Thai assets by non- esidents combined with legal prohibitions on residents’ requisition of foreign assets limit the risk of excessive :apital outflows in the short-term. Nevertheless, ulnerabilities remain, particularly in light of the risks of L further deterioration of the financial situation in Japan nd a sharper than expected slowdown of the J.S. economy. 40 0 Public sector 1 External Debt, 1997-ZOOlql SRivate s&or long-mm 97ql 97q3 98ql 98q3 99ql 99q3 @w ooq3 Olql rota1 external debt has fallen from $109 billion (70 percent of GDP) at end-1997 to $76 billion (65 percent of GDP) at end-March 2001. The decline in private sector external debt has been especially pronounced, falling by lmost half, from $85 billion to $44 billion, during the same period (see Figure). Moreover, the matnrity profile of he overall debt stock has improved; short-term debt has decreased substantially, and the ratio of reserves to short- u-m debt (on a remaining maturity basis) has improved Corn 57 percent in 1997 to 137 percent at end-March 2001. )ne source of vulnerability stems from the exposure of Japanese banks to the Thai economy (see Text Table). Vhile such exposure has fallen sharply in recent years, the private sector still has outstanding debt of about 114 billion to Japan (compared to $38 billion in 1997), equivalent to nearly one-third of total private sector external Ibligations. More than half of the debt to the Japanese creditors is falling due within one year, and these lines of redit could come under pressure in the event Japanese banks are forced to cut their exposure due to difficulties at .ome. More specifically: Foreign bunks operating in Thailand account for about onethird of private sector debt falling due through March 2002, and nearly 80 percent of these obligations are to Japanese creditors ($5 billion). Although most of the obligations are held by BIBF banks and not covered by the government guarantee, some pressure on the capital account could arise if Japanese banks were to suddenly reduce their credit lines. However, most of the foreign banks’ lending in Thailand is to top corporations and Japanese joint ventures, and these credit lines have typically been relatively secure in the past. Also, it is conceivable that some joint Extemal Debt (ii milliom? of U.S. d&m) ventures would receive offsetting 1997 2OOlQlZ financing directly from their foreign Total shut-tamI/ Tdal Sbat-tmml/ partners in the event the Japanese banks face difficulties (as was the case in 1998). On balance, the risk of pressure on the capital account from this source is deemed to be modest. Thai banks have reduced their foreign obligations by 75 percent since end-1997, and only $2 billion is falling due within one year (compared with $7 billion falling due in 1998), of which about on+fourth is owed to Japanese creditors.

Nevertheless, as the non-BIBF banks’ liabilities are covered by the comprehensive government guarantee, any sudden withdrawal of these credit lines could result in the guarantee being called, thereby putting pressure on official reserves. Thus, although of a relatively small magnitude, the risk of pressure on the capital account and reserves is moderate.

AN ASSESSMENT OF EXTERNAL VULNERABILITY (CONCLUDED) l Private corporations’ direct foreign borrowing accounts for more than 70 percent of total private debt. The maturity of corporate borrowing is on average longer than that of banks. Even so, about $lO% billion in private corporate debt is short-term, of which about $2% billion is owed to Japanese creditors. A large part of these short-term obligations are trade credits, and the overall BOP impact would be mitigated by lower imports in the event these credit lines dried up. Moreover, to the extent the private nonbank sector simply fails to meet its obligations (i.e., forced rollovers), the BOP impact would be limited. The risk for pressure on the capital account in the short-term is regarded as modest. Other sources of risks to the capital account arise from a global slowdown that would lower portfolio and FDI inflows, and a deterioration in domestic confidence that would induce banks to increase their holdings of foreign assets. However, the potential negative impact on the capital account stemming from these sources is relatively modest: Thailand has not witnessed large portfolio flows in recent years. Non-resident holdings of Thai equities are estimated at less than $2% billion, while holdings of government and corporate securities is very limited. As noted earlier, purchases of foreign assets by Thai retail and institutional investors are prohibited (without the permission of the BOT). Thus, although the financial sector currently is quite liquid, the potential for large capital outflows resulting from residents’ purchases of foreign assets is limited. Net FDI inflows have been modest but stable in recent years, averaging about $3 billion per year (even after excluding foreign investment in the financial sector). The investment base has been well diversified, with broadly equal amounts of investment coming from Japan, the US, EU, and other Asian countries. A sharper than expected slowdown in the global environment and/or a general deterioration in investor sentiment toward Thailand could obviously dampen future investment inflows. Although commercial banks’ foreign asset position has increased in recent years, their open foreign exchange position is small and is limited by prudential regulations. The net foreign asset position of the commercial banks amounted to $6 billion as of April 2001, compared with $4 billion at end-1999. However, a substantial part of the banks’ foreign assets is hedged, and their open foreign exchange position is much lower (about $300 million as of May, 2001). Prudential regulations prevent banks from having an open foreign exchange position that is larger than 15 percent of tier- 1 capital. Currently, this implies that the banking sector could increase its unhedged foreign asset position by, at most, about $1 billion. Thailand’s external vulnerability indicators do not compare unfavorably to other emerging market economies. While its external debt ratio is higher than those in Korea and Malaysia, it is lower than the average of other BBB and A rated economies (Standard and Poor’s rating; see Text Table). Moreover, Thailand’s level of gross reserves is higher than in most other emerging markets, both in terms of share of GDP and in months of imports.’ External Indicators in Selected Countries, end-2000 (In percent) FtignCurmcy TotalExtemalDcLW CinmRgavel oRwRsasrvssbl orce.sIlcmvd sbm-tmn Extunal Dew Batian Y GDP GDP mmbsofimtmis short-tam Extanal Debt 3l Tc4alExlemalDebtY Tbahod BBB- 65.8 2&z 6.2 131 30.4 Korea BBB 29.8 21.0 7.2 165 42.8 Malaysia BBB 46.2 33.5 4.4 345 21.0 FhiIippbm I/ BB+ 76.2 17.9 5.1 loo 23.6 bldmeda I/ ccc+ LOS.2 19.2 12.8 95 19.2 Average ofBBB rated cmntries 4, 75.2 14.2 5.7 . . . . .

In the medium term, growth rates of around 5 percent should be achievable, provided structural reforms are accelerated and macro policies remain appropriate (Table 8). Staff analysis suggests that achieving this growth path would require a pickup in total factor productivity, highlighting the importance of maintaining an open trade and investment regime, and facilitating the transfer of technology (Box 3, and forthcoming Selected Issues paper). This pace of growth would also require an acceleration of corporate debt restructuring to enhance consumer and investor confidence, and facilitate a pickup in domestic demand, particularly private consumption. The latter reflects an expected shift in the post-crisis period to a more balanced composition of growth, from investment-led to other components of aggregate demand, given the over-investment that took place during the pre-crisis period.7 24. Reserves are expected to remain adequate to meet repayments falling due to the Fund and bilateral contributors of the official financing package (Text Table). Though the current account would move gradually into deficit as domestic Indicators of Debt Service to the Fund, 2001-2006 I/ demand recovers (and the baht I 2001 2002 2ca zoo4 2005 20061 appreciates in real effective terms toward its medium-term equilibrium level), the capital account should also strengthen over the medium term, as the private sector’s pay down of external debt diminishes, and as FDI and portfolio inflows recover from recent troughs.

Macroeconomic Policies Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 25. The discussions took place against the backdrop of an escalating debate between the government and central bank over the course of interest rate policy. The Prime Minister and his advisors favored an increase in deposit rates to boost the income of savers and stimulate consumption. They also pressed for higher money market rates to stem capital outflows, particularly early debt repayments, which in their view had weakened the baht. The BOT Governor, on the other hand, reasserted his view that low interest rates were supportive of the recovery and consistent with the inflation targeting framework. 7 Evidence that this may already be taking place is seen by an emphasis by banks on the underdeveloped consumer retail sector (for example use of credit cards is on the rise).

GROWTH ACCOUNTING AND THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK 1991-96 1997-2000 KN MPK IN IN High rates of economic growth in Thailand, averaging about 8 percent in the 1980s and early 199Os, were driven Capital and Investment in Selected Asian Countries by capital accumulation and, to a lesser extent, by total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Indeed, during the first half of the 1990s Thailand experienced an investment boom (In percent) such that its investment rate (as a share of GDP) was near the top among the Asian economies (see Table). The high rates of Thailand 1.8 16.8 41 23 Malaysia 2.3 14.1 43 34 investment led to an increase in the capital-output ratio, and to Singapore 2.7 12.9 36 37 a declining trend in the marginal product of capital.

A Sources: Sarel(l997); WEO; aad Fund staff estimates. recent trend-break in the developments of the capital-output ratio and marginal product of capital is evident, possibly pointing to a reversal of the “over-investment” that took place during the 1990s. Thus, a further downward adjustment in the capital-output ratio can be expected. 14 1 Omwh in Outmt Factor Imuts. and TPP, 1981-2ooO -* Sounrs: NESDB;Bmkoflixdh$ andpuod StafTestimte. 4 1981-90 1991-96 199%2ooa Capit.&CIulput Ratio and Marginal R&cl of Capital, 1980-2000 (Index. 198C=loO) MO 150 140 110 ml 90 80 70 64 1980 1982 19&( 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 19% 1998 : Over the medium term, economic growth is expected to be driven by TFP growth, and to a lesser extent, by some growth in employment. For output growth to reach 5-6 percent per year, as assumed in the staffs medium-term projection, TFP would need to grow by about 3 percent per year. This projection assumes (i) only modest capital accumulation, such that the capital-output ratio would fall back to its average 1991-96 level, and (ii) employment growth of about 2 percent per year (owing to a gradual increase in participation rates and some reduction in the unemployment rate, currently at 4% percent). This pattern of TFP-driven growth highlights the importance of the following factors for the Thai economy: l Maintaining an open trade and investment regime. Thailand has benefited from its relatively high volume of trade growth of 5-6 percent, exports &d &ports would and foreign &vestment during the 1990s (see table). For GDI P continue to grow broadly in line with nominal GDP, while imports of capital goods would account for a large and rising share of total imports. Foreign investment inflows could be attracted if the authorities follow through on privatization plans and continues to maintain an open investment regime. l Skills development. Though Thailand has a strong foundation in basic education, and has made progress in improving secondary and tertiary education, enrollment rates are lower than in several other Asian countries. The government is reviewing its strategy on education and skills development, but it will probably take a few years before the skills shortage can be effectively addressed.

The mission argued against raising interest rates noting that, in the absence of inflationary pressures, the monetary stance needed to remain fully supportive of growth. In view of the weakening recovery, the team emphasized that it would be counter-productive to tighten monetary policy at this stage. Moreover, low money market interest rates had been an essential factor in restoring the profitability of the banking sector, which still remained fragile. Higher deposit rates were also unlikely to stimulate consumption, as most of the benefits would accrue to a relatively few wealthy savers- -about 10 percent of deposit holders Size Distribution of Household Deposits, December 2000 account for 90 percent of total deposits- who had a low marginal propensity to consume (Text Figure). Well-targeted fiscal programs would be a more effective way to stimulate demand, and could be implemented without imposing costs on the broader economy. The team also noted that early debt repayments had helped to reduce the external debt burden and, in any case, were already slowing given the Range of account sizes (in millions of baht) > 10 recent decline in U.S. interest rates. With respect to exchange rate weakness, the mission noted that the baht’s fall against the dollar in recent months was in line with regional exchange rate developments.* 27. Governor Chatu Mongol was dismissed soon after the mission, and his successor, Governor Pridiyathorn, has signaled a shift in monetary policy by raising policy rates. The new Governor has emphasized exchange rate stability, and maintaining a high level of foreign exchange reserves. There is market concern that the above objectives may eventually come into conflict. With legislation on central bank independence still pending, markets are uncertain about the commitment to the inflation targeting framework and the floating exchange rate regime, and are speculating about the possibility of tighter exchange controls. The authorities have reiterated that they plan to maintain the floating exchange rate regime, and have no plans to impose new capital controls. A small staff team will hold discussions with the new BOT Governor prior to the Board meeting and the conclusions will be summarized in a supplement to the staff report. Fiscal Policy 28. Markets have increasingly focused on debt dynamics in Thailand. There is concern about the size of the fiscal deficit and the impact of the new government policy initiatives on public debt.’ The level of domestic debt has risen sharply since the onset of the financial crisis, * The pass-through of exchange rate depreciation to domestic prices has been low in Thailand (estimates Corn the BOT’s inflation model suggest that the cumulative impact of the baht’s depreciation against the dollar this year on headline inflation is about ?4 percent). 9 The authorities’ budget presentation suffers from shortcomings that have also contributed to market confusion. For example, the authorities’ budget presentation for the central government deficit target in 2001/02 implies an expansion of 1% percent of GDP, while the GFS-type presentation used by the staff shows a contraction of nearly ‘/z percent of GDP.

Further, debt dynamics are sensitive to GDP growth rates; therefore, pursuing macroeconomic policies that enhance medium-term growth prospects would also be important. 29. The authorities agreed that fiscal policy has to balance support for the recovery with a commitment to fiscal consolidation to put public debt on a firmly declining path. To allay market concerns while providing sufficient support for economic activity, the mission recommended maintaining an accommodative fiscal stance for the remainder of the current financial year, but starting the process of consolidation in the next fiscal year. Announcement of a credible medium-term fiscal framework for consolidation would also help allay concerns about debt dynamics. The staff suggested that achieving a primary budget surplus within the next 3-4 years should be feasible. 30. A deficit of the magnitude targeted for the current fiscal year should provide suffkient support for economic activity. The comprehensive public sector deficit during this fiscal year is targeted to reach 5% percent of GDP. Indeed, the deficit would be even higher, at close to 6 percent of GDP, if the quasi-fiscal activities associated with the village fund and the debt suspension for farmers are taken into account (see 132 below). At the central government level, the deficit is projected to widen to 3% percent of GDP, corresponding to a worsening in the structural balance of about % percent of GDP. However, there are indications that the overall deficit target is likely to be undershot as public enterprises (which are targeted to run a deficit of 1 percent of GDP) actually ran a surplus during the first half of the year. The authorities explained that central government spending in the second half of the year was already projected to rise, and that increasing spending even further to compensate for the shortfall in public enterprise spending would prove difficult given rigid budget allocation rules and capacity constraints in central government spending. Therefore, they emphasized their intention to accelerate enterprise capital spending to bring the deficit in line with the target, thereby providing adequate fiscal stimulus for the slowing economy. 31. The mission recommended that the thrust of fiscal policy should shift towards consolidation starting in the next fiscal year. While the authorities agreed with this principle, they were concerned that if the expected pickup in external demand does not materialize, fiscal policy in 200 l/O2 should not be excessively contractionary. Therefore, they proposed to include in the 2001/02 budget a B 50 billion (1 percent of GDP) “reserve fund” that would only be spent if the expected acceleration in growth is threatened. Including the reserve fund, the projected deficit in 2001/02 would be 5 percent of GDP. Inclusion of net quasi-fiscal activities on top of this, yields a deficit close to 5% percent of GDP, implying a modest consolidation relative to the 2000/01 target. The structural balance would improve by X-1 ‘/z percent of GDP in 2001/02, depending on whether the reserve fund is utilized. In view of the large size of the projected deficit, the mission welcomed the authorities’ clearly stated intention to spend the B 50 billion reserve fund only ifthe economic outlook remains weak. To minimize the risk of the allocation being spent without due regard to economic developments, the mission urged the authorities to specify clearly the conditions under which the funds would be released.

More than two-thirds Low growth with \ of the debt is directly attributable to the costs of 5s financial sector restructuring. Financial sector restructuring debt stems from the costs of capital 50 and liquidity injections into the intervened finance companies (14 percent of GDP), and state and 45 intervened commercial banks (10 percent of GDP).

The primary balance is assumed to lower debt by around 2% percentage points of GDP, with the VAT reversion to 10 percent and revenue buoyancy each accounting for around half the adjustment. Without fiscal adjustment, i.e. maintaining VAT at the current 7 percent level (which would lower revenue by around 1% percent of GDP a year), the debt level would level off in the medium-term. However, consolidation is crucially dependant on achieving the 55% percent GDP growth. The medium-term debt dynamics are highly sensitive to the underlying macro and fiscal assumptions. A prolonged period of slow growth (e.g., 3 percentage points lower than in the baseline) could cause the debt ratio to become explosive, even with some fiscal adjustment (see Figure above). Without fiscal adjustment, the debt ratio would grow much faster and exceed 65 percent of GDP by 2009/10 (top line in Figure). The sensitivity to other factors is illustrated below. . Higher financial sector restructuring costs. Lowering the assumed recovery rate for distressed assets from 40 percent to 20 percent would increase the 2009/10 debt stock by about 5 percent of GDP. . Higher interest rates. Increasing the average interest rate on outstanding debt by 3 percentage points per year would increase the 2009110 debt ratio by about 10 percent of GDP. . No revenue buoyancy. The revenue-tc&DP ratio is projected to grow as the output gap closes (and with the growth in the share of consumption in GDP). Turning off this buoyancy would increase the 2009/10 debt ratio by around 10 percent of GDP. Thailand’s public sector debt does not currently compare unfavorably with other countries in the region (see Table). Differences in coverage complicate the comparison, especially with regard to nonfinancial public enterprises and the costs of financial sector restructuring. However, the relative size of government debt in Thailand is comparable to that of Korea and ’ Malaysia, and is below that of Indonesia and the Philippines. However, these comparisons could be misleading as they ignore future debt dynamics.

In view of the market concern, the authorities have decided to scale back some of their campaign spending promises, and spread the cost over a number of years. The cost of these initiatives is on the whole not large and, in some cases, would replace other spending programs. The staff cautioned that the debt suspension program for farmers could undermine an already weak credit culture. The authorities emphasized that the initiative was limited in time and size, assisted low-income farmers, and that the cost would appear fully in the budget with a lag of one year. On the village fund, the mission cautioned that it would be a challenge to ensure that projects financed would be productive. The macroeconomic impact depended on how fast projects were financed, and on whether the fund substituted other forms of credit. The authorities pointed out that this initiative was aimed at increasing the long-run productive capacity of villages and that the costs were only one-off, providing a revolving fund for micro-credit in each village. The mission advised against quasi-fiscal financing in general; the authorities reiterated their intention to fiscalize the costs with one-year lag. 33. On tax policy, the authorities were concerned that a reversion of the VAT rate to 10 percent this year could jeopardize consumption while the recovery remained weak. Therefore, they decided to postpone the reversion for at least another year. In view of the need for medium-term consolidation, the mission encouraged the authorities to announce a timetable for the reversion of the VAT to 10 percent, perhaps in a stepwise fashion, with the first step during the next fiscal year. Other tax measures recently announced by the government have a relatively small revenue impact. However, the authorities saw changes in the tax system as a means for achieving clear and narrowly defined objectives such as increasing the capitalization of the stock market or reducing imports. The staff cautioned against an overly activist tax policy that could undermine the Thai tax system, which generally compares favorably with international good practice. Instead, it urged the authorities to consider improving the long-run efficiency of the tax system (see forthcoming Selected Issues Paper). C. Structural Reform Policies Financial Sector Reform 34. Progress has been made in restructuring private banks, though risks to their capital and profitability remain. Thailand has emerged from the regional crisis with two-thirds of its banking system still in private hands. Private banks have reduced their distressed assets, returned to profitability, and over the last three years have raised about $10 billion in new capital. As such, they meet regulatory capital requirements. However, faced with an inadequate legal framework, pressure to lower interest spreads, and given that provisions against NPLs are crucially dependant on real estate collateral that is difficult to value, banks remain exposed. These risks are compounded by the slowdown in economic activity (Box 6 and forthcoming Selected Issues Paper). 35. State bank restructuring has lagged, with over half of all distressed assets now concentrated in the public sector.” State banks have made less progress in debt restructuring lo This amounts to some 25 percent of GDP.

FISCAL INITIATIVES Spending Initiatives These featured prominently in the government’s electoral platform, the most significant of which are: l Village Fund. This program envisages providing each of Thailand’s roughly 77,000 villages with up to B 1 million ($23,000) in funds to finance specific investment projects (essentially a micro-credit program). The funds are expected to be disbursed to the villages over a three-year period, for a total cost over the three years of up to B 77 billion (around 1% percent of 2001 GDP), but with the villages then recycling the money via revolving funds. The Government Savings Bank (GSB) will finance the costs as they occur, but the budget will reimburse the GSB with a one-year lag. The authorities plan to start the program by August. The modalities have not yet been finalized, but plans call for village committees to select projects for their own villages within the program guidelines, while a national committee would provide general oversight. l Debt Suspension for Farmers. This program, which began in April and is provisionally set to terminate at end-June, provides some debt relief to farmers with outstanding credit of less than B 100,000 ($2,300) from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC). Eligible farmers were given the choice of a three-year suspension of all principal and interest payments, or a 3 percentage point reduction in the interest rate for three years. The preliminary 2001/02 budget included B 6 billion in funds to reimburse the BAAC, and the total costs are expected to be around B lo-15 billion. The take up so far has been less than expected, with fewer than half of the almost 3 million eligible farmers participating. l Universal health care. The thrust behind this proposal is to make health care available at a fmed fee of B 30 ($0.66) per visit to those not currently covered by the several government-sponsored health insurance schemes. The authorities plan to phase this in over a three-year period, although it is already being piloted in 6 provinces, with another 15 recently added. The incremental costs-Thailand already has a fairly extensive public health care system-will ultimately depend on the precise details of the initiative, but could be in the range of B 30 billion a year when fully implemented. An additional B 8 billion had been included in the preliminary 2001/02 budget to finance an expanded pilot. Tax Policies In addition to deferring the VAT reversion, the authorities have announced the following tax measures: l Increase in alcohol and tobacco excises. The excise rate for tobacco and alcohol products was raised in late March 2001, For cigarettes, the excise rate was increased from 7 1.5 percent to 75.0 percent and for alcohol products the increase varied from 2 to 10 percentage points. This measure is projected to raise around B 7 billion on an annual basis, and was enacted to raise revenue and discourage consumption of imported luxury goods. l Corporate income tax (CIT) rate reduction for listed firms. In May 2001, the cabinet approved a measure that would lower the CIT rate from 30 to 25 percent for newly listed firms on the SET. In addition, firms listing on the Market for Alternative Investment (MAD, an equity market for small firms, would get a reduced rate of 20 percent, while currently listed firms on the SET or MAI would be subject to the 25 percent rate on the first B 300 million in taxable profit. The reduced rate is applicable for five years, and to qualify firms must list within three years. The measure is projected to cost around B l-2 billion per year in lost revenue. l Personal income tax exemption for home purchase. Effective 200 1, home buyers can claim an income exemption of up to B 100,000 a year for two years on down payments made in cash. Borrowed down payments are eligible for a B 50,000 exemption. This measure is projected to cost less than B 1 billion in foregone revenue.

The transmission from money market rates to bank deposit rates has been slow and incomplete, reflecting in part social resistance to lower deposit rates. Meanwhile, lower headline deposit rates have been matched by reductions in banks’ minimum lending rates such that headline spreads (the difference between headline lending and deposit rates) have remained broadly unchanged. However, with peak NPLs rising during the crisis to over 50 percent of total loans in the banking system by mid-1999, effective spreads on lending to performing borrowers rose as banks tried to stem their losses and preserve capital. Nevertheless, commercial banks’ net interest margins remain weak. Despite the substantial reduction in funding costs driven by falling deposit rates and the large capital increases by private banks, overall lending yields have been depressed by a combination of high levels of NPLs and the poor quality of subsequent debt restructuring. As a result, private commercial bank net interest margins (the difference between actual interest income and expenses), after bottoming out during the last half of 1998, remain well below historic levels. Private bank profits finally turned positive at end-2000, following massive losses during the crisis, but remain weak. Interest margins for these banks have converged to about 2 percent on average, just about allowing them to break-even on an operating basis given their cost Commercial Banks, Nominal Interest Rates, 19894001 @acens P.d , .J89 1991 1993 1995 97ql 97q3 98ql 98q3 9?Iql 99x,3 Ok,1 OOq3 Ok,1 1 0 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 .a Private Commerclsl Bank Margh, 198!%2001 @aFcnt P.S.) ,989 1991 1993 1995 97ql 97q3 9i!ql 98q3 99ql 99q3 caql ccq3 Olq1 structures and relatively low levels of fee-based income. Meanwhile, the state banks continue to have very weak operating performance, with the intervened banks in particular continuing to accumulate losses. Sensitivity analysis of bank profitability illustrates that even small reductions in margins would have adverse effects on bank performance. The sensitivity analysis presented in the table below considers the impact of the following scenarios: (i) 1 percent lower margins; (ii) l/3 of NPLs m-enter within the year; and (iii) a combination of scenarios (i) and (ii). The base case envisages margins remaining as in the last quarter of 2000. This shows that banks are vulnerable to a contraction in net interest margins, as well as a reversion of restructured NPLs. Indeed, were both to occur in conjunction, net interest yields would be halved and all banks would incur losses, in part reflecting increased provisioning requirements. Also, regulatory Tier-l capital ratios would be lowered by 2-3 percentage points on average across banks. Moreover, this is based on a flow analysis of banks’ financial position over a 12- month horizon, while shocks to collateral values and credit risk, not assessed here, would more substantially decapitalize banks. Indeed, regulatory capital ratios have been boosted by debt restructuring which is of questionable quality. Underlying capitalization could be weaker.

After lengthy delays, two state-owned banks (KTB and Bank Thai) transferred the bulk of their NPLs to state-owned workout units late last year. However, active resolution of these assets has yet to begin. Moreover, the privatization of the two remaining intervened banks (SCIB and BMB) has fallen through. The authorities recognize that resolving the distressed assets in state-owned financial institutions is an important near-term priority. 36. In response to the above problems, the new authorities have moved rapidly to set up the Thai Asset Management Corporation (TAMC). An overview of the key features of the TAMC is provided in Box 7, and the forthcoming Selected Issues paper provides a more detailed analysis and assessment. Despite some limitations, the staff believes that the approved TAMC law could be a useful tool to accelerate debt restructuring. Three key features are noteworthy: . Thepricing for asset transfers from private banks will be settled in the context of a gain-loss sharing formula with banks shouldering a large fraction of future losses from debt restructuring, thus reducing moral hazard. The transfer of assets from the private banks to the TAMC is also a onetime operation and cannot be repeated unless the law is amended. Moreover, loans to be transferred to the TAMC must meet well-defined criteria, eliminating banks’ discretion to transfer only their worst NPLs. In any case, the size of eligible assets that the private banks can transfer to the TAMC is fairly limited. The staff agreed that these arrangements balance the need to safeguard public resources against the objective of providing support to private banks. . Significant legalpowers have been granted to the TAMC to expedite debt restructuring and asset resolution. Importantly, the TAMC has strong foreclosure powers that enable it to seize and dispose of collateral on an accelerated basis. When the TAMC judges a business to be viable or of strategic importance, the law empowers it to administer a streamlined rehabilitation process that can accommodate all forms of debt and business restructuring. The TAMC’s foreclosure and rehabilitation powers envisage only limited reliance on the judicial system. One important limitation to the above powers is that the consent of the debtor is required for the TAMC to commence business rehabilitation. The staff expressed concern that this requirement could undermine the TAMC’s effectiveness and slow down the process. However, the authorities expressed confidence that debtors would readily consent to enter rehabilitation out of a fear that, unless they do so, the TAMC would use its enhanced foreclosure powers aggressively. *’ 0 Legal immunity has been provided to the TAMC staff against losses incurred during debt restructuring as long as they act in good faith. The staff had been pressing for immunity for state bank employees, as lack of such protection had been a key factor behind the slow speed and questionable quality of debt restructuring by state banks. 37. However, the TAM0 success will crucially depend on consistent implementation of the law and transparency of its operations. The enabling legislation provides the TAMC with l1 Some legal experts were concerned that without stipulating the need for debtor’s consent, the TAMC law could be challenged on constitutional grounds.

THAI ASSET MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (TAMC) The TAMC was formally established in June 2001, with the approval of the enabling law and the appointment of senior management. It will likely begin acquiring NPLs later this year, after the issuance of its operating guidelines. Its lifespan is limited to ten years. The key features include: Objective: The law defines the objectives broadly, placing emphasis on the revival and continuation of businesses and rapid resolution of NPLs, with a view to fostering national economic recovery. Eligibility: A total of B 1.3 trillion ($30 billion) in book value of distressed assets is eligible for transfer. Over 80 percent of these assets consist of NPLs held by state-owned entities, with the remainder from private banks (B 230 billion, or $5 billion). Eligibility for private banks is limited to collateralized loans above B 5 million ($110 million), and with more than two creditors. Though voluntary, participation is expected by all private banks. Funding: The FIDF will provide the initial capital and guarantee bonds issued by the TAMC which will pay a yield comparable to bank funding costs. The TAMC will also have the ability to borrow from the market, and to extend loans and guarantees. Losses incurred will be initially absorbed by the FIDF. Pricing: Collateralized NPLs from private banks and state institutions will be bought at a price equal to the value of collateral, appraised according to procedures set by the TAMC. For private banks, the price shall not exceed book value minus regulutoly provisions. Losses (or gains) will be shared over time with the originating institutions, according to a loss- sharing formula. In principle, the pricing formula implies that private banks’ exposure will be capped at roughly 60-65 percent of original book value (reflecting provisions already set aside by banks). Banks are also expected to refund, pro rata, their portion of TAMC’s operating and funding costs. Losses (and gains) will be settled at the end of the 5* and 10” years of TAMC’s operations. Structure: A 12-member Board of Directors, appointed by the Cabinet, will have authority to set policies and supervise general operations. The Chairman of the Board and other Directors will be selected from amongst the private sector and high-ranking public officials (though politicians are banned). The Board-appointed four-member Executive Committee (of which, two will be from the private sector) will be headed by a CEO, and will have authority to approve the terms of debt restrnctmings and of business rehabilitations. The law also requires that the Board appoint a professional and fUl-time Managing Director, in charge of day-to-day operations, and an Audit Board responsible for internal auditing and supervision. Loan management: Loans and workouts may, in principle, be managed directly by the TAMC. However, it is expected that multi-creditor loans acquired from all financial institutions will be managed with bank participation, within a CDRAC-style arbitration framework. The TAMC will also have the power to outsource loans to private sector asset managers, with priority given to Thai legal entities. Restructuring: The law provides for three loan resolution approaches. (i) debt restructuring including through debt and debt-service reductions, debt for equity swaps, and the transfer of collaterals; (ii) business reorganization, which could combine elements of debt restructuring with more fundamental operational restructuring supervised by a TAMC-appointed planner; and (iii)firecZosure and disposal of collateral. Special legal powers: The law provides enhanced foreclosure powers, enabling the TAMC to bypass the existing slow court and administrative procedures. The TAMC may itself directly seize and dispose of any collateral. Moreover, if the recovery from the sale of the collateral is less than the original obligation, it has the power to place the debtor or the guarantor into ~ liquidation. To support business reorganization, the law provides it with the ability to place consenting debtors directly into a five-year workout process, with the role of the bankruptcy court limited to the approval of the business plan. While debtor consent is needed to initiate business reorganization, the TAMC retains the ability to enforce foreclosure against debtors at any time. It may initiate business reorganization when it is a majority creditor, and when the company is considered viable, or of strategic importance. During the implementation of the plan, all other actions against the debtor’s assets are stayed. If the plan fails, the TAMC may effectively place the debtor or the guarantor into liquidation. Finally, the law provides immunity to the TAMC staff against losses incurred from bonu$de debt restructuring. Supervision and disclosure: The MOF is responsible for the general supervision of the TAMC, and the BOT has the power to examine its operations and financial performance. Afier two years of existence, a MOF-appointed committee is to carry out a full review of its operations, which will be submitted to Cabinet. The law requires the TAMC to produce and publish audited financial statements semi-annually. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - considerable autonomy and flexibility. Further, the objectives of its operation are left fairly broad. In particular, the law places much emphasis on the objective of corporate revival, but no reference is made to maximizing asset recovery. There is, therefore, a danger that the debt burden of the corporate sector could be reduced at an excessive cost to the state (for instance, by agreeing to significant debt reduction to support rehabilitation in circumstances where asset recovery would actually be maximized through liquidation). Also, while the law is very detailed in some areas, it leaves room for interpretation in other areas. However, it is expected that the specific guidelines that will steer the terms of debt restructuring will be issued in the near future. The staff urged the authorities to ensure that these guidelines clarify the exact process to be followed by the TAMC, and in particular, be consistent with the objective of value maximization. The authorities also pointed out that although the TAMC Executive Board would ultimately decide its disclosure policies, the law requires publication of audited financial statements semi-annually, and that the MOF would review thoroughly the operations of the TAMC after two years, and make a report to the Cabinet. 38. The incremental impact of the TAMC on public debt is marginal. The estimated costs for resolving the bad assets of the state banks had already been factored into the debt dynamics by both the staff and the authorities (see the forthcoming Selected Issues paper). Therefore, the long-run impact on public debt of simply shifting to the TAMC the responsibility for the resolution of these assets is marginal. The impact on debt of the TAMC taking over the envisaged small amount of bad assets from the private banks is also limited. The staff estimates that under the loss-gain sharing arrangement, the maximum contingent liabilities for taking over the specified bad assets of private banks would be less than 2 percent of GDP. 39. Despite some positive impact of the TAMC on private banks’ balance sheets, risks to their capital and profitability remain. On the positive side, if the TAMC is successful in catalyzing debt restructuring, it could provide banks with the leverage needed to resolve the distressed assets remaining on their books. Moreover, the TAMC will, at the very least, act as a stop-loss in the event that banks’ losses on transferred NPLs are substantially larger than expected. However, the introduction of the TAMC is not likely to have a large up-front impact on bank capital and performance, given that only about % of private banks’ distressed assets will be transferred. Banks will remain exposed given that they continue to face an inadequate overall legal framework for debt restructuring (see 144 below). 40. Even after the transfer of bad assets to the TAMC, the operating performance of the state banks will remain under stress, given their poor cost structures and weak ability to generate income. In this regard, the mission expressed concern that recent government pressures on the state banks and the specialized financial institutions (SFIs) to increase lending and reduce margins risk setting the stage for future losses at these banks. Indeed, the substantial existing NPL problem at state banks had its root in non-transparent and non-commercial lending activities. The authorities emphasized that in their view state banks were excessively risk averse in light of the large capital injections they had already received. They stressed that there was no intention to force state banks and SFIs to lend to unviable borrowers; rather, they were concerned about the flow of credit to the SME sector. 41. As the privatizations of BMB and SCIB were not successfully concluded, the staff recommended that their operations be wound down, given the small size of the performing loans in these banks. The authorities’ proposal for the state pension fund to invest in these banks Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - was at best a stopgap solution. The authorities explained that the pension fund investment would be fully guaranteed and, under this option, they intended to press on with fundamental rationalization of these banks’ operations, with a view to early privatization. In this regard, the mission warned that the proposal to allow the banks to resume lending in their current condition would place stringent demands on the supervisory authorities to ensure that proper credit risk assessment mechanisms were in place. 42. The mission urged the authorities to resist pressures to relax the regulatory framework for banking supervision. There is a risk that the authorities may accede to calls to ease prudential banking rules, which some regard as helpful to boost lending. Banks are currently awash with liquidity, indicating that their low level of lending reflects a scarcity of credit worthy borrowers, as well as risk aversion due to poor credit discipline and the weak legal framework. The authorities have pledged to maintain the existing minimum capital adequacy standard, but have not ruled out easing loan classification and provisioning rules. In the staffs view, relaxation of prudential rules would not remove any of the above obstacles, rather, any significant easing could damage the credibility of the government’s reform agenda. The Legal Framework 43. Although the TAMC’s special legal powers may accelerate corporate debt restructuring, such powers cannot substitute for more fundamental reform in this area. This is the case since the resolution of impaired assets that are not transferred to the TAMC- mainly in the private banks-will continue to be subject to the general legal framework for corporate restructuring. Further, enhancing the legal structure would have the longer-term benefit of increasing the availability of credit. The mission made a number of recommendations that would bring Thailand’s rehabilitation law closer to internationally accepted best practices.12 44. Important deficiencies in the bankruptcy law that were discussed include:‘3 0 Insolvency Test. Currently, insolvency is based on an assessment of whether the value of the debtor’s liabilities exceeds the value of its assets, which can be a complicated and uncertain exercise. The staff suggested that the law be amended to allow for proceedings to be commenced upon a determination that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (i.e., an “illiquidity” test). Conversion to Liquidation. Unlike many other insolvency laws, a failed reorganization attempt will not automatically result in liquidation proceedings. The staff recommended correcting this shortcoming that makes the process more protracted. l2 Further, while the TAMC will administer cases directly, improvements are also needed to the overall court infrastructure in order to speed up the resolution of the large backlog of cases outstanding, particularly in the civil courts. l3 See forthcoming Selected Issues paper for more details. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - Debtor Control. Under the present bankruptcy law, debtors often do not cooperate in restructuring because they typically lose control of the company to the court-appointed administrator or “planner.” Thus, the appointment of the planner becomes a polarizing contest, with debtors and creditors trying to win over the required creditor votes to secure the appointment of their choice of planner. The mission shared the experience in other countries that allow for a less contentious process, e.g., the debtor would continue to manage daily operations, but under the supervision of a court-appointed planner. The authorities have now formed a legal task force to consider amendments to the bankruptcy law, and the above suggestions have been put before the task force. They have recently requested technical assistance from LEG on these issues. 45. The mission also emphasized the need to expand legal reforms to enhance the availability of credit. Legal reform in two areas could be of assistance in this respect. First, a modern legal framework that supports the granting and enforcement of a wider variety of security interests will serve to reduce the risk of lending. The mission was encouraged that serious consideration is being given to these reforms and that, in fact, a draft of a secured lending law has been submitted for cabinet approval. Second, experience to date demonstrates that the weakness of the general credit enforcement mechanism in Thailand could continue to curtail the flow of new credit. Although some progress has been made over the past several years with respect to expediting enforcement, there is room for further reform, both with respect to the procedures applicable to the granting of a judgment and those that relate to execution. 46. The mission discussed other pending financial sector legislation (Table 9). . Early passage of a revised Central Bank Act would help repair the damage to policy credibility following the dismissal of the BOT Governor, by ensuring central bank independence, and cementing the new inflation targeting framework. . The authorities have put amendments to the Currency Act on hold. Instead, the BOT has devised a method to gradually release some of the foreign exchange reserves that currently need to be set aside in a segregated account. The mission argued that it would be much more practical to amend the Currency Act to combine the various BOT accounts, thus allowing full flexibility in reserve management. Passage of the new Financial Institutions Act, which is currently in the Upper House of Parliament, would go a long way towards the goal of bringing the supervisory and regulatory framework in line with Basle Core Principles, and providing Thailand with a modern financial sector framework. Progress continues to be made towards establishment of the new Deposit Insurance Agency (DIS). The staff suggested that premature removal of the blanket guarantee should be avoided so as to minimize risks to confidence in the financial system. In this regard, it would be important to clarify the conditions and steps for removing the blanket guarantee. Moreover, as the supervision of financial institutions is envisaged to remain under the purview of the BOT, in designing the DIS, it would be important to ensure that the new agency does not have overlapping supervisory responsibilities with the BOT.

The provision of economic data, both to the Fund and the public, has improved markedly since the crisis (Annex IV). Thailand was an early subscriber to the SDDS, and is in compliance with its requirements. In addition to the data disseminated on the National Summary Data Page and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, the authorities now publish an impressive range of statistics on official websites, including detailed data on the financial sector. Some deficiencies remain, however, in the quality of data, particularly with respect to the national accounts, the fiscal accounts, and various monetary aggregates, and timeliness of data remains an issue for some data in the latter two sectors. With the benefit of STA technical assistance in these areas, the authorities are working to address identified problems. 48. The authorities emphasized their intention to accelerate privatization of public enterprises. They intend to bring together many of the existing NFPEs into a single holding company to improve management, and implement a divestiture program, inter alia, to increase the capitalization of the stock market. Divestiture of three NFPEs is planned during the remainder of 200 1, including a partial privatization of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) and Thai Airways, and a full privatization of Internet Thai. In 2002, sectoral privatization plans include telecommunications, airports, and ports. 49. Trade liberalization is being carried out in the context of scheduled tariff reductions under the Asian Free Trade Area agreement (AFTA). Thailand began associated tariff cuts early last year. l4 The mission urged the authorities to establish a timetable for an acceleration of trade liberalization with countries outside AFTA. The team also pressed the authorities to simplify the trade regime, and to eliminate remaining quantitative restrictions. While Thailand’s simple average tariff rate remains much higher than in several other Asian countries, its effective rate is much lower (Text Table). This is due in part to a complex system of exemptions under the Board of Investment (BOI).

The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to review the system of Board of Investment (BOI) tax incentives with a view to limiting the role of incentives. The present system offers significant tax holidays and rate reductions, is difficult to administer, not transparent, and expensive in terms of foregone revenue. If the present incentives are not eliminated, the mission recommended that they be replaced by a system based on investment l4 On January 1,200O tariffs were reduced to O-5 percent across two-thirds of all tariff lines for commodity imports from members of AFTA. The strategy has been to rationalize the complicated tariff structure into a system of three product categories.

Such a system would be more transparent, and easier to administer. 51. The authorities are introducing measures to revive and develop the Thai capital market. In May the cabinet approved a package of measures to increase stock market capitalization by providing tax incentives for newly listed companies in the SET, and easing the requirements for small companies to list in the Market for Alternative Investment (MAI). Measures were also approved to develop the debt market, including through various tax incentives. Tax obstacles to investment in retirement funds were removed to promote the development of mutual funds. Finally, measures were introduced to promote “financial infi-astructure” by developing electronic trading and introducing interest rate derivatives. 52. Efforts are also underway to enhance good governance and transparency in both the public and corporate sectors. Thailand participates in the AsDB-sponsored anti-corruption initiative for Asia-Pacific. The new Constitution also emphasizes reducing corruption, including the establishment of the National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC). The Official Information Act of 1997 mandates stricter reporting requirements of public agencies. Moreover, many government entities, including the Office of the Civil Service Commission, the Revenue Department and the Ministry of Public Health are working on anti-corruption strategies, in some cases with the support of the World Bank. In the corporate sector, efforts are being made to strengthen accounting standards and disclosure requirements (e.g., through the issuance of a code of best practices for corporate Directors), as well as to enhance minority shareholders’ rights. However, associated amendments to legislation that would bring the fmrnework for corporate governance in line with best international practice are still pending, and implementation at the firm level is not yet complete. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 53. The Thai authorities have made significant progress over the past few years in stabilizing the economy and fostering an economic recovery. External vulnerability has been much reduced, reserves have been rebuilt, and growth, though slowing, should be positive for the third consecutive year. Regulatory reforms have strengthened oversight of the financial system, and financial institutions have recovered from the worst of the crisis. The new government has come to office with a strong electoral mandate to build on this progress and address remaining economic weaknesses. 54. Nevertheless, the difficult external environment and domestic political and policy uncertainty have increased the risks to the recovery, and GDP is projected to grow by only 2 percent this year. Indeed, there are substantial downside risks even to this modest growth forecast. Minimizing these risks will require the new government to pursue supportive macroeconomic policies, while adhering to its commitment to maintain an open trade and investment regime. Equally important, the authorities need to signal their intention to accelerate structural reform, not to backtrack as feared by many observers. 55. The BOT’s recent decision to raise interest rates is unfortunate. Low policy rates are needed to support the recovery, ‘and have also been crucial in restoring profitability to the banking sector. Further interest rate increases could undermine the recovery, aggravate the indebtedness of the corporate sector, and add to weaknesses in the banking sector. The dismissal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- of the BOT Governor, and the increase in rates for objectives outside the scope of the inflation targeting regime, have damaged the credibility of the monetary policy framework. To re- establish policy credibility, the authorities should press ahead with pending legislation to make the central bank independent. 56. The floating exchange rate regime has facilitated a reduction in external vulnerability and remains appropriate. Ultimately, the key to reducing the baht’s volatility is to address fundamental vulnerabilities, including bank and corporate balance sheet weakness, and maintaining a coherent policy framework. In this regard, efforts to tighten reporting requirements, if pursued too aggressively, or any intensification of capital controls, could undermine confidence and become counterproductive by hampering beneficial trade and hedging activities, and discouraging foreign investment. 57. Fiscal policy faces the challenge of balancing support for economic activity with a commitment to fiscal consolidation to reduce debt. In particular, market concerns about the size of the deficit and adverse medium-term debt dynamics needs to be addressed. Debt has increased sharply during the crisis and needs to be put on a declining path to allay market concerns, and to provide sufficient room for any future discretionary fiscal policy. Announcement of a timetable for the reversion of the VAT to10 percent would be particularly helpful in this regard. It would also be beneficial to move to a GFS-type budget presentation and to develop a medium-term fiscal and debt framework to articulate the government’s intentions. 58. The higher fiscal deficit target for this financial year is reasonable in view of the weakening recovery, but the budget for next year should aim for consolidation. Since this year’s budget was approved, growth projections have been revised down substantially. Therefore, the authorities’ decision to increase budget spending is warranted. For next year, the budget should begin the process of consolidation, although some flexibility has to be maintained in view of the risks to the economic outlook. In this regard, the authorities’ intention to budget a reserve fund of 1 percent of GDP is appropriate. This would provide sufficient flexibility in case the expected pickup in economic activity does not materialize, but would ensure fiscal consolidation if growth accelerates as expected. However, the conditions that would trigger the use of the fund need to be clearly specified in the budget. 59. The authorities should be commended for the speed with which they have set up the TAMC. The enabling Royal Decree has been approved, and the TAMC has begun work barely three months after the government took office. This is indicative of the authorities’ determination to deal with the distressed assets in the banking system, and de-leverage the corporate sector. The TAMC law also aims to strike a careful balance between providing the necessary powers to accelerate debt restructuring, and facilitating the cooperation of debtors. 60. The TAMC could catalyze much needed debt restructuring in Thailand. The TAMC has been appropriately designed to address key problem areas. First, it will concentrate primarily on the distressed assets in the state sector where progress has been slowest. Second, it will take on multi-creditor bad loans where coordination problems and strategic defaulters have stood in the way of rapid debt resolution. Finally, it will be endowed with special legal powers to overcome some of the deficiencies of the existing legal framework. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - 61. However, the success of the TAMC will depend crucially on its implementation. Although the TAMC has strong legal powers, especially with regard to foreclosure of collateral, the law requires the debtor’s consent to initiate a TAMC-administered business rehabilitation. To ensure cooperation of debtors, the TAMC would need to illustrate early in its operations that it is prepared to use its foreclosure and liquidation powers. In this regard, the forthcoming detailed operating guidelines of the TAMC will be critical in determining its precise approach to debt restructuring. It is important that the guidelines be based primarily on the principle of maximizing asset recovery. They also need to ensure the transparency of TAMC’s operations, and the even-handed treatment of debtors and other creditors. 62. The need to endow the TAMC with strong legal powers underlines the weakness of the legal framework for debt restructuring and the urgency of reform. Even after the establishment of the TAMC, a large amount of distressed assets will remain on the books of the private banks. Thus, priority needs to be given to addressing the deficiencies in the bankruptcy law by increasing its predictability and efficiency. In the long-run this would benefit both creditors and debtors. Also, with banks remaining risk averse, enhancing the legal fmrnework to facilitate credit extension-through strengthening enforcement procedures and widening the availability of security-also deserves urgent attention. 63. Attempts to pressure state banks to increase lending or reduce their margins could undermine the viability of the banking system. Although the authorities’ concern regarding the availability of credit to the SME sector is understandable, such concerns are better addressed through targeted budgetary assistance. Thus, to maintain the soundness of the banking system, it is important to allow banks to base their lending decisions on commercial criteria. 64. Any significant relaxation of loan classification and provisioning standards could also damage confidence. Progress has been made over the last few years to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of banking supervision and accounting standards. The past success of Thai banks in raising private capital owes much to increased transparency and acceptance of international standards. 65. GDP growth rates of some 5 percent should be achievable over the medium term with appropriate macroeconomic policies and an acceleration of structural reform. An increase in growth to these levels, however, would require maintaining an open trade and investment regime, as well as an acceleration of bank and corporate restructuring. As the economy recovers toward its potential, the current account balance would likely shift to modest deficits, consistent with the need to import capital to support Thailand’s economic development. However, with the pay down of private external debt, and a return of FDI and portfolio inflows, the capital account should strengthen, enabling reserves to remain adequate. 66. The authorities are to be commended for their excellent record in improving data dissemination, both to the Fund, and the public. An impressive array of economic statistics is now available, which puts Thailand near the forefront of international efforts to enhance transparency in this key area. 67. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Thailand be held on the standard 12-month cycle. A Post-Program Monitoring Board discussion has tentatively been arranged for December 200 1.

Amendments to the Currency Act (which had been approved by the previous Cabinet) have been put on hold. However, The BOT has devised a method to gradually release some of the foreign exchange reserves which currently need to be set aside in a segregated account. The BOT has recently withdrawn the draft of the Central Bank Act which had been approved by the previous Cabinet. The matter is currently under consideration by the newly appointed BOT Governor. Following the failure to sell the two intervened banks to private investors, the new government has announced its intention to sell these banks to the state pension fund. SAM was established last year, and the bidding for the outsourcing of its distressed assets was completed. However, the outsourcing contract was not awarded in anticipation of a decision to transfer these assets to the newly established TAMC. The FIDF has agreed to the terms for the establishment of a covered asset pool for Bank Thai, though its implementation may be put off in the event Bank Thai’s bad loans are transferred to the newly established TAMC. The FIDF is finalizing the draft Deposit Insurance Law, with technical assistance from MAE and the World Bank. The draft law was approved by the Lower House, and the new government has submitted it to the Upper House. The provisioning rules were filly phased-in as scheduled. Currently, all private banks meet the fully phased-in provisioning requirements. The new authorities have formed a legal task force to consider amendments to the bankruptcy law. A new Secured Lending Act, which will widen the types of collateral that can be pledged for new lending, has been submitted to the Cabinet for consideration.

Last Article IV Consultation (January 12,200O): Directors commended the authorities for their impressive progress in fostering economic recovery and restoring financial stability, but noted that recovery and restructuring were still incomplete. They expressed concern about the high level of nonperforming loans, and stressed that determined efforts were needed to accelerate structural reform, especially regarding corporate debt restructuring and the health of the banking system. In the meantime, supportive macroeconomic policies remained appropriate to sustain the recovery, although over the medium term fiscal consolidation would be needed to stabilize public debt levels. X. Recent Technical Assistance: FAD: A number of FAD missions took place in 1998: in February on tax policy and structure; in July to help establish an Office of Macroeconomic-Fiscal Analysis; and in November on pension reform. Customs, tax administration, and tax policy advisors have also been working in Bangkok. LEG: Staff have advised on the reform of bankruptcy and secured lending, including visits in January, April (as part of a World Bank mission), and June 1998, and November 1999, and February 2000. MAE: In the first half of 1997, MAE consultants participating in an APD mission focused on the soundness of the financial sector, and two MAE missions provided assistance on monetary instruments and monetary management under a floating exchange rate regime. In July 1997, an MAE mission with World Bank participation outlined a strategy for financial sector reform, and in August, MAE helped integrate this strategy into Thailand’s program with the Fund. Since September 1997, MAE has provided extensive support of the implementation of the financial sector restructuring program with several MAE missions and participation in APD review missions. The most recent of these took place during the March 2001 staff visit to assess progress in the setting up of a national AMC. In June 1998, a long-term resident advisor on banking supervision was assigned to the BOT from June 1998 to June 2001. STA: Thailand has received a series of technical assistance missions in recent years on national accounts statistics (December 1996, October 1997, March and September- October 1998, March and August 1999) mainly to improve the quality and timeliness of quarterly data. Furthermore, missions on producer price indices (June-July 1999) and on balance of payments statistics (September-October 1998) reviewed the methodology of several price indices and the balance of payments compilation system. There have also been missions on the areas of banking statistics (April and June-July 1998, and January- February 2001) and data dissemination issues (July 1996, and April-May, June and November 1997).

The Bank has drafted a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Thailand, which is scheduled to be submitted to the Board in September. The broad strategy of the Bank’s continued involvement in Thailand is on the basis of the Comprehensive Development Partnership (CDP) approach, which envisages provision of technical assistance, to sustain the momentum of reforms begun under the EFAL, PSRL, and SIP loans. Coupled with the CDP, there would be a limited amount of lending. The CDP would address four key areas- Competitiveness (C), Governance (G), Environment (E), and Social Protection (SP). CDP (C) has already been launched while CDP (G), (E), and (SP) are in various states of preparation.

The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) pledged $1.2 billion at the Tokyo Meeting in August 1997 to support the Government of Thailand’s stabilization and structural adjustment program, focused on the financial and social sectors. Lending by the AsDB increased from $330 million in 1996 and 1997, to $550 million in 1997, $630 million in 1998 (excluding guarantee operations of $950 million), and $364 million in 1999. No loans were made to the Government in 2000; $50 million for one project is planned for 2001. A $300 million Financial Markets Reform Program Loan (FMRPL) was approved on December 19, 1997, with the aim of, inter alia, strengthening market regulation and supervision in the securities market and improving risk management. A $500 million Social Sector Program Loan (SSPL) was approved on March 12,1998. The funds were disbursed in two tranches, on March 17, 1998 ($300 million) and October 28, 1999 ($200 million). The objectives of the SSPL are to mitigate the short-term impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable social groups and the unemployed; initiate structural reforms to enhance the competitiveness of the Thai economy; and reduce inefficiencies in the provision of social services. The SSPL includes measures to address systemic issues in the education, health, labor market, and social welfare sectors. Specific attention has also been paid to gender and poverty issues. The AsDB is providing long-term technical assistance support under the SSPL for education management and financing, health management and financing, and capacity building for social sector reform. An Export Financing Facility (EFF) was approved on March 26, 1998. The Facility was set up to fund pre- and post-shipment financing of exports, the import of raw materials needs of exporters, and export-related plant and machinery requirements. The EFF consisted of: (i) a $50 million loan to the Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM); and (ii) $950 million ‘Prepared by AsDB staff.

The AsDB provided a partial credit guarantee to the commercial cofinanciers, with a counter guarantee from the Kingdom to the AsDB. However, the terms of the facility, which reflected the prevailing market sentiment of March 1998, became unattractive as interest rates declined sharply with the restoration of stability. Of the $1 billion available under the EFF, $200 million was accessed by EXIM. The availability period for this facility lapsed without further drawdowns and loans from the AsDB and the syndication of international banks were prepaid by EXIM in September 1999. An Agriculture Sector Program Loan ($300 million, plus $300 million in “Miyazawa Initiative” cofinancing from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation) was approved on September 23, 1999. The objectives are to increase productivity, enhance export competitiveness, and improve governance and management in the agricultural sector. The first tranche of $150 million was disbursed by the AsDB on December 27,1999. Technical assistance activities are ongoing to improve the Office of the National Water Resources Committee and the Royal Irrigation Department, and to restructure the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. On December 2 1, 1999, the ADB approved a $7.5 million technical assistance package to restructure state-owned specialized financial institutions (SFIs) in Thailand. The assistance will help the government devise restructuring plans for four SF&, namely, the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand, Small Industry Finance Corporation, and Small Industry Credit Guarantee Corporation. The various forms of Government support for SFIs and their effect on SF1 operations will be reviewed. A clear corporate governance framework for the SFIs to ensure autonomy, accountability and transparency will also be established. The assistance will explore possible roles for the SFIs in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) financing. The AsDB assistance comprises a technical assistance loan of $4.5 million, which comes from its ordinary capital resources, and a technical assistance grant of $3 million, financed by the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility, funded by the Government of Japan. Consultants will be fielded in February 200 1. AsDB’s Private Sector Group approved a $25 million equity investment in the Small- and Medium-Enteqwises Investment and Restructuring Fund (SIRF) in March 2000. The fund- which has a target size of $100 million-will invest in SMEs with promising businesses in need of expansion capital. Technical assistance grants totaling $3.4 million for eight projects were also approved. The AsDB is preparing a new country strategy and program (CSP) to guide its operations in Thailand. The CSP proposes a strategy to support inclusive social development, promote rural development and deepen competitiveness, with the aim of advancing poverty reduction and equitable growth. Subject to the availability of resources and country performance, a loan pipeline has been prepared for 2002-2004 comprising 11 project totaling $1.25 billion, or an average annual lending level of $420 million.

The bulk of the information used by the staff in surveillance work is obtained directly from the Bank of Thailand (BOT): key financial data are reported daily, with more general economic data reported regularly via the Resident Representative. In addition, the BOT publishes a statistical monthly release, basic data on monetary aggregates, the balance of payments, investment and manufacturing production, and the overall fiscal cash surplus (all with a lag of on&w0 months). The BOT also posts a wide range of economic data on the World Wide Web (www.bot.or.th). Further details are obtained from the BOT’s monthly and quarterly reports. In addition, the BOT has been publishing quarterly inflation reports since July 2000. The Thai authorities responded to the crisis by greatly improving provision of economic data together with a commitment to increased data transparency. For example, data on the key assets and liabilities of the BOT are now published regularly, including net forward obligations. In addition, the BOT has made considerable efforts to improve the reporting of comprehensive data on the position of financial institutions (including nonperforming loans and capital adequacy), data on external debt positions and rollover rates, and, continues to provide data to the Fund to facilitate effective post-program monitoring of the Thai economy. The quality and timeliness of Thailand’s data differ across sectors: 0 Existing data collection arrangements adversely affect the quality and timeliness of the monetary statistics. The compilation of monetary statistics in the BOT’s Data Management Group is based on a reporting system that serves primarily bank supervision purposes. Although efforts have been made within the BOT to modify the reporting format to meet the needs of monetary statistics, the reports submitted by the financial institutions are not fully compatible with statistical standards. Moreover, the monetary aggregate M2A (which includes promissory notes issued by finance companies) is compiled with a lag of six weeks. There is an even longer lag in the compilation of M3 (which equals M2A plus deposits held in state financial institutions). The banking survey is compiled with a lag of about three months. A recent STA technical assistance mission has made recommendations to remedy these problems, and progress is expected. There are consistency problems in the interbank and intra sectoral positions in the monetary statistics compiled by the BOT. A cursory review of the underlying data undertaken by STA missions revealed significant discrepancies between asset and liability positions reported for the same group of financial institutions. These discrepancies indicate that there are inconsistencies in the sectoral classification of assets and liabilities that diminish the analytical usefulness of the monetary data. It was agreed that the authorities would review in greater detail the consistency of the interbank and intra sectoral positions and examine the causes of the discrepancies.

However, the Labor Force Survey is now conducted every quarter, instead of two to three times a year. Quarterly national accounts have been published since early 1999, and are currently available with one quarter lag. Their introduction was tied to Thailand’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and was developed with technical assistance from STA. However, a number of technical problems remain, essentially reflecting deficiencies in the underlying source data, but also technical problems in benchmarking the quarterly to the annual data. l While the methodology for compiling balance of payments data remains adequate, a number of weaknesses in the data collection system need to be addressed in order to fully capture developments following the relaxation of the foreign exchange controls. These include: (1) an inadequate coverage of transactions by nonresidents in Thailand and by Thai residents abroad (other than banks); (2) a lack of noncash activity, such as reinvested earnings; and, more generally, (3) a deterioration in the quality of data reported under the exchange control system, partly in consequence of the increased pressure on the reporting system that resulted from the sharply increased scale of transactions. l On fiscal accounts, although the authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the GFS, their own budget presentation to Parliament and public at large does not conform to GFS, causing confusion among market participants. The transparency of the official statistics with regard to the quasi-fiscal activities of the government also needs to be addressed.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation and Post-Program Monitoring Discussion with Thailand On August 2, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation and Post-Program Monitoring discussions with Thailand.’ Background Thailand successfully completed a 34-month Stand-By Arrangement on June 19, 2000. The arrangement was part of a US$I 7.2 billion official financing package from multilateral and bilateral contributors. Over the course of the arrangement, a total of US$14.3 billion was drawn (including US$3.4 billion from the Fund). Scheduled repayments began late last year, and have so far amounted to $1.6 billion (of which about half is to the Fund). Thailand has been recovering over the past few years from the severe economic crisis of 1997-98. In the years preceding the crisis, strong capital inflows fueled rapid economic growth, leading to large current account deficits and concealing financial fragilities. The external imbalances culminated in a loss of reserves, forcing the authorities to abandon their exchange rate peg in mid-1997. Compounded by regional contagion, a large depreciation and steep economic contraction ensued. This resulted in a large increase in non-performing loans, further undermining the health of the financial system. As the exchange rate began to stabilize in mid-1998, macroeconomic policies were gradually eased to support the weak economy. A social safety net was introduced with World Bank support to cushion the impact of the crisis on vulnerable segments of the population. The authorities also moved decisively to address the substantial problems in the financial sector. Unviable institutions were taken over by the state, while a comprehensive deposit guarantee 1 Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the August 2, 2001 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report. Meanwhile, Post-Program Monitoring is conducted concurrently and provides closer monitoring of the circumstances and policies of members whose arrangement has expired but that continue to have Fund credit outstanding.

To prevent financial sector problems from recurring, an enhanced prudential framework was phased in, bringing capital adequacy standards and loan classification and provisioning rules in line with international best practice. In addition, the government adopted measures to facilitate voluntary debt restructuring, including through the establishment of the Corporate Debt Restructuring Advisory Committee (CDRAC). Bankruptcy procedures were also reformed and various tax impediments were eliminated. As a result of these efforts, significant progress has been made over the past few years in stabilizing the economy and fostering an economic recovery. External vulnerability has been substantially reduced as a result of the large payoff of short-term external debt, and official reserves have been rebuilt. The supportive policy framework, combined, until recently, with strong external demand, has helped restore growth, with the economy expanding by over 4 percent in each of 1999 and 2000. Moreover, private banks have raised almost $10 billion in new capital, and Thailand is emerging from the crisis with two-thirds of its banking system in private hands. Headline NPLs have fallen sharply, and bank profitability has recovered. However, the economic recovery remains fragile and is now being undermined by the weakening global environment. Exports, which grew by almost 20 percent last year, have fallen sharply this year, as elsewhere in the region. With the pickup in domestic demand still too weak to offset faltering global demand, the economic outlook has deteriorated. Recent developments highlight that a number of economic weaknesses must still be addressed for the recovery to remain on track. In particular, the slow pace and questionable quality of corporate debt restructuring continue to undermine bank profitability and capitalization. Although headline NPLs have declined, there has not yet been a significant deleveraging of the corporate sector. As such, system-wide distressed assets remain high, especially among state-owned and intervened financial institutions. To address these weaknesses, the new government that came to office in March has proceeded with plans to establish the Thai Asset Management Corporation (TAMC). The TAMC was formally established in June, and is expected to begin acquiring assets by the third quarter of the year. All told, it is expected to acquire about half ($31 billion) of the financial system’s distressed assets. It will acquire almost all (US$26 billion) of the state-owned financial institutions’ distressed assets and about one-quarter of private banks’ distressed assets (US!% billion). As private banks will still need to engage in debt restructuring to resolve their remaining distressed assets, the authorities are simultaneously considering an overhaul of the overall framework for debt restructuring.
