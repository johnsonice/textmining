Addressing Rising Income Inequality  9.      The authorities shared staff’s concern about weak wage growth for low-skilled workers, which has contributed to growing income inequality as evidenced by the rising Gini coefficient. To address this concern, the authorities have introduced the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme in the FY 2007 budget.3 While recognizing the WIS as an important step to strengthen the social safety net, staff suggested that the authorities consider introducing an unemployment insurance scheme, which would not only provide individual income protection but also work as an automatic stabilizer for the broader economy. To minimize work disincentives, benefits could be subject to participation in active-labor-market programs, have limited duration, and cover mostly basic needs. The authorities reiterated their long-standing view that work is the best form of welfare. However, they did not rule out the possibility of broadening the social safety net in the future, noting that the WIS will be reviewed in 3 years.  10.      Given Singapore’s aging population, staff welcomed the Central Provident Fund (CPF) reform measures taken in recent years to enhance financial security in retirement. For low-income households, the CPF is the main source of retirement income. However, income replacement rates are relatively low,4 partly reflecting modest returns on CPF savings. In this regard, staff welcomed the recent steps to reduce charges on new investments under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) and continuing efforts to promote investor education to increase the use of the CPFIS. Staff recommended that the authorities explore options allowing more (but simple) risk-return options for CPF savings.                                                    2 Forty firms have been divested since end-2005. 3 This scheme provides income supplement for employed low wage workers over age 35. 4 Estimated replacement rates based on the CPF Minimum Sum range from 20–40 percent.

The financial system is sound, and no short-term risks are evident (Figure 4 and Table 7). The health of the system has been supported by the improving financial position of banks, corporates, and households. Banks are well-capitalized, and profitability and asset quality have continued to improve. Bank exposures to the property and equity markets have risen but risks are manageable. Corporate profitability has also increased, and households’ liability-to-asset ratio has dropped further.  12.      Most of the 2004 FSSA recommendations have now been implemented and adoption of Basel II is on track for early 2008 (Table 8). Recent measures include further lowering the minimum Tier-1 capital requirement for banks; amendments to the MAS Act, which clarified the MAS’ functions and objectives; and amendments to the Banking Act, including regulations related to large exposure limits. Staff stressed that reporting lags on corporate and household balance sheets and income statements should be reduced. 13.      The authorities appropriately view safeguarding financial sector growth and stability as crucial to Singapore’s heightened role as a global financial center. The MAS is continuing its efforts to improve risk-management capabilities of local banks and to enhance cross-border supervision of local banks’ overseas operations through supervisory cooperation with other countries. While local banks’ direct exposures to the rapidly growing asset management industry appear limited, indirect exposures through international banks and counterparties have likely increased, underscoring the need to strengthen cross-border risk management in financial institutions and monitoring by the authorities.  B.   Macroeconomic Policies Fiscal Policy 14.      Sustained prudent fiscal policy has been an important pillar for Singapore’s economy. With large fiscal reserves, Singapore has been able to weather a series of adverse shocks and is well-prepared to accommodate the fiscal costs associated with an aging population and to meet the challenges associated with globalization. 15.      The FY 2007 budget includes a number of important measures such as a shift toward indirect taxation and new permanent transfers to low-income households. Notwithstanding a cut in corporate income taxes, new income transfers and measures offsetting a hike in the goods and services tax (GST),5 the budget is slightly contractionary by staff estimates, partly reflecting the large one-off expenditures in the previous budget. Staff encouraged further front-loading of the GST-offset measures if the impact of the GST hike                                                  5 The announced GST hike by 2 percentage points to 7 percent will take effect in July 2007.

At the same time, capital inflows surged, reflecting: (i) favorable growth prospects for Singapore and the ongoing appreciation of the Singapore dollar, which have increased the attractiveness of Singapore assets; (ii) increasing use of the Singapore dollar as a proxy for the strengthening major regional currencies; and (iii) greater foreign investor participation in the high-end property market. The monetary policy stance has been kept on a tightening bias since April 2004, targeting a modest and gradual appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). The Singapore dollar has appreciated by about 5 percent in nominal effective terms (2½ percent in real effective terms) since the beginning of 2006.  Fiscal performance in FY 2006 (ending March 2007) was better than budgeted, owing to higher receipts from government property sales and tax revenue gains associated with strong growth, as well as slower-than-planned development spending and net lending. The fiscal impulse was positive, mostly reflecting large one-off income transfers.
