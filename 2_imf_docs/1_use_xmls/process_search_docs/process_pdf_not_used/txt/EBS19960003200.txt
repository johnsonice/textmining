BACKGROUND During the first half of 1995 fiscal performance was satisfactory, but the credit program of the Central Bank went off track and the implementation of the structural reform program stalled. However, in the second half of the year, credit conditions were tightened, the financial program was brought back on track, three major public enterprises were capitalized/privatized and a new Central Bank Law was approved by Congress. On this basis, the review of the first annual ESAF arrangement was completed by the Executive Board on November 29, 1995. For 1995 as a whole, most of the objectives of the program were met. However, inflation has accelerated in recent months (from 8 l/2 percent on a 12-month basis in December 1994 to 13 l/2 percent in January 1996), aud the fiscal deficit in the fourth quarter of 1995 was larger than envisaged. In December 1995, Paris Club creditors granted a stock-of-debt reduction and restructuring for Bolivia under Naples terms. 2. THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM AND POLICY ISSUES The authorities are requesting a second annual PSAF arrangement for SDR 33.66 million in support of their economic program for 1996. Economic policies for 1996 have been desigued in the context of a medium-term strategy for the period 1996-98 that aims at raising the growth of real GDP from about 4 percent in 1995 to about 6 percent in 1998 and 5 percent thereafter, reducing iuflation to 5 percent by 1998, and continuing progress toward external viability. The program of capitalization is expected to lead to a major restructuring of the economy and give a significant boost to growth. The recent acceleration in inflation can be explained largely by special factors (higher world wheat prices and a domestic drought) that should be reversed in coming months. Nevertheless, the authorities are assigning high priority to scaling back iuflation through the maintenance of a tight stance of financial policies. Fiscal policy has already been strengthened and the authorities are committed to restrain fiscal policy further, through contingency measures to be activated by midyear, if inflation does not decline as programmed. In any case, the fiscal deficit in 1996 will be limited to an amount that can be financed from concessional external resources. In the area of structural reforms, the Government intends to complete the capitalization of the national oil company and the state metal refinery as well as the sale of regional enterprises in 1996. In the fiscal area the Government also intends to implement mechanisms to monitor and control public sector wages; expenditure of local governments; and tax revenue under a new tax regime for the hydrocarbons sector. In the financial sector, the Government intends to complete by midyear the workouts for several banks that have experienced serious liquidity problems. The strategy to alleviate poverty includes the implementation of targeted programs to improve the coverage and quality of basic education and health. The balance of payments projections assume a large increase in foreign direct investment particularly in the energy and telecommunications sectors resulting from the capitalization program and continued substantial inflows of grants and concessional loans to the public sector. The debt- service ratio stays high for the next few years despite the relief provided by a stock-of-debt operation by Paris Club creditors. However, with strong policy implementation and the absence of external shocks Bolivia’s financing needs can probably be managed in the medium term without further exceptional financiug.

Introduction Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation and on an economic program to be supported by the second annual arrangement under the ESAF were conducted in La Paz during December l-19, 1995 and at headquarters during February 5-12, 1996. u Bolivian representatives included the Minister of Finance; the President of the Central Bank; the Ministers for Economic Development, Human Development, Sustainable Development and the Environment, and Capitalization; the National Secretaries for Finance and Pensions; the Undersecretary of the Treasury; and other senior officials. The three-year ESAF arrangement was approved by the Executive Board on December 19, 1994 together with the first annual arrangement thereunder (access under the three-year arrangement is equivalent to SDR 100.96 million or 80 percent of Bolivia's quota). The midterm review of the first annual arrangement originally scheduled for June 1995 wascompleted by the Executive Board on November 29, 1995. On January 31, 1996, outstanding Fund credit to Bolivia amounted to SDR 180.1 million or 142.7 percent of quota (Appendix I). Bolivia's relations with the World Bank are described in Appendix II. In the attached letter to the Managing Director dated February 29, 1996 and the accompanying policy memorandum, the Bolivian authorities request the second annual arrangement under the ESAF in an amount equivalent to SDR 33.66 million in support of their program. A policy framework paper (PFP) describing macroeconomic and structural reforms in the context of a medium-term program for 1996-98 will be circulated separately. In concluding the 1994 Article IV consultation with Bolivia, Executive Directors welcomed the progress that had been made in reducing inflation and the external current account deficit, They commended the innovative program of structural reforms, including the Government's plan to transfer control of the largest public enterprises to the private sector through capitaliza- tion. Directors noted that implementation of the ESAF program would greatly increase the likelihood that the growth rate of about 4 percent a year achieved in the past few years would be sustained and even increased. Bolivia is currently providing the Fund the core data needed for surveillance on a timely basis, despite weaknesses in certain areas (Appendix III). Bolivia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. u The mission to Bolivia comprised Ms. Brenner (Head-WHD), Messrs. Clements (FAD), Drummond (PDR), Gudac and Peraza (both WHD), and Mrs. Koo (Assistant-WHD). The mission was assisted by Mr. Garza, the Fund's resident representative.

Background and Recent DeveloDments Pet$onnance of the main jinanhl variables under the authorities’ pmgmm for 1995 is esthated to have been broadly satisfadory. In addition, an ambtius pmgmm of structuml reforms was initiated in 1995, induding the transfer of a major pcut of the public enterprise sector to p&ate owne&ip and management. months. However, in#iati&n hs picked up in recent 1. Macroeconomic develoDments The program for 1995 sought to reduce inflation to 6 l/2 percent and to raise net international reserves by US$40 million; real GDP was assumed to grow by 4 l/2 percent (Table 2). Structural reforms were to focus on the transfer of management of the principal public enterprises to the private sector through a process of capitalization/privatization. JJ An important aspect of the program was the pursuit of a restrained fiscal policy in the medium term, although the program envisaged an increase in the deficit of the combined public sector to 4.4 percent of GDP 1995, to allow for the one- time costs of structural reforms (especially severance payments in the enterprises that were to be capitalized). 2J The deficit was expected to be fully financed from abroad. Dwing the first half of 1995jhd performance was satisfactory, but the credit pmgmrn of the Cent& Bank went ofltmck and the implemenhtion of the structuml reform pmgmm stalled. As a result of liquidity support to commercial banks and the slow adjustment of monetary policy in the wake of the Mexican crisis, central bank credit rose by more than programmed, and net official international reserves declined by about US$lO million in the first half of 1995, compared with a gain of US$40 million in the program (Table 4). In the second half of 1995, the authorities took measwes that brought the pmgmm back on tmck. In pa&ular, cr&t conditions wem tightened and the hplementation of stmctuml ~fomugainedconsidhbk momentum. As a result, net domestic credit of the Central Bank fell in the second half of 1995, and by end-December it was in line with the program. Net international reserves increased by US$115 million compared with the adjusted program target of US$72 million. 3J The 12-month rate of growth of currency slowed from 37 percent in December 1994 to 21 percent in December 1995, while the growth of broad money also declined sharply (Table 5). The share of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars in broad money declined marginally to 80 l/2 percent. lJ For a more detailed description of the capitalization program and how it compares to traditional privatization see Appendix -- of the Recent Economic Developments paper. 2J In the event the deficit turned out to be 2.0 percent of GDP. 3J Adjusted for additional net revenue from the sale of an electricity distribution company.

Following the closure in November 1994 of two banks that accounted for 11 percent of the assets of the banking system, during 1995 several other banks experienced high and rising levels of nonperforming loans and a decline in deposits. To prevent these difficulties from spreading to other banks, the Central Bank provided some US$lOO million in liquidity credits and allowed an increase of US$37 million in reserve shortfalls during 1995. The Central Bank also was obliged during 1995 to redeem US$130 million of special central bank certificates of deposit issued to the depositors of the banks that were closed in late 1994. To offset these operations, the Central Bank placed official paper in a net amount of about US$210 million, equivalent to 9 l/2 percent of bank deposits at the beginning of the year. Interest rates on U.S. dollar- denominated treasury notes and central bank certificates of deposit rose from 8 l/2 percent at end-December 1994 to 14 l/2 percent in the second half of 1995 (Chart 1). lJ The de&it of the combined public sector is estimated at 2 percent of GDP in 1995, or at its hwestkveloverthepast 15 years. This deficit was in line with the program after adjusting for lower than projected severance payments to public sector employees (2 percent of GDP) 2J and larger than expected proceeds from the sale of an electricity distribution company (l/2 percent of GDP). Public sector savings and capital spending were each about 1 l/2 percentage points of GDP higher than programmed. Current revenue of the combined public sector is estimated at about 26 percent of GDP in 1995, compared with 24 percent of GDP in the program (Table 7). General government revenue was about 1 percent of GDP higher than programmed, reflecting higher social security contributions on account of the postponement of the privatization of the pension system and larger than programmed wage increases, and improvements in tax administration. The operating surplus of the Central Bank also was higher than expected by about 0.5 percent of GDP, as a result of higher interest earnings on official reserves and the replacement of central bank certificates of deposit with treasury bills in the conduct of open market operations. General government current outlays are estimated at about 22 percent of GDP, compared with 21 l/2 percent of GDP in the program. The wage bill was higher owing to a larger than programmed increase for health sector workers and a more general problem of wage drift, and interest payments also were higher (the counterpart of increased use of treasury bills in open market IJ A description of the high degree of dollarization in Bolivia and its impact on the conduct of monetary policy is presented in Appendix IV. 2J Because of the postponement of the capitalization of the state oil company and a smelter until 1996.

Capital expenditure is now estimated at about 9 percent of GDP, compared with about 7 l/2 percent of GDP in the program, mainly on account of higher investment by the public enterprises that remained in the public sector longer than planned. ~thefiscalou#unfor~yearasaw~kinl995wasinlinewith~prognun,t~ deficit was huger than prvg mnmed 0.6percentof ann& GDP. Mng the last quuter of the year by the equivalent of This overrun resulted mainly from a surge in spending by local governments (0.4 percent of GDP) and also some disbursements and outlays for projects in the fourth quarter of 1995 that were advanced from the first quarter of 1996. The 12-month rate of inflation picked up from 8.5 percent in December 1994 to almost 11 percent in June 1995. Following the tightening of monetary policy around midyear, it subsequently declined to 9.5 percent in September 1995. However, in the fourth quarter of.1995 inflation picked up again and the 12-month rate reached 13 l/2 percent in January 1996. The most recent pickup in inflation can be attributed in large part to temporary factors such as increases in world wheat prices, a drought in Bolivia that affected agricultural production, and uncertainty in domestic financial markets. L/ However, the fiscal stimulus in the last quarter of the year may have aggravated demand pressure and inflationary expectations. The growth of output slowed to 3.8 percent in 1995, compared with 4.2 per- cent in 1994 with about half of the slowdown accounted for by the effect of the drought on agricultural output. In December 1995 Paris Club creditors agreed to a stock-of-debt reduction for Bolivia under Naples terms with a 67 percent net present value reduction of all eligible debt. u The agreement applies to debt as of January 1, 1996 and supersedes the 1995-97 flow rescheduling agreed in March 1995. 1/ Overall, the total amount of debt reorganized by Paris Club creditors amounted to about US$980 million, and resulted in a reduction of about US$360 million in the net present value of Bolivia's external debt. The cash relief for the period 1996-98, at about US$lOO million a year, is estimated to have eliminated the financing gaps in that period. Bolivia maintains a unified exchange system in which the exchange rate is determined in daily auctions. The authorities manage the rate based on a number of indicators, including changes in prices and exchange rates in Bolivia's major trading partners, to help maintain competitiveness. During the final months of 1995 nominal exchange rate depreciation was relatively u Food comprises 50 percent of Bolivia's consumer price index. The increase in world wheat prices may explain around 2 percentage points of the increase in inflation in 1995. u For details see Bolivia --ReDort on External Debt Renepotiation (SM/96/12), l/12/96. y See Bolivia--Reoort on External Debt Reneeotiation (SM/95/68), 4/7/95.

On a 12-month basis, the boliviano depreciated by 4.5 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar in 1995, and in real effective terms the currency appreciated by 4.1 percent (Chart 2). The overall balance of payments deficit at US$70 million was in line with the program. Exceptional financing under the Paris Club flow resched- uling that was agreed in March 1995 (US$150 million) and the relief provided through a debt repayment agreement with Brazil (US$33 million) covered Bolivia's financing needs and allowed an accumulation of US$llS million in net international reserves. Gross reserve coverage increased to about six months of imports. The external current account deficit is estimated at US$365 million (about 6 percent of GDP) in 1995, compared with a deficit of US$410 million projected in the program (Table 8). (The trade deficit was smaller than projected but this was more than offset by a shortfall in grants.) At the same time, the capital account surplus was about US$300 million, compared with US$340 million in the program. Amortization was some US$30 million higher than projected on account of exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. Loan disbursements to the nonfinancial public sector were less than projected, mainly because of the postponement of some disbursements linked to progress in capitalization from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, but this was more than compensated by larger private direct investment in the hydrocarbons and tertiary sectors. 2. Structural reforms During 1995 substantial progress was made in implementing Bolivia's ambitious program of structural reform broadly as had been envisaged in the program. As noted above, however, there were difficulties in implementing structural reforms in the first half of 1995, in part because the effect of the Mexican crisis on foreign investor confidence contributed to delays in the capitalization of the large public enterprises. Also the securing of popular support and congressional approval of key legislation needed for capitalization and other reforms took longer than expected. The momentum of reforms picked up markedly around midyear (Table 6). Management of four of the six major public enterprises was awarded to private investors: the national electricity company in June; the national telecommunications company in September; the national airline in October; and the national railways in December. The proceeds from these operations will result in private direct investment in these key sectors of some US$840 million over the next five to seven years (an average of about 1.8 percent of GDP a year over this period). Also, the Government sold an electricity distribution company in August 1995 for US$50 million and 30 smaller enterprises during 1995 for US$12 million.

The law increases the independence of the Bank and makes the pursuit of low inflation the Bank's main objective. In the area of customs reform, the management of six customs warehouses was awarded to a private company in August, and a new draft customs law is expected to be submitted to Congress by September 1996. Reform of the pension system, which originally was to have started in October 1995, is now planned for late 1996 after the capitalization process is completed. Delays also have occurred in the implementation of education reform. u III. The Medium-Term Framework The Government’s m4xhnHenn economic stmtegy seeks to raise natimal savings and investment and improve the allocation of resources, with the objective of cmating the con.&ions for higher sustained economic growth and the alleviation of poverty. This is to be done within the context of j%m financial policies aimed at a progressive &celemtion in the mte of inflation and a buikiup in international reserves. Mom speu~cally, the pmgmn envisages: 0 an-increase in the rate of GDP erowth from about 4 percent in 1995 to about 6 percent by 1998 and 5 percent over the medium term; 0 a reduction in inflation to 5 percent in 1998; 0 continued progress toward external viability; 0 an increase in gross domestic investment from 14 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 18 l/2 percent of GDP in 1998, with the share of private investment in the total rising from about 40 percent to 60 percent during this period. Some two thirds of the projected rise in private investment from 1995 to 1998 is expected to result from a strong increase in foreign direct investment associated with the capitalization of the public enter- prises; 0 an increase in national savines (including official transfers) from 8.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to about 10 percent of GDP in 1998, with the increase coming largely from the private sector. The capitalization program will transfer savings capacity from the public to the private sectors, and the pension reform also is expected to help raise private savings; I-J Several elements of the Education Reform Law that was approved in 1994 are opposed by the teachers' union, including increased flexibility for dismissing teachers whose performance does not meet minimal levels and the possibility of making union membership optional. Pending resolution of these issues, the Government has concentrated its efforts in the education area on providing for community participation in the oversight of schools and on strengthening curricula.

This widening would be fully financed by associated inflows of foreign direct investment. Subsequently, the current account deficit is projected to decline markedly. Excluding imports associated with the capitalization process, the underlying external current account balance is estimated to narrow from 5.3 percent of GDP in 1996 to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1998. IV. The Program for 1996 The program for 1996 envisages the completion of the capitalization process and substantial progress in reforms of the health, education, and pension systems. The program assumes a pickup in output growth to 5 percent as major private investments in the capitalized firms begin, and the agricultural sector is expected to rebound from the drought in 1995. The program also envisages the maintenance of restrained financial policies particularly in the area of the public finances. On that basis, and assuming the reversal of the temporary factors that affected inflation toward the end of 1995, the program aims to reduce 12-month inflation to 8 percent by end-1996 and to increase net international reserves by US$60 million during 1996 (Chart 3). In the event that inflation does not slow as programmed over the next few months, fiscal policy will be strengthened significantly in midyear. 1. Fiscal oolicv For 1996 the public sector deficit will be limited to 2.6 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP envisaged for 1996 in the medium-term plan set out for the three-year ESAF arrangement in late 1994. The maintenance of a restrained fiscal policy in 1996 is to be attained principally through a restrictive expenditure policy, particularly on wages, and through increased taxation of the hydrocarbon sector. The authorities have reduced the deficit target relative to the original program to combat inflation. The program provides for a reversal of the slippage in fiscal policy that occurred in the final months of 1995, and the deficit in the first half of the year will be limited to 2 percent of GDP in that period. It also provides for the adoption of contingency measures in the fiscal area in the event the inflation does not decelerate as anticipated by midyear. The deficit is expected to be fully financed from concessional external resources. a. Revenue nolicies and taxation of hydrocarbons sector Current revenue of the nonfinancial public sector (including the operating surpluses of the public enterprises and the Central Bank) is projected to decline from 26.2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 24.8 percent of GDP in 1996. General government current revenue is projected to increase from Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - 22.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 23.3 percent of GDP in 1996, while capital revenue would decline from 0.8 percent of GDP in 1995 to 0.3 percent of GDP in 1996, mainly reflecting the sale of enterprises that belong to the Regional Development Corporations. The operating surplus of the public enterprises is projected to decline from 2.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to 1 percent of GDP in 1996 as a result of severance payments (0.8 percent of GDP) and the transfer of some of the enterprises (and their surpluses) to the private sector through capitalization. (As noted below, investment by the capitalized enterprises will also be undertaken by the private sector, and the overall outturn of the enterprises that remain in the public sector is projected to remain about in balance.) The operating surplus of the Central Bank is expected to decline from 0.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 0.5 percent of GDP in 1996, mainly as a result of the higher interest payments it will be making as a result of open market operations. During most of 1995.the Treasury was paying interest on Treasury notes issued for purposes of monetary policy without receiving interest on its deposits. Subsequent to discussions with an MAE mission in November 1995, the Central Bank has been paying the interest on additional Treasury notes issued for purposes of monetary policy. The current revenue of the general government is projected to rise despite the elimination of the tax on the net worth of enterprises (which yielded 0.7 percent of GDP), as receipts from the hydrocarbon sector are projected to increase by 0.4 percent of GDP while other taxes are projected to rise because of improvements in the administration of customs and domestic taxes and the reinstatement of mining royalties. The capitaliza- tion and deregulation of the hydrocarbons sector is being accompanied by measures to strengthen the revenue contribution of the sector from 5.9 per- cent of GDP in 1995 to 6.3 percent of GDP in 1996. Excise taxes on petro- leum products were raised in January 1996, increasing consumer prices for these products by a weighted average of 16 percent. The new hydrocarbons law that is currently under discussion by Congress specifies, inter alia, the upstream tax regime for the sector after the capitalization of the national oil company (YPFB) in June 1996 (see paragraph 9 of the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies). The proposed tax regime is in line with the recommendations of a technical assistance mission from the Fiscal Affairs Department in November 1995. Efforts to improve tax and customs administration will continue in 1996. As part of the reorganization of the internal revenue office, a unit will be assigned by June 1996 to monitor hydrocarbon revenues. In addition, the control of large taxpayers will be strengthened by the establishment of a unit at the national level to cover the largest 500 taxpayers throughout the country that generate approximately 75 percent of all revenue, and three regional large taxpayer units will be established during 1996. Furthermore, the Government is developing comprehensive customs legislation that it intends to submit to Congress by August 1996, which will allow a better coordination of information on taxpayers by internal revenue officers and customs officials.

RxDenditure policies Total expenditure of the nonfinancial public sector is projected to decline from 31 percent of GDP in 1995 to 30 percent of GDP in 1996. Current expenditure of the general government is projected to rise slightly to 21.9 percent of GDP in 1996, while capital expenditure of the nonfinancial public sector would decline by 1.1 percentage point of GDP to 8.0 percent of GDP in 1996. An essential part of the program to limit public expenditures will be the application of a firm wage policy. The increase in the general government wage bill will be limited to 10 percent in 1996 and relative to GDP the wage bill is projected to decline from 9.2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 8.8 percent of GDP in 1996. In light of the overrun in the wage bill in 1995, the authorities recognize that additional steps need to be taken to ensure that these expenditures are kept within their initial budgetary allocation. To this end, monthly allocations for wages by ministry have been established and will be monitored by the Ministry of Finance, and ministries will be subject to monthly cash limits on their wage outlays. FAD is providing technical assistance in this area, and steps to improve payroll administration on a more permanent basis will be implemented by June 1996. With respect to capital expenditure, investment by the general govern- ment is projected to increase 0.5 percentage point of GDP to 7.2 percent of GDP in 1996, with a shift of investment toward the social sectors and infrastructure. Capital spending of the public enterprises will decline, as investment by the capitalized enterprises will shift to the private sector. Following the unexpected overruns in spending in late 1995, the Government is taking steps to strengthen the monitoring and control of spending by local governments. Regulations were issued in January 1996 requiring the departments to deposit all proceeds from revenue sharing in separate accounts, which will allow better auditing of spending. A special unit will be created in the Ministry of Finance to monitor these expendi- tures, with the goal of ensuring that funds allocated to local governments through revenue sharing are spent on schools, roads, and infrastructure projects consistent with the national policy set in the budget. C. Continaencv clans The program provides for contingency measures that would be implemented by mid-1996 in consultation with Fund staff if inflation does not decline as programmed. Specifically, if cumulative consumer price inflation from the start of 1996 exceeds 6.1 percent by end-April or by end-May 1996, the authorities will activate measures sufficient to reduce the deficit by a further 0.5 percentage point of GDP, lowering the deficit limit for the year to 2.1 percent of GDP. The contingency measures would consist primarily of a reduction in capital spending and some increase in revenue.

Credit policy Credit policy will be geared to achieving the inflation and balance of payments targets of the program through the control of the net domestic assets of the Central Bank. The growth of currency issue is expected to slow to about 12 percent during 1996 (in line with the projected rise in nominal income during the year), and the net domestic assets of the Central Bank are programmed to decline during 1996 consistent with the targeted increase in net international reserves of US$60 million. The credit program will be implemented primarily through open-market operations, and the Central Bank will continue to develop the secondary market in treasury notes as the main instrument of monetary management. The net placement of treasury notes and central bank certificates of deposit is projected at US$80 million in 1996. Measures that are being taken to strengthen the banking system are expected to bolster the demand for money balances, and broad money is projected to increase by about 15 percent during 1996. On this basis, credit to the private sector would grow somewhat faster than GDP, supporting the pickup in private investment. The credit program envisages official support to the commercial banks of about US$200 million during 1996, which would help restructure and recapitalize four banks. Central bank support to banks for the year has been projected at US$lSO million (including up to US$llO million for the purchase of bank assets and possible partial compen- sation of depositors, and US$40 million in loans to a special fund (FONDESIF) created in September 1995 to help capitalize the banks). The Government also intends to borrow about US$SO million in 1996 from multi- lateral institutions to finance the operations of FONDESIF. More than three quarters of the central bank support to banks will be immediately sterilized as the funds will be first used to reconstitute bank reserves and repay liquidity credit to the Central Bank. Banks applying for support will be required to obtain fresh capital from new owners or through merger; to replace or strengthen management; and to write off or provision nonperforming loans. u On this basis, applicant banks are required to develop a quantified program of improvements in their operations to be monitored and reviewed by FONDESIF on a semi- annual basis. Strengthening of the banking system will continue as the banks comply with the requirements of the new Central Bank law to raise the capital to assets ratio from 8 to 10 percent, to apply Base1 standards for asset evaluation, and to eliminate lending to related parties over the next three years. The Central Bank intends to implement revised regulations on reserve requirements by mid-1996. The changes are intended to unify and u About US$40 million will be provided in fresh capital by new share- holders. The restructuring program for one of the distressed banks was approved by new shareholders, the Central Bank, and the Superintendency of Banks in January 1996.

A new nonbank financial inter- mediary (NAFIBO), which is a joint venture of the Government and private investors, will take over from the Central Bank the on-lending of develop- ment funds to commercial banks starting in May 1996. Shares of NAFIBO will be offered at the La Paz stock exchange starting in May 1997, and the Government is committed to either placing the majority of shares in the private sector or to terminating its financial participation in the corporation, within five years. The authorities are of the view that as credibility becomes more firmly established in their stabilization efforts, the conditions will be in place for a gradual reduction in dollarization (see Appendix IV). Consistent with this approach, they have taken cautious steps to encourage the demand for financial instruments denominated in bolivianos, for example by lowering required reserves on boliviano deposits relative to those on U.S. dollar- denominated deposits. 3. External policies a. Balance of navments and external financing; The overall balance of payments is projected to shift from a deficit of US$70 million in 1995 to a surplus of US$60 million in 1996. The external current account deficit is projected to increase from US$360 million in 1995 to US$580 million (about 9 percent of GDP) in 1996. Excluding imports associated with the capitalization process, the current account deficit would decline somewhat to 5.3 percent of GDP in 1996. Export volumes are projected to rise by 7 percent in 1996, owing in part to increased demand in partner countries and in response to projected favorable price developments particularly for soybeans and zinc. Import volumes would rise by 16 percent reflecting strong growth of capital imports and intermediate goods associated with capitalization (financed by private direct investment). The capital account surplus is projected to rise to US$640 million in 1996. Private inflows would increase mainly on account of higher direct investment, including inflows of US$260 million related to capitalization. Official bilateral and multilateral disbursements also are expected to increase somewhat (owing in part to increased disbursements from the World Bank and IDB linked to capitalization).

Exchanee rate oolicv and the exchanpe and trade svstem Since late 1985 Bolivia has maintained a unified exchange system in which the exchange rate has been determined in daily auctions by the Central Bank. The Central Bank establishes the rate in light of a number of factors, including to help maintain competitiveness taking into account estimates of changes in the real effective exchange rate. The lower inflation environment of the past few years has allowed the authorities to maintain competitiveness with relatively limited recourse to nominal exchange rate depreciation (see Chart 3). Bolivia's exchange rate system has provided flexibility in the face of external shocks, and the Government intends to maintain the present system during the program period. The present level of external competitiveness appears to be broadly appropriate (see Chart 3). All arrears to external creditors have been eliminated, and the Government is committed not to incur any new arrears during the program period. Also, the Government will maintain the trade and payments system free of restrictions. The Government's trade policy will be directed towards pursuing greater regional trade integration while maintaining the current tariff system with a uniform tariff of 5 percent on capital goods imports and 10 percent on all other imports. A multilateralization and deepening of bilateral agreements with Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) was completed in December 1995. Under these agreements, Mercosur countries will apply to Bolivia on a uniform basis the highest margins of preference that had been applied under the previous bilateral agreements; the list of products for which Bolivia receives nonreciprocal preferences will be harmonized across Mercosur countries. The Government hopes to conclude negotiations to establish a free trade zone with Mercosur countries before the end of 1996. Bolivia would remain a member of the Andean Pact. 4. Structural reforms in 1996 During 1996 the Government intends to further consolidate the structural reform effort by extending the capitalization process to the hydrocarbons sector and by making further progress in reforms in the education and health sectors and in the social security system. lJ These reforms will be undertaken with the technical and financial support of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). In the hydrocarbons sector, the main objectives are to develop the sector and expand natural gas exports through the elimination of the lJ Structural reforms are described in more detail in the updated Policy Framework Paper.

The program envisages that the exploration and production fields of YPFB will be capitalized as two separate companies, and transport activities will be capitalized as a third company. The awards of management of the three companies are expected to take place in June 1996, and the transfer of operations by September 1996. A refinery and two distribution companies will be sold as three separate companies in late 1996 or early 1997. At the end of the capitalization/privatization process, the role of the state petroleum company will be limited to the management of lease contracts with private investors. In the education sector the main objectives are to improve the quality and provision of basic education. Elements of the reform include improve- ments in curricula, teacher training, and the supply of educational materials; increased access to basic education in rural areas; and the construction of schools and other infrastructure. In the area of health services, the main objective is to improve primary health care. In the area of social security, the coverage of the current pay-as-you- go pension system is poor, administrative costs are high, and the funds are not financially viable in the medium term. Under the reform to be imple- mented beginning in late 1996, the Government plans to establish a noncon- tributory account for each adult Bolivian citizen with the shares of the capitalized public enterprises, which will constitute the basis of a minimum pension for all Bolivians. Also, employees will have a personal contribu- tory account. The Government will submit the pension law to Congress by September 1996, and expects enactment of the law and associated regulations by January 1997. These reforms are aimed at introducing a competitive market for the management of pension savings, with appropriate regulatory and prudential supervision. To strengthen the financial position of the funds, the new pension law provides for increased contribution rates and a rise in the minimum age of retirement. In preparation for the reform, a comprehensive reorganization of the National Public Pension Fund (FOPEBA) and a financial assessment of private complementary funds was begun in 1995 with the replacement of FOPEBA's management, an audit of the pension payrolls, and the computerization of operations. The reorganization of FOPEBA and the audit of most of the private funds is expected to be completed by June 1996. 5. Poverty and social orozrams Despite some improvement in social indicators in recent years, Bolivia remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Official estimates for 1992 indicate that 70 percent of the population was living in poverty, of which half in extreme poverty. About 95 percent of the rural population (which is mainly indigenous) were classified as poor in 1992 (compared with 98 percent in 1976) and 53 percent of the urban population (66 percent in 1976). The Government's strategy to alleviate poverty is Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - based on raising the rate of economic growth, while expanding the coverage and quality of basic education and health. Safety net programs include the Social Investment Fund (FIS) which channels external funding to meet basic needs in health, water supply, sanitation, and education in the poorest communities; the Mother-Child Health Care Program; the Food and Nutritional Vigilance Program (PROVIAN); the Integrated Child Development Program (PIDI) which seeks to improve nutrition, health and education for urban and suburban poor children; and the Program for the Development of Indigenous People. The Government has received strong support for these programs in the form of grants and concessional loans from the World Bank, IDB, and bilateral creditors. Other policies in the social sectors are detailed in the up&ted PFP. 6. Benchmarks and nerformance criteria The program includes quarterly financial benchmarks on the deficit of the combined public sector and the domestic financing of the deficit; on the net domestic assets and net international reserves of the Central Bank; and on net disbursements of public and publicly guaranteed external debt (Table 11). 1/ These financial benchmarks are performance criteria for June 1995. Also, the authorities are committed not to incur arrears nor to introduce or intensify restrictions in the exchange and trade system. The program also includes benchmarks to monitor progress with respect to structural reforms (Table 12). Capitalization of the National Petroleum Company, and the restructuring of banks in distress are structural perfor- mance criteria. The midterm review of the program, which is to be completed before end-September 1996, will assess program implementation with particular emphasis on the possible need for a further strengthening in fiscal policy and on progress in the area of structural reform as indicated in para- graph 29 of the authorities' policy memorandum. V. Medium-Term Balance of Pavments and Canacitv to ReDaY the Fund 1. Balance of navments outlook The baseline balance of payments projections for 1996-2005 incorporate the terms of the December 1995 Paris Club debt reduction and restructuring. Together with the strong adjustment and structural reform program that is being implemented, this operation improves the prospects for a gradual return to balance of payments viability as envisaged in the program for the u The limits on external debt apply to all borrowing with a grant element of less than 35 percent, regardless of maturity. This is intended to help maintain the recent improvement in the debt service profile.

In the baseline projections the external current account deficit is projected to rise from 6 percent of GDP in 1995 to a peak of almost 10 per- cent of GDP in 1997 before declining gradually to about 4 percent by the end of the projection period (Table 13). Export volumes are projected to grow by about 6 percent a year through the year 2005, as metal and nontraditional exports are expected to rise following increased private sector investment and reflecting increased access to regional markets. 2J At the same time, the growth of imports is expected to reflect the strong flows of private foreign direct investment related to the capitalization process. Excluding imports related to these investments, import volumes would grow in line with real GDP in the medium term. Based on the latest World Economic Outlook projections the terms of trade are projected to show a modest improvement through 2000, and are assumed unchanged thereafter. The medium-term projections are affected to an important extent by the capitalization of public enterprises. Foreign private sector investment in the enterprises is expected to total about USS1.6 billion in 1996-2002 (or an average of 3.4 percent of GDP a year). This investment is expected to result in increased imports of capital and intermediate goods during 1996-2002 and to generate investment income in the outer years. Excluding imports related to the capitalization process, the current account deficit would decline to 5.3 percent of GDP in 1996, and 4.6 percent in 1998. The projections assume that disbursements of official grants and loans would decline from a peak of US$530 million (9 percent of GDP) in 1995 to about US$480 million (6.4 percent of GDP) in 1998, while private capital inflows would rise gradually. It is assumed that most of the external financing for the public sector would continue to be on highly concessional terms through the end of the projection period. I-J The balance of payments and debt- and debt-service projections are similar to those presented in Bolivia-- Medium-Term Prosnects and Debt Sustainability (EBS/95/172, Supplement l), 11/20/95. The main differences are: the current projection incorporates the terms of the December 1995 Paris Club stock-of-debt operation; higher growth of imports by 0.5 percent- age point a year so that imports over the entire projection period grow in line with GDP; and the spreading of direct investment (and imports) related to the capitalization process over a longer period. World Bank staff have indicated that they are in agreement with the growth projections over the next few years. However, they view a sustained rate of growth of 5 percent in the medium term to be on the optimistic side. 2J In the past several years, various projects have been proposed for exporting natural gas to Brazil, but the medium-term projections do not take account of such projects. Negotiations related to these investments advanced in 1995 but a final agreement is still pending as the possible sources of financing have not been identified. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - Beginning in 1996 modest balance of payments surpluses are projected after taking into account expected private and official capital flows. This outturn would allow for an accumulation of reserves that would maintain the gross reserves coverage at above five months of imports during the projec- tion period. 2. External debt and debt sustainability At end-1995 Bolivia's external public debt was estimated at USS4.8 billion (Table 14). In present value terms, the debt was an estimated USS2.8 billion, equivalent to about 46 percent of GDP and 221 percent of exports of goods and services. Under the baseline balance of payments projections, the public sector debt burden would decline gradually from 79 percent of GDP at end-1995 to 47 percent by 2005. The debt-service ratio would decline from 41 percent of exports in 1995 to 27 percent in 1996 and 15 percent by 2005. On the assumption that the ratio of government revenue to GDP remains unchanged at its current level of 26 percent, the ratio of external debt service to government revenue would fall from 33 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in 2005. The stock-of-debt reduction and restructuring under Naples terms agreed with Paris Club creditors in December 1995 provides more debt relief than was envisaged in the original program supported by the first annual ESAF arrangement by about US$SO million a year during the period 2000-2003 and about US$30 million a year during 2004-2008. The debt-service ratio stays high for the next few years despite the relief provided by the stock-of-debt operation by Paris Club creditors. However, with strong policy implementation and the absence of external shocks Bolivia's financing needs can probably be managed in the medium term without further exceptional financing. The projections are sensitive to changes in key external variables (Table 15). If the growth of nontraditional export volumes were 1 percentage point lower than in the baseline scenario, the debt-service ratio would be 0.5 percentage point higher in 1996-2005. I/ If metal export prices were LO percent lower than in the baseline scenario, the debt- service ratio would be 0.8 percent higher. 2J The debt-service ratio would increase by a similar magnitude if foreign official transfers were to decline 5 percentage points faster than under the baseline scenario or if all new borrowing were on nonconcessional terms. Foreign direct investment related to capitalization can be projected with some confidence because the new investors make capital contributions equivalent to the investment they have committed to make. However, if foreign direct investment not related to capitalization were to remain at I-J One percentage point lower volume growth of nontraditional exports would lower the overall volume growth of exports by l/2 percentage point. 2J Metal export prices that are 10 percent lower than in the baseline reduces the total value of exports by about 4 percent each year. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - about US$210 million a year from 1996 to 2005 (rather than rising by 5 percent a year as projected in baseline), annual real GDP growth (and import volume growth) could be expected to drop back to about 4 percent a year during 1999-2005. By the year 2005, the current account deficit would be about 3 percent of GDP, compared with 4 percent of GDP in the baseline projection. 3. Canacitv to renav the Fund Assuming full disbursements under the second and third annual arrange- ments under the ESAF, Bolivia's borrowing from the Fund would amount to about 6 percent of gross financing needs in 1996 and 1997 (Table 16). Bolivia's debt-service payments to the Fund would rise to 24 percent of quota in 1998 and subsequently decline to about 14 percent of quota by 2005. In relation to exports of goods and services, Bolivia's debt service to the Fund would increase from 2.6 percent in 1996 to about 3 percent in 1998 and decline to about 1 percent by the end of the projection period. Bolivia has an excellent record of payments to the Fund. Given the authorities' commitment to adjustment and the projected maintenance of an adequate level of international reserves, Bolivia should be able to meet its financial obligations to the Fund on a timely basis. VI. Staff Annraisal Within the framework of the present ESAF arrangement, Bolivia has been implementing a comprehensive program to stabilize and restructure the economy. As a result, real GDP growth has been maintained at about 4 per- cent, major structural reforms have been initiated, significant progress has been made toward external viability, and inflation has been moderate. Notwithstanding these achievements, poverty remains widespread and the growth rates achieved so far imply only very gradual improvements in living standards; and the economy‘ remains vulnerable to adverse external develop- ments. In addition, there has been a pickup in inflation in recent months. It will be important in the period ahead that the authorities maintain prudent financial policies as planned to avoid a resurgence of inflation that could put at risk the expected benefits from the authorities' ambitious structural reform effort. The authorities are intensifying the implementation of policies aimed at fostering savings and private investment and improving the efficiency of resource use. In recent months, the Government has restored momentum to its program of structural reforms, including the transfer of a major part of the public enterprise sector to private managers. The staff welcomes the authorities' determination to complete the process by capitalizing the national oil company in 1996. The further consolidation of the structural reform program should set the basis for a fundamental restructuring of the economy and should place Bolivia on a higher medium-term growth path. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to sound fiscal and monetary policies with a view to scaling down inflation. The fiscal deficit in 1995 was in line with the program and was the lowest in the past fifteen years. However, there was a sizable overrun in the deficit in the fourth quarter of the year. The authorities have already taken measures to reverse the slippage; this action represents a significant tightening of fiscal policy and signals the Government's determination to ensure that inflation declines as programmed. Moreover, in the event inflation does not decline as anticipated by midyear, the authorities are committed to introduce additional fiscal measures to which end contingency fiscal measures are included in the program. In any event, the authorities are aiming at limiting the fiscal deficit for 1996 to a level that can be fully financed from concessional external resources. Restraint in granting increases in public sector wages will be key to meeting the program's fiscal objectives. In particular, it is essential that the planned measures to strengthen payroll management be implemented firmly to prevent a recurrence of overruns in the general government wage bill and that local government expenditure be monitored carefully to make sure that spending remains within the national budget. Substantial changes in the tax regime applied to the hydrocarbons sector are planned in connec- tion with the capitalization of the state oil company, and the effect of these changes will need to be monitored carefully to make sure that fiscal revenue from the sector increases as projected. The staff notes that pension system reform has been postponed until late 1996 and there have been delays in implementing education reform. It will be important to accelerate progress in these key social areas. Problems in the banking system re-emerged in 1995 following the difficulties experienced in the latter part of 1994. The authorities are addressing these difficulties in part through a fund established to capitalize and restructure commercial banks. The workout plans should require changes in management, contributions from shareholders, and the possibility of merger or closures, as appropriate, to ensure that the cost to the Government of these operations is minimized. The authorities are urged to move without delay to resolve the problems of those banks that are seriously undercapitalized to bolster confidence in the banking system. The authorities are to be commended for their commitment to an open and liberal trade system. Many of the conditions are now in place for the growth and diversification of Bolivia's export base, and it will be essential to maintain the country's external competitiveness. The exchange system based on central bank auctions has worked well in recent years and has permitted Bolivia to adapt to large external shocks.. The authorities have indicated that they intend to maintain the flexibility of the exchange rate system and to continue to support this policy with fiscal and credit policies aimed at scaling back inflation.

With this debt relief and continued substantial external support in the form of grants and concessional loans in the next several years, prospective financing gaps are projected to have been eliminated and it is not expected that Bolivia will require further debt relief. However, the balance of payments continues to be vulnerable to external shocks, and it will be essential for the authorities to continue with their policies to maintain strict monetary and fiscal discipline and to adapt policies quickly to changing external circumstances. At the same time, the staff urges the authorities to continue to limit strictly borrowing on commercial terms to sustain the recent improvement in the debt- service profile. In sum, the staff welcomes the authorities' bold reform initiatives and their intention to bring inflation back to a downward path. The staff regards the policy objectives and measures incorporated in the program as appropriate and recommends approval of the authorities' request for a second annual arrangement under the ESAP. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bolivia be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Bolivia has several statistical publications but there is no fully articu- lated publication policy. a. National accounts Annual national accounts &ta are prepared by the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Estimates of nominal GDP and expenditure components have been revised frequently and have been affected by unreliable estimates of the contribution of informal and illegal activities and their impact on the expenditure accounts. Fund missions have been estimating nominal GDP and expenditure components on the basis of information received from the author- ities; the staff estimates have been discussed with the authorities and used for program purposes. During 1994-95, INE received technical assistance from the Statistics Department of the Fund to help improve the national accounts estimates and the recommendations are being implgmented. As a result of these recommendations the national accounts estimates have become more reliable and a program for the regular dissemination of the data has been established. In the future, improved basic data collection should become a priority. b. Prices The consumer price &ta are collected by INE and cover prices in five cities. The consumer price index (CPI) has 1991 as the base year, and is published by INE on a timely basis. The producer price data are collected for manufacturing, mining, electricity, and hydrocarbon products, and INE expects to start collecting producer price &ta for agriculture during 1996. This would allow computation of a general producer price index starting in 1997. C. Data on nublic finances The staff is provided with current information on revenue, current and investment spending, and its financing for the Consolidated Central Government (Central Government and decentralized entities), public enter- prises and the Central Bank, with appropriate disaggregation, on a monthly basis and with a short lag. The public sector financial reporting system (SAFCO) was established with financial and technical assistance from the World Bank. The National Secretariat of Finance also provides the staff with data on certain revenue accruing to the military, which finances spending that is not captured in the budget. INE estimates that up to 25 percent of externally financed capital expenditure recorded by SAFCO as investment represents current expenditure of project implementation, and the staff has been making appropriate adjustments in estimating the savings- investment balances.

Commercial banks' data are collected by the Superintendency of banks and they become available with a lag of six- eight weeks. The coverage of banks in the monetary survey is comprehensive, and in 1995 the Central Bank also started to monitor and provide the staff with data on the operations of mutual funds.

Issues discussed include policies to reduce the degree of dollarization, and the adequacy of official international reserves. 1. Origins and extent of dollarization Rapid remonetization in Bolivia since the mid-1980s has been accompa- nied by increasing dollarization. The forced conversion of foreign currency denominated deposits into domestic currency deposits at a highly appreciated exchange rate in 1982-83 and hyperinflation during 1984-85 resulted in a decline of broad money from about 20 percent of GDP at end-1981 to about 10 percent of GDP at end-1985. As an element of the strong stabilization and liberalization program introduced in August 19.85, Bolivian residents were again permitted to hold U.S. dollar-denominated deposits, and by end- 1986 these deposits accounted for 61 percent of total bank deposits. Also in 1987 checking accounts in U.S. dollars were authorized. During most of the period 1985-91, the ex-post effective interest rate differential favored U.S. dollar-denominated deposits as higher nominal interest rates for boliviano deposits only partly compensated for exchange rate depreciation (Chart 1). While broad money rose steadily from 10 per- cent at end-1985 to 45 percent of GDP at end-1995, the share of U.S. dollar deposits rose to 93 percent of total bank deposits (Table 1). The share of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars in broad money (i.e. including currency) was about 81 percent. IJ During most of this period the imple- mentation of macroeconomic policies was generally good and inflation was declining, from hyperinflation in 1985 to 12 l/2 percent at end-1995. Stabilization was accompanied by the return of flight capital, reflected in increases in U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the domestic banking system. Banks maintained a balanced foreign currency position, and the expansion of deposits denominated in dollars was accompanied by rapid growth in credit to the private sector denominated in U.S. dollars during 1986-94. Some 96 percent of bank lending in Bolivia also is denominated in U.S. dollars. u The small spread between the selling and buying rates for the U.S. dollar facilitates substitution between the two currencies. Notwithstanding a high degree of currency substitution, the boliviano and the U.S. dollar u By comparison, the same measure of dollarization was 43 percent in Argentina, 63 percent in Peru, and 74 percent in Uruguay at end-1995. a Lending in domestic currency is limited to small amounts at short maturities. The spreads between deposit and lending rates in bolivianos are much higher than the spreads related to operations in dollars and the limited demand for such loans comes from small artisans who have little collateral.

The boliviano serves as a unit of account and means of payment for wages, taxes, services and purchases of goods of small unit value, while the U.S. dollar is preferred as a store of value, and as the unit of account and means of payment for high unit value purchases (real estate and durable goods). 2. The conduct of monetarv nolicv Open market operations are the main instrument of monetary policy in Bolivia. These operations are primarily conducted in U.S. dollar-denomi- nated paper with some 90 percent of open market bills and notes outstanding at end-1995 denominated in U.S. dollars. One half of this paper was held by the nonbank private sector. u Payment for these instruments is made in U.S. dollars, which is reflected in an increase in international reserves, either directly or through an increase in U.S. dollar-denominated deposits of the Treasury at the Central Bank. u The effectiveness of monetary policy in Bolivia has been limited owing to the openness of the capital account of the balance of payments and the pursuit of an exchange rate policy that aims at maintaining the real effective exchange rate. Rough estimates of the offset coefficients for Bolivia by an MAE mission, however, indicate that the placement of U.S. dollar-denominated paper has been effective in reducing liquidity in Bolivia and raising the margin between U.S. dollar interest rates in Bolivia relative to U.S. dollar interest rates abroad, at least over a short term. y Estimates of the offset coefficients for the period March 1988 to June 1994 show that a change in net domestic assets of Bs 100 was offset by a change in net foreign assets of Bs 74 and of base money by Bs 26. Moreover, the offset coefficient for net foreign assets declined between 1988 and 1994 despite an increase in dollarization in that period. 1/ Starting in December 1993, the 28-day certificates of deposit of the Central Bank have been gradually replaced by 3-month treasury notes. By the end of 1995, treasury notes accounted for about 70 percent of the total stock of official instruments outstanding. In January 1996, 12, 18, and 24- month treasury notes were introduced. Since November 1995, the open market committee has distinguished the treasury notes placed to control liquidity from those that finance the short-term liquidity-needs of the Treasury. The Central Bank is now paying the interest on notes issued for purposes of monetary policy. a Effectively Bolivia operates with two monetary bases, one in domestic currency and one in U.S. dollars, linked by the effective interest rates on deposits in the two currencies. 2/ International Monetary Fund, "Bolivia: Dollarization, Treasury Bill Market, and Foreign Reserves Management--Issues and Recommendations" (Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund, 1994). Offset coefficients measure the extent to which changes in net domestic assets of the Central Bank resulting from open-market operations are offset by opposite changes in net foreign assets or are reflected in changes in base money. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - APPENDIX IV In the wake of the Mexican crisis and in response to uncertainties affecting a number of banks, the Central Bank of Bolivia pursued a rela- tively active monetary policy in 1995. In order to dampen domestic credit expansion, the Central Bank placed official paper in a net amount of about US$210 million in 1995, equivalent to 9 l/2 percent of bank deposits at the beginning of the year. In reflection of this tightening, interest rates on U.S. dollar-denominated treasury notes and central bank certificates of deposit rose from around 8 percent at end-December 1994 to 14 l/2 percent in the second half of 1995 (Chart 2). These operations resulted in an accumulation of gross international reserves for the Central Bank. Tl=Y also resulted in a significant widening of the spread between interest rates on Bolivian U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and those on dollar deposits abroad. As indicated above, commercial banks extend credit denominated in U.S. dollars on the basis of deposits also denominated in U.S. dollars: the credit is a multiple of the reserve base. The stability of the system depends crucially on the adequacy of prudential regulation and supervision of banks to ensure the quality of their loans. J.J A generalized run on bank deposits can quickly become a claim on the country's foreign exchange reserve. 3. Adeauacv of official reserves Bolivia's official international reserves proved adequate to allow the Central Bank to provide support to banks in distress during 1994-95, while limiting the adverse impact on confidence in the banking system. The international reserve coverage of short-term U.S. dollar liabilities of the Central Bank of Bolivia, including outstanding open market instruments (treasury notes and CD's) increased from 85 percent at the end of 1991 to 100 percent at the end of 1993 (Table 2 and Chart 3). 2J Following sizeable support to commercial banks in late 1994 and during 1995, the reserve coverage of central bank short-term liabilities declined to 93 per- cent. At the same time, the coverage of bank deposits rose to 37 percent at the end of 1995, as the growth of bank deposits decelerated. While the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves virtually cover its open market instruments and the monetary base, they cover a much smaller proportion of the banking system's dollar-denominated deposits. J/ See p. 10 of the main text for measures being taken to improve pruden- tial regulation and supervision of banks and to manage workouts for banks in distress. u Official reserves measured with gold valued at USS42.22 per troy ounce. With gold valued at market price in 1995, gross official would cover 125 percent of the central bank short-term liabilities, and about 50 percent of bank deposits at the end of 1995. However, much of Bolivia's gold is not readily marketable.

If the purpose is to assess the adequacy of gross reserve coverage to meet claims on foreign exchange, then these liabilities should be included. 4. Policv issues The staff have discussed with the authorities measures to reduce the degree of dollarization, as well as policies to strengthen the Central Bank's role as lender of last resort in the context of a high degree of dollarization. The authorities are of the view that as credibility in their stabilization efforts becomes more firmly established, the conditions will be in place for a gradual reflow to domestic money. Consistent with this approach, the authorities have placed priority on reducing inflation and they have taken cautious steps to encourage the demand for financial instruments denominated in bolivianos. In May and July 1994, the Central Bank lowered the required reserve ratios on boliviano-denominated deposits and reduced the remuneration on required reserves on U.S. dollar-denominated deposits, thus increasing the relative incentive to commercial banks to seek deposits denominated in bolivianos. Since 1994 depreciation-adjusted interest rates on deposits denominated in bolivianos have been 4-6 per- centage points higher than for those denominated in U.S. dollars (see Chart 1). While the change has been gradual, the data in Table 1 indicate that dollarization declined in both 1994 and 1995 after increasing steadily from 1986 to 1993. The ratio of U.S. dollar-denominated deposits to broad money declined from 83.9 percent at end-1993 to 80.6 percent at end-1995. Given the high degree of dollarization, the question arises whether Bolivia should consider moving to a currency board arrangement. u The reserve coverage of the monetary aggregates indicates that the Central Bank's reserves are close to meeting the requirements of a currency board. Moreover, Bolivia's small domestic currency base implies that Bolivia has limited receipts to gain from the "inflation tax". However, Bolivia's considerable vulnerability to external shocks would suggest that it is not in a position to forego the use of the exchange rate as an instrument of adjustment policy. Further, the difficult state of Bolivia's banking system would argue against limiting the Central Bank's role as a lender of last resort. Bolivia could experience significant output loss if the authorities attempted to bring down inflation quickly from its present level to that required to sustain a currency board. u Consistent with the Fund's balance of payments methodology, these liabilities would only be considered as external debt if they were held by foreign residents. 2/ A currency board consists of the commitment to a fixed exchange rate backed up by monetary policy that requires that the money base or otherwise defined monetary liabilities be fully covered by international reserves.

Such a policy could help strengthen confidence and enable the financial system to operate with lower interest rates. Along these lines, the Central Bank is preparing changes in reserve requirement policy that are intended to include establishment of a remunerated liquidity requirement, which would generate a pool of inter- national reserves to be available for providing liquidity credits to banks. The high degree of dollarization limits the extent to which the exchange rate can be used as an instrument of policy, particularly in affecting the stock of financial savings of the private sector. Neverthe- less, wages are paid in domestic currency and, as a practical matter, nominal wages are not flexible in a downward direction. Thus flexibility of the exchange rate provides a margin for affecting real wages. In this context, the authorities consider that the current exchange rate system in which the rate is determined in daily auctions has served Bolivia well. They intend to preserve the margin of flexibility that the system provides as long as inflation remains above the level of industrial countries. In current circumstances, the adoption of a fixed exchange rate could initially lead to a real appreciation of the boliviano and have an adverse impact on exports and employment. Also, an external shock could result in a weakening in Bolivia's external position and growth prospects.

The attached memorandum on economic and financial policies reviews the policy implementation and developments under the first annual arrangement under the ESAF that expired in December 1995 and describes the objectives and policies that the Government intends to pursue during 1996 for the second annual arrangement under the current three-year ESAF arrangement for Bolivia. In support of these objectives and policies, the Government of Bolivia hereby requests the second annual arrangement under the ESAF in an amount equivalent to SDR 33.66 million. 2. The Government of Bolivia believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached memorandum on economic and financial policies are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. Bolivia will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of measures that may be appro- priate, at the initiative of Bolivia or whenever the Managing Director requests such consultation. In particular, Bolivia will conduct with the Fund a midterm review of its annual program before the end of September 1996. Sincerely yours, -s/ Fernando Candia Minister of Finance /s/ Juan Antonio Morales President Central Bank of Bolivia Attachment: Memorandum on economic and financial policies of Bolivia in 1996 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 61 - ATTACHMENT III Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies of Bolivia in 1996 1. Following a period of severe macroeconomic imbalances that culminated in hyperinflation in 1984-85, in August 1985 the Government of Bolivia adopted a far-reaching program to restore price stability and reform the economy. The economic program has been supported by a series of financial arrangements from the Fund, most recently by a three-year arrange- ment under the ESAF, and the first annual arrangement thereunder that ended in December 1995. The three-year ESAF arrangement supports a second generation of structural reforms focused on the transfer of the management and ownership of key public sector enterprises to the private sector through a process of capitalization; and reforms of the health, education, and pension systems. The 1995 economic nrozram 2. The Government's program for 1995 aimed to reduce inflation to 6 l/2 percent and to raise net international reserves by US$40 million, while real GDP was assumed to grow by 4 l/2 percent. Tax measures were adopted to help cover the costs of structural reforms (especially labor liabilities in the enterprises that were to be capitalized), and the public sector deficit was expected to be fully covered by concessional external financing. 3. Real GDP growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 1995, reflecting the effect of a drought on agricultural output and the effect of tight financial policies needed to offset the impact of the liquidation of two banks in November 1994 and the Mexican crisis. Notwithstanding the slower than anticipated rate of economic growth, the 12-month rate of inflation rose to 12 l/2 percent by December 1995 mainly on account of markedly higher cereal import costs and the effect of the drought on food prices. Net interna- tional reserves rose by US$115 million in 1995, or by US$43 million more than targeted (after adjusted as provided in the program for the proceeds from the sale of small- and medium-size enterprises). The relative tight- ening in financial policies in 1995 is reflected in a reduction of the deficit of the combined public sector from 3.2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 2.0 percent of GDP in 1995, or to its lowest level in the past 15 years. The result for the public deficit was only marginally higher than the 1.9 percent of GDP in the program. 4. The Government's capitalization/privatization program has been successfully launched in 1995, setting the basis for a fundamental restruc- turing of the economy. Four of the six major public enterprises--the electricity company, the telecommunications company, the national airline and railways --were transferred to private investors. This will result in private direct investment of some US$840 million over the next five to seven years, which should provide the basis for Bolivia to move to a higher medium-term growth path. The 1996 economic nrozram 5. The Government remains fully committed to the medium-term strategy set out in its Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies of November 29, 1994. This strategy aims at raising national savings and improving the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ATTACHMENT III allocation of resources to create the conditions for higher sustained growth within the context of policies aimed at scaling down inflation. Other key objectives of the program are the development of human capital, the allevia- tion of poverty, and the conservation of the country's ecological balance. 6. The Government's economic program for 1996 assumes a pickup of real growth to about 5 percent as major private investments resulting from capitalization, particularly in the electricity and telecommunications sectors, are expected to begin and the agricultural sector is expected to rebound from the drought experienced in 1995. The program also aims to reduce the 12-month rate of inflation to 8 percent by end-1996 and to strengthen Bolivia's external position. To this end, a tight stance of financial policies is to be maintained throughout the year. In the event that the one-time factors affecting inflation over the past several months are not reversed, fiscal policy will be significantly strengthened by midyear. Fiscal nolicv 7. For 1996, the Government has presented to Congress a budget with a deficit of the combined public sector equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP, of which 0.8 percent of GDP represents one-time payments of labor liabilities to workers in enterprises being capitalized. During the last quarter of 1995, there were overruns in expenditure that raised the deficit in the quarter to 2 l/2 percent of annual GDP. The Government is committed to reverse the deviations in the first half of 1996 as a result of which a significantly tighter stance of fiscal policy will be in evidence in the first half of 1996 in relation to the last quarter of 1995. In line with progress that has already been made to limit the deficit in the first quarter of 1996, the Government has established quarterly limits on the deficit of the combined public sector through December 1996, as shown in Table 1. The targeted deficit is expected to be fully covered by con- cessional external financing, including the debt relief that has been granted by Paris Club creditors. Quarterly sublimits on net domestic financing of the combined public sector through December 1996 are also shown in Table 1. 8. General government revenue is projected to increase to 23.3 per- cent of GDP in 1996 from 22.9 percent of GDP in 1995. Measures have been taken to strengthen revenue in 1996, that will more than offset the decline in revenue resulting from the elimination of the tax on the net worth of enterprises (IEPE). Mining royalties have been reinstated (0.2 percent of GDP), and changes in the tax regime for hydrocarbons are expected to yield additional revenue from the sector equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP. Also, revenue will continue to be strengthened by improvements in the adminis- tration of customs and domestic taxes, with efficiency increases of 2 and 3 percent, respectively, assumed for 1996. 9. In connection with the capitalization and deregulation of the hydrocarbons sector, the Government has adopted tax measures that will raise fiscal revenue from the sector from 5.9 percent of GDP in 1995 to 6.3 per- cent of GDP in 1996. Excise taxes on petroleum products were raised in January 1996, increasing consumer prices for these products by a weighted average of 16 percent. These excise taxes will yield revenues equivalent to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - ATTACHMENT III 2.6 percent of GDP in 1996, more than offsetting losses in hydrocarbon royalties (2.3 percent of GDP). The new hydrocarbons law, which is currently under discussion by Congress specifies, inter alia, the tax regime for the sector after the capitalization of YPFB. The main elements of the new tax regime are: (i) a 35 percent national royalty on production from existing oil and gas fields (old hydrocarbons); (ii) a 3 percent national royalty on production from new oil and gas fields (new hydrocarbons) and on old hydrocarbons; and (iii) a 12 percent departmental royalty on old and new hydrocarbons earmarked for local governments. Producers of oil and gas will also be subject to the general tax regime (corporate income tax, tax on remittances, the transactions tax, and VAT), and an additional 25 percent income surtax (to be introduced in the general tax regime). The corporate income tax, tax on remittances, and income surtax will be creditable against half of the national royalty on old hydrocarbons. 10. Steps to improve tax and customs administration will be inten- sified in 1996 as part of a reorganization of the internal revenue office. A unit at the internal revenue office will be assigned to monitor hydro- carbon revenues, and the control of large taxpayers will be strengthened by the establishment of a centralized unit covering the largest 500 taxpayers that generate approximately 75 percent of all revenues. To improve the efficiency of the customs administration and enhance revenue collection, the Government will submit to Congress by August 1996 comprehensive customs legislation, which will clarify the responsibilities of each part of the tax administration and allow a better coordination of information on taxpayers by internal revenue officers and customs officials. 11. A corporate income tax that has been in effect since January 1995 generated tax obligations in 1995 that will be payable in 1996. However, there will be no net increase in revenue, as corporate income tax payments are creditable against transactions tax obligations. The Government will monitor all aspects of changes in the tax structure resulting from the shift of the major public enterprises to the private sector and will consider changes if needed to increase tax revenue and to achieve its fiscal targets. 12. A critical part of the program to limit public expenditures will be the application of a firm wage policy. For 1996 the increase in the general government wage bill will be limited to 10 percent. The capital- ization process is expected to lower the wage bill of public enterprises from 2.1 percent of GDP in 1995 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 1996, while the general government wage bill would decline from 9.2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 8.8 percent of GDP in 1996. As a result of these policies, the wage bill of the public sector would decline from 11.2 percent of GDP in 1995 to 10 percent of GDP in 1996. 13. Steps will be taken to prevent overruns in the public sector wage bill. Monthly allocations for wages by ministry will be established and monitored by the Ministry of Finance, and ministries will be subject to monthly cash limits on their wage outlays. Steps to improve payroll administration on a more permanent basis will be implemented by June 1996. 14. Public capital expenditure is projected to decline from 9.1 per- cent of GDP in 1995 to 8.0 percent of GDP in 1996, as investment by the public enterprises that have been capitalized will shift to the private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 64 - ATTACHMENT III sector. Investment by the general government is projected to increase from 6.7 percent of GDP in 1995 to 7.2 percent of GDP in 1996. The implemen- tation of the popular participation law and the decentralization law that became effective in January 1996 have shifted the funding and responsibility for projects to the local governments. As a result, investment by local governments is expected to increase from 3.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to - 4.0 percent of GDP in 1996. 15. inflation. The Government attaches the highest priority to bringing down Accordingly, in the event that cumulative inflation were to exceed 6.1 percent by end-April or by end-May 1996, fiscal policy will be strengthened. The main measures would consist primarily of a reduction in capital spending and some increase in revenue totaling about 0.5 percentage point of annual GDP during 1996. 16. The Government will strengthen the monitoring and control of expenditures by local governments in 1996. A regulation issued by the Ministry of Finance in January 1996 requires the departments to deposit all proceeds from revenue sharing in separate accounts, which will allow better auditing of spending. A special unit will be created in the Ministry of Finance to coordinate with the Senate to ensure that the funds allocated to local governments through revenue sharing are spent on investment in and maintenance of schools, roads, and infrastructure consistent with the national plan set in the budget. 17. A reform of the pension system will be initiated in 1996. The reform is designed to broaden the system's coverage, strengthen its finan- cial position, and promote domestic savings. The key element of the reform is the development of individual contributory pension accounts that grad- ually will replace the current pay-as-you-go scheme. Individual pension accounts also will be credited with the shares in the capitalized enter- prises that are to be distributed to each Bolivian adult citizen. To strengthen the financial position of the existing system, contribution rates and the minimum age of retirement will be raised. Also, pension benefits will be based on the average real wage earned over the last ten years of work (rather than the last two years). Approval of the enabling pension law and related regulations is envisaged by September 1996 and the reform will be adopted beginning in January 1997. 18. Considerable progress was made in Bolivia's capitalization program during 1995 which should lay the basis for a fundamental change in the structure of the Bolivian economy. The implementation of the capital- ization/privatization program will continue in 1996. The Government intends to capitalize the state petroleum company (YPFB) in the second quarter of 1996 and the state smelter company (EMV) in the third quarter of 1996. Exploration and production fields of YPFB will be capitalized as two separate companies, and transport activities will be capitalized as a separate company. The awards of management of the three companies will take place by end-June 1996, and transfer of operations by end-September 1996. A refinery together with its distributor, and two distributors, will be sold as three separate companies through traditional privatization (outright sale, with proceeds to the Government) in late 1996 or early 1997. A reduced state company will remain to take over drilling operations on fields allocated by YPFB to other companies and other remaining services and to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - ATTACHMENT III prepare them for sale by 1997. Afterward, the role of the state petroleum company will be limited to the management of joint ventures with private operators. The Government also plans to sell or liquidate in 1996 the remaining companies that belonged to the regional development corporations. Money and credit oolicies 19. Money and credit policy will be geared to achieving the inflation and balance of payments objectives of the program through the control of the net domestic assets of the Central Bank. At the same time, it is expected that the substantive steps that are being taken to strengthen the banking system, as described in paragraph 22 below, will increase the demand for money balances. The net domestic assets of the Central Bank are programmed to decline during 1996 through the placement of certificates of deposit and treasury notes, while currency issue is projected to rise by 12 percent. On this basis, net international reserves would rise by US$60 million, and the import coverage of gross reserves would be maintained at about 5 l/2 months of imports. The growth of deposits denominated in bolivianos would lead to a modest reduction in the share of U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in broad money. Credit to the private sector will grow faster than real GDP, supporting the growth of private investment. Limits on the change in the net domestic-assets of the Central Bank and targets for the gain in net international reserves have been established through December 1996, as set out in Tables 2 and 3. 20. The Central Bank law approved by Congress in October 1995 increases the independence of the Central Bank and establishes the pursuit of low inflation as the Bank's sole objective. The Law provides for central bank autonomy in the formulation and implementation of monetary and exchange rate policies and establishes the principle that there will be no central bank lending to the Treasury outside the Bank's monetary program. In February 1996 the Superintendency of Banks began to implement the norms included in the new Central Bank Law that require banks over a three-year period to eliminate lending to related parties, to raise their capital/ assets ratio to 10 percent, and to comply fully with Base1 standards for asset evaluation. Also, the Central Bank is preparing revised regulations on reserve requirements, which would simplify the existing reserve require- ments that are differentiated by currency and maturity of deposit by a uniform reserve requirement that is lower on average than the existing reserve requirements, and introduce a remunerated liquidity requirement. The latter would generate at the Central Bank a fund from which to provide liquidity credits. The passage of the Central Bank Law also enables the completion of the Bank's restructuring. On-lending activities of the development department and the administration of four cultural institutions will be removed from the Central Bank; as a result, the size of the central bank staff will be reduced by 16 percent during 1996. 21. The Central Bank Law provided for the creation of a nonbank financial intermediary (NAFIBO), which is a joint venture of the Government and private investors, to take over from the Central Bank the on-lending of development funds to commercial banks. The new intermediary will begin operations in May 1996. The Government intends to start offering shares of the corporation for sale to the private sector by May 1997. The Government is committed to either transferring the majority of shares to the private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT III sector over a period of five years or to terminating the public sector's financial participation in the corporation. 22. A fund for strengthening the banking system (FONDESIF) established in September 1995 is helping resolve the undercapitalization and liquidity problems of commercial banks that have experienced significant deposit withdrawals since mid-1995. Total support to the banking system during 1996 is estimated at about US$200 million, of which direct central bank support is estimated at US$llO million. Support from FONDESIF would amount to US$90 million, of which the Central Bank would provide an additional US$40 million and the rest of the financing would come from loans from multilateral institutions. Direct central bank support will be provided in the form of purchase of nonperforming assets of banks, and some continued liquidity support. Most of the central bank support will be immediately sterilized, as the banks will have to use the funds to repay central bank emergency liquidity credits and to reconstitute reserves at the Central Bank. The Central Bank, Superintendency of Banks and FONDESIF approved the restruc- turing and financing of one of the distressed banks in January 1996, and are considering proposals for support to two other banks based on reorganiza- tions that have already taken place (new management and new shareholders who are providing fresh capital). The restructuring and financing of these two banks is expected to be completed by March 1996. As a result of these operations the three banks will repay to the Central Bank about US$80 million of emergency liquidity credits and will reconstitute reserves by about US$17 million. The Government will complete the restructuring of all the banks specified in the monetary program by June 1996. FONDESIF will continue to provide support to the banking system during 1996, with finan- cing within the limits set in the program. The Treasury will bear the ultimate responsibility for the repayment of financing to FONDESIF, including the loans from the Central Bank. External policies and orosoects 23. Since late 1985 Bolivia has maintained a unified exchange rate system in which the exchange rate has been determined in daily auctions conducted by the Central Bank. The Central Bank manages the rate in light of a number of factors, including to help maintain competitiveness taking into account changes in prices and exchange rates of Bolivia's major trading partners. The system is effectively implemented as a crawling peg because on most days bids are equal to the base price. However, the auction system provides flexibility at times to adjust to external shocks. The Central Bank intends to continue managing the system in a way that will preserve international competitiveness. The continued pursuit of prudent financial policies will be a central element of the strategy of maintaining inter- national competitiveness at a level sufficient to foster the growth and diversification of exports while continuing to reduce inflation. In the event that Bolivia experiences substantial capital inflows in the period ahead, the Government would seek to sterilize such inflows and take steps to avoid an undue appreciation of the currency or an expansion in the money supply. 24. Excluding imports of capital and intermediate goods related to the capitalization process, the underlying external current account deficit would decline from 6.1 percent of GDP in 1995 to 5.3 percent of GDP in 1996. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 67 - ATTACHMENT III However, taking into account imports related to capitalization that would be fully financed in the capitalization process, the current account deficit is projected to increase to 8.9 percent of GDP in 1996. It is expected that private and official capital flows will be sufficient to cover the external current account deficit and provide for the targeted accumulation of net international reserves in 1996 of US$60 million. 25. Bolivia continues to make progress in reducing its external debt. In December 1995, an agreement was reached with Paris Club creditors on a stock-of-debt operation under Naples terms. The agreement provides a 67 percent reduction in net present value terms of the outstanding stock of pre-cutoff date debt not previously rescheduled and previously rescheduled on nonconcessional terms. It also increases the level of debt reduction of debt previously rescheduled on concessional terms to 67 percent (topping up of debt previously rescheduled under Toronto and London terms). 26. To continue improving its debt service profile, the Government will avoid borrowing at commercial terms and with short maturity. The Government has established limits on the increase in the public sector's external indebtedness (including debt guaranteed by the Government) in line with a definition of concessionality based on the OECD commercial interest reference rates (C1RE.s). Using this definition, only concessional loans with a grant element of 35 percent or more are excluded from borrowing limits and all loans undertaken or guaranteed by the government, irrespec- tive of maturity, are within the coverage of the debt limits, as set out in Table 4. 27. In December 1995 the Government completed negotiations on the "Patrimonio Historico" consisting of the multilateralization and deepening of existing bilateral agreements with Mercosur member countries. This is an important step forward in the negotiations to establish a free-trade zone with Mercosur countries, which the Government expects to complete during 1996. Bolivia will continue to maintain a free-trade zone with the Andean Group. 28. Bolivia will maintain its policy of low tariffs and will maintain a system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current and capital international transactions. All arrears to external creditors have been eliminated, and Bolivia will not incur any new arrears during the program period. 29. The Government will conduct with the Fund by September 1996 a midterm review of the program to assess the adequacy of financial policies in achieving the targets for inflation, the balance of payments and growth and, in particular, the possible need for further fiscal adjustment in the remainder of the year. In the structural area, the midterm review will focus especially on progress in the ,capitalization of the two remaining large public enterprises; the implementation of mechanisms to monitor and control public sector wages and expenditure of local governments; and a full assessment of measures taken to restructure banks and implications for the health of the financial system.

The Government remains fully committed to alleviating widespread poverty through the implementation of structural reforms and acceleration of economic growth. To this end, the Government intends to set minimum levels of expenditure on human development (education, health care, and basic sanitation) and infrastructure for spending by local governments to guide the use of revenue sharing. Also in 1996 the Government intends to expand the infant and child development program (PIDI) by creating about 1,100 additional care facilities. 31. The Government is implementing a comprehensive education reform to improve the quality and provision of basic education. The reform emphasizes improvement of primary and secondary education and includes the construction of schools and other infrastructure, the supply of teaching materials, and improved teacher training. The Government is decentralizing the adminis- tration of education to ensure increased community participation in the provision of education services. Among the most important policy commit- ments for 1996 are: (i) introduction of a new system of payroll control based on the new teachers' registry; (ii) initiation of the curriculum program in 830 school districts; and (iii) training of more than 40,000 teachers in new curricula. 32. To improve the management of the country's natural resources and preserve the environment, the Government issued regulations for implemen- tation of the environmental law in November 1995. According to the decen- tralization law, the departments are responsible for enforcing environmental regulations. A new forestry law that, inter alia, regulates logging operations with a view to assuring long-term sustainability and protecting areas with indigenous or agricultural claims is expected to be approved by Congress by June 1996. 33. Structural adjustment policies for 1996 are detailed in the forthcoming policy framework paper. Benchmarks and performance criteria for monitoring the implementation of structural policies through December 31, 1996 are set out in Table 5.
