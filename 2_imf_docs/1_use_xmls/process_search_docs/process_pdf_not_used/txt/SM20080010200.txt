The staff team comprised Messrs. Akitoby (Head), Haacker, Kpodar, and Nachega (all AFR). • The mission met with Minister of Finance Abrehe, senior officials of the Central Bank, senior government officials, and representatives from the donor community, the private sector, and trade unions. • The currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Eritrea continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2. It maintains a number of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. • The last Article IV consultation was concluded on March 27, 2006. Eritrea is potentially eligible for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI. • Compilation of macroeconomic statistics has improved, although there are no national accounts statistics. Lack of official GDP data and weaknesses in balance of payments data continue to give rise to uncertainty in estimates and projections.

GDP per capita is among the lowest in the world. Nevertheless, the country’s institutional discipline and social cohesion have led to welfare gains, as evidenced by improved social indicators and infrastructure. The economy continues to stagnate, and inflation remains high. Border tensions are putting pressure on public finances, although tight government expenditure control has improved the fiscal position.  Foremost among the risks, a worsening security situation at the border with Ethiopia would be a major setback. However, expected foreign investment in the mining sector could support economic growth in the medium term and improve the external position. Policy issues Staff emphasized the following measures to restore economic stability and revive growth: (i) further reduce the fiscal deficit; (ii) allow the exchange rate to depreciate; and (iii) gradually liberalize the trade and exchange systems. Staff also underscored the importance of moving promptly to address weaknesses in the banking system, particularly the high rate of nonperforming loans and the increasing exposure to foreign currency. The authorities generally agreed with staff’s recommendations and indicated their willingness to start removing trade and exchange restrictions. Prospects for economic stabilization seem to be improving but depend critically on improvements in the security situation at the border with Ethiopia. The debt sustainability analysis suggests that Eritrea’s external debt is unsustainable. The high level of domestic debt by itself also poses a challenge to public debt sustainability. The authorities indicated that they will give serious consideration to seeking access to the HIPC initiative and MDRI when security improves. Staff also encouraged the authorities to establish a comprehensive debt management strategy. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 4   I.   BACKGROUND 1.      From independence in 1993 until the 1998 border war, Eritrea’s economic growth averaged 7 percent annually because of its market-oriented policies and substantial investment. However, the war with Ethiopia and subsequent stalemate have put major pressure on fiscal aggregates and fueled domestic and external imbalances, resulting in high inflation, low growth, low reserves, unsustainable debt, and an overvalued exchange rate. GDP per capita is among the lowest in the world, and total public debt is high at 157 percent of GDP as of 2007. External debt amounts to 65 percent of GDP.  2.      Nevertheless, institutional discipline and social cohesion have brought the country welfare gains. Since independence Eritrea has made rapid progress in creating new institutions and improving social and physical infrastructure.1 Some social indicators have improved markedly, although from very low levels. Net enrollment in primary education has tripled, and infant and child mortality has declined by a third. Reflecting these achievements, Eritrea’s human development indices compare well with those of other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and of mature stabilizers. Text Table 1.

Security at the border with Ethiopia remains uncertain. The UN-sponsored Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, set up after the border war in 1998–2000, disbanded in December 2007 after defining the border on the map, but not on the ground. Ethiopia does not recognize this “virtual demarcation.”  4.      The World Bank is currently drawing up a new strategy of support to Eritrea. The strategy will focus on supporting the government where there is strong client ownership, the World Bank has a comparative advantage, and support is harmonized with other development partners (Supplement 1). 5.      Eritrea is potentially eligible for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI. Discussions on a staff-monitored program held during and after the 2005 Article IV                                                  1 The percentage of paved primary roads is about 22 percent; the SSA average is 15 percent.

The authorities indicated that they will give serious consideration to seeking access to the HIPC initiative and MDRI when security improves. II.   RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS Real sector 6.      The economy continues to stagnate and inflation is high (Table 1 and Figure 1). After a decline in 2006 real GDP growth is estimated at 1.3 percent for 2007, driven by a better harvest and a rebound in construction. About 70 percent of the population rely on agriculture for income and employment. The manufacturing sector has shrunk because foreign currency shortages hamper imports of intermediate and capital goods. The inflation rate increased from 9 percent in 2006 to 12.3 percent in 2007, owing largely to higher prices for imported foods and demand pressures associated with monetary growth.  Fiscal policy 7.      Though the fiscal position improved markedly in 2006–07, the deficit was still high at an estimated 10 percent (Text Table 2 and Table 2). The overall fiscal deficit declined from about 21 percent of GDP in 2005 to 10 percent of GDP in 2007 as spending was rationalized. Defense outlays were trimmed, and capital projects and externally financed programs were scaled back as foreign financing declined. Savings from expenditure consolida-tion were partly offset by the erosion in tax revenue as economic activity declined in the formal sector. Grant disbursements fell by about 7 percent of GDP in 2006–07, owing to the authorities’ self-reliance policy and strained relations with bilateral donors and aid agencies.2                                                   2 The World Food Program—a major donor in Eritrea—wound down its activities because of disagreement on implementation of food aid.

The authorities have made progress in reforming public financial management (PFM). The government has implemented a number of measures with a view to ensuring fiscal discipline and improving transparency (Box 1).  Box 1. Reforms in Public Financial Management  Debt management capacity has been enhanced. The law now gives the Ministry of Finance the exclusive right to negotiate and sign external loans. Management of all public and publicly guaranteed debt is centralized at the Debt Management Unit (DMU) in the ministry. Detailed information on debt stock and service can now be produced monthly. The budget and fiscal reporting have been revamped in line with the 2001 GFS classification. A system of economic, functional, and program classifications has been used in all line ministries since 2006. This new system has improved fiscal monitoring and expenditure tracking. Treasury functions have been streamlined. The registry of government fixed assets has been computerized. The authorities are moving toward a single treasury account by tightening control over cash flows and minimizing idle cash balances in line ministry bank accounts. Strict enforcement of dividend payments by parastatals has also yielded impressive results. Customs and tax administrations have been strengthened. Goods are cleared very quickly—within one day at the airport and three days at the port of Massawa. The current roll-out of ASYCUDA is expected to reduce clearance times further. To streamline enforcement and intelligence functions, the Finance Police has been integrated into the Customs Department. To increase efficiency at the Large Taxpayer Office, a new selection criterion for large taxpayers has been introduced. Fiscal reporting is now more timely and accurate. Reports on monthly budget execution are generally completed within eight weeks. Also, fiscal reporting fully covers externally financed projects. Monetary policy and the financial sector 9.      Monetary policy is driven by the financing needs of the government. Broad money grew by 8.6 percent in 2007 (Table 3), with net credit to the government accounting for about 62 percent of the increase. Credit to the government was met through treasury bill sales to commercial banks. Driven by activity in agriculture and construction, credit to the private sector expanded at about 11 percent in 2007, up from about 5 percent in 2006. Net foreign assets declined by about 14 percent in 2007, continuing their downward trend.  10.      Negative real interest rates still hamper financial intermediation. The administratively fixed interest rate on T-bills was increased from 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 2006—still far below the inflation rate. Deposit rates of 4.0 percent are thus significantly negative in real terms.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 7   Figure 1.

The banking system is burdened by nonperforming loans. 3 About half of all loans to borrowers other than the government were nonperforming in 2007. However, since remedial actions were taken in 2005, the banks appear to be in compliance with loan-loss provisioning and capital adequacy requirements.  12.      Increasing exposure to foreign currency is undermining the stability of the banking sector. Because of remittances, a substantial share of deposits (19 percent) is denominated in foreign currency. However, the ratio of net foreign assets relative to foreign currency deposits declined from 58 percent in 2006 to 44 percent in 2007. External sector 13.      The most significant external development since 2005 has been a sharp decline in transfers (Table 4). Like official transfers, net private transfers declined, from 41 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 23 percent of GDP in 2007, mainly because the franco-valuta imports system was suspended in 2005.4 The decline in transfers was partly offset by a contraction in imports, while exports of goods and services held steady at about 6 percent of GDP. Overall, the current account (including official transfers) widened to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007, and gross international reserves were precariously low (about 1 month of imports). External debt remained high at 65 percent of GDP (Table 5). The real exchange rate remained fairly stable during 2006 and 2007, following a substantial appreciation relative to its average since 1997. 14.      The government maintains trade and exchange restrictions (Supplement 1) to contain external imbalances stemming from fiscal deficits. The exchange and payments system is tightly controlled; permits are required for all private imports. III.   ECONOMIC OUTLOOK  15.      Economic prospects are dominated by the security situation. Because the border conflict has not been fully resolved and tensions persist, national security concerns heavily influence economic policies. To set the stage for the policy discussions, staff elaborated the two scenarios summarized below (see also Table 6). Current policies scenario 16.      If current policies continue, near-term economic growth will remain sluggish. Impediments to growth—negative real interest rates, low private investment, limited external support, and foreign exchange shortages—that have developed since the onset of the war will continue. Real GDP growth would be unchanged at about 1.2 percent in 2008, supported by                                                  3 A selected issues paper provides a detailed assessment of the banking system and its vulnerabilities. 4 “Franco-valuta imports” are imports that do not require locally sourced foreign exchange. Such imports typically constitute private transfers that do not enter the financial system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 9   modestly improved agricultural performance and moderate construction activity. Inflation would be high at 11 percent, reflecting higher prices for imported food and oil. The fiscal deficit would decline to about 8.3 percent of GDP, relieving pressure on the external sector. However, mining-related imports, coupled with higher commodity prices, would widen slightly the current account deficit (including official transfers) to about 5 percent. International reserves would still be about 1 month of imports. 17.      The medium–term economic outlook is supported by expected foreign investment in mining (Text Table 3). Real GDP is projected at 2 percent in 2009, supported by mining-related construction. Thereafter, economic growth could average about 5 percent through 2012 as the mining projects come on stream. Mining revenues could help bring down the fiscal deficit to about 5 percent of GDP by 2012. Although imports would also rise, receipts for mining exports would help bring the external current account to near-balance by 2012, so gross international reserves would rise gradually to 2 months of imports.

Reform scenario 18.      The reform scenario is based on a return to prudent market-oriented economic policies, supported by debt relief and donor assistance. The policies are already moving in the right direction, as evidenced by the fiscal adjustment in recent years and the sharp decline in the parallel market premium. The reform measures will need to be carefully sequenced to ensure that the liberalization of trade and exchange restrictions will be phased in gradually, as fiscal consolidation relieves pressure on the balance of payments, interest rates, and prices, and the exchange rate is allowed to depreciate. External debt sustainability will be achieved Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 10   through debt relief and higher grant assistance, which is expected to be provided in support of the authorities’ reform program. In this scenario annual real GDP growth would increase gradually to about 7.5 percent in 2012, stimulated by private investment and donor assistance. Though inflation would rise temporarily as the exchange rate depreciates, it would then fall rapidly to single digits. The external current account would widen due to the import demand associated with an increase in external assistance and growth. IV.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS 19.      The authorities noted that discussions of economic policies should be cast against the backdrop of their development priorities: food security and development of cash crops; physical and social infrastructure; and human capital development. They stressed that they are pursuing these objectives despite the conflict. 20.      With these three development priorities in mind, staff and authorities concurred that the overarching economic challenge facing Eritrea is how to return to the private-sector-led growth and economic stability that prevailed shortly after independence in the mid-1990s.  21.      In presenting the reform scenario, staff pointed out the benefits of a return to more market-oriented policies and measures to stabilize the economy and revive growth: (1) further reduce the fiscal deficit; (2) correct the real exchange rate appreciation; (3) liberalize the financial system and interest rates; and (4) gradually liberalize the trade and exchange systems.  22.      The authorities agreed with the mission’s assessment. They explained that they will move to liberalize the economy once the border issue is resolved. Taking the virtual demarcation of the border with Ethiopia as a step forward, they indicated their willingness to start removing trade and exchange restrictions this year.  23.       The discussions focused on (1) the need for fiscal adjustment to ensure economic stability; (2) monetary policy and financial sector vulnerabilities; and (3) external stability and exchange rate policy.  A.   Fiscal Policy 24.      Further fiscal adjustment is critical, staff stressed, for fiscal sustainability and reducing inflation and external imbalances. Savings in the defense budget would help bring down the deficit to a sustainable level, but the scope for reducing defense spending depends on an easing of the border tensions. Given the uncertainty over defense spending, staff urged the authorities to reduce nonpriority spending and intensify collection of taxes and dividends from public enterprises. Moreover, efficiency gains could be achieved by implementing the recommendations of the World Bank review of spending on health and education.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 11   25.      The authorities agreed on the need for further fiscal adjustment. They concurred with staff proposals to reduce the fiscal deficit, which they plan to deal with in 2008 primarily through tight control of spending. They noted that (i) the current review of nonwage defense spending would identify savings; (ii) the overall wage bill as a share of GDP would decline due to wage restraint; (iii) capital spending would be rationalized; (iv) improved tax administration, especially at the regional level, would bring in more taxes; and (v) as in 2007, intensified collection of dividends would improve nontax revenue. Based on these measures, staff calculated, the fiscal deficit would decline to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2008 from 10 percent in 2007. Staff and authorities agreed that in the medium term mining revenues would further consolidate the fiscal position. 26.      Fiscal adjustment would be greatly facilitated if the government could secure additional grants or highly concessional financing to support the budget. After the abrupt decline in donor assistance, staff pointed out the economic advantages of building good relationships with development partners. The authorities noted that they will continue their efforts to build partnerships with donors, without compromising ownership of their development agenda. 27.      Staff emphasized that routinely publishing government budgets would increase transparency and accountability. Like its recent predecessors, the 2008 budget has not been published; the authorities explained that the extraordinary security situation creates uncertainty about expenditure and revenue. Staff stressed that setting transparent objectives for the deficit in a budget and sticking to them can help signal commitment and establish credibility. Staff also encouraged the authorities to publish the government budget and other core economic statistics regularly. This will enhance economic governance and transparency and further the dialogue with the donor community. 28.      The priority given to food security is welcome. The authorities are working to expand rural infrastructure, diversify agricultural production, and improve yields through research programs, microdams, and small irrigation systems. 29.      The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Eritrea’s external debt is unsustainable (Supplement 2). Most external debt burden indicators exceed their policy-dependent thresholds. However, given the importance of remittances (about 26 percent of GDP in 2007) for servicing external debt, their inclusion in external debt indicators would significantly reduce the debt burden. 30.      The high level of domestic debt (about 92 percent of GDP) by itself poses a challenge to public debt sustainability. In particular, it requires a sharp adjustment in the primary fiscal balance and seriously constrains the pace of increases in T-bill interest rates, given the large budget impact of even a modest increase. Staff urged the authorities to use part of expected mining revenues to reduce the domestic debt. Staff also encouraged the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 12   authorities to establish a comprehensive debt management strategy, in consultation with East AFRITAC. 31.      The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment of the debt outlook. They explained that debt is high because of the border conflict and significant investment in agriculture, human development, and physical infrastructure. They added that the sharp decline in grants also led them to borrow to pursue their development priorities. 32.      Staff underscored the importance of debt sustainability, pointing out the potential benefits of the HIPC initiative and MDRI for Eritrea’s external viability. The authorities recognized the benefits and said that they will give serious consideration to the HIPC initiative and MDRI when Eritrea’s security situation improves. B.   Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Vulnerability 33.      The mission stressed that improved monetary policy will require a reduction in fiscal dominance and welcomed the government’s decision to avoid borrowing from the Bank of Eritrea (BOE). Noting that negative real interest rates on bank deposits and T-bills are not conducive to healthy financial intermediation, staff urged the authorities to consider increasing the T-bill rate now that the fiscal deficit is being brought under control. 34.      The authorities agreed that the fiscal situation undermines the effectiveness of  monetary policy. They pointed out that high domestic debt constrains the pace of increases in the T-bill rate. Nonetheless, they suggested that with the fiscal deficit falling, they would consider adjusting the rate. 35.      Staff underscored the importance of moving promptly to address weaknesses in the banking system, particularly the high rate of nonperforming loans and the increasing exposure to foreign currency. To address these challenges, staff urged the authorities to speed up implementation of the action plan drafted by the Fund MCM technical assistance mission in April 2006.  36.      The authorities pointed out steps that are being taken to address weaknesses in the banking sector. Risk management guidelines were issued in 2006, but improving the banking sector’s responsiveness to BOE remedial actions is a challenge. As recommended by the MCM TA mission, the authorities indicated that a number of regulations were being drafted to (i) raise the capital adequacy ratio from 8 percent to 12 percent; (ii) allow banks to write off nonperforming loans; (iii) align bank accounting with international standards; and (iv) limit foreign exchange exposure. While welcoming these initiatives to improve banking sector soundness, staff urged the authorities to quickly finalize these regulations in consultation with East AFRITAC.

External imbalances reflect primarily fiscal rather than exchange rate policy. High fiscal deficits since the onset of the border conflict remain a source of external instability. The authorities agreed but explained that because of the border war and subsequent stalemate, the country must remain in a heightened state of readiness in spite of the financial and economic costs. They reiterated their commitment to restore external stability by reigning in fiscal deficits.  38.      The exchange rate seems overvalued (Box 2 and Selected Issues Paper), and staff recommended an adjustment. While the parallel exchange market premium—a benchmark of overvaluation— remains substantial, it has declined markedly to 15–20 percent as fiscal deficits declined, and pressure on the foreign exchange market should diminish further with the additional fiscal consolidation proposed by staff. Fiscal consolidation will not, however, reverse the large real appreciation that has resulted from inflationary fiscal policies in the past. Staff considered that the substantial uncertainties did not allow establishing beyond reasonable doubt the existence of significant overvaluation, but that it would be prudent to correct the recent real appreciation. The authorities did not disagree with staff’s analysis but emphasized the uncertainties involved in determining the equilibrium real effective exchange rate in a postconflict country like Eritrea. 39.      International foreign reserves need to be increased in the medium term. They should be rebuilt gradually from their precariously low level so that Eritrea can better respond to external shocks. The authorities observed that anticipated revenues from mining projects would help rebuild foreign reserves.  40.      Staff urged the authorities to gradually remove import and foreign exchange restrictions on current international transactions. The authorities expressed their intent to return to the liberal policies in place before the border conflict, and noted that, despite the border stalemate, the government had started to build a network of free zones that would lead the country toward a freer market-based economy. They also said that 2008 would be a year of transition during which the government will start removing trade and exchange restrictions.

Assessing the Exchange Rate and Competitiveness Assessment of Eritrea’s real exchange rate (RER) is complicated by a number of factors, particularly very short time series; limitations of national accounts and balance of payments data; structural breaks due to the border war and data revisions; and the trade and exchange restrictions. This analysis should therefore be approached with caution. With this caveat, the assessment suggests overvaluation. The RER has appreciated. The nominal exchange rate is out of line with recent price developments, resulting in a real appreciation.  The exchange rate seems to deviate from equilibrium. The parallel exchange market premium, as a benchmark of overvaluation, is reported to be in the 15–20 percent range.  Given the short time series (only 7 years without full-scale war), a single country estimation of the equilibrium RER is not possible. As an illustration, we use estimated parameters from Chudik and Mongardini (2007)1 to determine the equilibrium RER, which indicates that the exchange rate could be overvalued by as much as 30 percent. These coefficient estimates are, however, subject to a wide margin of error because of the likelihood of country heterogeneity, omitted variables, sample dependence of the results, and structural breaks. With regard to the business climate, the World Bank’s Doing Business 2007 ranks Eritrea 37 th overall among 44 countries in SSA. On the one hand, compared to SSA generally, Eritrea fares better in terms of flexible labor regulations, contract enforcement, and the number of hours spent preparing, filing, and paying taxes. On the other hand, Eritrea is behind the average country in the region in terms of credit access and procedures to start a business. Eritrea has a number of advantages: The Eritrean free zones offer a liberal business environment with highly simplified procedures to start or close a business; a “one-stop shop” for company registration; and no restrictions on trade and foreign exchange. Other advantages are the country’s proximity to major European and Middle Eastern markets, very low crime rate, and little corruption, as evidenced by its relatively high score on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index 2007. Moreover, Eritrea’s road network compares well with that of other African countries, with a percentage of paved primary roads that is above the regional average. However, the risks associated with the border stalemate deter private investment outside the mining sector. _____________________ 1 Chudik, A., and J.

Statistics and Capacity Building 41.      Staff encouraged the authorities to compile national statistics for the real sector. There are no official national accounts statistics; and data sources for national accounts are weak (Supplement 1). The authorities stated that efforts are underway to compile national accounts statistics; staff urged them to expedite the promulgation of the National Statistics Act to strengthen the capacity and increase the autonomy of the National Statistics Office. 42.      While the timely provision of information during the consultation was welcome, data provision between Article IV consultation missions is limited. The authorities indicated their willingness to improve data provision between Article IV consultations. 43.      The authorities appreciate IMF technical assistance; they have made substantial efforts to implement previous recommendations. In particular, fiscal data have been improved through use of the 2001 GFS classification; and capacity to supervise banks has been reinforced. During the mission, the authorities requested further TA (on, e.g., banking supervision and legislation), which they plan to follow up on with East AFRITAC. V.   STAFF APPRAISAL 44.      The war and subsequent stalemate have fueled domestic and external imbalances. The trade and exchange restrictions introduced to contain these imbalances have dampened private investment and growth. Nevertheless, the authorities have made substantial efforts to improve social indicators and physical infrastructure. 45.      Near-term economic growth will continue be sluggish but would be boosted by market-oriented reforms. Under current policies, real growth is projected to remain low and inflation relatively high. Growth is projected to rise markedly in the medium term, however, propelled by planned foreign investment in mining. In a reform scenario, annual real GDP growth would be markedly higher, supported by improved macroeconomic conditions, a revival of private sector investment, and increased donor assistance.  46.      There are downside risks to the economic outlook. The most significant risk would be a worsening security situation at the border with Ethiopia. Also, any deterioration in the fiscal position would exacerbate imbalances. 47.      Under current policies the debt position is unsustainable. Provision of debt relief under the HIPC initiative and MDRI would help Eritrea achieve debt sustainability. Staff notes the significant advantages of more donor support in the form of grants and highly concessional loans. 48.      The authorities’ intention to pursue a deficit-reduction path largely through expenditure rationalization is welcome. Staff encourages them to continue their efforts to review military expenditure to identify potential fiscal savings, subject to national security Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 16   constraints, and supports current initiatives to make social and capital spending more efficient. 49.      The decision to avoid central bank financing of the budget deficit is welcome. Continued increases in the T-bill rate—along with a tightened fiscal stance—are needed to return to positive real interest rates and alleviate the domestic debt burden on commercial banks. 50.      Prompt action is needed to address nonperforming loans and banks’ increasing exposure to foreign currency. Staff urges the authorities to speed up implementation of the action plan recommended by Fund TA. 51.      A comprehensive reform scenario would also prudently include a correction of the real exchange rate appreciation. The real exchange rate is overvalued, although there is uncertainty as to how significant the extent of overvaluation is. 52.      Gradual liberalization of the trade and exchange system is critical for addressing foreign exchange shortages. The authorities intend this year to start removing trade and exchange restrictions with a view to returning to the market-oriented stance that prevailed immediately after independence. Eritrea maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The authorities have not sought, and the staff does not recommend, approval. 53.      Further progress in publishing economic and financial statistics is needed to enhance economic governance and transparency. A first step should be the regular publication of the government budget.  54.      Data provision to the Fund is inadequate for surveillance, mainly because of deficiencies in national accounts and balance of payments data. High priority should be given to improving national accounts statistics, where the weaknesses are extensive. Staff urges the authorities to promulgate the Statistical Act to strengthen statistical institutions and processes. 55.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 17    Table 1.

GDP per capita is among the lowest in the world. Nevertheless, the country’s institutional discipline and social cohesion have led to welfare gains, as evidenced by improved social indicators and infrastructure.  The economy is stagnating and inflation is high. After declining by 1.0 percent in 2006, real GDP grew by about 1.3 percent in 2007, driven by a better harvest and a rebound in construction. About 70 percent of the population rely on agriculture for income and employment. The manufacturing sector has shrunk because foreign currency shortages hamper imports of intermediate and capital goods. The inflation rate increased to 12.3 percent in 2007 from 9.0 percent in 2006, owing largely to higher prices for imported foods and demand pressures associated with monetary growth.  Though the fiscal position improved markedly in 2006–07, the deficit was still high at an estimated 10 percent. Grant disbursements fell by about 7 percent of GDP in 2006–07, owing to the authorities’ self-reliance policy and strained relations with bilateral donors and aid agencies.                                                   1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

C. 20431 USA  25ANNEXDownload Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 26   Monetary policy is driven by the financing needs of the government. Broad money grew by 8.6 percent in 2007, with net credit to the government accounting for about 62 percent of the increase. Credit to the government was met through treasury bill sales to commercial banks. Negative real interest rates still hamper financial intermediation. The administratively fixed interest rate is still far below the inflation rate.   The most significant external development since 2005 has been a sharp decline in transfers. In particular, net private transfers declined from 41 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 23 percent of GDP in 2007. The decline in transfers was partly offset by a contraction in imports, but exports of goods and services held steady at about 6 percent of GDP. Overall, the current account (including official transfers) widened to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007 from 3.3 percent in 2006, and gross international reserves were precariously low (about 1 month of imports). External debt remained high at 65 percent of GDP.
