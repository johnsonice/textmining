Chabrier and C. Puckahtikom August 18, 1995 The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Oman were held in Muscat during June 26-July 2. 1/ In concluding the 1994 consultation, Executive Directors indicated that expenditure retrenchment and an expansion of non-oil revenues were needed to correct the imbalances in the fiscal and external positions and contain further drawdowns of official foreign assets or accumulation of official debt. Achieving these goals was considered essential in order to avoid a weakening of private sector confidence. Oman's economic &ta meet the requirements for Article IV consultations (Appendix IV). For surveillance between consultations, the authorities have offered to provide a monthly reporting of core statistical indicators. I. Backeround Oman's economy recorded a number of positive developments in 1992-94. Real non-oil GDP growth was buoyant; crude oil production rose by nearly 15 percent; consumer prices were virtually stable; and the economy benefited from interest rate liberalization. The exchange system remained free of restrictions on payments and transfers for international transactions, 2/ and the trade system open. Economic performance was also marked by large fiscal and external deficits. With the budget and the balance of payments heavily reliant on earnings from petroleum exports, the u The Omani representatives were led by the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, H.E. Qais Abdul Al Muniem Al Zawawi; the Minister of Civil Service and Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, H.E. Ahmad Abdul Nabi Macki; the Minister of Petroleum and Minerals, H.E. Saeed Al-Shanfary; the Minister of State for Development Affairs, H.E. Mohammed Bin Musa Al-Yousef; the President of the Central Bank, H.E. Hamoud Sangour Hashim; and the Under Secretary for Financial Affairs, H.E. Darwish Ismael Ali. The staff mission consisted of Messrs. Jakubiak (Head), Alexander, Chami, and Martey, with Ms. Lissenburg as Administrative Assistant (all MED). 2J See Appendix II, Item VII.

Fiscal i policy, however, was not adjusted. Budget deficits on the order of 5-9 percent of GDP were recorded in 1992-94 (Table 1 and Chart 1). From a position of approximate balance in 1991, fiscal policy targeted a spending freeze in 1992 and subsequently spending reductions of B-10 percent annually in 1993-94. Outlays instead rose by 20 percent in 1992, and thereafter the targeted spending reductions were not realized. The largest expenditure overruns occurred in the defense and civil current spending categories. Efforts to increase non-oil revenues yielded only modest results. The financing of the deficits entailed liquidations of government foreign investments and foreign currency deposits at the Central Bank, lJ increases in foreign debt, and domestic bank and nonbank borrowing. Monetary and private sector credit growth were moderate over 1992-93 (Table 2). Although net credit to the Government rose, this reflected the draw down of foreign currency deposits at the Central Bank in order to finance foreign investment as well as the fiscal and external deficits. In 1994, monetary growth accelerated to 7 percent owing essentially to a sizable increase in private credit mainly to finance certain large-scale investment projects. The expansionary fiscal stance of 1992-94 was reflected in a weakening of the balance of payments. The current account deficit was moderate in 1992, but subsequently widened to 5-6 percent of GDP as lower oil prices were accompanied by continued strong demand for imported goods and labor services (Table 3). In the overall position, a surplus was recorded in 1992 essentially owing to sizable government net foreign borrowing. However, in 1993-94 deficits emerged equivalent to 6-8 percent of GDP (totalling ' USS1.5 billion) despite further government borrowing abroad. The cumulative government external borrowing (US$560 million) raised the public sector external debt/GDP ratio to 26 percent. The liquidations of SGRF foreign investments and foreign currency deposits at the Central Bank to finance these deficits lowered total official foreign asset holdings by 25 percent to about US$4 billion at end-1994. The Central Bank's foreign asset position (USS1.7 billion) was at about six months of import cover. The rial Gmani is pegged to the U.S. dollar. With the weakening of the dollar against other major world currencies, the real effective exchange rate for the rial depreciated by about 15 percent over 1989-94 (Chart 2). u The State General Reserve Fund (SGRF), controlled by the Ministry of Finance, holds assets abroad and foreign currency deposits at the Central Bank.

Discussion of Policv Issues The central issue in the consultation discussions was the fiscal adjustment needed to correct the balance of payments position in order to stem further liquidations of official foreign assets and achieve a subsequent recovery while keeping the level of public sector external debt at a manageable level. 1. Real sector nolicies Crude oil production in 1995 is expected to average nearly 850,000 barrels per day, representing a 5 percent increase over 1994. The Cmani representatives stated that, given the prospects for future additions to oil reserves, output would be held to this level over 1996-2000--the period of the Fifth Development Plan. It was anticipated that additions to reserves from exploration and reassessments would be more than sufficient to replace the targeted production level and allow the reserves horizon--presently at about 17 years--to move outward. With sizable natural gas reserves now identified, planning was under way for a number of export projects entailing foreign investment participation-- most prominently a LNG project. Options for financing the US$4 billion cost of its on-shore components were under consideration. If LNG sales contracts now under negotiation (6 million tons per year) were finalized by mid-1996, the project could come on stream in 2000. Other export projects under negotiation included a petrochemicals and a urea facility. The expansion of the,non-oil economy was expected to continue in 1995 as it was anticipated that government expenditure would remain at about its 1994 level. It was recognized that in the past government spending had provided the growth stimulus for the non-oil private sector, but the authorities intended to break this dependency under the Fifth Plan. The Plan's strategy would be directed at private sector diversification into non-oil tradables. The long-term goal was a doubling of real non-oil GDP by 2020 and a lowering of the oil sector's GDP share to about 20 percent. To assist both domestic and foreign investors, an active privatization policy had been put in place; deregulation steps had been taken; and foreign investment regulations had been liberalized to permit up to 100 percent foreign ownership under certain conditions. Major reforms of the education system would also be implemented, oriented toward the fields and technical skills required for a diversified economy. With a rising number of skilled Cmanis, policies covering the employment of expatriates would be tightened, particularly in view of the presently high rate of unemployment among nationals--estimated at 8-10 percent. In this connection, a strengthened policy of Omanization had already been implemented in late 1994. Employment targets had been established for all sectors of the private economy to be achieved by 1996, and the tax applicable to the employment of expatriates had been made comprehensive and raised. The resources generated would be utilized to finance training programs for Gmanis.

Under these circumstances, it was welcome that for the medium term the authorities intended to avoid raising production further. Even with production held constant, the goal of lengthening the horizon-- or even holding it constant--would be challenging as it would require that new reserves be consistently identified to replace production. With these considerations, it was appropriate to evaluate the depletion of national wealth in the form of nonrenewable oil reserves against the productivity of government expenditures. As presently oil revenues were being used largely for public sector consumption, there was a need for a shift in fiscal policy toward generating public sector savings. In view particularly of the recent heavy liquidation of government foreign investments in part to finance development spending priorities, it was also important for the next plan to evaluate thoroughly new public investments in terms of their total economic returns. In this regard, it was not clear that the conditions existed which would justify a continuation of the past level of infrastructure spending. Private enterprise was still largely oriented toward nontradables. Moreover, important measures to support private sector diversification were not yet in place--in particular, measures relating to government employment and compensation levels, education, and key macroeconomic variables. With a limited domestic market, diversification would need to be outward-oriented, and therefore competitiveness would need to be ensured. Unit labor costs could be viewed as relatively high vis-ii-vis prospective competitors, and the exchange rate instrument might need to be used to correct for this factor. Evaluations of domestic public investments in terms of economic returns might indicate that some projects be curtailed or abandoned. Such outcomes, however, would not constitute a retreat from the ultimate goal of diversification, but rather a husbanding of national wealth until the domestic environment was appropriate. The additional foreign assets in the interim would yield income to assist the budget, and could be liquidated as appropriate in the future to advance diversification. In this context, it might also be useful to begin considering for the longer term a sustainable economic strategy which considered the risk that oil reserves could be relatively limited. A possible guideline for the strategy would be the maintenance of real per capita GNP. This suggested that sufficient public sector savings be generated and invested--including abroad--in order that government income at the time the horizon was reached would be large enough to replace oil revenues to the extent that private sector diversification could not maintain real per capita GNP. Under a conservative scenario which assumed a 20-year depletion horizon and that the private sector might not respond strongly to the diversification effort, it was estimated that annual fiscal surpluses of 5-10 percent of GNP might be needed. While less conservative assumptions would permit lower surpluses, achieving public savings near these magnitudes implied a substantial fiscal policy revision.

Fiscal Policies f The 1995 budget was formulated using an oil price forecast of US$lS per barrel, and on this basis an expenditure reduction (by 4 percent) was targeted in or&r to contain the deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP. The authorities, however, now expect overruns to occur, and estimate a financing requirement entailing a sizable call on government foreign assets. The staff commented that it would be disappointing if again the goal of fiscal retrenchment were not realized. The official assessment of budget financing suggested a spending overrun comparable to those of 1993-94. As a result, and despite a now nearly 10 percent higher than projected average oil price, the deficit/GDP ratio was forecast to exceed 5 percent, and could result in a foreign investment liquidation of about US$450 million as well as an increase in debt. For the balance of payments, this fiscal outcome implied current and overall deficits of 3-4 percent of GDP. Every effort should be made to hold to the targeted expenditure reduction. This discipline could reduce the fiscal and external deficits to l-2 percent of GDP--representing a reasonable start at adjustment, and an investment drawdown could be avoided. The staff discussed with the authorities medium-term prospects for the budget and external position under unchanged and adjustment policy scenarios. A lack of adjustment in 1995 and a continuation of the recent fiscal stance into the next few years --when oil prices were expected to be lower--gave rise to concern. Over 1996-97, fiscal deficits could be recorded averaging some 8 percent of GDP annually, as well as similar current account and overall deficits in the balance of payments (Table 4). If the present levels of domestic and external debt were not to be exceeded, the financing of the deficits pointed to liquidation of all remaining government foreign investments and a reduction of central bank reserves to near a minimum level by end-1997. Following these rundowns and with continued large deficits, the external debt/GDP ratio could rise steadily to 60 percent by 2000. These prospects had adverse implications for private sector confidence, and severe near-term additional pressures could be placed on the balance of payments and require defensive actions. In the event, adjustment would be forced on the economy. These confidence risks had not been quantified in the scenario. While it might appear feasible to sustain real non-oil growth by allowing expenditures to continue rising, it was not likely that growth could be sustainable with such mounting financial imbalances. The possibility of such developments underlined the urgency of an early start on a medium-term fiscal adjustment. Holding to the spending reduction targeted for 1995 and implementing a strong tightening in 1996, followed by more moderate restraint subsequently, would allow the budget and overall external positions to benefit from rising surpluses over 1996-2000. By the end of this period, central bank reserves and government foreign investments could be restored to about their 1992-94 levels without breaching the, Government's intention for the Fifth Plan period to move external debt back below the official ceiling of RO 1 billion (USS2.6 billion).

The effective outcome, however, had been an external debt level at end-1994 which exceeded SGRP foreign investments by 25 percent. The staff noted that these scenarios had utilized expenditure policy as a proxy for the overall fiscal stance, but significant expenditure and revenue measures should both be pursued. Given the present modest level of non-oil revenues and lags in implementing corrective measures, the fiscal adjustment would need to rely heavily on expenditure reductions. In view of the large spending for defense and civil service wages--which were . equivalent to 18 percent and 10 percent of GDP, respectively, and together accounted for 55 percent of total budget expenditures--it would be difficult to reduce total spending in a way that could maintain basic government services without cuts in these two areas. Reductions in defense outlays were less likely to have adverse consequences for activity in the non-oil sector. As prospective budget resources were not sufficient to sustain the present wage bill, numerical ceilings should be placed on government employment and quickly lowered over the medium term. In the area of capital spending, the proposals made earlier for evaluating projects should permit retrenchment. Regarding non-oil revenue measures, the recent broadening of the business income tax and the changes in the tax on expatriate employment had assisted revenues. But as the gains were modest, more significant steps were needed. For 1996-97, revenues could be expanded by applying the minimum 5 percent import tariff across-the-board to all presently exempted commodities; taxation of owner-occupied real estate; increases in petroleum product prices; raising charges for power and water toward fully covering production costs; introducing reasonable charges for health services; and initiating a general sales tax. Such a domestic revenue effort would also help address the downside risks deriving from the budget's continued vulnerability to oil price volatility, and be consistent with the need for oil reserves conservation and the limitations that population growth would place on social spending cuts. The Omani representatives responded that the authorities recognized that the fiscal and external positions of recent years were not sustainable, and that fiscal adjustment was needed. A strategy of expenditure reduction would be initiated in 1996 and continued during the Fifth Plan period in order to reduce the budget deficit ratio to annually 2.5-3 percent over 1996-97 and 1 percent over 1998-99, and to achieve overall balance in 2000. Annual expenditure ceilings would be specified, and higher outlays would not be permitted unless fully funded from new resources. Steps would be taken to reduce civil service employment. At present it was not expected that new taxes or price increases would be introduced given tax and price levels in neighboring countries.

In the process, the safety margin against economic shocks from oil prices or private confidence and against expenditure slippage could become relatively thin by 1998-99. 3. Monetarv nolicv Following the liberalization of commercial bank interest rates in mid-1994, u domestic &posit rates have approximately tracked international U.S. dollar rates, although with a lag and at a lower level. The staff commented that this pattern likely contributed to the 25-30 percent annual rate of increase in foreign currency deposits in 1994 and early 1995. These developments could indicate insufficient competition for deposits and market inefficiencies, and consideration of further liberalization might be in order. First, the moratorium on bank licensing or the prohibition on commercial bank rial Gmani placements abroad could be inhibiting competitive market forces. Second, the Central Bank should push forward its liberalization efforts by removing the interest rate ceiling which continued to apply to some consumer loans, since it did not allow banks to price risk appropriately. Rather than harming small borrowers, it would benefit those who were now shut out of the market by this limit on loan pricing. Third, the late 1994 regulation limiting consumer lending by banks to 25 percent of their credit to the private sector should be rescinded as this enforced segmentation impaired the efficiency of the market's allocation of credit and the interest rate mechanism. Fourth, the government bond sales program continued to operate under administered rates, but instead should be encompassed in a comprehensive freely operating financial market by moving to a competitive auction system. The Cmani representatives responded that the new regulation limiting consumer credit was intended to prevent excess borrowing by individuals which had resulted in social problems, and to orient bank lending toward productive purposes. The authorities were considering the sale of government bonds by auction, and Fund technical assistance would be requested. 4. External policies The authorities continue to view the present exchange arrangement as appropriate to the economy's needs, and consider that the level of the exchange rate provides sufficient competitiveness given the real effective depreciation of recent years. The staff observed that, given Oman's economic structure, the responsibility for maintaining the current peg jJ Entailing the removal of the global ceiling previously applied to rial Omani loan rates. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - rested essentially with fiscal policy. The budget stance of recent years, however, had not been consistent with this responsibility, and maintaining 7 the exchange rate through Central Bank transactions had been costly in terms of foreign assets. If fiscal policy were not moved to a consistent position, it could eventually prove difficult to avoid a rate adjustment. The Omani representatives indicated that the Government had applied for observer status in the UT0 as the first step toward membership. III. Staff AVDraiSal Oman has continued to benefit in recent years from strong real growth, price stability, and an open trade and payments system. While these positive conditions gave rise to a general sense of well-being in the economy, they have had their costs. The sizable deficits in the budget and the balance of payments, which reflected an expansionary expenditure stance, entailed substantial liquidations of government foreign investments and foreign currency deposits at the Central Bank as well as rising debt. The combined gross foreign asset position of the Government and the Central Bank declined by 25 percent in 1992-94, and public sector external debt, increased by nearly 25 percent. The fiscal policy of recent years is not sustainable in view of its consequences for the balance of payments. If expenditure and domestic revenue policies remain unchanged, and with a weaker outlook for oil prices, there would be continued large overall budget and external deficits. The resulting loss of reserves and increase in external debt could well be accelerated by an adverse shift in private sector sentiment. Such prospects are of concern, and the staff welcomes the authorities' recognition that a significant medium-term fiscal adjustment is in or&r. However, the expenditure overrun which is presently viewed as acceptable for this year and the authorities' path for medium-term spending will translate into large calls on official foreign investments that will narrow the margin against economic shocks to an uncomfortable level. The staff therefore urges an early and front-loaded start on fiscal adjustment. The correction should be initiated in 1995 by adhering to the expenditure retrenchment originally planned for this year, and be followed by a much stronger fiscal effort in 1996 encompassing a significant reduction in outlays and start at increasing non-oil revenues. Thereafter, efforts at spending restraint and revenue enhancement will need to be continued. In the staff view, a substantial increase in non-oil revenues is essential. These policy revisions would halt the liquidation and permit a subsequent recovery of government foreign assets, allow implementation of official external debt policy, improve the structure of the budget, and provide the most propitious environment for the growth of the non-oil economy. Indeed, it is doubtful that growth could steadily be maintained in the absence of forceful adjustment. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - For the long term, the authorities face the task of putting in place a sustainable strategy for the economy. In this regard, the staff agrees with the authorities' decisions to conserve oil resources, develop natural gas-based exports, encourage competitive private sector diversification into tradables, and attract foreign investment. Diversification, however, could prove to be a challenging process despite the positive steps recently taken. As the experience of past years has shown, the process does not proceed easily, and it will likely take time for policy changes across a broad spectrum to provide the appropriate domestic environment. The uncertainties regarding the pace at which diversification can take place reinforces the need to reorient fiscal policy toward increased and more efficient investment. The staff welcomes the interest rate liberalization introduced in 1994. Liberalization should be continued by removing the remaining controls on interest rates --including the administered rates on government debt instruments --as well as nonprudential regulations applied to the banking system which could be adversely affecting the market determination of interest rates. Economic efficiency will be impaired by the recent measure establishing end-use credit allocations, and this regulation should be rescinded. The authorities have pursued the goal of exchange rate stability in order to provide a steady macroeconomic environment for economic growth. However, recent fiscal policy has not been conducive to this goal, and needs to be corrected if the exchange rate level is to be maintained. Oman's economic &ta meet the requirements for effective surveillance. Improvements have recently been made in the balance of payments accounting of transactions with foreign oil companies, and steps are being taken to improve the collection of interest rate data. The task of policy formulation would be assisted by a more comprehensive and transparent presentation of the official budget and by improvements in the compilation of national income and price data; in these areas, technical assistance could be helpful. The timeliness of core statistical indicators between consultations is expected to be addressed by the monthly reporting offered by the authorities. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Public Finance Both scenarios utilize expenditure policy as a proxy for the fiscal policy stance. Oil production is held constant at its 1995 average as proposed by the authorities, and price forecasts are based on the WE0 (June 1995) projections. Other external sector-related transactions are derived from the balance of payments assumptions and projections. 1. Constant ~olicv scenario This scenario assumes that total outlays in 1995 will experience an overrun equivalent on average to the percentage overrun during 1993-94. Thereafter, total expenditures are assumed to remain equivalent to 49 percent of GDP--the average ratio for 1994-95 which is similar to the historical position. Outstanding gross official external debt is held constant at its projected end-1995 level. 2. Adiustment scenario The staff scenario assumes that in 1995 the authorities adhere to the budget target of reducing total expenditures by 4 percent. For 1996-2000, expenditures are reduced over 1996-98 and then held constant in nominal terms with the goal of moving the overall balance of payments position to surplus in 1997 in order to halt the liqutdations of government foreign investments and Central Bank foreign assets and permit a subsequent recovery. It is also assumed that,for the period the Government implements its intention to observe the ceiling on total public sector debt of RO 1 billion. II. Balance of Pavments 1. Crude oil exnorts: Based on the WE0 (June 1995) oil price projections adjusted to reflect the price differential for Cmani crude oil. Oil output is projected to average about 850,000 b/d in 1995-2000. Refinery input is assumed to remain constant. 2. Refined DrOdUCtS exnorts: Dependent on refinery input and domestic consumption of petroleum products which is projected to increase by 7.5 percent a year, on average; prices are assumed to move in line with WE0 oil price projections. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - APPENDIX III 3. Non-oil exnorts: Assumed to increase by the product of the growth rate of export-weighted real GDP of partner countries and the weighted average of partner countries' GDP deflators in U.S. dollar terms. Re-exports are assumed to increase by 10 percent in 1995 and by 5 percent per year in 1996-2000. 4. Imnorts: Recorded government imports are assumed to increase in proportion to civilian government expenditures with an import content, i.e., all nondefense expenditure other than wages and interest. Unrecorded (defense) imports are assumed to move tn line wtth defense spending. Private import growth (excluding re-exports) is based on an elasticity of 1.5 in respect of non-oil GDP growth, and the change in partner countries' export unit values as projected in the WE0 exercise. 5. Profit remittances: Payments of PDO foreign partners' fees and interest costs reflect contract terms covering a return on net investment, an oil production fee, an oil discovery fee for new reserves, a pipeline usage fee, * a gas discovery fee, and a gas operating fee. Profit remittances by other oil companies are based on their oil export shares according to production sharing agreements. Profit remittances by foreign contractors are assumed to be 12.5 percent of non-oil investment in the economy, and those by commercial banks are an extrapolation of historical data. 6. Services: Net payments for travel are assumed to increase by one percent a year. Port dues are estimated on the basis of the average percentage of total trade over 1992-94. Official interest receipts are the return on foreign assets of the Central Bank and the SGRP; the rates of return are based on their historical level relative to the Libor six- month U.S. dollar rates and the WRO forecasts for the latter. Commercial banks' interest receipts and payments are also based on historical levels relative to the forecast for the six-month Libor rate. Other services (net) comprise largely payments by the Government for services related to civilian and defense activities; they are projected to move in line with the respective expenditure forecasts. 7. Private transfers: Workers' remittances are &rived from estimates of the average wage rate and the number of expatriate workers in the public and private sectors; the latter remit a hfgher proportion of their earnings. Wage rates are assumed unchanged in 1995 and to increase in line with the forecast non-oil GDP deflator in 1996-2000. The number of public sector workers is assumed to be unchanged in 1995 and is related to the forecast growth of government expenditure in subsequent years. The number of private sector workers is assumed to increase by 10 percent in 1995 and to rise in line with non-o%1 GDP growth in 1996-2000. 8. Canital account: Disbursements of medium- and long-term capital are official forecasts for 1995, and for 1996-2000 in line with government policy it is assumed that the total external debt is reduced to and held at the legal ceiling of RO 1.0 billion. Amortization payments on outstanding commercial bank loans and other commercial debt (mostly import credits) for 1995-2000 are based on payment schedules provided by the authorities.

Sales of development bonds in 1995 are assumed at RO 70 million, double the amount sold in the first issue in March 1995. In view of the total debt constraint, no further sales of development bonds are assumed for 1996-2000. Direct investment (net) by PDO foreign partners is the authorities' estimate for 1995 and is assumed at the average 1994-95 level in 1996-2000. Direct investment (net) by other oil companies is the authorities* estimate for 1995 and is assumed to remain unchanged in 1996-2000. Oil export credits reflect the projected increases in crude oil prices and export volumes.

As indicated below, in a few areas remedial measures would be beneficial. The authorities publish all data provided to the staff except information relating to the SGRP which is confidential. 1. National accounts National accounts data are prepared by the Directorate General of Economic Statistics of the Ministry of Development on the basis of information received from government departments and agencies. The authorities have made ongoing efforts to improve the national income estimates. The non-oil nominal GDP estimates appear to be generally consistent with other information on economic developments. However, certain non-oil GDP sectoral deflators at times have given rise to unexpected movements in the derived sectoral real value added series that cannot be easily related to known developments in the economy. Consequently, there is some question about the accuracy of some sectoral and thus overall real non-oil GDP estimates and the derived growth rates. The authorities recognize these issues and are in the process of improving the quality of the sectoral price deflators. On the uses side, only nominal national income data are available. Public and private sector investment &ta appear to correspond with budget, plan, and other information. 2. Prices. emnlovment. and waves Consumer price data are currently collated by the MinLstry of Development only for the capital area. The Kuscat Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly on the basis of prices collected monthly by field visits to selected samples of enterprises. The index is based on new weights from a 1990-91 household expenditure survey. Data on civil service and public sector enterprise employment are available and appear to be accurate, including the breakdown between nationals and expatriates. No data on defense employment are available. Private sector employment data are derived from surveys, and the national/expatriate breakdown from information on labor work permits. As there have been long-standing problems with the noncancellation of redundant permits, the estimates of the private sector employment of expatriates should be approached cautiously. This problem has burdened the worker remittance estimates in the balance of payments. Information is available on wages for non-Omani workers in the private sector by major occupational groups.

Government finance statistics i The authorities are able to provide monthly data on public finance with a short lag. They also provide a comprehensive and analytical presentation of the budget for the consultation process. However, the official budget presentation excludes data on State General Reserve Fund (SGRP) transactions (as well as those of the Contingency and Oil Funds). Due to this practice, there are difficulties regarding the coverage of the official budget and its financing. Broad use within the Ministry of Finance of a comprehensive budget compilation as used for consultations, including SGRP operations and the budget's financing, would assist in ensuring that an internally consistent, transparent, and analytical official budget is available to government policy makers. The accounts of municipalities and the regional administrations are included in the budget. 4. Monetarv statistics Monthly data are provided on the Central Bank balance sheet and the consolidated accounts of the commercial banks with a short lag. The autho- rities are able to respond quickly to enquiries for key items from the Central Bank balance sheet. The authorities are now collecting information to allow publication of improved and more disaggregated interest rate data on rial Omani deposits and loans (by maturity and category). 5. Balance of oavments statistics Data for most balance of payments entries are reliable, e.g., oil and non-oil exports, imports, transactions with PDO foreign partners, official capital flows, and the financing data. During the past year, the Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals has provided detailed and revised data on PDO partners' fees and earnings and gross direct Investment flows. In the forthcoming year, the authorities are planning to obtain improved infor- mation from the Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals on profit remittances and direct investment by other foreign oil companies, and to implement a survey system in order to generate improved estimates for worker remittances and tourism. For the future, resources should be directed to obtaining data on gross flows for the other services items, which comprise mainly government payments for civilian and &fense services. The public sector external debt data are comprehensive and accurate. No data are available on private sector foreign debt, or on private non-oil and nonbank capital account transactions. The authorities provide comprehensive and accurate information on government foreign investments held by the SGRF and related transactions for use in consultation reports; these data are confidential and not available for publication. 6. Militarv transactions The fiscal, balance of payments, and external debt data fully incorporate military transactions.

The education project aimed at: (a) expanding and improving primary and secondary education as well as teacher training; and (b) strengthening the Ministry of Education and Youth. The health project aimed at improving the health status in the Batinah region and strengthening the Ministry of Health. The education project was closed in December 1994, while the health project was closed in April 1995. As of June 30, 1995, the Bank's total loan approvals, net of cancellations, amounted to USS142.3 million, of which USS111.6 million had been repaid. IFC made an equity investment of USSO. million in 1993 in the Oman National Leasing Company. This was followed by a loan of USS5.0 million from IFC to the leasing company in 1995. IFC also approved an investment in United Power Corporation in 1995 consisting of an A Loan of US$lS million and equity of US$4 million for IFC's own account; and a B Loan of US$45 million and a stand-by C Loan of US$l2 million for the account of participants. A framework for technical cooperation was signed in 1991, when the Government graduated from lending. The program is the second largest after Saudi Arabia. Originally, the Technical Cooperation Program focused on institutional and organizational studies. Recently, the program reflects the Government's interest in shifting the main emphasis and scope the Technical Cooperation Program from institutional and organizational issues to policy and sectoral issues. Currently, the program consists of activities in the areas of macroeconomics and sector development and management. The program aims at improving the performance and efficiency of government, and providing analytical knowledge of development issues. In November 1992, a review of public expenditures in the health and education sectors was conducted, and the report was transmitted to the Government in August 1993. A Country Economic Memorandum (GEM) mission was conducted in January 1993, and the grey cover report was issued in May 1994 (Report No. 1299-OM). The main activities in the current program (FY95) include studies in electricity privatization, standards of living assessment, institutional development for the Ministry of Civil Service, and the Vision Conference.

The process of preparation for the Vision Conference involved the entire government and all segments of the Omani society in identifying the issues and challenges facing Oman, formulating a vision for Oman's economy by the year 2020, and articulating strategies necessary to deal with these challenges. The Conference also engaged in international experts in debating and identifying aspects of successful development experiences which could be useful in the realization of the vision. The June Conference was a major success. The Bank will assist, through the Technical Cooperation Program, the Government in the implementation of the main recommendations of the Vision Conference.
