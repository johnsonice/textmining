Beginning in late 1997 the Guyanese economy encountered a series of shocks. Real GDP grew by 3 percent in 1999 (follow- ing a decline in 1998), while 12-month inflation rose to 8% percent at end- 1999 from 4’/2 percent at end-1998. A two-month strike by civil servants in May-June 1999 led to large civil service wage increases for 1999 and 2000. Despite the wage increase, the overall public sector deficit (after grants) fell from 5 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1 percent of GDP in 1999, reflecting mainly lower nonwage and capital expenditures. In 1999 social expenditure (11 ‘/z percent of GDP) was about l/? percentage point higher than the target set at the original HIPC Initiative completion point in May 1999 (EBS/99/70). In addition, progress was made on structural reforms, including privatization of two large state-owned companies, trade liberalization, and strengthening of the financial sector. 0 The authorities have formulated a macroeconomic program to support the I-PRSP. Over the medium term, the program is based on an average annual real GDP growth of 4% percent and aims to bring inflation down to 3 percent. The program also contains important additional structural reforms, including the restructuring of the state-owned bank and the sugar. company, and civil service reform. l More spending on poverty reduction projects and the restructuring of public enterprises would contribute to increases in the overall public sector deficit (after grants) in 2001-02 that would shift to a small surplus by 2005. Fiscal policy is based on a two-pronged strategy that: the public sector will not engage in domestic borrowing and its saving performance will improve over the medium term, following the expected decline in 2000. Public saving would improve through efforts to keep government current expenditures (including the wage bill) generally in line with projected inflation. The deficits would be more than covered by concessional external financing, thereby allowing a reduction in public sector domestic indebtedness. l Monetary policy would be conducted to achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives of the program. The program also calls for a strengthening of banking supervision and the authorities have requested Fund technical assistance. l On risks to the program, a delay in the general election scheduled for January 2001 or political unrest following the election (as in 1997) could result in macroeconomic pressures and a slowdown in the pace of implementation of structural reforms. Also, civil service unions may demand additional real wage increases. However, the authorities believe that the unions may not succeed, given the recent large wage increases and the inclusion of the government’s wage bill policy in the I-PRSP. 0 Approval of the second annual arrangement under the PRGF and the preparation of a sound I-PRSP are required for reaching the decision point under the enhanced HlPC Initiative. The estimated amount of additional assistance to be provided to Guyana under the enhanced Initiative has been estimated at US$329 million in net present value terms.

Discussions for the 2000 Article IV consultation and the request for the second annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were held in Georgetown Guyana during August 4-l 8, 1999, December 1-15, 1999, April 26-May 10,2000, and August 2-16,200O and in Washington, D.C. during September 29-30, 1999 and June 13,200O. The Guyanese representatives included President Jagdeo; minister with responsibility for finance at the Office of the President, Mr. Kowlessar; the Acting Governor of the Bank of Guyana, Ms. Singh; and other senior officials. Consultations were also held with the private sector business organizations, trade unions, nongovernmental organizations, and the leaders of the main opposition political party. The staff team included Mr. Yadav (Head), Mr. Egoume-Bossogo, Mrs. Francis, Ms. Torres, Mr. Weisman (all WHD), Mr. Jones (PDR), Mr. Faal (Resident Representative), Ms. Campbell (Assistant-PDR), and Miss Villarroel (Assistant-WHD). Mr. Williams (Senior Advisor, WI-ID) and Mr. Dhanpaul, the Assistant to the Executive Director for Guyana, participated in most of these discussions. ’ 2. On July 15, 1998, the Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF (now PRGF) arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 53.76 million, or 59 percent of quota. As of August 3 1, 2000, outstanding Fund credit to Guyana was SDR 88.49 million, or 97.3 percent of quota (see Attachment I). 3. Guyana is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.2 On May 12, 1999, the Executive Board concluded the 1999 Article IV consultation with Guyana, completed the midterm review of the first annual arrangement under the PRGF, and determined that Guyana had reached the completion point under the original Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative (EBS/99/65, EBS/99/70). Directors observed that while assistance of US%256 million in net present value (NPV) terms under the original HIPC Initiative would lower the NPV of debt-to- exports ratio to within the target range (150) this assistance would not achieve the fiscal target for the NPV of debt-to-revenue (280) because of lower-than-expected revenues and the sharp depreciation of the Guyana dollar in 1998. At that time, the Board also waived the nonobservance ’ Staff from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) collaborated with the Fund missions, particularly in the areas of structural reforms, social sector, public sector investment program, and debt sustainability analysis. ’ Guyana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current ,intemational transactions. Guyana also accepted the proposed Fourth Amendment of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement on September 20,200O. Relations with the Fund, the World Bank, IDB, and the CDB are summarized in Attachments I-IV.

While supporting decisions on the completion of the review and HIPC completion point, Directors saw implementation of the proposed government wage policy as critical to meeting the program objectives and urged the authorities to press ahead with structural reforms and to prevent HIPC assistance being diverted to fund general wage increases. 4. Guyana’s 1998 economic program went off track because of exogenous shocks (EZ Nigo, a sharp decline in export prices, and political disturbances) and a sizable increase in government wages (an average of 19 percent for all civil servants compared with 9% percent in the program). The program approved in May 1999, had envisaged a 6 percent general salary increase and higher increases for key positions. The government’s firm resolve to implement the programmed wage policy prompted a two-month strike by civil service unions in May-June 1999. In consultation with unions and private sector organizations, the government agreed to refer the wage dispute to a binding arbitration tribunal. At end-August 1999, the tribunal awarded core civil servants general wage increases of 31 percent, retroactive to January 1,1999 and an additional 26% percent beginning on January 1,200O. While the government was successful in containing the spread of the wage award to other government workers (teachers and armed forces) to 12 percent in 1999, it has granted the 26% percent increase to all government employees in 2000. 5. Despite the large wage increases, the overall public sector deficit after grants fell from about 5 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1 percent of GDP in 1999 (compared with 3 percent of GDP in the program) mainly because of lower nonwage and capital expenditures. In 1999 social spending was higher than targeted at the time of the completion point, but the wage component of social spending was substantially higher because of the large wage award and the increase in the number of trained teachers and health workers (Box 1). 6. In order to help contain pressure on the wage bill and to increase efficiency, since late 1999, with support from the World Bank, the authorities have been offering a severance and training package to achieve a substantial voluntary reduction in the size of the civil service, particularly among the temporary and unqualified workers. However, the civil service unions are opposed to any large-scale downsizing because of the concern that unqualified workers may not be able to find jobs in the private sector in the near term. Under the circumstances, the authorities believe that they would be able to reduce the size of the core civil service through outsourcing 1,000 property security guards in 2000 and retrenching 1,000 temporary and unqualified workers by May 2001 (out of a total of some 12,000 core civil servants). The authorities are of the view that a deeper cut in the size of civil service at this time would undermine other reforms and the provision of public services. They also believe that it will take more time and effort to garner adequate public support for a comprehensive civil service reform, which they are developing with IDB assistance. In the meantime, the authorities have committed to gradually reducing the ratio Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Box 1.

This would be achieved through downsizing and keeping the wage bill constant in real terms (except for the education and health ministries, which need to attract more trained stafFto improve the quality of public services). The wage bill policy also is indicated in the government’s interim poverty reduction strategy paper (I- PRSP) for public discussion and support (see the companion paper to this report). 7. The program to be supported by the Fund provides for modemization of the state-owned sugar company (GUYSUCO), which is necessary to enable it to compete in the face of expected erosion in preferential markets over the medium term (Table 5).3 Civil society in Guyana supports the modernization plan, which includes certain elements of privatization through the sale of 3 In 1999 the sugar industry accounted for 16 percent of GDP and over 25 percent of export earnings, and it generated indirectly employment for an estimated 75,000 persons (about 10 percent of the population).

The authorities believe that complete privatization of the industry is not feasible at this time and that forcing the issue could jeopardize other important reforms. In addition, they argue that the current uncertainties in preferential arrangements for sugar exports would prevent Guyana from receiving a fair price for GUYSUCO and that a private owner may not take into account social issues. A World Bank-led team (including the staff of the U.K. Department for International Development, and other consultants), financed by a Japanese preparation grant, is expected to complete a review of the modemization plan in November 2000, and recommend that a more modest investment plan be considered; these discussions are continuing. The authorities would seek donors’ assistance under the World Bank leadership in obtaining concessional financ- ing for GUYSUCO but, if such financing were not to become available on a timely basis, they would like to revisit the restructuring issues with the World Bank and the Fund staff The staff has been adamant that nonconcessional borrowing would be inconsistent with the spirit of the HIPC Initiative. 8. In the attached letter dated October 30,200O (Attachment VIII), the authorities review Guyana’s recent economic performance and describe their economic program for the period October 1,200~September 30,200l (and a medium-term policy framework) which aims to put the economy on a new sustainable growth path. The proposed program emphasizes poverty reduction and economic growth in the context of a stable macroeconomic framework and continued structural reforms. The proposed program also includes prior actions. 9. The approval of the second annual arrangement under the PRGF is a condition for reach- ing the decision point and delivery of assistance under the enhanced HlPC Initiative. Under the fiscal criterion, Guyana is eligible for receiving enhanced HIPC relief of an estimated US$329 mil- lion in NPV terms. If the enhanced HlPC relief were to be delivered in 2001, the NPV of debt to revenue would fall to 223% percent, well within the target of 250 in that year. 10. Guyana provides the core minimum data for surveillance and for tracking progress under the PRGF. However, improvements are needed to strengthen transparency and accountability through better data collection and dissemination practices. The authorities also are addressing weaknesses in social data and indicators as outlined in I-PRSP. Furthermore, they have been making efforts to improve macroeconomic data collection, particularly on government financial statistics, as discussed in the Statistical Issues and the Technical Assistance Consultation report (Attachments V and VI). II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 11. In 1999 real GDP grew by 3 percent compared with 2 percent in the program (and a decline of 1% percent in 1998) mainly due to favorable weather conditions for agricultural production; however, the impact of flooding on agricultural production in early 2000 is expected to moderate real GDP growth to 2% percent in 2000 (Table 1). The 12-month inflation rose from 4% percent in December 1998 to 8% percent in December 1999, reflecting the currency depreci- Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- ation in late 1998 and early 1999, increases in utility rates and fuel prices, and the public sector wage awards (which put pressure on private sector wages). However, inflation slowed to 6% per- cent in the year ended August 2000, mainly because of a stable Guyanese dollar and the under- lying tight monetary policy. 12. The overall public sector deficit (after grants) declined from about 5 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1 percent of GDP in 1999 compared with 3 percent of GDP projected under the program, reflecting lower-than-programmed nonwage and capital spending, which more than offset the shortfall in revenue and grants (Tables 2-4). The public sector deficit was more than covered by concessional external loans, thereby allowing a reduction in public sector domestic indebtedness. To help offset the impact of the wage award in a sustainable manner, in September 1999 the authorities substantially strengthened tax administration and increased the customs valuation exchange rate to close to the market rate to increase revenue. Nevertheless, revenue fell short of the program because of the impact of the civil service strike and weaker-than-expected operating balances of public enterprises (due to lower export prices and a delay of the privatiza- tion of the loss-making bauxite companies). The impact of the high wage awards in 1999 was more than offset by lower-than-programmed current spending, including interest payments (see Table 2).4 HIPC-related social expenditure (at 11% percent of GDP) was ‘/ percentage point higher than the target set at the HlPC completion point as the wage component of social spending increased substantially (see Box 1 and the companion decision point document). 13. In the first half of 2000 the overall public sector balance after grants was close to zero, reflecting robust central government revenue, (which more than offset a recovery in expenditure relative to 1999) and the weaker-than-projected performance of the public enterprises. Central government revenue has been bolstered by tax administration improvements following the establishment of the Revenue Authority in January 2000 and higher tax collections on oil imports. The current balance of the publicly-owned sugar company was adversely affected by flooding and lower-than-projected prices (in Guyanese dollars) for exports to the European market . Public sector expenditure increases reflected the impact of the mandated wage award for 2000, reinforced social spending (including trained teachers and health workers) and the anticipated increase in domestic interest costs. Also reflecting the recovery in social spending, capital invest- ment has kept pace with projections for the year. Large bilateral grants and continued access to concessional external financing allowed a further reduction in domestic indebtedness in the first half of the year. 14. In 1999 and 2000 the Bank of Guyana carried out aggressive open market operations to contain inflationary pressures while avoiding Y2K-related liquidity shortages. Treasury bill rates in the weekly auctions at end-1999 were on average over 3 percentage points higher than at end- 4 Interest costs were lower than programmed in 1999 due to more-than-expected HIPC external interest relief and monetary operations that used longer-term instruments.

However, by end-June 2000, the rates had fallen back by 1% percentage points due to weak private sector credit growth (8 percent in 1999 and only 3 percent for the year ended in June 2000) and high demand for government paper. ’ Private sector credit growth slowed reflecting uncertainties in the lead-up to the January 2001 election, and banks’ efforts to observe prudential requirements in the face of persistent large nonperforming loans (Table 6). In the 1Zmonth period ended June 2000, weak credit demand combined with a 12 percent increase in broad money led to a sizable increase in the foreign assets of the banking system.6 Gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana also increased more than projected, and were equivalent to four months of imports of goods and nonfactor services at end-June 2000. The Guyanese dollar depreciated in nominal terms by 11 percent during 1999, but remained fairly stable in the first half of 2000. In real effective terms, the Guyanese dollar appreciated by 2 percent in 1999, and by 1% percent in the first half of 2000 (Figure 1). 15. In 1999 the external current account deficit narrowed to 11 percent of GDP (compared with a projected 14 percent of GDP), as a decline in imports more than offset lower exports. Both exports and imports were adversely affected by strikes in the first half of 1999. Exports also were affected by weak export prices, particularly for gold and sugar, Preliminary data for the first half of 2000 show a sizeable current account deficit (US%67 million) compared with a small surplus for the same period in 1999 (US$8 million), mainly reflecting a sizeable merchandise trade deficit. While exports rose by 4 percent (with higher volumes tending to offset lower prices), imports increased by about 40 percent in large part due to higher oil prices and a rise in imports associated with foreign direct investment in the gold mining industry. In 1999 net capital inflows fell mainly because of the postponement of certain multilateral loan disbursements from the last quarter of 1999 to the first quarter of 2000. In the first half of 2000, the increase in net capital inflows also reflected an exceptionally high foreign direct investment. As noted above, gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana increased in 1999 and the first half of 2000, as current account deficits were more than covered by capital inflows and original HIPC assistance. 16. In 1999 and early 2000, the authorities made substantial progress in implementing the structural reforms envisaged in the program (Table 1 of the government’s letter dated October, 2000). The state-owned Guyana Airways Corporation was privatized in April 1999, the electricity company in September, and a pharmaceutical company in December.’ However, the 5 Interest rate spreads narrowed in 1999 and early 2000 as commercial banks’ deposit rates increased while lending rates fluctuated along a downward trend. 6 The 12-month growth in broad money was boosted temporarily from 8 percent in November 1999 to 12 percent in December 1999 mainly to avoid YZIK-related liquidity shortages, and the growth slowed to 8’/2 percent by January 2000. ’ In early October 2000, a large public retail outlet also was privatized.

The process of direct contracting (as opposed to bidding) for the sale of these mining companies has begun. On April 30, 1999, the maximum rate under the CARICOM Common External Tariff was reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent. In December 1999 ‘the authorities announced a voluntary severance program for temporary and unqualified civil servants with a view to downsizing the civil service (no separations have taken place so far in 2000). In early 2000, the authorities also implemented an improved cost recovery system for water services, which raised charges while protecting the poor through temporary, targeted subsidies. In January 2000, after much delay, a favorable court ruling allowed the authorities to make the Revenue Authority operational. 17. As to the structural reforms in the financial sector, bid limits on treasury bill yields in weekly auctions were removed in late January 1999, and commercial banks’ reserve requirements on all deposit liabilities were reduced from an average of 15 percent to 12 percent, effective February 1, 1999. In May 1999, the two nonbank deposit taking institutions previously not in compliance with the capital adequacy norms met their statutory requirements (Attachment VII). In December, as scheduled, the expatriate management team of the state-owned Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB) completed the final report on the future of the bank (Box 2). In February 2000, the authorities agreed to restructure the GNCB with a view to bring it to the point of sale within the next 12-15 months. In October 1999 a mission from MAE provided technical assistance on banking supervision, and the authorities now are preparing terms of reference for additional technical assistance from MAE in a number of areas, including bank supervision. III. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Background and the Proposed Strategy 18. Since the May 12,1999 Board discussion, Guyana has faced two major shocks: the large arbitration wage awards to the government employees and an unexpectedly sharp deteriora- tion in the terms of trade. These developments have had an adverse effect on the economy, parti- cularly the public finances. To address the fiscal pressures, the scope for large cuts in the core civil service was discussed, but it became apparent that such cuts had insufficient public support and ran the risk of undermining other reforms. Thus, the authorities focussed on containing the growth of nonwage expenditures and strengthening revenue efforts. However, room for addi- tional expenditure restraint is limited as the authorities are committed to increasing social sector spending (particularly for school buildings and hiring more trained teachers and health workers) and increasing rural areas’ access to public services and markets through an improved transportation network. In addition, Guyana’s high ratio of central government revenue to GDP (around 30 percent of GDP) constrains further revenue efforts. As noted earlier, in the first half of 2000, Guyana also experienced widespread flooding which has adversely affected agricultural production and exports. Furthermore, the run-up to general elections scheduled for January 2001 has increased fiscal pressures and created uncertainty in the market.

The Restructuring of the Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB) l/ The GNCB was established in 1970 by the government of Guyana. In 1995 it was merged with a state-owned development bank (GAIBANK) as part of a fmancial sector adjustment program. The merged bank now accounts for approximately 17 percent of total banking sector loans. The bank has been a loss-maker for much of the 1990s (G%236 million, or 0.2 percent of GDP, in 1999), reflecting rising nonperforming loans. However, overdue loans are well provisioned under the FIA. At end-1999 accumulated losses were G$5.2 billion (slightly more than 4 percent of GDP), covered by an equal amount of nonnegotiable, mostly noninterest bearing debentures issued by the govemment under the Cooperative Financial Act (COFA). Since the beginning of 1999, the nonperfoxming portfolio has shown a net increase of G%750 million. With assistance from the World Bank, the authorities contracted a management team of foreign experts to restructure the bank beginning in April 1999. The team took the following actions to improve the bank’s outlook: a thorough analysis of the bank portfolio; transfer of approximately 80 percent of the loan book to a newly created Recovery Unit, exclusively devoted to collecting loans in arrears; limiting new loans only to the most reliable customers after very close scrutiny; rationalization of branches and staffimg; technological improvements (including new computer&d equipment like ATMs). These actions have improved the bank’s profile by dampening the flow of losses and improving the flow of liquidity. Since its creation, the Recovery Unit has put up aggressive collection efforts, recovering almost a G$ 1 billion, but the management team recognizes that recovery has reached a plateau. The management team also has carried out valuation of GNCB’s eight branches. In addition, a new Board was appointed with the understanding that it will not interfere in the day-to-day management of the bank. The management team’s contract also included the preparation of two progress reports. The first report, completed in June 1999 assessed the financial situation of GNCB. The second report prepared in December 1999 presented three options for the future of GNCB including: (i) closure; (ii) restructuring under government ownership; (iii) and restructuring with a view to eventual privatization. The government chose the third option, which the management team had established to be the least-cost alternative. In April 2000 the foreign management team began the technical groundwork for bringing the bank to the point of sale by May 200 1. Reaching agreement on the steps leading to the point of sale is a prior condition under the program. The team also will provide technical expertise as needed, but the Privatization Unit of the ministry of finance will manage the privatization process. l/ This box updates the one included in staff report EBS/99/65 dated April 28,1999, page 16.

To help foster a stable financial environment, the authorities propose to follow a two-pronged fiscal policy strategy that emphasizes no recourse to domestic financing and a strengthening of the public sector saving performance over the medium term following an expected sharp decline in 2000. Furthermore, they have stated that any shortfall in external financ- ing will be offset by measures to curtail the fiscal deficit to prevent any recourse to domestic financing (the government letter, paragraph 11). They also have committed to ratio&zing the civil service by outsourcing the services of 1,000 guards in 2000 and retrenching 1,000 workers by May 2001. The program envisages a gradual reduction in the ratio of the government wage bill to GDP over the medium term. The ratio of total public sector debt to GDP would decline from 179 percent in 2000 to 160% percent in 2005, notwithstanding a temporary rise in 2001-02. The program includes major structural reforms (paragraphs 33-36) and two prior actions in revenue and privatization areas (paragraph 40). B. The Program 19. The program is based on an average annual real GDP growth of 4% percent over the medium term (2% percent in 2000 and 4 percent in 2001, Table 1).8 The 12-month rate of inflation is targeted to decline from 8 percent in December 2000 to 6 percent in December 2001 and to 3 percent by 2003. A sustained increase in national and public sector saving is projected following a period of decline through 2000. Private investment is projected to rise steadily, while public sector investment will recover from the low 1999 level. The external current account deficit would peak in 2001, and is expected to be more than covered by external grants and concessional loans (paragraph 40). Gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana are targeted to rise to ensure that they remain equivalent to 3’/+t months of imports. The program envisages major privatization efforts and other reforms in the public and financial sectors to enhance economic efficiency and growth prospects. C. Fiscal Policy 20. Fiscal policy under the program is based on the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy.g As envisaged in the revised guidelines for the PRGF, more spending on poverty reduction projects ’ A return to normal weather conditions in 2001 is projected to increase temporarily real GDP growth. Also, it is assumed that GUYSUCO’s modemization will give a permanent boost to economic growth in 2003. ’ The I-PRSP also incorporated most of the recommendations outlined in the recent draft Public Expenditure Review by the World Bank, especially concerning health, education, and water services.

However, the proposed larger deficit would be more than financed by greater flows of concessional loans and grants (including original HIPC relief) consistent with a stable macroeconomic environment. 21. The overall public sector deficit (after grants) is projected to rise from 1 percent of GDP in 1999 to 6% percent of GDP in 2000 and 9% percent of GDP in 2001, before turning into a surplus in 2005. ‘O The deficits are expected to be more than covered by external concessional loans (approved or at advanced stages of preparation), thereby helping reduce domestic indebtedness of the public sector substantially in each year over the projection period. 22. Public sector saving is projected to decline sharply in 2000, because the large increase in current expenditures (wages and severance payments, the cost of domestic debt, and one-time costs for the election and the privatization of the electricity company) is not expected to be fully offset by the anticipated rise in revenue. However, public sector saving is projected to increase from 2% percent of GDP in 2000 to 3% percent of GDP in 2001 and to 9 percent of GDP by 2005, mainly through expenditure restraint and increases in the current surpluses of the rest of the public sector (paragraph 25). The new Revenue Authority has begun to improve tax admini- stration, and the authorities were urged to expedite the provision of additional staff, training and computers to further consolidate the gains in efficiency. In early October 2000 the authorities fulfilled their commitment, prior to the Board consideration of their request, to establish an automatic mechanism for adjusting monthly the customs valuation exchange rate on the basis of the market exchange rate. Furthermore, they are examining ways of improving the tax system, including the possibility of introducing a value added tax in the second half of 2004 and a public seminar on this topic is scheduled before the end of 2000.” 23. The central government wage bill will be reduced gradually from 10% percent of GDP in 2000 to 10 percent of GDP by 2005. As noted in paragraph 6, this reduction will be achieved lo The proposed public sector deficits are higher than those in the program presented to the Board in May 1999 mainly due to accelerated implementation of the poverty alleviation program, the recent high wage settlement, and the inclusion of the estimated cost (not quantifiable earlier) of the expected privatization of the GNCB and the modemization of GUYSUCO (Table 2, memorandum item on the adjusted overall public sector balance after grants). Any revision in the GUYSUCO modemization plan as a result of the on-going review by the World Bank is likely to result in a smaller capital outlay than assumed in the program. The program assumes that any external borrowing by GUYSUCO will be on concessional terms. l1 A FAD technical assistance report delivered to the authorities in March 2000 provided recommendations on tax policy and administration, including the operations of the Revenue Authority and the eventual adoption of a value-added tax system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- through a combination of downsizing and keeping the wage bill constant in real terms for most employees (except for the education and health ministries, which need to attract more trained staff to improve the quality of public services).” In order to contain growth of the government wage bill, the staff had sought a larger reduction in the size of civil service than programmed, but the authorities felt this was not feasible (see paragraph 6). While the envisaged reductions would not yield fiscal saving in the short run, they serve to signal the authorities’ intentions to promote efficiency gains in the civil service. To help ensure the envisaged reduction in the ratio of the government wage bill to GDP over the medium term, the mission also impressed on the author- ities the crucial role of adequate consultation with stakeholders (including labor unions). In this context, the authorities felt confident that following the large real wage increases during 1998- 2000, the unions would not be able to press successfully for further real wage increases in the near term. l3 24. The other central government current expenditures (excluding wages, interest payments and one-off items) are programmed to increase by slightly more than the projected rate of inflation.14 The program allows for some additional spending for goods, services, and transfers to local authorities, primarily for poverty-related current spending during 2002-05. Beginning in 2001, domestic interest payments include the projected costs associated with the privatization of the GNCB (0.4 percent of GDP in 2001 and 1 percent of GDP thereafter). In addition, domestic interest payments are projected to rise sharply in 2000 due to recent open market operations through the sale of government paper, but they would decline in relation to GDP over the medium term as macroeconomic pressures diminish. 25. The program assumes that the current surpluses of the rest of the public sector will increase from about 3 percent of GDP in 1999 to 4 percent of GDP in 2000 and 4% percent in 2001. These surpluses are projected to rise in 2000 mainly because of the favorable impact of the rise in domestic oil prices on profits by the government-owned gas stations (GUYOIL). The current surplus of the National Insurance Scheme (NE) is projected to rise beginning in 2001 because of increases in the contribution rate.” The current surpluses of these enterprises are ‘* The World Bank and IDB staff agree with this strengthening of social sector services. l3 The I-PRSP states the authorities commitment to the programmed wage bill policy. l4 The one-off items include spending on elections, utility increases caused in part by privatization, severance payments, and anticipated increases in pension payments to the NIS for government employees. ls The authorities are planning to raise the NIS contribution rate (related to income) from 12 percent in 2000 to 13.6 percent in 200 1 and 15.2 percent in 2003. The NIS benefit spending also would rise but at a slower pace. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- projected to rise to close to 6 percent of GDP over the medium term, reflecting expected improvements in the operations of GUYSUCO and NIS. However, it should be noted that the recent depreciation of the Euro, if not reversed, could adversely affect the operating surplus of GUYSUCO. 26. Because of the lumpiness of the investment for the modernization of GUYSUCO, the level of public sector investment will show sizable fluctuations over the medium term (rising from 16 percent of GDP in 2000 to 20 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2002 before falling back to 13 per- cent of GDP in 2005). Following a sizable cutback in planned central government investment to 9% percent of GDP in 1999, accelerated spending on social sector projects is projected to raise investment outlays to 12 percent of GDP in 2000, peaking at 13 percent of GDP in 2002 before falling back to 11 percent of GDP in 2004-05. The World Bank staff finds the proposed medium- term public sector investment program satisfactory, but will review it in the context of the full PRSP. The stti pointed out that in order to increase public investment efficiently the authorities would need to strengthen their project implementation capacity, particularly procurement regulation and the coordination of capital and recurrent costs of projects D. Monetary, Financial, and External Sector Policies 27. Monetary policy will be conducted to achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives. Interest rates will continue to be determined by market forces. In 2000 and 2001, broad money is projected to grow in line with nominal GDP, but faster than nominal GDP in later years of the projection period (as in recent years) because of improvements in the financial sector and diminished political uncertainty. The recent declining trend in the growth of private sector credit is projected to continue in 2000, but a gradual upward trend in the credit growth is assumed for the remainder of the projection period as the business climate improves. Public sector credit will decline because of the projected reduction in the public sector domestic financing requirement. On this basis, net foreign assets of the banking system would rise, and gross inter- national reserves of the Bank of Guyana are projected to remain between 3% and 4 months of imports over the medium term. 28. The program calls for a strengthening of bank supervision with a view to begin reducing nonperforming loans in the banking system, which the authorities recognize put upward pressure on interest rates and could undermine business confidence and economic growth.i6 In this context, the Supervision Department of Bank of Guyana will begin to strengthen l6 Aggregated microprudential indicators compiled over 1996-99 (Attachment VII) showed that the aggregated risk-adjusted capital adequacy ratio was well above the international standard of 8 percent. Year-end profitability was above 10 percent in recent years. However, the ratio of nonperforming to total loans increased to more than 30 percent by end-1999 after the implement- ation of more stringent definitions and regulations under the Financial Institutions Act (FIA). Provisions for nonperforming loans were in line with the recommendations of the FIA. Sectoral (continued.. .)

Also, as noted below, the authorities will take steps to privatize the GNCB, which carries a large share of nonperforming loans. In order to help develop the domestic capital market, the sttiemphasized the importance of implementing the new Securities Law, and the authorities indicated that they would redouble their search for qualified personnel needed to administer the law. 29. The staff encouraged the authorities to maintain the present policy of allowing the exchange rate to be determined by market forces. While noting that this exchange rate arrange- ment allowed a degree of protection against external shocks, the staff impressed on the authorities the importance of diversifying production and exports. To this end, the staff ernphasized the need to exercise control on the growth of domestic demand and costs, particularly public sector wages, to maintain international competitiveness. 30. Guyana does not maintain any restrictions on making payments and transfers for inter- national transactions. Its external trade system is free from quantitative controls, except for restrictions on imports of a few items relating to health and security. The CARICOM Common External Tariff(CET) has been reduced to 20 percent, effective from end-April 1999.” Guyana is fully compliant in its application of the CET agreed among the Caribbean nations, and further trade liberalization would need to be agreed by all CARICOM member countries.” 31. The authorities have continued to improve their debt management capabilities. With assistance from the U.K. Department for International Development, they have acquired additional computers for the debt management unit. During February 1999 and August 2000, Debt Relief International @RI) provided extensive training to the debt management unit and other relevant official agencies. A national debt strategy workshop was held in September 1999 for the various official agencies, private sector representatives and donors. DRI is presently taking steps to strengthen Guyana’s capability to monitor private sector debt and capital flows. credit concentration did not show excessive lending to any particular sector, but revealed that banks were reducing their exposure to agriculture. ” The simple average import tariff rate, based on 1998 data, is estimated to be 10% percent, with rates ranging from 0 to 100 percent (for further details see Appendix I of the accompanying Statistical Annex). r* The export taxes are mostly negotiated in the context of giving concessions to investment. The authorities are reviewing export taxes with view to eliminating or making them consistent with WTO obligations.

The program provides for increased spending on basic health and education as well as on the provision of potable water and sanitation services, and low income housing.” In May 2000, the authorities decided on a policy of providing free universal access to secondary education to all students within three years (the current access rate is 58 percent). Also, they are committed to increasing the budgetary allocation for social spending in the hinterland over the next three years. In addition, they have been improving procurement procedures to strengthen project implementa- tion capacity. The staff expressed concerns about the large increase in the wage component of social sector spending. The authorities argued that the increase reflected the need to improve the quality of services, by attracting better trained teachers and health workers, as well as the recent large wage increases awarded by the arbitration tribunal. The staff urged the authorities to adequately provide for needed material and supplies for the social sectors. 33. With support from bilateral donors, the authorities intend to develop medium-term expenditure programs for each ministry to improve budget preparation and to exercise better execution and performance monitoring based on sector specific indicators. Along with computerization of budget and treasury operations, this will enhance capacity to assess the impacts of poverty reduction programs. F. Other Structural Reforms 34. With assistance from the World Bank, the authorities intend to bring the GNCB to the point of sale by May 2001. The authorities have finalized the steps leading to this objective (Table 2 of the government letter). The fiscal program provides for interest payments of up to 1 percent of GDP to offset the likely cost of privatization of GNCB. 35. A new investment law is to be tabled in Parliament by end-2000. Further, the two major political parties have agreed to table in Parliament a number of constitutional amendments, including the procurement law. The passage of appropriate investment and procurement laws would enhance transparency and the business environment. 36. As part of the consultation on technical assistance provided by the Fund (Attachment IV), the authorities recognized that further progress could be expected, especially in the implementa- tion of recommendations concerning government finance statistics. In this context the authorities I9 The program includes original HIPC debt relief, but excludes additional spending that could be financed by enhanced HIPC debt relief. Possible additional spending is outlined in the I-PRSP (Section IV, and Tables 4.1-4.3), and covers mostly education, health, and infrastructure projects, with about two-thirds of total additional spending devoted to capital investment (see also the companion enhanced HIPC Initiative Decision Point Document, Table 4). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- have expressed interest in participating in the joint initiative of the Fund and the UNDP to establish the Caribbean Technical Assistance Center by end-2000. 37. As to the restructuring of public enterprises, the authorities are now preparing for direct negotiations with potential buyers for the privatization of the two government-owned bauxite companies. As noted in paragraph 7, the authorities are engaged in the modernization of GUYSUCO to enable it to compete in the face of the impending erosion in the preferential export markets. The World Bank is expected to complete in November 2000 a review of the modemization plan to help finalize it and organize its financing. IV. MEDIUM-TERM BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OUTLOOK AND EXTERNAL DEBT 38. The medium-term balance of payments projections described in the St&report for the 1999 Article IV consultation and the midterm review under the first annual arrangement under the ESAF (EBS/99/65,4/28/99) were revised to take account of the policy understandings described above, as well as to reflect recent developments, and revisions to projections of output, exports, imports, and external financing (Tables 7 and 8). In particular, the impact of GUYSUCO’s investment plan and a weaker terms of trade are now included. In addition, the debt sustainability analysis conducted at the original HIPC Initiative completion point (EBS/99/70) was updated to take into account newly reconciled information for end-1998 (see companion document for the enhanced HIPC Initiative decision point). 39. The external current account deficit is projected to increase from 11 percent of GDP in 1999 to 18% percent of GDP in 2000 and to 22% percent of GDP in 2001 before declining to 12% percent of GDP in 2005. This pattern reflects the large and lumpy nature of GUYSUCO’s investment plan. The terms of trade are expected to worsen in 2000 because of relatively high oil prices and low export prices. During 2001-05 projected improvements in export prices together with relatively unchanged import prices are expected to result in some improvements in the terms of trade.*’ Over the medium term, export volumes are expected to remain broadly unchanged. The bulk of the increase in imports over the medium term represents capital goods imports, as foreign direct investment picks up. Between 1999 and 2005, the value of nontraditional exports is pro- jected to grow at an average annual rate of over 10 percent, but traditional exports (78 percent of total exports) are projected to increase at an average annual rate of around 1 percent because of depressed prices and limited volume growth prospects. Foreign direct investment, concessional financing (already approved or being negotiated) and the original debt relief under the HIPC Initiative are expected to more than cover the current account deficit, thereby helping maintain the gross international reserves of the Bank of Guyana equivalent to 3%-4 months of imports. *’ All export and import prices reflect the recent WE0 projections, except sugar export prices. The sugar industry projections are based on the GUYSUCO projections consistent with its proposed modemization plan.

In accordance with their commitments, the authorities have completed the following actions before Board consideration of their request for a second annual arrangement under the PRGF: (1) agreement on a time table for steps to bring the GNCB to the point of sale and (2) establishment of a system to adjust the customs valuation exchange rate automatically in line with the market exchange rate. The authorities also are preparing a response to the questionnaires on the Safeguard Assessment and the response will be reviewed by the staff in coming months. 41. In addition to the structural performance criteria and benchmarks, including civil service reform and restructuring of GNCB and GUYSUCO (Table 2 of the government letter), quantitative performance criteria have been set for end-March 2001 (Table 3 of the govem- ment letter). Two disbursements (SDR 6.96 million each) are envisaged under the second annual PRGF arrangement: (1) upon approval of the second annual PRGF arrangement; and (2) upon observance of performance criteria for end-March 2001 and completion of the midterm review by end-June 2001 (including establishment of performance criteria for end-June 2001). A third disbursement under the second annual arrangement of about SDR 4 million will be available on observance of performance criteria for end-June 2001. The total amount available under the second annual arrangement is the equivalent of SDR17.92 million (Table 9 and 10). VI. STAFFAPPRAISAL 42. Guyana’s economic performance improved remarkably during 1991-97 as the country reduced its financial imbalances and implemented wide-ranging structural reforms to increase efficiency. However, since late 1997, the country has encountered a series of shocks (terms of trade deterioration, adverse weather conditions, and domestic civil disturbances) and legally mandated large wage increases for government employees. Although the overall public sector deficit after grants was reduced below the program level in 1999, the public sector’s capacity to save and support investment has deteriorated. Increased availability of external assistance has helped Guyana to meet the HIPC social sector spending targets and reduce public sector domestic indebtedness, but this assistance must be supported increasingly by domestic efforts. 43. The authorities recognize that total expenditures, excluding wages, were curtailed to a minimum level in 1999 and that a temporary recovery in these expenditures is needed to accelerate the implementation of poverty reduction programs and to carry out other essential expenditures (including nonrecurrent outlays relating to the election, severance payments, and the privatization of the electricity company). At the same time, room to increase taxes is constrained by the existing high tax to GDP ratio. However, the authorities firmly believe that financial stability is crucial to achieving their goal of poverty reduction. To help foster financial stability, the authorities have been pursuing a fiscal program based on a two-pronged strategy: that the public sector will not engage in domestic borrowing and that it will improve its saving performance over the medium term following the unavoidable sharp decline in 2000. The staff endorses this strategy. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- 44. The proposed economic program for 2000-01 and the medium term is aimed at reducing poverty through targeted programs, structural reforms and maintenance of financial stability. The program is realistic in seeking to achieve an average annual increase of 4% percent in real GDP, reduce inflation gradually, and maintain a reasonable cushion of international reserves against shocks. 45. The pursuit of a prudent fiscal policy is crucial for achieving these goals. The stti recognizes the need to temporarily allow the overall public sector deficit to rise in 2000 and 2001 before turning into a surplus in 2005. The projected levels of deficit are large, but they are expected to be more than covered by concessional external assistance. To avoid slippage in fiscal policy, it will be important to monitor fiscal developments, particularly the wage bii and nonpriority spending, and to stand ready to take corrective fiscal actions. The ratio of public sector debt to GDP, although large, is projected to decline over the medium term, facilitating the achievement of a sustainable ratio of external debt to government revenue by 2001. 46. As to the public sector investment program, Guyana needs to modernize GUYSUCO, which generates sizable employment and exports, to enable it to compete in the face of the impending erosion in preferential export markets. However, it is important that the authorities ensure that the modernization plan is economically viable and technically sound, and that any borrowing needs are met from concessional sources (consistent with the spirit of the HIPC Initiative). Further, the authorities should strengthen their project implementation capacity, particularly the procurement system, to achieve efficiently the projected level of public invest- ment needed for poverty reduction and economic growth. 47. The sta.fT supports the authorities in their objective of raising public sector saving to shore up public sector investment efforts. In this context, the stafEng and training of the new Revenue Authority should be expedited. However, given the high ratio of tax to GDP, the authorities are encouraged to focus on restraining current expenditure, particularly the wage bill. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to reducing the ratio of government wage bill to GDP over the medium term. It is important that the policy of keeping the government wage bill constant in real terms, noted in the I-PRSP, is publicly discussed to increase support from all stakeholders, including unions. The authorities should continue to seek a voluntary reduction in the civil service but should also be prepared to make involuntary cuts if needed. The staff fully supports the rationalization of the civil service through the separation of security guards and temporary and unqualified workers, and the implementation of a comprehensive civil service reform in the medium term. These actions should help increase fiscal saving over the medium term and signal the importance being attached to efficiency gains in the provision of public services. Further, the authorities should closely monitor other current expenditures, while protecting social sector spending. 48. In recent years Guyana has had commendable success in privatizing inefficient public enterprises, including the state airline and electricity companies in 1999 (Box 3).

These efforts are necessary for increasing domestic saving to support-poverty reduction programmes. The authorities intend to expedite and widen the scope of their efforts to reduce poverty. In conjunction with the World Bank, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to: (1) provide free universal access to secondary school; (2) increase budgetary allocations to rural areas; (3) improve the provision of potable water, sanitation, and low income housing in social programs; and (4) increase the number of trained teachers and health workers. However, it is important that the wage component of social sector spending be reduced over the medium term and adequate allocations be made for material and supplies to bolster the quality of services. There also is an urgent need to direct more effort to develop sector-specific outcome indicators to monitor the effectiveness of social sector spending. 50. The Bank of Guyana should continue to conduct monetary policy to achieve inflation and balance of payments objectives. Interest and exchange rates should continue to be allowed to reflect market conditions. Since the enactment of the Financial Institutions Act in 1995, prudential requirements have been strengthened. However, the authorities need to address expeditiously the risks associated with the high level of nonperforming loans, including by continuing to enforce adequate provisioning. In this context, the staff notes that bank and nonbank supervision have improved, and supports the authorities request for technical assistance to further enhance supervision capacity. To boost confidence in the financial sector and help develop the local capital market, it will be necessary to expeditiously complete the privatization of the state-owned bank and to begin to implement the Securities Law. 51. Efforts should be enhanced to improve data collection and dissemination for program monitoring and promoting transparency. The authorities urgently need to improve fiscal data collection and the staff strongly supports their efforts outlined in the Technical Assistance Consultation report (Attachment VI). 52. Guyana has experienced a series of shocks since late 1997, which have weakened the country’s capacity to save and invest. In addition, the program for 1999 suffered a major setback from the legally mandated large wage awards to civil servants. Nevertheless, the authorities have met the aggregate social sector spending targets directed against poverty. They also have cooperated in pursuing policies to contain deviations from the program in 1999 and 2000 and have developed a new medium-term policy framework which is appropriate for achieving their economic objectives as noted. However, several risks remain. There continues to be a possibility that the general election (scheduled for January 2001) might be delayed by a few months or that civil unrest may occur. Such a delay or unrest could result in macroeconomic pressures and a slowdown in the pace of implementation of structural reforms (particularly privatization and civil service reform). Further, the civil service unions may demand additional real wage increases, notwithstanding the sizable increases in 1998-2000. Thus, it is crucial that the consultations with stakeholders on the program take place to enhance ownership so that the chances of it being fully implemented are increased. Taking into account these factors, the staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-24- recommends approval of the authorities’ request for the second annual arrangement under the PRGF. 53. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Guyana has requested that the second annual arrangement, in the amount equivalent to SDR 17.92 million, under the three-year arrangement for Guyana under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (EBS/98/101, Supplement 3) be approved. 2. The Fund has reviewed the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (“Interim PRSP”) submitted by Guyana and concludes that it provides a sound basis for the development of a fully participatory PRSP and for Fund concessional assistance. 3. The Fund decides to approve in principle the second annual arrangement set forth in EBS/00/213. This approval shall become effective on the date on which the Fund decides that the World Bank has concluded that the Interim PRSP provides a sound basis for the development of a fully participatory PRSP and for Bank concessional assistance. Upon the approval of the arrangement becoming effective, Guyana may request the first disbursement specified in paragraph l(a)(i) of the arrangement, on the condition that the information provided by Guyana on the implementation of the prior actions specified in paragraph 36 of the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies attached to the letter dated October 30, 2000.

The IDB has been a partner in Guyana’s development since 1976. By 1998, the IDB had approved a total of US$705 million in loans and over 80 technical assistance projects totaling US$45 million. IDB assistance is focused on reducing poverty, the human resources, infrastructure and private sector development, and redefining the role of the state. Adjustment lending is concentrated in the agricultural, financial, energy and air transport sectors, which is expected to lead to significant policy reform and an improved climate for private sector development. Project lending is focused on poverty reduction, education, health, institutional development, and basic infrastructure rehabilitation or expansion. The IDB is currently Guyana’s major source of concessional financing and the largest multilateral donor under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Of the operations approved since 1990 15 loans were active as of September 1 2000 Fbelow) for a total of US$390.0 million, of wmch US$211.9 million remains undisburied.

Of this amount, US$20.6 million has been from Ordinary Capital Resources. Net approvals to the productive sector amounted to USS39.5 million, while resources to economic and social infrastructure and other areas amounted to US$39.2 million. Resources for multi-sector usage stood at US$54.5 million. At the end of 1999, Guyana had a total outstanding balance of USS52.3 million on ten loans representing five projects under implementation and five projects in operation. The largest component of this balance represents the US$42 million Economic Recovery loan approved in 1990. To date, approximately US$28.6 million is undrawn, representing committed resources on the five projects under implementation. Disbursements have been made on the following loans: Sea Defense - Berbice: Second Road Project: Water Rehabilitation: US$O.6 million, US$6.8 million remaining undisbursed US$7.8 million, US$3.2 million remaining undisbursed US$O.3 million, US$8.5 million remaining undisbursed No disbursements have been made on the following loans: Poor Rural’ Community Proj ect : Drainage and Irrigation: US$S. 1 million US$5.05 million To date, four new technical assistance projects have been approved totalling US$O.76 million Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-47- ATTACHMENT V Guyana: Statistical Issues Most data are obtained during missions and by telephone/fax contacts by the staf& except for monetary, exchange, and interest rates statistics which are provided by the Bank of Guyana on a monthly basis and the consumer price index which is provided with a lag of one month. Although Guyana provides the core minimum data needed for surveillance, there are deficiencies with respect to quality, timeliness, and coverage (particularly in the areas of national accounts, public finance, and balance of payments) that hamper a more comprehensive assessment of economic developments. The Fund and bilateral donors have provided a significant amount of technical assistance in the recent past, but lack of counterpart resources and poor coordination between agencies have limited the improvement. National accounts Considerable work is still required to strengthen the national accounts, including completion of the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) register of enterprises and improvement in response rates for business surveys. Prices From July 1989 through December 1994, because of concerns about the unrepresentativeness of available weights, no official consumer price index (CPI) was published. Since January 1994, an index has been compiled by the BOS, based on weights derived from a household income and expenditure survey @TIES) and prices collected in the Georgetown area. Government finance The June 1998 GFS mission was a follow-up to a 1993 STA multisector mission, which expressed concerns about the classification of government transactions and the need to resume GFS reporting. A 1997 MAE mission found substantial weaknesses in the public accounting system and inconsistencies in monetary and fiscal data. The 1998 GFS mission found significant deficiencies in the fiscal data. In particular, the mission found that (i) there is a lack of clarity and documentation regarding compilation procedures and available fiscal data, (ii) annual data, which (unlike monthly fiscal data sent to WHD) covered all budgetary transactions, had significant statistical discrepancies, (ii) budgetary central government data reported monthly for Fund monitoring purposes covered only revenue and expenditure transactions, (iv) some budgetary central government data were not collected on a cash basis, and the procedures for recording transactions were deficient, and (v) the Accountant General permitted unwarranted flexibility in the recording of transactions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-48- ATTACHMENT V The mission outlined a plan of action aimed at improving the compilation and reporting of these data. The plan called for, in the near term, unproved reporting of GFS aggregates on the budgetary central government on the basis of improvements in the data base, reclassifications of transactions, and adjustments identified during the mission. While many improvements have been made, work needs to be undertaken to compile and report consolidated data on the budgetary and social security subsectors. The plan, calling for the subsequent compilation of GFS data, explained that the timing for compiling GFS would depend on additional resources to ensure an adequate data base, on the extent of institutional coverage and detail of compiled GFS data, and on the priority given to the work by the authorities. The authorities need to demonstrate a commitment to compile and report adequate and timely fiscal data to the Fund’s Statistics Department. Monetary accounts Most of the recommendations relating to monetary statistics made by the 1993 multisector mission have been implemented, but coverage is yet to be extended to include credit unions and pension funds. Further work is needed to develop detailed consistency with government finance statistics. Balance of payments The Fund assigned a balance of payments advisor to the BOG during June 1995-June 1996 to assist in establishing a compilation system for balance of payments statistics according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. This was followed by a technical assistance mission from November 25-December 13, 1996. The mission was in response to the need to lend further support to the Bank of Guyana (BOG) to implement the enterprise-based survey approach for compilation of BOP statistics. The authorities have made some progress in implementing the recommendations contained in the Advisor=s final report of July 19, 1996. However, BOP data in the Bahnce of Payments Yearbook is only available through 1995. The BOG Act of 1998 has designated the BOG as the official compiler of BOP statistics and has empowered the BOG to collect all data relevant for BOP purposes. A BOP unit has been created in the BOG Research Department and a BOP standing committee, chaired by the Governor, has been set up. However, the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) will maintain its own in-house capacity for BOP compilation, as it views the BOP as an integral part of the national accounts. Deficiencies with the ASYCUDA system have not yet been resolved, and therefore, the BOS has not replaced its own system for processing customs data with the ASYCUDA system.

FAD provided technical assistance on fiscal management in November 1996 and recommended: developing macroeconomic capacity; establishing systematic revenue forecasting procedures; reforming and enhancing budgetary management; and strengthening institutional structure with the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The mission opined that a resident fiscal advisor could play a valuable role in implementing these recommendations and provide “hands-on” training to staff, as long as this included adequate domestic counterpart resources and close coordination with other external assistance. FAD fUrnished a long-term expert during October 1997September 1998, but the assignment was not successful because of grossly inadequate local interaction and support. In the event, the assignment was terminated prematurely because of internal security disturbances. Subsequent progress appears to have been modest. In late 1999 an FAD mission on tax policy and administration visited Guyana. In its final report furnished to the authorities in early March 2000, the mission identified three areas in which (unspecified) external technical assistance should be sought. It called for effective operationalization of the newly established Revenue Authority (RA). Specifically, it recommended replacing consumption duties on domestic and imported goods by a consumption-type value-added tax, spearheaded by a development unit created within the RA to undertake preparatory work over a two-year period. It also suggested canying out an in- depth review of existing production-sharing arrangements for natural resources (e.g., timber, gold, and shrimp), taking into account open-ended long-term tax exemptions previously granted and the tax regimes in investors’ home countries. The authorities announced in their 2000 budget that they would consult with stakeholders, during 2000, to examine the applicability of the FAD recommendations on the value-added tax. Technical assistance needs If the authorities pursue the implementation of a value-added tax, as recommended in the recent FAD report, follow-up technical assistance would be useful (see section on CARTAC, below). In addition the authorities have identified training needs to support the new Revenue Authority and the macroeconomic and fiscal policy unit that will be established in 2001 to measure macroeconomic performance, advise the minister of finance on policy actions, assess and react to risks, and to review budgetary performance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5l- ATTACHMENT VI IL Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department Assessment of technical assistance effectiveness In recent years, MAE has provided technical assistance to Guyana in banking supervision, payment systems, accounting and reconciliation of fiscal and monetary accounts, auditing, organization and methods, monetary operations, and general policy advice. This technical assistance has been provided through visits by staff and short-term experts, long-term resident advisors, and an MAE inspection visit. Although positive results have been achieved, MAE technical assistance to Guyana has been far less effective than expected, given the resources devoted. The reasons include the lack of cooperation among BOG departments and limited trained staff in the BOG. Also, long-term advisors have found it difficult to obtain the necessary information to perform their tasks well. In general, there has been reasonably good progress in the area of banking supervision. Financial sector legislation has been enacted; prudential norms in line with regional and internationally accepted criteria have been developed; and inspection stti has been trained. Some problems remain in commercial banks’ compliance with prudential regulations, related mainly to the limits set for loans to individuals and groups and the timely submission of reports. Technical assistance in late 1999 therefore addressed the legal steps for applying sanctions and penalties for noncompliance with the Financial Institutions Act 1995. In monetary operations, open market operations have intensified since January 1999, and the restraints on Treasury bill bids removed, allowing interest rates to reflect market forces. In 1997 an International Department was established and the BOG began intervention in the forex market (albeit without the full development of front- and back-office itiastructure), using a simple telephone offer/bid mechanism due to the small size of the market. Preliminary steps also were taken to set up a reserves management committee and establish investment rules and dealer guidelines. Under the PRGF program the authorities are committed to refraining from intervening in the foreign exchange market except to smooth sharp fluctuations. On the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary accounts, a BOG-MOF coordination committee was established in 1997 to ensure that large disparities in cash accounts did not reappear; however, the committee has not met recently and reconciliation remains an issue. The BOG also reassessed the recommendations of the MAE expert, who provided assistance in organizational structure with a view to strengthening the core departments. In the payment system area, there has been commendable progress in the reform effort, marked by: 1) formal publication of the Operating Circular governing the National Clearing House (NCH); 2) formation of the Operations and Technical Committees of the NCH since 1998; 3) adoption of the check standardization program with the MICR technology Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - ATTACHMENT VI platform; and 4) rationalization of the existing clearing house procedures and cut-off hours for same-day clearing and settlement. Progress has also been made to implement the national automated clearinghouse. In audit and accounting, some success has been achieved in developing an improved accounting classification system for use as a basis for the budget process, and in updating the accounting and auditing systems, covering a wide range of specific topics. The long-term policy advisors provided additional assistance; for example, they helped in the coordination of technical assistance and in its implementation, while rendering advice as required by the Governor. Some specific tasks were pre-assigned; however, a few were not fully completed. Advisors: (1) completed models for the computation of nominal and real effective exchange rates; (2) trained BOG staff on important macroeconomic linkages in the economy; (3) improved the identification of BOG research priorities; and (4) assisted in the refinement of reserve money programming, improving the information and database for decision making, and refining open market operations. Technical assistance needs Guyana will continue to need additional technical assistance in all areas of central banking noted above. The recent acceleration of reforms in some areas could indicate that the effectiveness of tuture technical assistance might improve over time. The BOG has identified technical assistance needs and detailed terms of reference are being developed for long-term technical assistance. The priority will be to provide long-term technical assistance in banking supervision to strengthen the authorities’ bank inspection efforts (see section on CARTAC, below) especially to provide guidance on specific steps on intervention and closure. III. Statistics Department Assessment of technical assistance effectiveness STA provided limited technical assistance to Guyana in recent years following a 1993 multisector statistics mission. Some data sources remain weak and additional work may be needed. The 1993 mission provided recommendations on real sector statistics and staff from the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) have attended courses on national accounts at headquarters. The consumer price index is limited to the capital, Georgetown. Resources for economic statistics at the BOS remain limited. Follow-up technical assistance by the Fund has not occurred. The authorities note that only four staff compile the national accounts and the CPI. Therefore, there are pressing needs for quality training in these areas. In addition, users have emphasized the need to provide quarterly national accounts and broader measures of inflation. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - ATTACHMENT VI Most of the money and banking statistics recommendations contained in the 1993 report have been implemented and data continue to be received in a timely manner. However, coverage of the statistics may need to be reviewed, given the structural reforms, including application of the financial institutions act and privatizations that have occurred in recent years. No technical assistance on balance of payments and external debt statistics has been provided by STA since December 1996. However, in part through the authorities’ follow-up and technical assistance provided by other Fund departments in recent years, the compilation of balance of payment statistics and statistical reporting to the Fund were improved and the institutional capacity of the BOG was strengthened. Stemming from the joint efforts by the Fund and the World Bank in the context of the I-UPC Initiative, the quality and timeliness of external debt statistics also have improved. A government finance statistics (GFS) mission visited Georgetown during June 1998 to assist the authorities to improve fiscal statistics, to reconcile government and banking records on fiscal activities, and to review the procedures used to compile fiscal data reported for operational work of the Fund The GFS mission report was sent to the authorities on September 24, 1998, requesting comments by February 28, 1999. The 1998 GFS mission found that there were major deficiencies in the MOF database on government transactions. In particular data on financing was incomplete, discrepancies existed between MOF and BOG fiscal data, and the National Insurance Scheme was not covered in general government statistics. Furthermore, a comprehensive national classification scheme, with linkages to the GFS system, needed to be established to allow fiscal data to be reported on a standard basis. The mission found that there was a clear need for improvements to staff training and resources to allow these improvements to be made. Most of the improvements recommended by the mission were not implemented, in part due to the departure and non-replacement of trained staff at the MOF. Technical assistance needs While needs have been identified, especially on government finance statistics, there are no plans to undertake further STA technical assistance work in Guyana in FY 2001 (see section on CARTAC, below). IV. CARTAC Guyana has expressed its interest in participating in the joint initiative of the Fund and the UNDP to establish the Caribbean Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC, based on the model in the Pacific - PFTAC) by end-2000. An assessment mission visited Guyana in early March 2000 and held discussions with the authorities to identify technical assistance needs in this context. During this visit, the authorities identified a broad variety of training needs. The newly established RA has identified 30 priority training courses, including advanced tax courses for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - ATTACHMENT V-l senior managers, investigative techniques, the tax implications of money laundering, and transnational operations and tax evasion. The MOF underlined the need to develop and retain trained staff and specified training needs to include: the budget cycle (especially integrating capital expenditure in the budget process), treasury operations, macroeconomic management and programming, policy analysis and development. Specifically on the capital program training needs were identified covering the project cycle, negotiation, evaluation, and development of the public sector investment program. At the same time, the treasury emphasized training needs on the preparation and interpretation of financial statements in the accounting and auditing units. The BOG restated their request for support in the area of banking supervision, especially regarding risk assessment and management and insolvency issues. In addition, they noted the need for assistance in the preparation of a standardized chart of accounts for banks and non-banks, guidelines and regulations for financial institutions, (particularly guidelines for implementing a new anti-money laundering law), and further training on the 1993 SNA in the balance of payments division of the BOG. The BOS included national accounts as well as labor and poverty related statistics training among its priorities, noting that there is only one trained person in the BOS at this time, preferably in the form of long-term technical assistance or a series of short-term visits.

The most important change was the adoption in May 1995 of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA), which updated regulations to internationally accepted standards.2 The resulting tightening of the standards revealed, in particular, a large ratio of nonperforming loans prompting an increase in provisioning, which somewhat depressed banks’ profitability. This attachment briefly analyzes various aggregated microprudential indicators of the Guyanese banking system over 1996-1999 (reported in the attached Table). Profitability and earnings The indicators of profitability point to a slight deterioration over 1997-99. Most income indicators have declined during the period, whereas expense indicators have risen. In particular, the ratios of net operating income to both total assets and total income have dropped. Both returns on assets and equity increased in 1998, but dropped in the following year. However, the rates of return appear sound. Asset quality The level of nonperforming loans is relatively large in Guyana. Under the more stringent regulations of the FIA, the level of nonperforming loans was determined to be much higher than under the old regulations. Thus, the level of nonperforming loans increased from 9 percent under the old regulations in 1996 to 24l/ percent under the new FIA regulations in 1997. In 1998, the combination of economic recession, civil disturbances, and bad weather conditions (El Nifio) sent the ratio soaring by another six percentage points to 30% percent. In 1999, the ratio continued to rise. Excluding the troubled state-owned commercial bank (GNCB), the ratio increased from 14 percent in 1997 to 22 percent in 1999. Since a large share of banking system loans were made to distressed rice farmers and the associated milling industry, who continue to suffer from unstable weather and depressed export prices, nonperforming loans may not decline significantly in the near term. Guyana would need to achieve continued strong economic growth, thus improving private sector profitability, in order to quickly and durably reduce the level of nonperforming loans. Provisioning currently covers slightly more than half the amount of nonperforming loans. Considering the scale of the problem, banks were given four years (1998-2001) to ’ The Guyanese banking system is composed of seven banks. ’ The implementation of the FIA has been gradual. For instance, the Supervision Guideline (No. 5) was issued in June 1996 and became effective only in June 1997, as banks were given one year to adjust. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicATTACHMENT VII fully comply with the provisioning requirements for nonperforming loans, with a June 1999 mid-target of 50 percent of the requirement. However, any new nonperforming loan has to be fully provisioned immediately. Loans to related parties were 23 percent of the capital base and 4 percent of total loans in 1999, which represented a small increase over 1998. These levels appear fairly large and could be the result of the recent privatization of several commercial banks, which were acquired by large companies. Sectoral credit concentration shows a relative decline of agriculture and households and the relative increase of manufacture and services. This would indicate diversification of the economy away from its traditional base, but also may reflect the fact the banks are now more careful in lending, particularly to agriculture which has been a prime contributor to the nonperforming loans. The evidence shows that, relative to their contribution in nominal GDP, manufacture and services attract the largest share of credit to the private sector. Credit to agriculture has declined in absolute terms, and also in relation to its weight in nominal GDP. Domestic financing of mining and quarrying is negligible compared to its share in nominal GDP, as these activities are largely externally funded. Credit concentration, as measured by the ratios of loans to the top twenty borrowers to total loans and the capital base, has be declining. Capital adequacy ratios The aggregated capital to risk-adjusted assets is well above the international standard of 8 percent established by the Basle committee. It improved steadily from 12.3 percent in 1996 to almost 17 percent in 1998 and declined slightly to 16.7 percent in 1999. Prior to 1998 only one bank was not in compliance, but since then all the banks comply with the minimum requirement.

In May 1998 the International Monetary Fund approved a three-year arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, now the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), in support of Guyana’s economic and financial policies. On May 12, 1999, the Executive Board concluded the 1999 Article IV consultation, completed the midterm review of the first annual arrangement under the PRGF, and determined that Guyana had reached the completion point under the original HIPC Initiative. 2. In 1999 and thus far in 2000, Guyana faced economic shocks, particularly adverse terms of trade and a protracted civil service strike leading to large wage awards by a binding arbitration decision. However, the government remains fully committed to the main thrust of the agreed policy framework under the PRGF. In 1999 the overall fiscal deficit after grants was lower than programmed because of expenditure cuts and revenue measures to offset the wage awards. Nevertheless, HEX-related social expenditure was kept higher than the target set at the HIPC completion point. Substantial progress has continued to be made in the implementation of structural reforms (privatization and trade and financial sector reforms), and additional major reforms are envisaged under the program to be supported by the second annual PRGF arrangement. 3. Because of the complications arising mainly from the large wage awards and the preparation of an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), a suitable program could not be developed for support under the second annual PRGF arrangement immediately following the expiration of the first arrangement. In the interim, the government has sought to contain deviations from the original adjustment path by reducing public sector domestic indebtedness and by measures to improve public sector saving over the medium term. The government is also committed to a gradual reduction in the central government wage bill in relation to GDP through a civil service reform and a policy of keeping the wage bill constant in real terms over the medium term (with minor exceptions for teachers and health workers). The government intends to pursue this strategy to provide a stable financial framework to enhance economic growth and to implement poverty reduction programmes. 4. In the attached memorandum on economic and financial policies the government sets forth the financial policies (based on the above strategy) that it intends to follow during the period under the second annual PRGF arrangement (October 1,2000-September 30,200l). In support of this programme, the Government of Guyana is seeking assistance from the international community and also requests Fund approval of the second annual arrangement Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59- under the PRGF in the amount equivalent to SDR 17.92 million (with the first purchase of SDR 6.96 million to be made available after approval of this arrangement). 5. With the participation of civil society and Guyana’s development partners, the government has begun designing a poverty reduction strategy which is to be completed in mid-2001. In the meantime, extensive consultations have been held and the government has prepared an I-PRSP, which describes the process and specifies the preliminary objectives for combating poverty. The I-PRSP will be transmitted to you separately. 6. The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached memorandum on economic and financial policies are sufficient to achieve the objectives of its programme under the second annual arrangement, but stands ready to take additional measures that may prove necessary. Moreover, during the period of the second annual arrangement, and as long as Guyana has financial obligations to the Fund under the arrangement, the Government of Guyana will consult with the Managing Director of the Fund on the adoption of any measures deemed appropriate, either on its own initiative or at your request. 7. The Government of Guyana will communicate to the Fund all information needed to assess the progress made in implementing its economic and financial policies and in achieving the program objectives. Guyana will cooperate with the International Monetary Fund in conducting a midterm review of the second annual arrangement under the programme, to be completed no later than June 2001. This review will focus particularly on the implementation of the government’s wage bill policy, outlined in paragraph 15 of the attached memorandum. Sincerely yours, ISI Saisnaraine Kowlessar Minister with responsibility for Finance Offke of the President ISI Dolly Singh Acting Governor, Bank of Guyana Attachment: Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies for 2000-01 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - ~MEMORAND~JMONECONOMKANDFINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2000-01 I. INTRODUCTION 1. Following two decades of declining economic activity and high inflation, Guyana’s economic performance improved substantially during 1991-98. Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 6 percent in 1991-98; inflation was drastically reduced; the public sector deficit after grants was reduced Corn 23 percent of GDP to below 5 percent of GDP; monetary policy was tightened; and external competitiveness was improved in the face of adverse external shocks. These financial policies were strongly supported by sustained implementation of important structural reforms that removed price controls; liberalized the exchange and trade systems; raised fiscal revenues through a tax reform; installed private management at the state-owned sugar company; privatized major public enterprises, including two state banks; enacted a new central bank law; and recapitalized the Bank of Guyana and eliminated its quasi-fiscal deficit. The number of poor people has been significantly reduced and the access to and quality of social services, in particular education, have improved. Nevertheless, poverty remains high and the high debt burden continues to inhibit a more aggressive poverty reduction effort. (See the I-PRSP, transmitted separately). II. PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION 1999-2000 2. Following a sizeable deviation from the fiscal path due mainly to EZ NiSo and adverse terms of trade, the first annual program was modified in May 1999 to help achieve sustainable economic growth and medium-term macroeconomic stability. In particular, it focused on fiscal consolidation efforts while increasing expenditure on the social sectors and strengthening policies to promote national savings and private investment. In this regard, macroeconomic performance in 1999 was broadly satisfactory, with the exception of a large civil service wage award. 3. The government’s firm resolve to implement the programmed wage policy led to a two-month strike by civil service unions in May-June 1999. The wage dispute was referred to a binding arbitration tribunal, which awarded salary increases of about 3 1 percent in 1999 and 26.7 percent in 2000. In separate negotiations for 1999, teachers and security personnel were also awarded lo-12 percent salary increases. Despite the strike, real GDP grew by 3 percent in 1999 and is projected to rise by 2% percent in 2000, reflecting mainly variations in weather conditions affecting agriculture. After increasing from 4% percent in December 1998 to 8% in December 1999, the 12-month increase in consumer prices fell to 6 percent in July 2000. In 1999 the overall public sector deficit was 1 percent of GDP compared with the programmed 3 percent of GDP, reflecting expenditure cuts in areas other than the social sectors and measures to increase central government revenues. In 1999 and the first half of 2000, the government also made substantial progress in implementing structural policies, particularly, in privatization and trade and financial sector reforms (see Table 1). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6l- m. THE PROGRAMME FOR 200&2005 4. The government’s medium-term objective is to achieve a high rate of economic growth and to reduce poverty, while fostering a stable economic environment. The government believes that a sustained expansion in private sector activity is crucial for achieving enduring growth. To provide a stable financial framework for its poverty reduction efforts, the government would continue to pursue a strategy of reducing public sector domestic indebtedness and increasing public sector saving over the medium term (after a temporary decline in 2000). 5. In line with the above strategy, the government will continue to implement policies and reforms to ensure average annual growth of 4% percent of real GDP. National saving is projected to increase from an estimated 10 percent of GDP in 2000 to 17% percent of GDP in 2005, while investment would rise from 28% percent of GDP to an average of about 32 percent of GDP during 2001-05. Inflation will be targeted to decline to about 3 percent by 2003. Reflecting partly the proposed lumpy investments of the government-owned sugar company (GUYSUCO), the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) would rise from an estimated 18% percent of GDP in 2000 to an average of 22% percent of GDP in the following two years before declining to 12% percent of GDP in 2005. Because of the high degree of openness of the Guyanese economy and its vulnerability to external shocks, gross international reserves will be maintained at around 3l% to 4 months of imports over the medium term. 6. To achieve the medium-term objectives, fiscal policy will emphasize increased revenue mobilization, while at the same time strict control will be exercised over public spending through rationalization of its structure and increases in efficiency. The goal will be to allocate more resources to the social sectors while ensuring adequate allocations for investment and maintenance of public infrastructure. The ratio of the central government wage bill to GDP will be reduced gradually through civil service reform and pursuit of a policy to keep the wage bill constant in real terms (with minor exceptions for teachers and health workers). This, together with improved budget control and execution should make the budget a more useful tool for measuring the impact of social programs on poverty, increasing public savings, and monitoring implementation of the public investment programme. The program will also emphasize the need to maintain the high rates of implementation of structural reforms achieved in 199912000. In particular, the government intends to implement the comprehensive reform of the civil service, complete the privatization of the bauxite companies and the Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB); and strengthen banking supervision. 7. The government has prepared an interim PRSP (I-PRSP) that describes the process of consultations in preparing the PRSP, Guyana’s poverty profile, and data gaps. Also, it reviews policies implemented recently to stabilize the economy and to reduce poverty; sets out a medium-term macroeconomic framework on which the programme is based; indicates the key elements of the poverty reduction strategy and a timetable for its preparation. A Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - matrix of objectives and measures that the government intends to implement over the medium-term has also been prepared. 8. In preparing the programmes and setting the targets that would underpin the full PRSP, the government intends to further seek the active participation and support-both technical and financial-of public agencies, civil society, and its development partners. This process will lead to the preparation of a full PRSP by mid-200 1. In this regard, the PRSP may require government to modify some of the specific assumptions and objectives underpinning the programme supported by the PRGF. IV. THEPROGRA~~~~FORO~~OBER~~~O-SE~~~R 2001 9. Within the medium-term framework, the programme envisages real GDP growth of 2% percent in 2000, and about 4 percent in 2001. In 2000, flooding has adversely affected rice and sugar production, which are expected to recover in 2001. The 12-month rate of increase in consumer prices is targeted at 8 percent in December 2000 and 6 percent in December 200 1. 10. Inflows of grants and concessional financing are expected to be significantly higher in 2000 and 2001 (including external financing for GUYSUCO’s modemization plan which is being negotiated). The terms of trade are projected to deteriorate sharply in 2000 due to lower export prices and higher oil import prices. However, the terms of trade would improve in 2001 with a projected decline in oil prices and a recovery in the prices of main exports. Taking into account these factors, and the projected rise in the public sector deficit, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) would rise from 11 percent of GDP in 1999 to 18 percent of GDP in 2000, and 22% percent of GDP in 2001. The external current account deficits are expected to be more than covered by grants (including original HIPC assistance) and concessional loans, allowing international reserves to be equivalent to 3 G-4 months of imports. A. Fiscal Policy 11. Due to the accelerated implementation of social sector programmes and investment projects as well as costs associated with the modemization of GUYSUCO and privatization of GNCB, the overall public sector deficit (after grants) is programmed to rise to 6% percent of GDP in 2000 and 9l% percent of GDP in 200 1. The deficits will be more than covered by external concessional loans (approved or being negotiated), thereby allowing a sizable reduction in domestic indebtedness of the public sector. In the event of a shortfall in external grants and net external financing, measures will be taken to curtail the overall public sector deficit and to prevent recourse to domestic financing. 12. The programme aims to increase public sector revenue from 33 % percent of GDP in 1999 to an average of about 3 5 percent of GDP in 2000-200 1. To reach the government revenue targets in 2000 measures have been taken to boost revenues and to further improve the efficiency of the collection agencies. The Revenue Authority is now fully operational. The Authority will pay particular attention to improving tax and customs administration and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 63 - strengthening its current programme to combat tax fraud and corruption. Also, the Authority will continue to focus on the computerization of its operations and training to improve the skills of its human resources to ensure maximum efficiency gains in revenue collection. In addition, on October 9, 2000, the government established a mechanism that automatically adjusts the customs valuation rate so that the prevailing rate is equal to the mid-rate as computed by the Bank of Guyana on the last Friday of the preceding calendar month. The Bank of Guyana mid-rate is based on the average market rate of the three largest commercial banks. 13. The Inland Revenue Department of the Revenue Authority will continue to restructure the tax unit in charge of large enterprises by reinforcing its staff and upgrading its equipment, with a view to raising the quality of, and access to data contained in-the national taxpayer database. The Revenue Authority has already stepped up its audit services for both the customs and tax departments which has led to higher revenue collections so far in 2000. Recruitment of staff at the Revenue Authority will be completed by end-December 2000. The government is also considering the feasibility of a value-added tax. Technical assistance was received from the Fund in 1999, and a tax-workshop is planned in November to discuss the merits and feasibility of an alternative tax system suitable for Guyana. 14. On the expenditure side, the government will exercise restraint, particularly concerning the wage bill and nonpriority spending, in order to allocate adequate resources to public investment and basic health and education services. Total expenditure of the public sector will rise to 48% percent of GDP in 2000 and 5 1 percent of GDP in 2001 (before falling back close to the 1999 level in 2005). This reflects largely social sector spending under the HIPC Initiative, the restructuring of the government owned bank, the lumpy nature of the GUYSUCO investment, and spending on infrastructure improvements. 15. The wage bill will be strictly limited to the programmed level of 10% percent of GDP in 2000 and 200 1, allowing for increasing recruitment of qualified personnel in the social sectors and the general wage award in 2000. Beginning in 2001, the government is committed to keeping the central government wage bill constant in real terms (with minor exceptions for teachers and health workers). In this context, the growth of the wage bill will be limited to the projected increase in consumer prices. Further, the government will continue its policy of allowing a gradual reduction in central government employment through attrition (estimated to be 3 percent a year). The government also has begun to prepare a more comprehensive public sector modemization program, with support Corn the IDB (see below). 16. The government’s social sector policies, geared toward poverty reduction, are detailed in the Interim PRSP. The government is committed to allocating significant resources, including HIPC assistance to the social sectors with the objective of improving access to education, health, housing, and water and sanitation services. The government has recently announced its aim to provide universal access to secondary education by 2003. Training for education and health personnel is a critical input for enhancing quality in these sectors. In addition, the government intends to undertake reforms to improve social safety Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-64- nets and ensure better targeting of poverty programs through the Social Impact Amelioration Programme (SIMAP) and the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) to poorer areas. The government is making efforts to expedite procurement reforms, improve the social sector database, and contract out to the private sector the maintenance and security of public buildings. 17. The higher public sector investment reflects partly faster implementation of several projects already in the pipeline to combat poverty and improve social infrastructure. Therefore, the government will strengthen the monitoring of project implementation, in close cooperation with donors and creditors. The government intends to meet its commitments regarding the provision of counterpart financing. In consultation with the World Bank and as part of the preparation of a till PRSP, the government intends to review by end-2000 the public investment program for the period 2000-05, outlined in the I-PRSP so as to develop a program of social projects that could be supported under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 18. In line with the need to better target and improve the efficiency of expenditure, the government intends to reform the budget preparation and execution procedures beginning in 2000. With the support of the Canadian International Development Agency, the government will strengthen the line ministries and fully implement programme budgeting at the ministry level. This will allow line ministries to exercise greater responsibility in the preparation and execution of their budgets and their performance will be monitored based on sector specific indicators. This reform, together with the computerization of all budget and treasury operations, will allow the government to more closely monitor the impact of programmes on poverty reduction. B. Monetary Policy 19. Monetary policy will be conducted to help achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives of the programme. The central bank will continue to allow interest rates to be determined by market forces. The Bank of Guyana will continue to improve indirect monetary policy instruments, to develop inter-bank and securities markets, and to strengthen banking supervision. 20. The government will strongly support the central bank in its efforts to strengthen Guyana’s financial system. The Bank of Guyana will continue to monitor prudential requirements to ensure that banks’ portfolios do not deteriorate further. To that end, the Bank of Guyana will urge commercial banks to improve the quality of their assets. 21. The average annual increase in broad money is expected to be in line with the projected growth in nominal GDP in 2000 and 2001. The net creditor position of the public sector together with slower (than nominal GDP) growth in private sector credit would allow a modest buildup of net foreign assets of the banking system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - C. External Sector Policies 22. The government remains committed to a liberal trade and exchange system. To this end, it will review its trade policies to ensure consistency with CARICOM and WTO requirements. This, together with the maintenance of a market-determined exchange rate, should enhance Guyana’s external competitiveness and facilitate recovery in the nontraditional export sectors. Consistent with the HIPC Initiative, and to further improve its debt service profile, Guyana will continue to rely exclusively on external grants and concessional loans to help finance public sector operations. In the case of GUYSUCO, the World Bank is assisting in arranging for concessional loans for the modemization programme but, if such financing were not to become available on a timely basis, the government would like to revisit the restructuring issues with the World Bank and the Fund sta.K 23. The government will seek agreements with all its multilateral and bilateral creditors on the modalities for delivery of assistance under the HIPC Initiative, and seek to obtain from all bilateral creditors treatment at least comparable to that granted by the Paris Club. It will limit the contracting and guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt with a maturity of one year or more, with the exception of normal short-term trade credits. D. Structural Policies 24. The structural reforms that the government will implement during the programme period are summarized in the matrix attached to the I-PRSP (see also Table 2). The major reforms cover the civil service and other public sector reforms, privatization of the GNCB and other companies that have already been brought to the point of sale; modernization of GUYSUCO; strengthening of bank supervision; and improvements in the environment for the private sector. 25. The government is concerned about the difficulties encountered in its efforts to restructure the civil service in the past. Given the urgent need to contain the size of the wage bill, the government plans to reduce the size of the civil service during the second annual arrangement under the PRGF. The government plans to separate 1,000 security guards from the core civil service by October 2000. In addition, the government is seeking the voluntary separation of 1,000 temporary and unqualified workers from the core civil service by end- May, 2001. The World Bank stands ready to support the government with concessional financing for severance packages following the separation. To introduce better control over the government payroll, the government with the assistance of the World Bank will complete the computerization of the public service payroll and pensions by end-December 2000. Also, it will issue directives to end wage payments outside the computerized system by end- December 2000. 26. The government is negotiating with the IDE a longer-term comprehensive Public Sector Modemization Programme (PSMP) to enhance its ability to deliver public sector services. It has reached agreement with the IDE on the technical assistance component (TC) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 66 - of the public sector modemization programme. The government intends to begin implementing the TC which requires completion of staff audits, job descriptions, and a performance appraisal system by end-September 2001. 27. Important progress has been made in the reform of public enterprises. GUYSUCO’s operations will be modemized with a view to reducing costs and improving competitiveness in anticipation of eventual erosion of preferential export markets. Steps have already been taken to rationalize operations through the amalgamation of management of contiguous estates. With the assistance of the World Bank and the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the government intends to decide on the scope and financing of GUYSUCO’s modemization programme by March 200 1. 28. The government intends to privatize all large public enterprises with the exception of the three nonfinancial enterprises (Guyana Oil Company, GUYSUCO, and Guyana National Shipping) by end-200 1. The enterprises remaining in the public sector will be restructured and their management improved to increase efficiency and domestic savings. The privatization of Guyana Stores Limited is expected to be completed by October 2000. The two bauxite companies again were brought to the point of sale in 1999 but the sale could not materialize, and the government is now engaged in direct negotiations with interested parties. It is expected that these entities will again be brought to the point of sale by end-May 2001. The government will continue to intensify efforts to complete the sale or liquidation of remaining smaller public enterprises that are currently advertised for sale. 29. In the financial sector, the government will take actions to prepare the GNCB for privatization. It will prepare a report designed to determine the range of market values for the bank, identify preferred options for financing any equity gap by November 2000) and prepare bidding documents and memorandum of understanding for the sale of GNCB by April 2001. The bank will be brought to the point of sale by end-May 200 1. 30. At a Business Summit organized by the government in October 1999, the government agreed with the private sector on policies to enhance competitiveness and make the private sector the driving force behind rapid and sustained economic growth. The main elements of this strategy, which is supported by Guyana’s development partners, include strengthening the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for business; and improving relations between the private sector and government. With regard to the legal framework, the government will by end-2000 introduce an investment code/law designed to simplify and clarify the legal environment under which businesses operate in Guyana. In addition, the government will implement the Securities Legislation Act beginning in October 2000. 31. In other areas of structural policy, the government intends to press ahead with the reform of tender and procurement processes. Consistent with this and to enhance transparency and facilitate faster project implementation, the amended tender and procurement bill will be tabled in Parliament by March 2001, subject to other requirements under the Constitutional Reform. Restructuring of the Central Tender Board including establishment of a new procurement supervising body will be completed by September 2001.

The government remains committed to the pursuit of appropriate environmental protection policies and will seek passage of recently tabled legislation to regulate the manufacture and use of pesticides. E. Poverty Reduction Policies 33. The government embarked on a broad-based consultation with private businesses, trade unions, non-governmental organizations (NGGs), religious groups, and other civic groups and town meetings to develop a National Development Strategy that formed the main input for the I-PRSP. The full PRSP will involve additional consultations with stakeholders and is scheduled for completion by mid-200 1. 34. In the 2001 budget, the government will include additional sociai programs that could be financed by possible interim assistance under the enhanced HIK Initiative. In the education sector they include recruitment and training of teachers, maintenance of schools in poorer areas and ensuring an increase in secondary classrooms and teaching materials commensurate with the government’s goal of universal secondary education by 2003. In the health sector, the measures would include the recruitment of nurses, training of health personnel, improving data collection and analysis for reform. V. PROGRAMMONITORINGANDPRIORACITONS 35. To monitor progress in economic policy implementation under the 2000-01 programme, quantitative and structural performance criteria and structural benchmarks under the second annual PRGF arrangement, are summarized in the annexed Tables 2 and 3. These include a floor on net foreign assets of the Bank of Guyana, ceiling on the net domestic assets and net domestic financing of the Bank of Guyana, net borrowing requirement of the nonfinancial public sector, new concessional borrowing, external arrears, and outstanding short-term debt of the nonfinancial public sector. The above variables relating to end- March 2001 constitute performance criteria and indicative targets have been set for end- December 2000 and for end-June and end-September 2001. Structural performance criteria and benchmarks apply to certain measures including the completion of certain actions relating to civil service reform, restructuring of GNCB and GUYSUCO as described in Table 2. 36. In early October 2000, the government completed the following actions that it had committed to take before Board consideration of the request for the second annual PRGF arrangement: l A firm timetable has been agreed for the privatization of GNCB, including intermediate steps, with sufficient detail to allow agreement on structural performance criteria. l An automatically adjusted market-based valuation exchange rate has been established.

To better monitor programme performance, the government will soon establish a programme monitoring unit in the Ministry of Finance. In addition to assessing performance, the unit will coordinate work to improve data for programme monitoring, including the reconciliation of real, fiscal, monetary and external accounts.

This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets forth the definitions of the variables used in quantifying the targets and benchmarks, and explains the adjusters to these targets and benchmarks. The limits and targets referred to in the letter dated October 2000 (Table 3) are cumulative from December 3 1, 1999, and include debt relief provided under the original HIPC Initiative but exclude any additional relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. 2. All data for monitoring developments under the Fund supported program will be sent directly to the Fund’s Resident Representative within four weeks from the end of the relevant month or quarter. The Guyanese authorities will send through the Fund’s Resident Representative office monthly information on the operations of the public sector as specified in section C below, as well as the information on the monetary sector reported by the Bank of Guyana, main macroeconomic indicators reported by the Bureau of Statistics, and external financing as reported by the Ministry of Finance. In addition, timely information will be provided to the Fund on economic and financial measures taken by the government and changes in legislation, including laws approved by the Parliament and other key economic agencies, especially on the structural reforms highlighted in the program. A. Quantitative Targets 3. The net foreign assets of the Bank of Guyana (BOG) are defined as the gross international reserves of the BOG less current short-, medium-, and long-term external liabilities, rescheduled external liabilities, and (if any) external payments arrears of the BOG. Gross international reserves are defined as foreign bank accounts, securities, gold, SDRs excluding the net position in the Fund, and working balances in foreign currencies. Non-U.S. dollar reserve assets and liabilities are converted into U.S. dollars at the cross-exchange rate prevailing on December 3 1, 1999, except for the U.S. dollar/SDR rate which is assumed at US$l.40803 = SDR 1. ’ 4. The net domestic assets of the BOG are defined as currency held outside the Bank of Guyana less net foreign assets of the BOG (as defined in paragraph 3 above) converted into Guyana dollars at the agreed accounting exchange rate.2 5. Thepublic sector is defined as the nonfinancial public sector (as defined in paragraph 6) and the BOG, but excludes the Guyana National Cooperative Bank. 6. The nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) comprises the central government, the National Insurance Scheme, and the nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises and agencies ’ Excludes any encumbered reserves. 2The assumed accounting rate is US$l=G$182.

The total net borrowing requirement of the NFPS (NBR) is defined as the sum of : (i) net external financing (paragraph 7); and (ii) the net domestic borrowing by Nl?PS (paragraph 8). 7. Net externalfinancing is defined as the sum of the net inflows in foreign currencies (as reported by the Ministry of Finance) to the NFPS converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction. Net flows in foreign currencies to the NFPS are defined as the sum of disbursements (including loans, suppliers’ credits, leases, or any other financial instrument that gives rise to an external liability), less scheduled principal payments, plus principal and interest payments rescheduled or forgiven in the period, plus external arrears (see paragraph 9), plus net inflows from the GUYSUCO retention account. 8. The net domestic borrowing requirement by NFPS is the sum of (i) the change in the stock of domestic debt of the NFPS; (ii) net receipts from divestment; (iii) the change in domestic arrears of the NFPS; (iv) the float; and (v) the value of domestic land sales by GUYSUCO. The change in the stock of domestic debt of NFF% (to be reported by the BOG) consists of changes in the net credit extended by the domestic financial system to the NFPS, excluding net receipts from divestment; and changes in the stock of treasury bills, debentures, and defense bonds held by the nonfinancial private sector, except for special debentures issued by the treasury to cover unrealized foreign exchange losses of the BOG and provisions for bad loans of the Guyana National Cooperative Bank. Treasury bills will be recorded at face value, except for those held by the banking system which will be recorded on a purchase price basis.

Changes in the externalpayments arrears of thepublic sector will be defined as the difference between the external scheduled debt service of the public sector that has fallen due and actual debt service as reported by the Ministry of Finance and the BOG less amounts programmed to be rescheduled, forgiven, or in dispute. Scheduled debt-service obligations are defined as projected scheduled principal and interest obligations on outstanding debt, including rescheduled debt and debt arrears plus projected principal and interest on new debt to be contracted. 10. Contractual debt service not paid following the signing of respective bilateral agreements with creditors and normalization of debt to other creditors will be considered to be in arrears.

Nonconcessional public and publicly guaranteed external borrowing is defined for this purpose as any financial instrument that gives rise to an external liability for the public sector with a grant element of less than 35 percent, calculated on the basis of currency- specific discount rates based on OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs). The CJRRs to be applied should reflect lo-year averages for credits with a maturity of more than 15 years, and 6-month averages for credits with shorter maturities. The margins added to these average rates are 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15-19 years, 1.15 percent for 20-29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. Where a CIRR is not available for a given currency or time period, a rate based on five-year government bond yields in the currency concerned may be used as proxy. The limit excludes the contracting of short-term import related credits, the use of Fund resources, and refinancing operations. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt is defined to include debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector as defined in paragraph 7. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. --, August 24,200O) but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. B. Adjusters to Quantitative Targets 12. The limit on the total net borrowing requirement of the NFPS will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount that the NFPS scheduled interest payments on external debt falls short of (exceeds) the programmed interest payments. 13. The required increase in the BOG net foreign assets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount that external amortization paid by the nonfinancial public sector falls short of (exceeds) the external amortization payments incorporated in the program. 14. The limit on the net borrowing requirement of the NFPS will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount that project loan disbursements (including the IDA’s possible poverty reduction support credit for projects) exceed (fall short of) the programmed disbursements of US$69.9 million during January-December 2000, and US$85.3 million during January 2000-March 2001. td’. The required increases in the net foreign assets of the BOG will be adjusted upward ownward) by the amount that the cumulative disbursements of nonproject loans exceed (fall short of) the programmed amounts. Similarly, the net domestic borrowing of the NFPS will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of the shortfall (excess) in nonproject loan disbursement. The required NFA will not be adjusted downward and domestic borrowing of NFPS upward by the amount that the cumulative disbursements of nonproject loans fd short of the programmed amounts, except in cases where the shortfall was due to factors other than the nonimplementation of the associated policy conditions. 16. The net domestic assets of the BOG will be revised downward (upward) by the Guyana dollar equivalent of any upward (downward) adjustment in the net foreign assets of the BOG.

C. Public Sector Operations 18. To strengthen the monitoring of the operations of the public sector and minimize possible fiscal slippages from the program targets, the authorities will strengthen appropriate mechanisms to expedite the collection, processing, assessment, and reporting of the fiscal statistics. In this connection, and in addition to the fiscal data regularly provided to the Fund, the Ministry of Finance will provide the Fund’s Resident Representative on a regular basis with the following: a. monthly and quarterly data on the operations of the central government and the public enterprises within four weeks from the end of the reported month or quarter; b. monthly and quarterly (original and revised) budget targets for central government and public enterprises data provided in (a) above as soon as such data become available and no later than one week from the time that such data are compiled (or revised); C. revisions of data previously provided in (a) and (b) above as soon as such data become available and no later than one week from the time of revision; and d. monthly explanations of the main developments and planned policy responses. D. Exchange Market Operations The functioning of the exchange market should continue to be free of restrictions and the exchange rate should be fully market determined. The Bank of Guyana will provide the Fund’s Resident Representative on a regular basis with weekly cambio market information and monthly foreign exchange cash flow of BOG (hard currency receipts and payments).

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Guyana On the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Guyana.’ the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Guyana’ and at the same time approved the second annual arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) along with a disbursement of SDR 6.96 million (US$xx.x million) of the SDR53.76 mil- lion originally committed under the (former Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility) program in 1997. On that occasion, the Executive Board of the IMF jointly with the World Bank decided that Guyana was eligible for additional debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative (see Press Release No. 00/xXx). As a result, the amount of assistance to Guyana from its external creditors provided under the HIPC Initiative in net present value terms will be US$585 million (including US!§256 million under the original HIPC Initiative and US$329 million additional assistance under the enhanced Initiative). The IMF will contribute about US$74 million (US$34.5 million under the original Initiative and US$39.5 million under the enhanced Initiative). ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which foils the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

However, since late 1997, the country has encountered a series of shocks (including weather, the terms of trade, and public sector wage increases). After a decline in 1998, real GDP grew by 3 percent in 1999, while 12-month inflation rose from 4% percent at end-1998 to 8% percent at end-1999. Following a two-month strike by civil servants in May-June 1999 a binding arbitration tribunal granted large civil service wage increases for 1999 and 2000 that put pressure on prices. Despite these events, the overall public sector deficit (after grants) fell from about 5 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1 percent of GDP in 1999, reflecting mainly lower nonwage and capital expenditures. Nevertheless, in 1999 HIPC-related social expenditure at 11 W percent of GDP was about W percentage point higher than the target set at the completion point in May 1999. In addition, progress was made on structural reforms, including privatization of the airline and electricity companies, trade liberalization, and strengthening of the financial sector. The authorities have formulated an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy, which focuses on economic growth and targeted poverty projects within a stable macroeconomic environment. Over the medium term, the program is based on an average annual real GDP growth of 4% percent and aims at bringing inflation down to 3 percent. The program also contains important additional structural reforms, including the restructuring of the state-owned bank and sugar company, civil service reform, and actions to improve the business environment (including new investment, procurement and securities legislation). More spending on poverty reduction projects would contribute to increases in the overall public sector deficit (after grants) in 2001-02 that would shift to a small surplus by 2005. Fiscal policy is based on a two-pronged strategy that: the public sector will not engage in domestic borrowing and its saving performance will improve over the medium term, following the unavoidable decline in 2000. Public saving would improve through efforts to keep government current expenditures (including the wage bill) generally in line with projected inflation. The deficits would be more than covered by concessional external financing, thereby allowing a reduction in public sector domestic indebtedness.Monetary policy would be conducted to achieve the inflation and balance of payments objectives of the program. Interest and exchange rates will continue to be determined by market forces. The program also calls for a strengthening of banking supervision with a view to begin reducing nonperforming loans in the banking system. The enhanced HIPC Initiative focuses on monitoring of outcomes of social spending and other measures for the poor. Relevant social indicators are being developed and the collection of information improved to strengthen the tracking of social sector spending on education, health, housing, water, and direct poverty alleviation capital projects under the program.

It remains possible that the general election scheduled for January 2001 might be delayed by a few months or that civil unrest may occur. This could result in macroeconomic pressures and a slowdown in the pace of implementation of structural reforms. Further, civil service unions may demand additional real wage increases, notwithstanding the sizable increases in 1998-2000. Consultations with stakeholders, including unions, to create consensus on the public sector wage bill policy will be essential to increase the chances of its full implementation.
