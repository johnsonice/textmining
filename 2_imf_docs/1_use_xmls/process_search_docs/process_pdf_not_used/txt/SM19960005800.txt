Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with China were held in Beijing during December l-15, 1995. lJ The mission met with Executive Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC) Dai Xianglong, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, and senior officials from key economic agencies and ministries. China continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV. ,- II. Background and Recent Economic DeveloDments 1. Background Notwithstanding major achievements in growth and structural transformation since the initiation of reforms in 1978, China's economic performance has been punctuated by recurrent episodes of cyclical over- heating alternating with sharp but short-lived periods of retrenchment. 2J These cycles can be traced to the monetary accommodation of surges in investment spending followed by shifts toward financial restraint to quell the resulting inflationary pressures. Policy tightening has been difficult to sustain primarily because of the weak financial position of the state- owned enterprise (SOE) sector that has accounted for the bulk of industrial employment. Furthermore, the degree of restraint has at times been excessive, owing to the bluntness of direct policy instruments, prompting calls for premature relaxation. The current cycle began with a boom in domestic demand, notably investment, triggered by Mr. Deng Xiaoping's call in early 1992 for accelerated reform and faster growth. The boom was fueled by highly expansionary financial policies, contributing to an inflationary surge and disorderly conditions in financial and exchange markets. In mid-1993, macroeconomic policies were tightened to reduce inflationary pressures and slow the growth of output and demand to a more sustainable pace. Demand lJ The staff team comprised Messrs. Neiss (Head) and Adams, Ms. Gotur, Mr. Arora, Ms. Zhou, Mr. Hong, and Mrs. Sahasranam (Administrative Assistant) (all CTA), Mr. Sugisaki (OMD), Mr. Norregaard (FAD), and Mr. Hwa (World Bank). Mr. Scott (Resident Representative) and Mr. Winglee (Deputy Resident Representative) assisted the mission. Mr. He (Advisor) and Mr. Zhang (Executive Director) joined the mission for the first and second weeks of the mission, respectively. 2J For a further discussion, see W. Tseng, H.E. Khor, K. Kochhar, D. Milhaljek, and D. Burton, Economic Reform in China: A New Phase, Occasional Paper 114 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, December 1994).

Although administered price increases and supply problems were also significant contributory factors, rapid monetary expansion further fueled by a growing external surplus accommodated much of the increase in inflation. Against this background, the authorities intensified their efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability and set themselves the objectives of moderating growth to about 9 percent in 1995 and reducing annual average inflation to 15 percent, through curtailing liquidity expansion and further slowing fixed investment, particularly by the SOE sector. At the time of the last consultation, Directors welcomed these objectives and policies, which they saw as requiring support from a faster pace of trade liberalization and, in the event of a continuing large external surplus, more upward flexibility in the exchange rate. On structural policies, they called for further progress in developing the policy infrastructure for indirect macroeconomic management, strengthening revenue performance, and addressing weaknesses in the SOE and financial sectors. They also strongly encouraged China to accept the obligations of Article VIII at an early date. 2. Data weaknesses Previous staff reports have noted the difficulties in assessing macroeconomic developments in China owing to severe weaknesses in the economic data. While the authorities have taken steps to address these weaknesses, with support from the Fund and other agencies (Annex IV), statistical problems have grown particularly acute in the last two years. In particular, there has been a sharp increase in unrecorded transactions in the external and monetary accounts (of both the PBC and the commercial banks) as well as the emergence of a number of inconsistencies in the data. 2J These problems are increasingly hampering the assessment of I-J The Third Plenum adopted a comprehensive reform strategy directed at achieving a breakthrough in China's efforts to transform the economy to a fully market-based system. The authorities describe the goal as a "socialist market economy," in which market forces play the fundamental role in resource allocation while public ownership (in the form of corporatized SOEs and collectively owned units) remains the mainstay. 2J In 1994, for example, the expenditure-based estimate of GDP in the national income accounts exceeded the output-based estimate by over 3 percent of GDP. There are also large discrepancies in 1995 between the net foreign asset accumulation implied by the balance of payments and the decumulation recorded in the monetary accounts of the banking sector.

Recent develoDments The most notable economic development in 1995 was the authorities' success in reducing inflation to just below the targeted 15 percent (annual average), without causing a sharp deceleration in growth as in previous periods of disinflation. At the same time, the external sector remained strong, with a further increase in the current account surplus and continued large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. These developments took place against the background of a modest tightening of financial policies and intensified controls on investment spending; stepped-up2 administrative measures to dampen inflation; and improved food supplies. On the structural front, progress was made in implementing the wide-ranging actions--related to central banking, fiscal reform, the exchange system, and the legal framework--spurred by the Third Plenum Decision as well as in undertaking new initiatives in these areas (discussed further in Section III). China and the United Kingdom have formalized the legal and economic framework for the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the Basic Law of 1990. These documents imply no changes in the framework governing economic relations between China and Hong Kong. For a description of the envisaged transition and the growing economic linkages between China and Hong Kong see SM/96/33 (page 21) and SM/95/23, Supplement 1. GDP growth Real GDP growth slowed from almost 12 percent in 1994 to about 10 percent in 1995, with moderating domestic demand offsetting a small stimulus from net exports. The moderation in domestic demand was primarily the result of a continued sharp reduction in (nominal) fixed investment growth (of state-owned units) to about 20 percent in 1995. 1/ On the other hand, after slowing somewhat in 1994, consumption recovered modestly in 1995 owing mainly to gains in rural incomes associated with agricultural price increases and the adjustment in the grain procurement price in 1994. 1/ Notwithstanding a sharp slowing in fixed investment growth since 1993, the ratio of fixed investment to GDP has declined only moderately, reflecting strong underlying momentum. In official statistics, "state-owned units" (SOUs) include the central and local governments, all agencies and enterprises under their supervision, as well as joint-ownership units (both domestic and foreign) in which the state is one of the owners. In 1994, investment by SOUs is estimated to have accounted for 75 percent of total fixed investment, with SOEs accounting for a similar share of SOU fixed investment.

This decline was attributable to the easing of demand pressures and the dissipation of the effect of adjustments to administered prices in 1994, while a good harvest, augmented by higher food imports, contributed. To contain price rises, the authorities also resorted to administrative measures: stepped-up price surveillance, increased price subsidies, and postponement of administered price increases. lJ External sector The balance of payments data should be interpreted cautiously, in view of the large unidentified transactions (amounting to negative $26 billion), recorded as "errors and omissions" in 1995. These transactions could reflect a significant and unexplained increase in unrecorded capital outflows, although there are also weaknesses in the recording of other items in the balance of payments including, in particular, current transactions (Box I). The continued strength in the balance of payments boosted international reserves from $54 billion at end-1994 to about $77 billion (slightly over seven months of imports) by end-1995 (Table 3). The improvement in the current account (about 1 percent of GDP) mainly reflected the continuation of strong exports through the early part of 1995, driven in part by the lagged impact of the efficiency gains associated with the 1994 exchange market reform, 2J and the anticipated reduction in the VAT rebate on lJ The increased resort to price subsidies has been widely reported; the budgetary data do point to some increases in such subsidies but do not appear to capture them fully. 2J Prior to the exchange market reform and the unification it entailed, the system of export retention quotas (which entitled the holder to the purchase of foreign exchange at the official rate for import purposes and which could be sold at the swap market price) led to 80 percent of export proceeds being effectively converted at the swap rate. This implied that the "effective" depreciation associated with the exchange market unification was significantly less than the 50 percent depreciation of the official rate. However, under the old system, the significant part of the retention quotas accrued to foreign trade corporations and local governments rather than the domestic exporter. Thus, the elimination of the retention quotas may have raised considerably the return to domestic exporters.

After averaging negative $8-10 billion a year during 1992-94, errors and omissions rose to minus $26 billion in 1995 (almost 4 percent of GDP), approximately the same order of magnitude as the overall balance of payments surplus. These unrecorded flows pose serious difficulties for the assessment of macroeconomic developments and the formulation of balance of payments projections. The significant increase in “errors and omissions” in 1995 may be related to difftculties in any of the following components in the balance of payments: a Merchandise trade: The increase might reflect a significant increase in the overreporting of exports and/or underreporting of imports. Such misreporting could reflect fraudulent practices on the part of exporters seeking to obtain higher refunds than VAT payments on inputs during early 1995; increased evasion of import duties; and/or deteriorating data collection. Large-scale misreporting would be expected to be reflected in an increase in the discrepancies between the aggregate trade data reported by China and that of its international trading partners. Even though there have been large discrepancies between the exports recorded by China and the imports of China’s major trading partners in the last few years, these discrepancies did not increase in the first half of 1995 (the period for which data are available). On the other hand, discrepancies between China’s recording of its imports and partner country exports to China have remained small. l Factor incomes oavable abroad: China’s balance of payments records very low profit repatriation on foreign direct investment in China. In 1995, recorded profit remittances were less than $1 billion compared with a stock of foreign direct investment in China estimated by the staff at over $80 billion. Reliable estimates are not available on the rate of return on foreign investment in China. However, given that the bulk of profits is believed to be reinvested in China, balance of payments accounting should record both a higher level of net factor payments abroad and a commensurately higher level of capital inflows. Provided a significant share of profits is reinvested in China, the net impact on the overall balance of payments would be small. The current account surplus would, however, be reduced by the appropriate accounting for net factor payments abroad. 0 Foreign direct investment inflows: An explanation that has received attention.. is that investors may be artificially inflating their foreign direct investment in China to take account of generous tax concessions. This can be accomplished by sending funds out of China and bringing them back as “disguised” financing for new foreign direct investment (“round tripping”), leading to an over- statement of m capital flows. While such “round tripping” is potentially important-some estimates suggest that it may have led to an overstatement of FDI flows by 20-30 percent in 1993-94-it would need to increase substantially to account for the large increase in “errors and omissions” in 1995. a Caoital outflows: The “errors and omissions” may reflect a significant unrecorded increase in capital outflows from China, especially direct investment and increased holding of foreign assets by residents. It is not easy to identify why such outtlows should have increased sharply in 1995; any increase could be the result of either stepped up foreign asset accumulation by specialized banks (including the Bank of China) and/or increased purchases of real assets abroad, including in Hong Kong. The explanation is difficult to assess in the absence of supporting information from other sources and countries. On the other hand, the monetary survey for China implies that the net foreign assets of the deposit money banks declined sharply in 1995.

As regards the capital account, the surplus rose as a result of an almost 20 percent increase in FDI inflows to $40 billion (partly due to a surge late in the year in anticipation of a phasing out of preferential policies for foreign investors). The renminbi continued to be closely linked to the U.S. dollar and, despite fluctuations during the year related to swings in key currency exchange rates, remained broadly unchanged from its end-1994 level in nominal effective terms. As a result of higher inflation in China relative to its major trading partners, the renminbi appreciated by about 5 l/2 per- cent in real effective terms during 1995, bringing the real appreciation since the early 1994 exchange rate unification to about 20 percent (Chart 2). 4. Macroeconomic oolicies a. Monetary oolicy The tightening in the stance of monetary policy contributed to a significant slowing in the growth of narrow monetary aggregates (Ml and the monetary base) in 1995, but only a modest deceleration in the expansion of broad money (Table 4 and Chart 3). Efforts by the PBC to curtail credit expansion included a moderately tight credit plan and restraint in its lending to specialized banks. These actions served to limit the growth in domestic assets of the PBC, and thereby helped contain the increase in the monetary base in the face of the continuing accumulation of international reserves. u On the other hand, the growth in broad money--a major intermediate target of the stabilization effort--slowed only to 30 percent from 35 percent during 1994, mirroring large increases in informal credit u In early 1995, the authorities announced a reduction in the VAT rebate rate for exporters from 17 percent to 14 percent effective July 1995-- reflecting their suspicion that, partly because of fraud, the rebate rate was yielding higher refunds than VAT payments on inputs by exporters. This incentive could have been another factor underlying the strength of exports in early 1995. 2J However, a new source of base money creation since mid-1994 has been a relatively large increase in the unidentified assets of the PBC--a problem being examined by the PBC. It is noteworthy that, in earlier years, unauthorized lending by the branches of the PBC tended to weaken central control over lending to banks. To bolster control, the authorities decided in late 1993 to prohibit lending by PBC branches to banks and local governments.

L/ As a result, domestic assets of the banking system continued to grow at a rapid pace, reflecting increases in credit hidden in "other items net," which amounted to as much as three fourths of the recorded credit extension during the first nine months of 1995. 2J The expansion in broad money appears to have reflected in part an increase in the demand for money stemming from dampening inflationary expectations and a return of funds to the banking system after the disintermediation in the wake of sharply negative real interest rates and disorderly financial conditions in 1993 (see Chart 3). The reintermediation was spurred by the reintroduction in late 1993 of inflation-indexed time deposits (of three years or longer maturity). The velocity of broad money declined by 7 percent during 1995. b. Fiscal nolicv Fiscal developments in 1995 followed the pattern of recent years--with a small and stable deficit masking underlying pressures stemming from weak- nesses in tax revenue. The deficit in the state budget (on a GFS basis) is estimated to have remained unchanged at about 1.7 percent of GDP in 1995, as budgeted, and was financed entirely by domestic bond issues (Table 5). 3J However, the tax ratio, which has shown a significant secular decline, is estimated to have fallen further in 1995--mainly owing to continuing tax concessions and exemptions as well as problems in tax administration (Box II) --necessitating a further compression in budgetary expendi- tures. 4J In recent years, this compression has resulted in both a reduction in the overall level of budgetary spending in terms of GDP and its deflection to off-budget sources. The former, while including cutbacks in budgetary subsidies (for price support and SOE losses), has fallen mainly on outlays for social and physical infrastructure. The latterhas been reflected in a shift of expenditures off-budget, largely financed by IJ The expansion in bank credit was made possible by a rising multiplier, that, in turn, reflected a decline in the currency/deposit and excess reserve ratios (the latter owing partly to several factors making for greater efficiency in managing reserves). 2J The "other items net" of the deposit money banks declined signifi- cantly in the last quarter of 1995, reflecting efforts by the central bank to crack down on such credit leakages and also possibly improved accounting. 3J Direct central bank lending to the Government is prohibited under the PBC law, except under exceptional circumstances. A/ Reflecting the conservative nature of the budget projections, however, the estimated outturns for the expenditure and revenue ratios exceeded the corresponding budgeted ratios by about 1 percent of GDP.

The Decline in the Tax-Revenue-to-GDP Ratio In common with other transition countries, the ratio of fiscal revenue to GDP in China has fallen sharply and nearly continuously since the initiation of reforms in 1978, reflecting mainly a decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio (see chart below). The ratio of expenditure to GDP has fallen in tandem, however, leaving the fiscal deficit roughly constant at or below 2 percent of GDP. Chart.

The decline in the tax ratio has been reflected across the board, with declines in the shares in GDP of both direct and indirect taxes as well as of customs duties. Direct taxes amounted to 8 l/2 percent of GDP in 1985, but only 2 percent in 1995. The share of the enterprise-income tax, the main direct tax, fell from 8 percent in 1985 to 1 l/2 percent in 1995, mainly reflecting a sharp decline in income tax collected from SOEs. Indirect taxes amounted to 12 percent of GDP in 1985, but only 8 percent in 1995, although the reformed value-added tax adopted in 1994 has yielded an increasing share of GDP in recent years. Customs duties, which have traditionally been relatively small in size, declined by 2 percentage points during the decade to l/2 percent of GDP in 1995. The declining tax ratio, which in several transition countries was linked with declines in output, has in China been the result of three broad interrelated factors: l Structural and institutional changes in the economy have significantly affected tax bases: the SOE sector, traditionally the major contributor to tax revenue, has declined; the share of wages (which are lightly taxed) in SOE value added has increased; the share of exports (which also are lightly taxed) in GDP has increased. Also, institutional changes in the tax system--the replacement of the full transfer of SOE profits by the enterprise contract-responsibility system, which in turn was replaced by a new uniform domestic enterprise income tax-reduced SOE revenue contributions. While these factors may have led to some corresponding increase in extrabudgetary revenues, data limitations make it difficult to verify the extent to which this has ocan-red. 0 The problems resulting from these changes have been accentuated by tax oolicies that are excessively generous to new investments and several other economic activities. Various tax concessions are granted to particular types of enterprises, such as foreign-funded enterprises who enjoy, inter alia, lower-than-standard profit tax rates and duty exemptions on imports of capital equipment. Owing to the various duty exemptions, the overall “effective” rate of customs duty is less than 5 percent. a These factors have combined with a weak tax administration which is still adapting to its new structure and tasks.

The persistently poor revenue performance has led to an undue weakening in the level and composition of public expenditure and, by perpetuating the need for quasi-fiscal activities of the banking system, placed an ongoing burden on monetary policy. However, its overall macroeconomic impact is hard to assess owing to the incompleteness of data on extrabudgetary spending and difficulties in estimating quasi-fiscal activities. Estimates by the staff imply that, despite a small increase in 1994-95, a measure of the fiscal deficit including these factors has been relatively stable in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent of GDP in recent years. 2J III. Report on the Discussions The main challenge for economic policies in the period ahead is to consolidate the recent gains in macroeconomic stabilization and ensure enduring lower inflation. Specifically, the objectives of the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000) are to sustain growth in the 8-9 percent range, with an attendant improvement in living standards, and to maintain inflation at 10 percent in 1996 with further reductions to l-2 percentage points below the real growth rate by the year 2000. The discussions focused on the policy framework needed to achieve these objectives. The staff and the authorities recognized that, for 1996, policies would have to take into account the possibility of lingering inflationary pressures, the extent of which was highly uncertain partly in view of the shortcomings in key economic data. Indeed, it was possible that the large unrecorded outflows in the balance of payments in 1995 might indicate stronger domestic demand--or more excess liquidity--than implied by the recorded data. lJ While complete data are not available, extrabudgetary funds (com- prising more than 1,000 mainly local government funds), are estimated to be in surplus (on a cash basis), with expenditures of about 3 l/2-4 percent of GDP financed mostly by various ad hoc levies and charges, especially on SOEs. There are also five off-budget social funds, which are also in surplus and whose expenditure amounts to about l-l l/2 percent of GDP. 2J The World Bank estimates a broad measure of the public sector balance by consolidating the deficits of the SOE and government sectors. This measure shows the public sector borrowing requirement declining in recent years (from about 13 l/2 percent of GDP in 1992 to about 9 l/2 percent in 1994, the last year for which estimates are available) owing to a small reduction in investment by SOEs and an, as yet unexplained, large increase in SOE deposits with the banking system.

Assessment of 1innerinF inflationary pressures in 1995 The "soft landing" achieved in late 1995 could prove difficult to sustain in light of a possible buildup in inflationary pressures as a result of continued rapid monetary expansion as well as the need for future adjustments in a number of administered prices. l/ While reintermediation into the banking system explained part of the decline in velocity during 1995 (Box III), there was a risk that direct controls on investment, as well as intensified price surveillance, might be temporarily holding back demand pressures. In addition, transmission lags might have delayed the impact of the rapid monetary growth on prices. Deep-seated structural weaknesses in the SOE and financial sectors, as well as ongoing fiscal revenue problems, also posed risks for sustaining the recent macroeconomic achievements and for avoiding a repeat of the "stop-go" cycles characteristic of past performance. Notwithstanding these considerations, it seemed clear that the economy had "cooled" from the intense overheating evident in 1993 and 1994. In this regard, the authorities pointed out that the cooling had been facilitated by a more gradual and selective approach to the control of fixed investment, than in previous episodes of disinflation. Further, the unexpected strengthening of net external demand in 1994-95 also facilitated a less abrupt slowdown of the economy. Also supporting the view that the economy had cooled were the absence of signs of repressed inflationary pressures in informal indicators (such as rationing, queues, and black market prices), and the subdued behavior of "forward-looking" asset prices (such as those for real estate rents and equities). In addition, the external sector had improved markedly from the weakness in 1993, with associated strong upward pressure on the exchange rate in each of the last two years. In these circumstances, significant repressed inflationary pressures from domestic sources did not seem apparent although the possibility that..they might be building up gradually could not be discounted--indeed, the test would come with the easing of the administrative measures to control inflation. 2. Monetarv nolicv and reform The objective of reducing inflation in the medium term called for significant further reductions in the growth of credit and monetary aggregates, given that velocity would be unlikely to continue to decline at the rates of recent years. The extent and pace of the needed deceleration are, however, unclear owing to considerable uncertainty about whether excess liquidity had built up during 1994-95 and the underlying trend decline in velocity. These uncertainties called for a cautious but flexible approach to monetary policy implementation, with the adoption of relatively wide I/ Urban transport fares were raised substantially in several major cities in early 1996.

Au the mlidk¶ are in kg xdc. 0 Factors behind velocitv develonments: The secular decline in the velocity of MO has been closely associated with the process of monetization in China, which has encompassed a number of institutional developments that have encouraged the growing use of money for transactions. The currency-to-GDP ratio increased from 8 percent in 1984 to 12 percent in 1995, which is high compared with industrial countries, but broadly in line with low- to middle-income developing countries. The secular decline in M2 velocity, on the other hand, has been related to financial deepening in China, which has been accompanied by significant increases in financial savings intermediated through the banking sector. The fluctuations in MO and M2 velocities have been closely related to China’s economic cycles, with the velocity of both aggregates tending to move procyclically. Changes in expected inflation and interest rates, both representing the opportunity cost of holding money, have contributed to the fluctuations in velocity. 0 The divergent behavior of MO and M2 velocitv in 1995: While M2 and MO velocity have generally moved together, there have been periods when they have diverged. Most notably, the velocity of M2 declined during 1995, while that of MO increased sharply. The decline in M2 velocity during 1995 reflected a sharp rise in the demand for interest-earning M2 assets, linked to the reintroduction of inflation-indexed interest rates for time deposits, as welJ as subdued investors’ interest in stocks and the real estate market. The rise in MO velocity during 1995. on the other hand, seems to have been related to a number of institutional developments including the increased use of direct bank deposit for wage payments and ongoing improvements in the payments system that are helping to economize on the use of currency. In addition, there may have been a shift out of currency into higher yielding time deposits. 0 Outlook: Is the trend decline in velocity likely to moderate ? Studies suggest that in many countries velocity tends to follow a U-curve pattern. Increased use of money in transactions (monetization) and development of the banking system (financial deepening) lead to velocity falling at an early stage of economic development, while financial sophistication eventually causes it to increase. 21 Typically, the velocity of narrow aggregates tends to bottom out before that of broader aggregates. In the next few years, although the velocities of M2 and MO are likely to continue to decline, the strong downward trends may moderate as the processes of monetization and financial deepening mature. In the case of MO, the moderation in the rate of decline-which may already be in evidence during 1995-would result from further improvements in the payments system and the growing importance of noncash settlement of transactions. The expected moderation in the M2 velocity trend, on the other hand, would reflect the absence of further significant increases in financial saving (as a share of GDP) as well as the growing importance of substitutes for money, such as bonds and stocks.

For 1996, based on a relatively conservative assumption on velocity, the staff suggested that the authorities' growth and inflation objectives would require a slowing of broad money from about 30 percent at end-1995 to the 20-25 percent range during the year. I/ However, the deceleration would need to be more rapid should demand pressures turn out to be stronger than expected. The authorities concurred that a cautious approach to monetary management was essential in view of the present uncertainties, although, on a preliminary basis, they were leaning toward a somewhat slower deceleration in broad money growth to about 25 percent during 1996. They indicated, however, their willingness to allow a faster deceleration of monetary growth, if necessary. Regarding monetary policy instruments, the authorities indicated that they would continue to gradually phase out the credit plan, while pressing ahead with the development of indirect instruments. 2/ In 1996, the plan would be limited to the four specialized banks and policy banks, while credit provision by the other financial institutions would be regulated primarily by asset-liability ratios and PBC control over the monetary base. Within this overall credit stance, the allocation of credit would be further reoriented to meet the needs of agriculture, infrastructure, priority SOE investment projects, and the working capital requirements of profitable SOEs. As indirect instruments are unlikely to become fully operational for some time, continued efforts would be made to control the leakages from the plan. w Looking to 1996, the authorities intend to commence limited open market operations based on Treasury securities; to facilitate these operations, an integrated national interbank market was established in January 1996, allowing for more flexibility in short-term money market rates. Planned actions also include the simplification of the present u The reintermediation process--which had contributed to a reduction in velocity in 1995- -seems to have been mostly completed last year. On this basis, it was expected that the further reduction in velocity would be primarily in line with the long-term trend decline, which itself would be likely to moderate. ZZ/ In 1994-95, the credit plan accounted for 65-70 percent of total credit extended by deposit money banks. The 1995 credit plan covered mainly the specialized banks, with most other banks' lending controlled through recommended asset/liability ratios. With the emergence of a sizable informal market for credit in recent years, the plan's effective coverage has been reduced further. u As part of such efforts, banks have been required to divest their nonbank subsidiaries that are often used to circumvent the plan, while nonbank financial intermediaries --another source of leakage--are required to re-register with the PBC.

At the same time, the continuing implementation of the recently- enacted PBC and commercial bank laws would help strengthen the institutional framework for monetary policy. Recognizing the benefits of flexible, market-determined interest rates, in particular for indirect monetary control, the authorities intend to further liberalize and rationalize the structure of interest rates in a phased manner. To simplify the present complex system of about 200 adminis- tered rates, the PBC intends to significantly reduce the number of lending categories and to announce guidance rates for the main loan maturities. Further, to allow banks more scope for differentiating rates across borrowers, wider margins would be allowed for lending rates. 3. Fiscal policy and reform Discussions in the fiscal area focused on the importance of arresting and reversing the ongoing decline in the revenue ratio--particularly with a view to generating the additional resources needed for meeting prospective demands on the budget. While the 1994 tax reform had done much to improve the tax structure and steps had been initiated to strengthen tax adminis- tration, the envisaged gains in revenue buoyancy had not materialized, as suggested by the declines in the tax ratio in 1994 and 1995. Revenue performance continued to be undermined by widespread import tax exemptions, income tax concessions, and mounting tax evasion, calling for significant additional measures in the areas of tax policy and administration. In addition to strengthening tax administration, 2J the authorities were making preparations for rationalizing preferential tax policies, especially for foreign investors and domestic and foreign nationals engaged in processing trade. 3J While expecting these policies to gradually bolster revenue performance, however, the authorities were not optimistic about their near-term impact, as they would be, in some cases, phased in and, in others, grandfathered. They were also concerned about the possible revenue losses from the proposed tariff reductions (Section 111.3), but recognized that such losses could possibly be offset by the expected I-J Banks are recommended to hold considerable excess reserves in view of weaknesses of the payment and clearing systems; all reserve deposits receive interest remuneration of 9 percent. 2J Reforms in tax administration are still at an early stage, although some improvements have been made at the central level. Further benefits may be expected from ongoing reforms in procedures and computerization, which are being supported by technical assistance from FAD and the World Bank. 3J For a description of preferential tax policies for foreign investors, see SM/95/44, Supplement 1 (3/g/95).

In addition to the planned phasing out of exemptions and concessions, the staff advocated: extending consumer excises, in particular to energy products; and strengthening the personal income tax, through reducing the high threshold and extending the base to include interest income. Improved cost recovery for the delivery of public goods and services would also be important. The discussions also reviewed the additional expenditure burdens that the budget might have to assume over the medium term. L/ Of particular importance was the need to devote more resources to strengthening the physical and social infrastructure, the spending cuts in recent years. which had become underfunded owing to 2/ Other potential demands on the budget pertained to spending associated with SOE and financial sector reform--notably, actions to relieve the enterprises of their social obligations to workers and to help alleviate the burden of nonperforming assets on specialized banks. Furthermore, policy lending currently provided by these banks and in the process of being transferred to the policy banks would need to be financed by the budget, as part of the effort to commercialize the operations of specialized banks. 3J Extrabudgetary expenditures would also need to be brought back into the budget, so as to make fiscal operations more transparent. In assessing the budgetary impact of these various factors, however, the staff underscored the scope for achieving future cost savings from rationalizing expenditures, especially social benefits, and prioritizing investments. Further improvements in budgetary management and control, which are under active consideration by the authorities, would also mitigate fiscal pressures and improve the allocative efficiency of government spending. These envisaged actions would help reduce the broadly defined fiscal deficit in the coming years, consistent with the authorities' goal to eliminate the state budget deficit by the year 2000. For 1996, the authorities were not in a position to discuss the specifics of the state budget (to be announced in early March and discussed in a forthcoming supplement to this report) but indicated that it would be in line with their medium-term fiscal objectives. Given the limited scope for significant additional cuts in expenditure and the need to preclude the further shifting IJ The World Bank has tentatively estimated, on a conservative basis, the additional public expenditure requirements in priority areas to be about 5 percent of GDP (see forthcoming report, China: Updating Country Economic Memorandum, 1996). 2J World Bank estimates show a declining trend in social sector spending in recent years (see World Bank: op. cit.). 3J Three policy banks were set up in 1995 to undertake exclusively policy lending, in support of specific government policies, notably for key state projects, agricultural procurement and development, and trade financing. These banks are to take over the policy-lending obligations of the specialized banks, freeing them to pursue commercial objectives.

Thus, the staff stressed the importance of immediate action to address the persistent weaknesses in tax performance, with a view to raising the tax ratio by 1/2-l percent of GDP in 1996. The authorities agreed that an early strengthening of revenues was essential and indicated that consideration would be given to the staff's recommendations. It would also be important to press ahead with the phased implemen- tation of the 1994 system of revenue sharing between the central and local governments. Progress had been made in the last two years in raising the central government share close to the 60 percent target (prior to transfers to provinces). The next step would be to make headway toward the authorities' objective of reducing regional fiscal disparities through the formulation of a grants mechanism that would take into account both revenue capacities and expenditure needs of local governments. 4. External oolicies Discussions on external policies were framed against the background of the strength of the balance of payments in 1994-95 and the continuing-- albeit diminishing-- surplus on the current account in prospect for the next few years (see Section IV). a. Trade reform There was agreement that the strength of the external sector afforded an excellent opportunity for substantial trade liberalization, consistent with the emphasis accorded by Directors at the last consultation. These actions would further open the economy, increase the efficiency with which foreign investment is absorbed, and enhance China's competitiveness. In view of the relatively restrictive nature of the present trade regime by international standards, the staff called for bold action. Following reductions in both tariff and nontariff barriers in the early 1990s--see table below--progress had recently slowed except for some headway in granting trading rights. Future trade reform would require action in four major areas: completing the liberalization of trading rights by removing restrictions covering individuals as well as foreign and domestic enterprises (and eliminating canalization); dismantling most nontariff import controls, especially on machinery and electrical equipment and also agricultural products; accelerating tariff rate reductions and rationalizing the rate structure; and reviewing current practices in industrial policy to ensure that these do not foster inefficient import substitution.

IJ Mainly import licensing and quotas. 2J Based on statement by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji in November 1995. The authorities envisaged a two-stage action plan for trade reform. The first, announced at the November 1995 APEC meeting, included a reduction in the (unweighted) average tariff rate from about 36 percent to about 22 percent in 1996, with tariff reductions on 4,900 items; and revoking of import quotas and controls on 170 items (equal to 30 percent of all items subject to such controls). In addition, joint-venture trading companies would be established, on a trial basis, in selected cities. The second stage, planned for the next few years, is expected to entail significant further liberalization, with the (unweighted) average tariff rate brought down to about 15 percent--closer to the developing country average--and most remaining quantitative restrictions dismantled. The staff endorsed these plans but indicated that a full evaluation of the APEC package would have to await its finalization in the coming weeks. It would be important to ensure that tariff rate reductions are concentrated on final rather than inter- mediate goods, the rate structure simplified and maximum rates reduced, and foreign trading rights substantially liberalized. On WTO negotiations, the authorities indicated that a number of important issues were still pending resolution, including whether China would eventually be admitted with developing country status.

Exchange svstem reform The staff strongly encouraged the authorities to remove the remaining restrictions under Article XIV, paving the way for acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in the very near future-- an action that would further boost domestic and international confidence in China's reform effort. u In addition to calling for the elimination of the restrictions on nontrade-related service payments, the staff stressed that access by foreign enterprises to foreign exchange should not be subject to prior government approval or examinations, or to compliance with contractual or other obligations. With these practices terminated, there should be no impediment to allowing foreign enterprises full access to the domestic interbank market in the context of a fully integrated and efficient foreign exchange system. The authorities indicated that they intended soon to remove the remaining restrictions- -which in many cases were not being enforced--with a view to bringing forward Article VIII status to perhaps 1996 or 1997 (from their earlier deadline of the year 2000). Still, in order to avoid having "to take one step forward and then two steps back," they wished to be fully confident about the economic situation before removing the remaining restrictions and accepting current account convertibility. The authorities also indicated that only after accepting Article VIII status would they focus on the liberalization of the capital account that continued to be tightly regulated. C. Exchange rate nolicv In reviewing exchange rate policy, the staff took into account the strengthening of the external position in recent years and the medium-term outlook. It was, however, difficult to evaluate the strength of the underlying external position, in view of the large "errors and omissions" in the balance of payments. u Although the special factors that stimulated u The two main remaining areas of restrictions pertain to the limitations on access to foreign exchange for foreign-funded enterprises arising under the special exchange regime applicable to them and limits on the availability of foreign exchange for certain nontrade-related current international transactions. China also maintains restrictions on the transferability of interest income by nonresident Chinese immigrants and on the transferability of the proceeds of certain sales of goods in China by certain nonresidents (for a detailed description, see SM/95/41, Appendix I). In June 1995, the multiple currency practice subject to approval under Article VIII, section 3--arising from the conversion of unused foreign exchange certificates at the old official rate--was eliminated. u For instance, if the "errors and omissions" represent a temporary step up in foreign asset accumulation by banks (including Bank of China), the underlying external position could be much stronger than implied by the overall balance of payments position. Conversely, if stemming primarily from an underestimation of imports, the "errors and omissions*' may reflect a stronger momentum of domestic demand than estimated by the staff. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - exports in 1994-95 had apparently lost their momentum, the external position was expected to remain robust in 1996, albeit with a smaller current account surplus. Against this background, the staff recommended more upward flexibility in the exchange rate in the short term, particularly if the current account surplus remains large or capital inflows were to increase again. The authorities strongly expected the current account surplus to narrow in the next year or two and the unusual strength in the balance of payments to dissipate; furthermore, they reiterated the importance they attached to exchange rate stability and to avoiding sharp upward movements in the exchange rate. In this regard, they also indicated that they considered a strong reserve cushion essential for continuing the reform process, especially external liberalization, and in view of political uncertainties. In response to the authorities' concerns, the staff pointed out that an early and substantial trade reform would help ease upward pressure on the exchange rate and that the current level of reserves, in its view, was more than adequate to meet prospective needs. d. Policies relatine to foreign direct investment Policies relating to foreign direct investment are expected to undergo further significant changes in line with recent initiatives. In 1995, to counter growing income disparities among regions, the Government introduced new regulations to attract FDI into inland provinces, as well to reorient such flows into infrastructure and other high priority areas. As noted, the authorities intend to substantially rationalize the fiscal incentives for FDI in 1996 and in subsequent years, in order to reduce their fiscal cost and level the playing field for domestic and foreign investors. The authorities are confident that China's strong economic performance and large domestic market will continue to attract the FDI needed for its further transformation and development. 5. State-owned enterprise (SOEJ reform The restructuring of the vast and relatively inefficient SOE sector remains the sine qua non for China's transformation into a socialist market economy. Concerned about the ongoing weaknesses and inefficiencies in the state-enterprise sector, the Government has adopted a two-pronged approach to reform. First, it has sought to alter gradually the environment in which SOEs operate, mainly by reducing subsidies provided through the fiscal and banking systems but also by promoting competition through the development of the nonstate sector and increased foreign trade. Second, it has sought to alter incentives within firms by giving management more autonomy, restruc- turing operations, and diversifying ownership. Some headway has been made in these areas but the major tasks lie ahead. In 1995, SOE reform was accorded high priority on the structural policy agenda. Although the authorities have been experimenting with diverse forms of ownership, the main objective continues to be the development of a "modern" corporatized enterprise sector based on autonomous shareholding companies, within a framework of continued dominant state ownership. The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - reform has also stressed the following objectives: improving valuation and management of state assets; divesting enterprises of their heavy social burden; restructuring their overdue debts; strengthening internal management; and alleviating the impact of the sizable labor shedding likely to accompany SOE reform. lJ In line with the guiding principles of China's overall reform strategy, these initiatives are being implemented through experiments, involving a large sample of enterprises across many regions. 2J Although many of the planned actions were initiated in 1995 and progress has been made on several fronts, immediate results are not to be expected. A key reason is that the process is a gradual one, owing to its experimental and medium-term orientation as well as its complexity. Further, with local governments (which own the bulk of the over 100,000 SOEs in existence) at the forefront of the effort, the reform has resulted in a diversity of practices, experiences, and outcomes across regions. The authorities have decided to adopt a dual-track approach in the future: the Central Government would concentrate its reform effort on the 1,000 or so largest enterprises (based on the principle of "corporatization"), while delegating responsibility for the remaining SOEs mainly to lower levels of government and permitting them more flexibility on reform issues. The latter step will allow increased scope for ownership diversification, divestiture, mergers, leasing, joint-venture arrangements, and conversion to cooperative shareholding companies. Consistent with this approach, the authorities intend in 1996 and beyond to expand and extend the experimental actions commenced last year. On the basis of the results of these actions, a clearer overall strategy on SOE reform is expected to emerge. The staff welcomed the above proposals but, as these would take time, called for intensifying action, in the near term, to subject enterprises to greater market discipline and competition, as well as to allow the gradual reduction in the share of bank credit allocated to loss-making SOEs. These efforts, which would also help mitigate the problems of the banking sector, should include stricter constraints with regard to the cost and volume of SOE credit and restraint on SOE wage increases by enforcing guidelines linking wage and nonwage payments to profitability. Furthermore, reform in the SOE sector would have to proceed broadly in parallel with that in the banking sector, as weaknesses in the latter largely mirrored those in the former. 6. Financial sector reform A sound financial sector is very important for ensuring the efficient allocation of resources and supporting indirect monetary management. The discussions reviewed recent and prospective actions in key areas, against lJ About one third of SOE employment is estimated to be redundant. 2J A more detailed discussion of these initiatives is contained in a forthcoming background paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - the background of the envisaged phased approach to financial sector reform. In 1995, the process of commercializing the specialized banks continued, while the newly established policy banks expanded their policy lending. The staff also welcomed the incipient efforts, supported by the recent Commercial Bank Law, to allow the specialized banks somewhat greater autonomy in lending decisions with a view to developing experience with risk assessment and liquidity management. I/ Also noteworthy were the recently approved actions to enhance competition in banking, with the conversion of urban credit cooperatives to banks and the prospective opening of renminbi business to foreign banks on a limited, trial basis. The next steps envisioned in the reform process included: improving the profitability and management of commercial banks; developing funding sources other than specialized banks for the new policy banks; and strengthening regulation and supervision of the financial sector. In particular, to improve the viability of the specialized banks, the magnitude of nonperforming loans in bank portfolios (possibly accounting for 20-30 percent of total bank assets and a somewhat smaller share of GDP, with almost half of such loans being delinquent for more than three years or irrecoverable) would have to be assessed and some government funds provided for bank recapitalization. In this regard, the staff urged the authorities to ensure that the recent initiatives being considered for restructuring SOE debt did not compromise efforts to strengthen bank profitability. In addition, more frequent adjustments in interest rates in line with market conditions, together with the proposed shifting of the cost of the inflation indexation (on time deposits) from the banks to the budget, would ameliorate the very low spreads faced by banks and help improve their profitability. With regard to policy banks, it was important to more fully integrate their financing requirements into the Government budget, while relieving specialized banks of such obligations (including through discontinuing their mandatory purchase of policy bank bonds). In parallel with the increasing market-orientation of the financial system, the PBC should strengthen regulatory oversight not only on deposit money banks but also on nonbank financial institutions. 7. Statistical issues The staff reviewed with the authorities the major weaknesses in China's economic statistics and the urgent need for effective actions to address them. The growing weaknesses reflect in large measure the increasing complexity and structural changes in the Chinese economy and the difficulty of the statistical agencies in keeping pace with them as well as weak accounting systems and diversity of data sources. The heightened problems encountered in assessing the macroeconomic situation in 1995, in particular, underscored the importance of reliable and consistent statistical informa- IJ Anecdotal evidence suggests that the wider options now available for loss-making SOEs with regard to bankruptcy and mergers allowed banks greater scope to reject SOE loan requests.

The staff considered the balance of payments,. monetary statistics, and the national income accounts as the priority areas for improvement. Furthermore, there is a need for greater coordination among the major agencies in China producing official statistics, a step that should help improve consistency across macroeconomic aggregates. The staff intends, in consultation with the authorities, to review the Fund's program of technical assistance in statistics in the context of the broader programs of multilateral and bilateral assistance, with a view to helping to achieve early improvements in the key problem areas. The staff also underscored the emphasis recently placed by the Board on timely publication of high quality economic data to inform markets, calling for wider publication and dissemination of China's economic data. IV. Medium-term Scenarios Notwithstanding major challenges, the medium-term prospects for the Chinese economy are favorable. The continued implementation of the comprehensive reform strategy of the Third Plenum should serve to lay the foundation for sustained noninflationary growth and considerably further advance China's economic transformation and opening to foreign trade. In particular, the envisaged structural reforms would foster the additional productivity gains needed to maintain strong growth and improve living standards. At the same time, the further development of indirect policy instruments and institutions would provide the underpinnings for more effective macroeconomic management and reduce the vulnerability of the economy to large cyclical swings. The baseline scenario illustrates the likely evolution of the economy over the medium term (Table 6). It is predicated on the following key assumptions: pursuit of restrained financial policies to consolidate recent gains and reduce inflation below the growth rate of the economy over the medium term; implementation of structural reforms, to lay the basis for sustained and stable growth; and the maintenance of competitiveness of the traded goods sector through flexible exchange rate management. A modest pickup in domestic demand is anticipated in the near term, as fixed investment recovers somewhat from current levels--with a build up in physical and economic infrastructure--before stabilizing over the medium term somewhat below its average ratio to GDP in the first half of the 1990s. The efficiency gains resulting from the reforms are assumed to allow economic growth over the medium-term to be sustained at 8-9 percent annually, even with a lower ratio of investment to GDP. Domestic saving is expected to decline to a rate more in line with past experience, as the anticipated improvement in government saving is offset by a decline in the rate of private saving owing to continued expansion in consumption possibilities.

Moderate current account deficits would be appropriate for China's stage of development, given the need to utilize available resources to augment growth potential. Notwithstanding the projected evolution in the current account, exports and imports are both likely to grow faster than GDP in the foreseeable future, reflecting the further opening of China's economy. While it is difficult to project capital movements, especially because of the large errors and omissions in 1995, inflows of foreign direct investment are expected to be sustained at slightly lower levels than in the recent past, while small portfolio/equity investment inflows are likely to continue, with the envisaged current account deficits adequately financed. Furthermore, the continued importance of nondebt-creating inflows would imply a reduction in the external debt and debt service ratios in the medium term, while maintaining the import cover of reserves at about 5 l/2 months. To highlight the central importance of continued structural reforms, the staff also reviewed qualitatively the implications of a failure to persevere with the reform process. In the absence of further efficiency and productivity gains from structural reforms, it would be difficult to sustain rapid growth and generate the additional employment opportunities needed to absorb China's growing labor force, 1/ without a significantly higher investment rate. At the same time, deep-seated institutional and structural weaknesses, especially in the SOE sector and revenue performance, will perpetuate the economy's vulnerability to stop-go cycles and the burden on monetary policy. Specifically, for instance, without resolute actions to strengthen tax revenues, budgetary resources would not be available for supporting the planned increases in development spending, to the detriment of growth, while quasi-fiscal operations of the banking system would be perpetuated. Similarly, without SOE reform, credit demands from unreformed SOEs and local governments will continue to put pressure on the fiscal and banking systems as well as pose pressures for premature relaxation of credit and investment controls, thereby risking a rekindling of inflationary pressures and jeopardizing the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. V. Staff Appraisal The year 1995 was a good one for the Chinese economy. Following the intense overheating of the preceding two years, inflation decelerated steadily to single-digit levels, while the growth of demand and output moderated toward more sustainable rates--with the elusive "soft landing" achieved. The external position remained strong, owing to robust albeit moderating export growth and continued sizable inflows of foreign direct lJ The forthcoming recent economic developments paper reviews labor market issues in China.

On the structural front, ongoing reforms in the financial and fiscal sectors are gradually helping to strengthen macroeconomic management, while the emerging initiatives in SOE reform are laying the basis for an improvement in this sector's performance over the medium term. The authorities are also preparing for a significant liberalization of the trade and exchange regimes and are considering advancing the date for China's acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII. Notwithstanding these favorable developments, a cautious approach to financial policies is essential in view of a number of risks in the outlook. Most notably, the reduction in inflation in 1995 was supported to some extent by administrative actions ("price surveillance" and delays in raising administered prices) that cannot, and should not, be relied upon for an extended period. Furthermore, notwithstanding the likelihood that increases in money demand helped absorb part of the sizable expansion in broad money in 1994-95, excess liquidity may have built up. This possibility, together with the normal lags in the effects of money growth, carries the risk of a rekindling of inflationary pressures in the coming year. These uncertain- ties are accentuated by the difficulties in assessing the extent of the strength of underlying demand pressures owing to heightened data problems. At the same time, deep-seated weaknesses in the SOE sector and in revenue performance, which constrain the sustained implementation of appropriate financial policies, have yet to be adequately addressed. The staff supports the authorities' macroeconomic objectives of sustaining growth in the range of 8-9 percent over the medium term, while keeping inflation at 10 percent in 1996 and reducing it gradually thereafter to slightly below the growth rate of the economy. Achieving the inflation objective will require a significant slowing of broad money growth, given that velocity is unlikely to continue to decline at the rates of recent years. However, because of the uncertainties about the macroeconomic situation, policy implementation will need to be flexible. The attainment of the macroeconomic objectives for 1996 will require that broad money growth be reined in from current high rates to the range of 20-25 percent during the year, with the authorities prepared to move quickly to the lower end of this range if necessary. The ongoing erosion in the effectiveness of the credit plan underscores the importance of developing the policy infrastructure for indirect monetary management. The staff welcomes the establishment of an integrated interbank market in early 1996 and other actions planned for this year, including the start of open-market operations on a limited scale and the greater use of asset-liability ratios in controlling bank lending. Notwithstanding the ongoing progress, however, the move to indirect monetary instruments will take time and will need to be supported by reforms in other areas, notably the SOE sector. In the near term, the credit plan will continue to be an important instrument of monetary control, calling for a strengthening of ongoing efforts to curb the leakages from it.

In their absence, the budget will continue to come under pressure-- perpetuating the demands on the banking system to undertake quasi-fiscal lending operations and thereby complicating monetary policy. Continued revenue weakness would also preclude the author- ities from undertaking the expenditures needed for strengthening infrastruc- ture and social spending as well as rehabilitating the banking system. Early actions are required for improving tax administration and broadening the tax base, including in particular the scaling back of preferential tax policies. The staff recommends that the revenue effort should be strengthened in the forthcoming budget, with a view to raising the tax ratio by 1/2-l percent of GDP in 1996. These actions would constitute an important first step toward achieving the authorities' medium-term objective of eliminating the state budget deficit, while meeting prospective expenditure demands. China's strong external position provides an excellent opportunity for substantially accelerating trade and payments liberalization. As regards the trade system, which remains relatively restrictive by international standards, the authorities' plans outlined at Osaka last year to implement a comprehensive program of liberalization are encouraging. In finalizing the package, the authorities should push ahead in a number of important areas: cutting the maximum and average tariff rates on final goods; substantially reducing the number of import categories subject to quotas and licenses; and significantly liberalizing foreign trading rights. With practice running ahead of regulation in many areas, China is already close to achieving current account convertibility. The staff welcomes the authorities' ongoing review of the existing foreign exchange laws and regulations, aimed at bringing them into line with practice and removing the few remaining restrictive features. The early acceptance by China of the obligations of Article VIII will further strengthen domestic and international confidence in the reform effort. In view of the continuing--albeit moderating--strength of the external position, the authorities should allow more upward flexibility in the exchange rate, particularly if the current account surplus remains large or capital inflows increase sharply. Upward pressure on the exchange rate would, however, be alleviated by an early and substantial trade reform which, in any case, should have high priority. The priority accorded by the authorities to addressing the deeply entrenched problems of the SOE sector is appropriate. While the initial progress on various experimental initiatives, including the increasing scope for diverse forms of ownership, is encouraging, substantial results are not yet at hand. This is to be expected, as SOE reform requires the resolution of complex issues, such as labor redundancy, social services, and restructuring of SOE debt. Progress in these areas, while taking time, would be aided by an acceleration of efforts under way to establish a social safety net as well as to promote labor mobility while providing alternative Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 31 - job opportunities in the nonstate sector. Nevertheless, it is crucial to ensure that continuing weaknesses in the SOE sector do not jeopardize the recent hard-won gains in macroeconomic stability or impede further progress toward financial sector liberalization. To this end, the authorities should build on the nascent efforts to reduce subsidized credit and other financial support to SOEs, especially for the weaker enterprises; and subject them to more market-oriented wage policies and increased competition. While remaining intertwined with progress in SOE reform, financial sector reform should seek to strengthen the soundness and efficiency of the banking system. The recent initiatives toward commercializing the specialized banks are welcome. However, it will be important to press ahead with the next phase of the envisaged reform process with early actions to address the problem of nonperforming loans and further relieve these banks of the obligation of policy lending. While the authorities intend to permit greater flexibility in selected short-term interest rates in 1996, it will also be necessary to simplify the complex rate structure and ensure that rates are adequate in real terms--the latter with a view partly to improving bank profitability. At the same time, the financial sector's increasing market-orientation underscores the need for.enhanced prudential supervision. The heightened deficiencies in China's economic statistics are seriously complicating economic policy making and hampering effective surveillance. The authorities should aim for improved coordination among the main statistical agencies, which should assist in efforts to achieve a more focused approach to technical assistance in statistics, including the program of the Fund, in order to achieve early resolution of data problems. Improvements in the quality of data should be accompanied by their wider dissemination and publication. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Under the new exchange system, domestic enterprises are required to sell their foreign exchange to designated banks and can freely purchase foreign exchange from banks for most trade and trade-related transactions with the necessary import documentation. Foreign-funded enterprises, however, are subject to a different exchange regime based on the concept of the foreign exchange balancing requirement. Exchange control continues to apply to nontrade-related services and to capital transactions.

The Executive Board discussed the staff report for the 1994 Article IV consultation (SM/95/41 at EBM/95/27) on March 22, 1995. The following decision was adopted: 1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with the People's Republic of China, in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with the People's Republic of China conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977 as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The People's Republic of China continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, as described in SM/95/41, except for the multiple currency practice arising from the conversion of unused foreign exchange certificates, which is subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3. In view of the authorities' intention to eliminate this multiple currency practice by end-June 1995, the Fund grants approval for its retention until June 30, 1995. The Fund welcomes the continued liberalization of the exchange system and urges the People's Republic of China to remove the remaining restrictions under Article XIV. IX. Technical Assistance Technical assistance provided through December 1995, and projected for 1996, is summarized in Table 1.

Following a period of slowdown caused by the events of the summer of 1989, lending increased rapidly during the early 1990s. Combined IBRD/Lending in FY 1995 was just under $3 billion, a level first reached in FY 1993. The Bank projects aggregate lending to continue at comparable levels. Since FY 1992, China has been the Bank's largest borrower in terms of new commitments, followed by Mexico ($2.39 billion), India ($2.06), Russia ($1.74 billion), and Argentina ($1.43 billion). The Bank has made five loans to China in the first half of the current fiscal year, totalling $940 million. The Bank's overall assistance objective in China is to promote broadbased economic development and reduce poverty in an environmentally sustainable way. The Bank's assistance strategy is to support China in achieving macroeconomic stability, while maintaining rapid and more efficient growth, and in shifting resources toward priority areas--such as poverty reduction, human resource development, infrastructure, and environmental protection-- that are presently underfunded. The assistance strategy comprises four areas of focus: (i) implementation of macroeconomic and structural reforms; (ii) easing of infrastructure constraints; (iii) reduction of poverty; and (iv) safeguarding the environment. Support in these areas is provided through a mix of economic and sector work, lending operations, and technical assistance. Details on the sectoral breakdown of lending can be found in Table 2. Since 1990, the Bank has carried out studies in collaboration with Chinese counterparts in the fields of urban employment, the social security system, financial policies and institutional development, capital markets development, public investment and finance, national accounts assessments,V price reform, housing reform, grain policy, and provincial development strategies as well as budgetary and fiscal issues and trade-.policies. Four country economic memoranda (CFNs) have been completed. One focused on China's transition from a planned to a market economy. The second, looks into major issues and options faced by China in its economic and reform programs in this decade. The third, provides an update of major recent developments in the Chinese economy and focuses on managing rapid growth during transition. The fourth and most recent analyzes the implications of decentralization for improving macroeconomic stability and evaluates the government's reform program for improving the management of macroeconomic policies. An updating economic memorandum is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of CY 1996. Representation: The People's Republic of China assumed China's representation in the World Bank on May 15, 1980.

Technical Assistance: A technical assistance loan ($60.0 million) to the People's Bank of China to enhance the Central Bank's supervision, research, and clearing capabilities was approved in 1993. A second technical assistance project ($50.0 million), approved in the same year, is financing reform supportive studies and economic research, the strengthening of core agencies responsible for macroeconomic management and local training institutions. Technical assistance for economic law reform went to the Board in FY 1995. Fiscal technical assistance, also approved last fiscal year, supports the implementation of recent fiscal reforms by developing and establishing a new National Tax Administration, and by developing an intergovernmental grants scheme and improved budgetary practices. Resident Mission: A resident IBRD office in Beijing was opened in October 1985. International Finance Corporation (IFC): IFC commitments held as of June 30, 1995 total about $93.6 million in loans and $55.5 million in equity, of which $79.9 million of the loans and $21.2 million of the equity are disbursed. This does not include $30.5 million in loan commitments held for participants, of which $25.0 million is disbursed. IFC opened up a new office in Beijing in 1992. The focus of IFC's activities in China is on pioneering transactions and demonstration projects focused on four core objectives: (i) developing limited recourse financing; (ii) augmenting the quality and number of investments; (iii) assisting in restructuring SOEs; and (iv) promoting the development of capital markets and the financial sector.

Accordingly, the AsDB has given significant attention to reinforcing market-oriented reforms, developing efficient financial markets, restructuring the industrial sector and improving agricultural productivity. By increasingly focusing the operational program on inland provinces and rural areas where the poor are concentrated, the AsDB is also addressing the Government's objective to eradicate poverty by the year 2000 and bring about a more balanced pattern of development. Environmental projects aim at pollution control and human resource development in environmental management, while natural resource conservation projects aim at soil and industrial energy conservation. Since China became a member of the AsDB in 1986, 49 project loans totaling $5,252.4 million (see Tables 1 and 2) have been approved as of December 31, 1995. In addition, the AsDB has approved one line of equity for $3 million, two equity investments totaling $14.3 million, one loan of $50 million to the private sector without government guarantee, and 212 technical assistance projects amounting $90.535 million. The 1996 lending program is estimated at $1.1 billion for 11 projects. Loan projects include: North China Marine Culture and Coastal Resources Management ($70 million); Guizhou Hongjiadou Hydropower ($200 million); Anhui Fuyang Power Station (engineering loan; $2 million); Anhui Environmental Improvement - Industry ($70 million); Industry Energy Conservation II ($180 million); Second China Investment Bank ($100 million); Fancheng Port ($52 million); Chongqing Expressway ($150 million); Daxian- Wanxian Railway ($100 million); Jianxi Highway ($150 million); and Anhui Environmental Improvement - Water ($30 million). In addition, proposed technical assistance program for 1996 includes 41 projects totaling $16.7 million. The technical assistance program is aimed at assisting the Government prepare projects for possible AsDB financing; undertaking policy studies in support of the reform program; and strengthening the capacities of selected government institutions involved in policy analysis and implementation as well as the executing agencies of AsDB-financed projects. Overall, China has demonstrated a strong capacity in the implementation of AsDB-financed projects. Generally, loans are declared effective on time and most projects are completed within the planned period. Loan disburse- ment and contract award performance is good. Of the 49 loan projects approved up to December 31, 1995, 10 are fully disbursed and closed, 1 loan was allowed to lapse, 28 remain effective, while 10 loans have yet to be made effective. The AsDB's proposed operational program in the next few years will continue to address the critical issues associated with rapid economic growth, such as transport bottlenecks and energy shortages, growing income L/ Prepared by the staff of the Asian Development Bank.

Increased attention will be given to the less developed inland provinces that are expected to receive at least 50 percent of AsDB assistance. The lending program will continue to be supported by a TA program aimed at assisting the Government in carrying out policy reforms as well as in formulating quality projects. The AsDB will also provide support to the Government in carrying out policy reforms as well as in formulating quality projects. The AsDB will also provide support to the Government in seeking alternative financing such as private sector participation through build-operate-own projects and additional sources of financing in the international financial markets such as cofinancing with commercial banks. The AsDB will continue to exchange views with the Government concerning the country's ongoing reforms. Such policy discussions, to be facilitated through the provisions of advisory technical assistance and the AsDB's own economic and sector work, will focus on financial, fiscal, and enterprise reforms and sector level reforms which implement the AsDB's lending program. Institutional development will also continue to be a key feature of the AsDB's operations in China.

While the authorities continued to take steps to improve these statistics, lJ the weaknesses in the macroeconomic indicators increased, in part because of the difficulty of the statistical systems to keep pace with the rapidly changing and increasingly complex structure of the economy. The most severe weaknesses were: the very large "errors and omissions" in the balance of payments, the sharp increase in "other items, net" in the monetary accounts, and the inconsistencies in key indicators of economic activity, output, retail sales, and investment. 2J Although in most instances the data limitations confronting the staff and discussed in this Annex are also limitations for officials, there are cases in which more complete, timely, and diverse data are available to officials for internal use, especially for the budget and banking sector. The Fund and other international and bilateral institutions have provided extensive technical assistance to China in the main areas of statistics, mainly as training courses on concepts and methodology. This work has supported Chinese programs for improving statistics which have sought to adapt to the very rapid changes in the economy since 1992. However, despite some expected improvements, the problems with data quality and the limited number of indicators available J/ are likely to continue to hamper economic analysis the next year or two. The main data weaknesses are discussed below, by sector: a. Real sector The demand components of GDP, in line with the SNA, were published for the first time in 1995 but this highlighted inconsistencies in the main indicators of expenditure, production, and incomes. 4J The incomplete coverage of the new and rapidly growing nonstate sectors and errors in reporting by lower level units e.g., in investment, output, and prices, have contributed. Although some corrections are being made to address these problems, mainly from separate inspection visits, the problems persist. IJ These included: a gradual implementation of the UN System of National Accounts (SNA); the broadening of the institutional coverage of monetary data; and the design of a new balance of payments statistical system (discussed further in text). 2J In addition, the statistical discrepancy in the national accounts increased sharply in 1994, the latest year available. 3J For example, on budget implementation, enterprise finances, and inventories. 4J In 1994 the demand components of GDP grew much more rapidly than output leading to a sharp increase in the statistical discrepancy. In 1995 increases in retail sales and savings deposits significantly outpaced personal incomes.

The lack of reporting of the detailed components of these two price indicators, the weights used, and alternative price indices, prevents adequate analysis. A wholesale price index is complied by the PBC but for its internal use only. There is only a limited range of published data on monthly real sector indicators. b. Government finance The availability of fiscal data is limited, mainly by weaknesses in fiscal management systems. Only limited data on extrabudgetary revenue and expenditure are available, despite being of the same order of magnitude as the budget aggregates. Further, the limited reporting of component data gathered by local government level units to central government units makes it difficult to diagnose problems except by direct inspection visits. The decentralized nature of the budget process results in the Ministry of Finance only having details of expenditures by spending unit classification and not by economic classification (e.g., salaries, etc.). The current publicly available data to analyze budget developments is very limited. Monthly details of revenue and expenditure are released with a delay of eight months. The annual budget speech contains data on the main budget aggregates in the text but there are no tables either on the budget projections or on the detailed annual final revenue and expenditure data. The latter are available to the public only somewhat later in the year, in the China Statistical Yearbook and the Ministry of Finance Yearbook. The Fund, for surveillance purposes, receives more detailed annual data and part year data for the Article IV Consultation and has requested monthly data on the levels of revenue and expenditure and financing. Current annual data on some key expenditure items, extrabudgetary funds, and social funds are not available. The GFS system has been chosen as the statistical framework for the reform of the fiscal management system that would eventually produce more complete data. Technical assistance from STA and FAD to support this objective has mainly been in the form of training through seminars in China and at headquarters. The Chinese authorities have indicated their intention to hold in China in June 1996 another seminar for officials of local governments at which STA is expected to provide training assistance. Data for the budgetary central government have been provided for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook for 1990-93. Regarding data in IFS, annual data on total revenue, expenditure, and the corresponding deficit/surplus from the Chinese state budget are published through 1994.

Monetary statistics Discrepancies in the monetary accounts mainly reflect limitations in the quality of accounting information. A continuing program to improve monetary data has been under way in the past two years, including expanding the institutional coverage and publishing monetary aggregates. However the discrepancy (other items, net) in the accounts of both the PBC and the deposit money banks has increased significantly. In both cases a significant part is believed to reflect unauthorized credit issued because of systemic weaknesses in banking operations and supervision. The incomplete reporting of foreign currency items has created difficulties in analyzing the links with the balance of payments. Data on gross foreign assets and liabilities of deposit money banks were recently provided to Fund staff but these data appeared to be inconsistent with the balance of payments and anecdotal understandings of bank behavior. Expected improvements in 1996 will mainly relate to coverage and include the full consolidation of foreign currency assets and liabilities of residents, and better enforcement of reporting standards. Longer-term improvements are linked to the reform of the accounting systems of banks. Fund technical assistance was previously focused on training but in 1996 assistance has also been requested for the consolidation of foreign-currency-denominated accounts. The PBC is improving the range of publicly available financial data. Official monetary aggregates for China have been published quarterly since early 1995 and information on assets and liabilities of financial institutions is also published quarterly. In mid-1996 it is expected that the PBC will publish a quarterly statistical bulletin. Subsequently, it is expected that monthly data should be available. d. Balance of payments The compilation of balance of payments statistics in China has become particularly problematic because of external sector liberalization, increases in fraudulent activities, and the internationalization of some Chinese entities. These developments have weakened existing data collection carried out by different administrative agencies that are not responsible for data accuracy or consistency with the Fund's Balance of Payments Manual. Thus, many new classes of transactions, especially Chinese direct investment abroad and resident holdings of foreign assets, are unrecorded. These and other problems are highlighted by the very large errors and omissions estimated for 1995; such problems were also important in previous years. In recognition of the statistical and administrative problems, a number of measures will be initiated in 1996. Customs administration will be strengthened to improve the capacity to reduce fraud on trade transactions. A new balance of payments statistical system, based mainly on bank reports, was launched in January 1996 and surveys of foreign investment will follow shortly, but full implementation will take longer. Technical assistance for the latter two projects is being provided by the Fund.

More frequent balance of payments data are likely to become available from the new statistical system- -semiannual data should be available in 1996 and subsequently quarterly data. External debt data are published annually but data are collected half-yearly. foreign direct investment, Data for only trade, and state reserves are available monthly. 2. Data reporting to STA for IFS There have been severe problems with reporting of data, particularly regarding real sector statistics, to STA for IFS. No report forms have been received since July 1995. The most recent price information reported for IFS is the 12-month change in the CPI ending in March 1995. Monthly international trade statistics are reported to STA for IFS only sporadically. Data on exports and imports have only been reported through April 1995. In addition, for several years. several of the series listed have not been updated Improved data reporting to STA for IFS, however, is expected to commence in 1996, and, from late 1996, it is expected to include, monthly, rather than quarterly, monetary data. The reporting forms for the monetary data are currently being revised to include more detailed data and for compatibility with revisions in the presentation of the China page in IFS. 3. Data dissemination to the public Access to data by the public is well short of international standards. Although the main real sector and monetary indicators are widely reported in the press, the monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series nor the disaggregations needed for analysis. Many time series are not made public in a systematic and timely manner. The proposed publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin of the PBC (expected by mid-1996) will help address this problem for monetary statistics. Extensive annual economic data are available in various statistical yearbooks, published nine months or more after the end of the year. In many cases, nongovernment users of data prepared by the State Statistical Bureau have to pay high fees.
