KITTS AND NEVIS Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2003 Consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis Approved by Adrienne Cheasty and Matthew Fisher October 10, 2003 Discussions: A mission comprising S. Rizavi (head), P. Kufa, P. Njoroge, and D. Velculescu visited St. Kitts and Nevis during June 3-13,2003. It was assisted by stalf from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Caribbean Development Bank, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Lewis-Bynoe (both OED) participated in the final round of discussions. The mission met with Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Condor), Premier of Nevis (Mr. Amory), Deputy Governor of the ECCB (Mr. Allen), other senior government officials, representatives of the private sector, labor unions, and the political opposition. Exchange arrangement: St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (EXXU). The common currency of the ECCU, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. St. Kitts and Nevis has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Key facts: St. Kitts and Nevis forms a twin-island federation in the eastern Caribbean, with a land area of 269 square kilometers, a population of 45,900, and an average income of US$7,500 per capita. The economy is based on tourism and other services, sugar, and light manufacturing. Nevis, the smaller of the two islands, has an area of 93 square kilometers, and a population of about 10,000. Political context: Reflecting periodic strains in the relationship between the two islands, the ruling party in Nevis, the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM), has recently restarted a move to secede from the federation. At the federal level, Prime Minister Douglas’ Labor Party has been in office since 1995, and won all the seats in parliament in the March 2000 elections. The next elections are due in 2005. Previous Article IV Consultation: At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on June 7, 2002, Executive Directors expressed concern about the deterioration in the fiscal and debt situation. They saw this as stemming not only from hurricane-related construction outlays in the past few years, but also from rapid growth in other expenditures, a steady erosion of the tax base, and persistent losses in the sugar industry. Directors recommended measures to halt the rapid build-up in debt by curtailing spending, strengthening the revenue effort, and durable reform of the sugar industry.

Real GDP grew by 0.8 percent in 2002, owing to a larger sugar crop and expansion in retail trade. For 2003, real GDP is projected to increase by about 1.2 percent, as tourism partially recovers and three fairly large housing projects are initiated. The fiscal deficit and public debt have reached unsustainable levels. In 2002, the overall fiscal deficit rose by 4 percentage points to 16 percent of GDP, and public debt rose by around 18 percentage points, to nearly 160 percent of GDP. The 2003 budget envisages a major adjustment, 8 percent of GDP, mainly through reductions in capital expenditure and net lending. The government has been able to maintain access to financing at reasonable terms and has remained current on all its financial obligations. Little progress has been made on key structural reforms. In particular, there is no clear resolution regarding the sugar company, which runs losses of 3-4 percent of GDP annually, reflecting a concern for job losses in a slow-growth environment. Policy discussions The discussions centered on debt sustainability, seen as an important pre-condition for enhancing growth prospects. The authorities agreed with the mission about the gravity of the fiscal and debt situation, and said they would consider the adjustment measures proposed by the mission. Though the authorities did not see any immediate risk of a funding crisis, given their continued access to financing, impeccable payment record, and the fiscal effort underway, they also envisage undertaking a major privatization program, the proceeds of which could be used to reduce the public debt,, potentially to about 70 percent of GDP by 2008, implying considerable progress toward debt sustainability. The staff views fiscal consolidation to be critical for avoiding funding difficulties. While welcoming the authorities’ emphasis on privatization, on structural grounds as well as for its contribution to debt reduction, staff noted the downside risks of such a large privatization effort, given institutional weaknesses and implementation difficulties. The authorities stated that the monetary and exchange arrangements of the ECCU had continued to serve St. Kitts and Nevis well. While agreeing, the mission noted the loss in competitiveness and recommended that this be addressed by supplementing fiscal consolidation efforts with productivity-enhancing structural reforms. The authorities expressed willingness to participate in the forthcoming regional FSAP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- I. INTRODUCTION 1. The 2003 consultation took place against a backdrop of slow growth, a large fiscal deficit, and rising public debt. During the early- to mid-1990s, the economy of St. Kitts and Nevis was able to record real GDP growth of about of 5% percent annually, higher than the average for member countries of the East Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). Growth was interrupted in 1998 by Hurricane Georges, followed by Hurricanes Lenny and Jose in 1999. Post-hurricane reconstruction led to a temporary resumption of growth in 2000 and before September 11,200 1, but contributed to widening the fiscal deficit despite already high public indebtedness. Fiscal and debt problems have been exacerbated by large and persistent losses of the government sugar company. Hence the discussions focused on the need to reduce the fiscal deficit and bring public debt to a sustainable level, and to accelerate structural reforms to strengthen growth prospects. 2. The political situation is overshadowed by renewed debate about the secession of Nevis. In 2002, the ruling party in Nevis, the Concerned Citizens Movement, expressed the desire to hold a referendum on seceding from the federation. In response, a parliamentary select committee for constitutional affairs was formed at the federal level, which submitted a report to parliament in May. Contents of this report have not yet been made public. A similar referendum was held in 1998 but failed by a small margin to achieve the required two-thirds majority. At the federal level, the Labor Party government of Prime Minister Douglas controls all eight seats. The next general elections are due in 2005. 3. There has been some improvement in the quality of the statistical database. However, weaknesses in the national accounts, the finances of the state enterprises, and the balance of payments hampers effective surveillance. II. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDPROSPECTSFOR 2003/04 4. Growth slowed in 2002 and is expected to remain weak this year. Real GDP growth in 2002 decelerated to 0.8 percent (from 2.3 percent in 2001), owing to significant declines in tourism, manufacturing, and construction, which were only partly offset by a strong sugar crop and an expansion in the retail trade and transportation sector (Table 1). 5. Given the small size of the domestic market, the economy’s growth potential largely depends on external demand and on its capacity to attract foreign direct investment. In the recent past the main hindrances to growth have been the global slowdown, the adverse impact on tourism of the September 11 attacks, and the uncertainty Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- created by events leading up to the war in Iraq. Indications are that the unemployment rate stood at about 10 percent in 2002, compared with 6 percent in 200 1.’ 6. Based on preliminary data for the lirst quarter of 2003, activity is projected to pick up slightly in 2003. The main drivers for expected GDP growth of 1.2 percent are a partial recovery in tourism-due to a large new resort opening, completion of the scenic railway, and increased airlifts to both St. Kitts and Nevis-and somewhat greater construction activity in housing. 7. Inflation has remained low (less than 2 percent in 2002) reflecting the openness of the economy and the peg of the Eastern Caribbean (E.C.) dollar to the U.S. dollar. The real effective exchange rate (REER) of the E.C. dollar, as measured for St. Kitts and Nevis, depreciated by about 4 percent in 2002 and a further 6.5 percent up to June 2003, largely reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Despite this, the REER remains very appreciated compared with its level in the early 1990s (Figures 1 and 2). 120 115 110 Figure 1.

The public sector imbalance has worsened and public debt has risen to an unsustainable level.2 The overall fiscal deficit including grants rose to 16 percent of GDP ’ This estimate is based on discussions with the authorities and tourism industry representatives. No firm data for unemployment are available for 2003. 2 The overall fiscal deficit is a consolidation of the St. Kitts central government budget with the budget of the Nevis Island Administration. For additional information on fiscal relations between the two islands, see the Statistical Appendix to the Staff Report.

Revenue effort improved but did not keep pace with expenditure growth, and the primary deficit rose to around 9 percent of GDP. 9. To meet its financing needs, the government borrowed from regional commercial banks and issued paper in the Regional Government Securities Market (RGLWQ3 This allowed it to remain current on all obligations to domestic and external creditors and suppliers. Public debt rose by around 18 percentage points in 2002, to nearly 160 percent of GDP (Table 4), reflecting the deficits of the St. Kilts central government and the Nevis Island Administration, the losses of the sugar company (34 percent of GDP annually) and of other public enterprises (Box 1). 10. The 2003 budget envisages sizeable fiscal adjustment through expenditure cuts and revenue-enhancing measures. The overall deficit is targeted to decline by nearly 8 percentage points, to 8.3 percent of GDP. Most of this reduction would be due to cessation of lending to Port Zante (as its expansion has been completed) and limitation of the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) to projects with identified external financing. Current expenditure is envisaged to remain broadly unchanged in relation to GDP. ;.;I To enhance revenues, a number of measures have been taken. These include: 1 increasing the wheel tax by 25 percent;4 (ii) raising the custom service charge by 1 percentage point (to 6 percent);5 (iii) increasing the consumption tax on imports by 2.5 percentage points (to 22.5 percent); (iv) tightening the rules governing duty free shops; (v) converting the tax on tobacco and alcohol to an ad valorem tax of 25 percent; and (vi) raising prices charged by the government quarry. 12. The preliminary fiscal outturn for January-June 2003 was somewhat better than targeted. Revenues were slightly higher than projected mainly reflecting higher land taxes, while expenditures, notably wages, were lower. 13. Interest rates have declined modestly, reflecting regional trends. The ECCB, which had previously reduced its discount rate (from 8 to 7 percent, in October 2001), lowered the minimum mandatory rate on savings deposits from 4 to 3 percent in September 2002. These measures, combined with weak credit demand, led to a decline in lending and deposit rates (by 70 and 40 basis points, respectively) since October 2001. 3 The RGSM began operations in November 2002 to facilitate the primary issuance and secondary trading of ECCU members’ government securities. 4 An annual weight-based charge on all vehicles, ranging from EC$325 to EC$l,lOO, with an additional EC$2,500 on vehicles over 5 tons. 5 The authorities explained that this is grandfathered under WTO rules.

This rigidity appears to be linked to the underlying term-structure of the bank’s loan portfolios, oligopolistic nature of the banking structure, high operating costs of providing banking services in a small economy, lengthy litigation procedures, and weak laws governing loan recoveries, factors evidenced in other countries of the region as well. Box 1: St. Kitts and Nevis: Main Features of Public Sector Debt l The public debt stock of St. Kitts and Nevis has increased considerably over the last five years, from a nominal level of US$290 million, equivalent to about 100 percent of GDP in 1998, to approximately US$560 million, or 157 percent of GDP at end-2002. The main reasons for the rapid rise in debt include: substantial borrowings to rehabilitate the infrastructure destroyed and damaged by hurricanes in 1998 and 1999, a large public investment program, loss of eligibility to borrow on concessional terms from the multilaterals raising the NPV of debt, and losses of the sugar company of 34 percent of GDP per year. Most of the debt is contracted on fixed interest rates. l As of end-2002, total domestic debt was US$303 million, or equivalent to 85 percent of GDP. Of the total, debt of the federal government was 59 percent of total, Nevis Island Administration 6 percent, and the public enterprises (mainly sugar company) 35 percent. Traditionally, loans and advances (overdraft) from the commercial banks were the main means of domestic financing, however, in recent years Treasury bills have become a significant source. Borrowing from the ECCB is very limited reflecting its policy of adhering to the strict lending limits prescribed in the ECCB Act. l The external debt as of end-2002 was US$257.5 million, 70 percent of GDP. In terms of creditor composition, nearly 32 percent of external debt was owed to multilaterals and 16 percent to official bilaterals, and the rest to commercial creditors. In terms of the debtor composition, almost 70 percent of the external debt was owed by the central government, including both guaranteed and non-guaranteed borrowings of the Nevis Island Administration, and the remaining 30 percent was owed by the public enterprises. l Reflecting the rapid rise in the debt stock, the debt service burden has also sharply increased. The ratio of external debt service to exports of goods and services over the past five years increased from 7 percent to 19 percent, while the ratio of domestic interest payments to revenue rose from 13 to 22 percent over the same period putting pressure on the country’s payment capacity. 15. Relatively high deposit rates were associated with some growth in broad money (6.4 percent in 2002, and a marginal decrease up to July 2003). This was weaker than in the rest of the ECCU, where broad money grew by slightly over 6 percent. Money growth was reflected on the asset side mainly through increases in credit to public enterprises and in foreign assets (Table 5). Credit to the private sector declined by 2 percent in 2002, in line with the region. For 2003, credit to the private sector is projected to grow in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- line with nominal GDP, accommodating growth without inflationary pressures. A higher share of foreign assets in bank portfolios is expected to depress banks’ profits given the currently low margins abroad. 16. The banking system soundness indicators have slightly weakened. The ratio of nonperforming to total loans increased by about 1 percentage point to 123/4 percent in 2002, partly due to weak activity. The largest commercial bank, which is majority-owned by the government, continued to have high exposure to the public sector, including to the loss- making sugar company. There has been an increase in the activities of the nonbank financial institutions partly reflecting regulatory arbitrage-such as to differences in lower reserve requirements-as these institutions are not supervised by the ECCB. 17. Considerable progress has been made in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the offshore financial sector. St. Kitts and Nevis was removed in 2002 from the list of jurisdictions that meet the OECD’s tax haven criteria and from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) list of non-cooperative countries and territories. A self-assessment of the regulatory regime for the offshore financial sector (Module 1) has been completed and AML/CFT legislation has been strengthened-inter alia by providing for exchange of information with other jurisdictions, increasing penalties for money laundering, and establishing a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to investigate suspicious financial activity. The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force commenced a mutual evaluation of St. Kitts and Nevis in parallel with the ECCU-wide FSAP. 18. The external current account deficit widened to 33% percent of GDP in 2002. This was largely due to low tourist receipts and high imports for private sector projects in the tourism sector (Table 6). Tourist arrivals fell by 28% percent, with the number of stay- over (as opposed to cruise-ship) tourists-the mainstay of the tourist industry-falling by 10 percent after September 11,2001, and declining further in the run up to the war in Iraq. The current account deficit was fully financed by official capital inflows and foreign direct investment. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt rose by 9 percentage points in 2002, to 70% percent of GDP. For 2003, the current account deficit is projected to narrow to around 20 percent of GDP, as imports decline upon the completion of large tourism projects financed by FDI. 19. Progress with structural reform has been slow. No concrete steps have yet been taken to address the problem of the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Corporation (SSMC), though its losses (3-4 percent of GDP per year) have long been a heavy drain on the budget. The authorities have received considerable external advice, including from the World Bank, on the modalities and implications of closing the company. The government’s hesitation reflects concerns about unemployment and political ramifications since the sugar company employs nearly 1,000 workers (about 7 percent of the labor force). Other areas in need of reform include the tax administration, the Social Security Board (SSB), and public enterprises.

The discussions focused on a strategy to restore debt sustainability by improving fiscal performance and promoting growth, issues on which the 2002 discussions were also centered. The authorities’ past response to key policy challenges highlighted in the Fund’s advise has been mixed, reflecting both weak implementation capacity and concerns about unemployment. Some progress was made in reducing the fiscal deficit and strengthening the legal framework for the offshore financial centers. On the other hand, the public debt further increased and the issue of the loss-making sugar company remained unresolved. 21. The authorities were keenly aware that the fiscal and debt situation is very difficult. They agreed with the mission on the need for strong fiscal measures, although they preferred a somewhat more gradual approach to expenditure cuts than that recommended by the mission, to support the weak recovery and mitigate the unemployment impact of the contraction in tourism. The mission stressed the importance of fiscal adjustment in the near-term, to preclude any funding difficulties. Moreover, the mission’s adjustment scenario indicated that, even with additional fiscal measures proposed by the staff, the public debt ratio would remain very high over the medium term, constituting a serious vulnerability. The authorities recognized this, but saw scope for substantially reducing the debt stock through large-scale privatization. 22. The authorities are optimistic about growth prospects, given the completion of a number of major tourism projects, and a somewhat improved external environment. The main growth driver in the medium run is expected to be the service sector. In particular, tourism, transportation and real estate are expected to grow strongly over the next five years, more than offsetting a decline in sugar production and manufacturing, as the sugar industry is phased out. The main risks come from the fragile fiscal and debt situation, delays in structural reform, and shocks such as hurricanes. A. Fiscal Policy 23. The 2003 budget envisages a major deficit reduction. On current policies, the overall deficit (including grants) is projected to decline by nearly 8 percentage points to 8.3 percent of GDP by end-2003. This would achieve an important narrowing of the primary deficit from 9 percent of GDP in 2002 to about 1% percent in 2003. 24. While welcoming the deficit-reducing measures, the mission expressed concern that debt is projected to rise further to 161 percent of GDP in 2003. To contain this trend and strengthen prospects for sustainability, the mission proposed a comprehensive set of near- and medium-term measures. 25. For 2003, the mission proposed additional expenditure cuts of almost 2 percent of GDP. These could be generated by limiting capital outlays to ongoing projects, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - curtailing net lending and transfers to public enterprises to less than 1% percent of GDP, and strengthening procurement controls. 26. The mission recommended that the 2004 overall deficit be reduced to around 4 percent of GDP, mainly by persevering with and broadening the measures initiated in 2003. Specifically, capital spending should be limited to projects with assured external financing; the wage bill and transfers to public enterprises should be reduced in real terms, and spending on goods and services should not grow faster than nominal GDP. Wage savings could be achieved by withholding the end-year double salary, and reducing the number of government employees by not replacing retirees in non-essential jobs. To enhance revenue, the mission proposed revising property valuations, increasing electricity charges, and reducing discretionary duty and tax exemptions. 27. As regards the medium term, the mission recommended narrowing the central government deficit to near balance by 2008. Total expenditures should be reduced to about 33 percent of GDP, and the revenue to GDP ratio maintained at the current level of about 33 percent of GDP. Revenue should be strengthened by implementing recent FAD recommendations-including introducing a VAT-type tax. Improvements in expenditure control should be achieved by policies based on the recommendations of the recent World Bank public expenditure review and report on procurement policies. 28. The authorities promised to review the mission’s proposals and closely monitor fiscal developments, but viewed St. Kitts and Nevis as creditworthy. The authorities agreed with the mission that at the current debt ratio the economy was very vulnerable to any adverse external shocks, such as hurricanes. However, given their continued access to financing, impeccable payment record, and marketable public assets, they did not see a significant risk of an immediate external or domestic funding crisis. The mission stressed that continued access to financing would significantly depend on the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts. To address the fiscal situation, the authorities have instituted quarterly reporting to the cabinet and created a new coordinating post for fiscal monitoring. They have also taken decisions and steps to strengthen the fiscal situation: (i) issuance of a five-year note to replace the existing stock of treasury bills, with a view to lengthening domestic debt maturity and reducing debt service; (ii) pursuit of important tax arrears cases; and (iii) payroll monitoring, especially for non-permanent workers, by creating a central employment database, which will give the treasury full control over all payments to non- permanent workers, as well as salaries of new appointees in ministries. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 29. The mission expressed concern that large fiscal deficits and high debt in St. Kitts and Nevis (and other ECCU countries) could undermine the viability of the currency board. The authorities acknowledged that unsustainable deficits and debts entailed risks for the currency union, but pointed to the ECCB’s strong balance sheet and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- strict statutory rules preventing the monetization of fiscal deficits.6 In any event, the authorities were actively engaged in an ECCU-wide effort to develop adjustment programs with technical assistance from the CARTAC. 30. The authorities reaffirmed their support for maintaining the fixed exchange rate regime operated by the ECCB, with the E.C. dollar pegged to the U.S. dollar. The staff shares the authorities’ view that participation in the currency board has delivered, over several decades, low inflation and a degree of investor confidence that very small, open, and vulnerable economies like St. Kitts and Nevis could not achieve under other institutional arrangements. However, the staff stressed that fiscal consolidation was necessary to underpin the viability of the monetary arrangement. 31. The authorities agreed that growth prospects were likely to be negatively affected by the effective appreciation of the E.C. dollar and the accompanying loss of competitiveness, despite its recent partial reversal. However, this was in their view more than compensated by the benefits of nominal exchange rate stability, and should be addressed by domestic structural reforms aimed at raising productivity. The authorities noted that St. Kitts and Nevis has broadly maintained its competitive position vis-a-vis other countries in the region, partly evidenced by continued FDI inflows. The authorities stated that the magnitude of the loss of competitiveness suggested by indicators such as appreciation of the real effective exchange rate needs to be interpreted cautiously as it is based on a CPI basket which consists largely of imported goods and excludes most exportables.7 C. Banking Sector Issues 32. The authorities view the banking system as generally sound and well supervised. They felt that the marginal increase in nonperforming loans in 2002 was largely the result of slow growth and did not pose any systemic risk to the financial system. They noted that commercial banks were in compliance with statutory and prudential requirements, as verified by close central bank supervision (including by on-site inspection of the offshore bank). 33. The government-owned National Bank remains, however, a source of concern. While it meets prudential ratios, its assets are heavily concentrated in public sector loans, including to the sugar company. The mission noted that this constituted an important vulnerability, given the high public debt ratio and strict limits on the ECCB’s ability to support member governments or regional banks in an emergency. The mission thus reiterated the desirability of further government divestment from the bank to broaden its 6 The ECCB’s external assets cover nearly 98 percent of its demand liabilities. 7 For additional discussion of competitiveness indicators, see Statistical Appendix to the Staff Report.

The authorities, however, have no immediate plans for issuing additional shares to the public. 34. The staff commended the authorities on their progress in strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for the offshore financial center (OFC). This achieved the removal of St. Kitts and Nevis from the OECD’s list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions and from the FATF’s list of jurisdictions with weak anti-money laundering frameworks. The authorities noted that the FIU was frequently receiving requests for tax- related information (mainly from developed country jurisdictions), which put pressure on its limited resources. The mission pointed out that, despite such additional resource demands, the strengthened regulations have benefited the OFC, as evidenced by higher revenues from the sector. D. External Sector Policies 35. The authorities viewed the widening of the current account deficit in 2002 as temporary, expecting the deficit to narrow as tourism picks up. As in other ECCU countries, St. Kitts and Nevis’ current account deficit has recorded wide fluctuations over the years, reflecting the large import content of investment. The mission shared the authorities’ view that-with an increase in tourism earnings combined with an expected reduction in imports following completion of large tourism projects-the current account deficit would narrow to around 20 percent of GDP in 2003 and strengthen further over the medium term. The current account deficit is projected to be financed by tourism-related foreign direct investment, official grants, and government borrowing on appropriate terms. 36. St. Kitts and Nevis has maintained a moderate external trade regime, with a customs service charge of 6 percent over the CARICOM external tariff and limited quantitative restrictions.* The authorities have not yet implemented the final phase of the Common External Tariff, which would reduce the maximum import tariff to 20 percent.g 37. The mission encouraged the authorities to explore domestic revenue sources to reduce dependence on trade taxes, which currently account for nearly 50 percent of tax revenue. This would also facilitate St. Kitts and Nevis’s integration into the CARICOM Single Market Economy and the Free Trade Areas of America (FTAA). The * St. Kitts and Nevis has an overall score of 6 on the IMF’s trade restrictiveness index (a scale of l-10, from the least to most restrictive rating). Quantitative restrictions are mainly on agricultural imports. ’ St. Kitts and Nevis implemented the third phase of CARICOM’s Common External Tariff in January 200 1, reducing the maximum tariff to 25 percent (from 30 percent). The fourth and final phase reduces the top rate to 20 percent (agricultural products are still subject to a maximum rate of 40 percent and arms/ammunition to a maximum rate of 70 percent).

The authorities remain fully committed to the objective of regional economic integration. Together with other countries of the region, St. Kitts and Nevis is participating in discussions aimed at creating a single market within CARICOM, and FTAA. There has been no change in St. Kitts’ external trade regime, with the exception of increasing the custom service charge, since the previous Article IV consultation discussions. E. Medium-Term Prospects 39. The medium-term outlook was discussed with reference to three macro- scenarios prepared in collaboration with the authorities. The baseline scenario included the impact of the medium-term fiscal adjustment strategy recommended by the mission. It showed, however, that fiscal adjustment alone could not reverse the debt dynamics, without measures to deal directly with the debt stock. The budget would continue to record deficits over the medium term mainly due to a high interest bill and the need to cover the debt service for the sugar company (Box 2 and Table 7), and the debt ratio would rise further before stabilizing at around 150 percent by 2008. 40. The authorities agreed that budget measures alone would not be sufficient to contain the rise in the debt ratio, and requested the mission to prepare alternative scenarios including privatization and closure of the sugar company. These scenarios indicated that the additional measures could, if fully implemented, sharply reduce the debt ratio to around 70 percent of GDP by 2008. 41. A first adjustment scenario augments the baseline adjustment effort with privatization of non-sugar assets (Box 2, Adjustment Scenario I). The privatization would permit the debt ratio to decline to around 110 percent of GDP by 2008-still high enough to constitute a major vulnerability, in the view both of the mission and the authorities. Moreover, it would still far exceed the ECCB benchmark limit of 60 percent of GDP on public debt. 42. A second adjustment scenario assumes a higher level of privatization proceeds, predicated on closure of the sugar company and sale of sugar lands. On this basis, the public debt ratio would decline sharply to around 70 percent by 2008, albeit still above the ECCB benchmark. lo lo The scenarios assume that the average interest rate on the debt would gradually decline from its current level of 9 percent as the fiscal and the debt situation improves.

Besides these scenarios, the mission undertook the standard debt sustainability exercise to simulate the impact of a variety of adverse macroeconomic shocks (Table 10). The results of this exercise indicate that temporary shocks to real interest rate, real GDP growth, and the primary fiscal balance would increase the debt ratio sustainability (ranging from 15 to 45 percent of GDP) over the medium term. Similarly, given the large proportion of the external debt, a 30 percent real depreciation would increase the external debt ratio to above 125 percent by end-2004 from 87 percent at end-2003, and would remain above 100 percent up to 2008. In the staffs view, financing needs associated with these levels of debt would be difficult to meet through recourse to the country’s traditional creditors. Box 2. Medium-Term Public Debt Scenarios Given the level of fiscal imbalances, strong fiscal adjustment supported by use of substantial privatization proceeds will be needed to put the debt ratio on a sustainable trajectory. l Baseline Scenario. The government relies mainly on fiscal adjustment, without using any privatization proceeds to reduce debt. l Adjustment Scenario I (with privatization of non-sugar assets). Sales of shares in the National Bank, Cable and Wireless, the cable company, lands owned by the port; privatization of airport and electricity services (35 percent of GDP-l 5 percent of GDP in 2004; 10 percent of GDP in 2006). l Adjustment Scenario II (with privatization of non-sugar assets and closure of the sugar industry). Closure of the sugar of industry in 2004 and liquidation of debt by sale of some assets (sugar lands) amounting to 30 percent of GDP (10 percent of GDP per year in 2004-06). This leads to a reduction in the debt level through three channels: the direct reduction of debt due to the sale of lands, the cessation of the debt accumulation due to losses of the sugar industry, and lower interest cost on the lower level of debt reducing the overall fiscal deficit.

The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to consider privatization and encouraged speedy action given the extensive preparatory work that may be required. It suggested that the government seek technical assistance from the Caribbean Development Bank and the World Bank to prepare assets for privatization, directly or possibly through the creation of a holding company, preferably listed on regional stock exchanges. 45. The authorities, aware of the fiscal risks, noted that they had already initiated measures to restore medium-term sustainability, but underscored that resolving the issue of the sugar company was an essential element. They indicated that they were weighing various options for alternative uses of the sugar lands, but cautioned that while the sugar company was not economically feasible, they would have to address the political and social implications of closing the company. 46. In other secfors, the authorities indicated that public assets equivalent to as much as 75 percent of GDP could be targeted for privatization. There was scope for private participation in a number of activities currently carried out by the public sector-for example, solid waste collection, seaport and airport management, and electricity generation and distribution. They had approached the Caribbean Development Bank to assist in conducting due diligence to assess the value of some of the government assets. F. Structural Reforms 47. The mission stressed the need for structural reforms to enhance competitiveness. Besides fiscal consolidation the agenda should include skills training, keeping wage growth in line with productivity, and reducing the role of the public sector in areas where private sector participation could enhance efficiency. 48. The authorities stated that they have already begun to take measures in some of these areas. They were investing substantially in hospitality and computer training- skills regarded as critical for developing tourism-and were conducting due diligence to prepare some assets for private sector participation. To contain wage bill growth and send a signal to the private sector, the government had withheld the payment of the end-year bonus (equivalent to one month’s salary) for the last two years. The authorities agreed that the pace of structural reforms has been slower than desirable, partly reflecting shortages of qualified staff to design and implement the reforms, but also because of the government’s concern to minimize the after-effects of the September 11 events on the economy. 49. The discussions focused on three main areas of structural reform: the tax administration, the SSB, and the public enterprises. 50. The mission urged the authorities to implement the recommendations of the recent FAD report on modernization of the tax system, including introduction of a VAT. Implementation would reduce the government’s dependence on taxes from international trade, enhance competitiveness, and prepare the country to deal with the revenue effects of further trade liberalization (initiatives such as FTAA). The authorities Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- said that the recommendations, along with the report of the OECS Tax Reform and Administration Commission, were being reviewed by the government. Moreover, following on the recommendations of the Monetary Council of the ECCB, consultations on tax reform are planned with stakeholders in the currency union, including the general public. The authorities added that efforts are underway to develop an ECCU-wide strategy for the implementation of the recommendations of these reports. 51. The mission argued for greater operational autonomy for the SSB. Since St. Kitts and Nevis has a relatively young population and the highest contribution rate among the ECCU countries, the SSB has been able to record surpluses ranging from 4 to 6 percent of GDP annually. However, SSB’s rate of return is lower than the regional average, reflecting the concentration of its investment portfolio in a narrow range of domestic assets. The mission recommended that the government allow SSB greater autonomy in selecting its investment portfolio, including investing abroad. The authorities indicated that a proposal was under consideration to allow the SSB to invest up to 10 percent of its portfolio in external assets, and that the launch of the RGSM will also provide an opportunity to diversify SSB’s portfolio. 52. The mission saw scope for strengthening the public enterprise sector. Key public enterprises receive operating transfers from government, and their financial accounts are not generally published on a regular basis. l1 To increase efficiency and reduce the burden on the budget, the government should seek private sector involvement where feasible-such as in airport management and water and electricity utilities. 53. The mission also urged the government to enhance transparency by enforcing the statutory requirement for submitting public enterprises’ annual reports to parliament. The authorities indicated that four enterprises have started providing their financial accounts to the ministry of finance, and efforts are underway to make others do so. . The authorities explained that, in some cases, a lack of qualified auditors is the main reason for delays in preparing and publishing financial accounts. 54. Though the political process related to the issue of Nevis’ secession is underway, the economic and financial implications of this move remain to be worked out. The staff suggested that the authorities undertake such an exercise to fully understand how the separate economies would cope with the increased vulnerabilities from their openness, greater dependence on single industries or enterprises, natural disasters, a redistribution of national assets, debts and existing pension obligations to the successor nations. l1 The main enterprises include Frigate Bay Development Corporation, National Housing Corporation, Urban Development Corporation, and Whitegate Development Corporation.

The deterioration is partly explained by exogenous shocks-such as hurricanes, the global slowdown, the September 11 attacks, and the uncertainty associated with the Middle East crisis-and the government policy to maintain high level of expenditures for post- hurricane reconstruction, that have adversely affected growth and revenue while imposing heavy claims on the budget. These developments have underscored the vulnerability of the economy and placed the issue of debt sustainability at the forefront of the policy agenda. 56. Recognizing the seriousness of the fiscal and public debt situation, the government has initiated a major effort of fiscal adjustment. The staff welcomes the measures introduced in the 2003 budget, but considers that further steps are necessary to reverse the debt dynamics in a credible manner. In addition to measures to strengthen the budget, steps are needed to reduce the stock of public debt. Moreover, structural reforms should be broadened and intensified. 57. Besides retaining the measures taken in 2003, budget strengthening for 2004 and beyond could be based on the recommendations of recent Fund and World Bank reports. Notably, steps to modernize the tax system should be initiated with the 2004 budget. In line with FAD recommendations, an integral part of this modernization should be to prepare for the introduction of a VAT-type tax on a regional basis. On the expenditure side, the formulation and execution of the PSIP should be strengthened by including only projects with high returns and concessional external financing. Current expenditure should be rationalized as recommended in the World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review and Country Procurement Assessment reports. 58. In addition to fiscal consolidation, measures should be taken directly to reduce the stock of public debt. The authorities envisage using privatization proceeds to pay down expensive debt while continuing to explore further opportunities to refinance part of the debt at lower interest rates. They believe that these actions, together with the generation of primary surpluses based on the measures proposed by the staff, could lead to a reduction in the government’s borrowing requirements and ultimately bring down the debt ratio to a sustainable level over the medium term. Staff supports the ambitious privatization agenda not only because of its potential to reduce the debt but also because of its structural benefits. However, the uncertainty regarding the projected proceeds and implementation difficulties constitutes a major downside risk. 59. Fiscal consolidation and debt reduction should be supported by structural reforms aimed at enhancing competitiveness. These reforms should include a permanent solution to the long-standing issue of the loss-making sugar company, strengthening the rest of the public sector, ensuring the long-term viability of the social security insurance scheme, and withdrawal of government from activities better performed by the private sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- 60. The mission welcomes the authorities’ decision to participate in the forthcoming ECCU-wide FSAP, whose recommendations should form the basis for strengthening the legal and supervisory framework for the financial system. Such a strengthening is particularly important in view of the increasing financial integration underway in the region. The staff encourages the authorities to issue additional shares of the majority government-owned commercial bank to enhance the role of the private sector in the financial sector, and reduce the bank’s public sector exposure. 61. The staff commends the authorities for strengthening the legal and supervisory framework for the offshore financial center. The authorities’ efforts have resulted in the removal of St. Kitts and Nevis from the OECD list of non-cooperative tax havens and the FATF list of jurisdictions with weak anti-money laundering frameworks. The staff urges the authorities to maintain their existing vigilance to ensure that the sector continues to remain an attractive destination for reputable business. 62. The staff is of the view that participation in the ECCU has served St. Kitts and Nevis well and remains appropriate, provided strong fiscal policies can be put in place. The arrangement has delivered, over the last several decades, low inflation and a degree of investor confidence that would be difficult for St. Kitts and Nevis to achieve in isolation. However, competitiveness needs to be enhanced despite the recent partial reversal in the appreciation of the E.C. dollar. This will require, in addition to fiscal consolidation, reforms to raise productivity such as enhancing private sector participation in public sector activity. The staff welcomes the government’s intentions to develop initiatives in this area. 63. While St. Kitts and Nevis has maintained a moderate external trade regime, further progress will require less reliance on trade-related revenue. The staff urges the authorities to implement FAD recommendations to strengthen the domestic tax base. Meanwhile, they should proceed with trade liberalization by narrowing the dispersion of tariff rates and phasing out import licensing. 64. There has been some improvement in statistics, but further strengthening is desirable. Data on the financial activities of the public enterprises remain in need of improvement. The staff urges the authorities to redouble efforts to ensure that these data are available to the ministry of finance and the public through regular and timely publication. 65. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - Figure 3.

There are no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. There are exchange controls on payments for invisibles (i.e., indicative limit on travel allowances), but all bonafide transactions are approved. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation: St. Kitts and Nevis is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 7, 2002. The staff report is M/02/163, and the accompanying statistical appendix is M/02/162. Ix. Technical Assistance: FAD: In November 2002, a mission visited St. Kitts and Nevis to provide assistance on tax policy and administration. This was part of an effort to advice on tax reform to seven members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.

The CAS, which covers FY 2002-06, proposes new commitments of US$l 10 million for five borrowing member states of the OECS, including St. Kitts and Nevis. The main goals of the strategy are to reduce income insecurity and vulnerability at the national and household levels, and build human and institutional capacity to meet the challenging economic and social environment facing these small states. Most new projects are being provided under a sub-regional umbrella mechanism using horizontal Adaptable Program Loans (APLs), and in close collaboration with sub- regional organizations and external partners. I. Projects There are five active World Bank projects in St. Kitts and Nevis for a net commitment of approximately US$24 million equivalent. The OECS Telecommunications Reform Program, approved in FY 1998, seeks to introduce pro-competition reforms in the telecommunications sectors and increase the supply of informatics related skills in five OECS borrowing countries: the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project has helped the OECS countries negotiate with the sub-regional telecom monopoly and lower the long distance and regional telephone rates. The share for St. Kitts and Nevis in the US$6.0 million loan is US$l.2 million. The Disaster Management Project, approved in FY 1999, is part of a regional program for five OECS borrowing countries to fortify, reconstruct, and rehabilitate key economies and social infrastructure and facilities to minimize damage caused by natural and man-made disasters and to speed-up emergency recovery following such disasters. Additionally, the project aims to strengthen countries’ institutional capacities to prepare for and respond to disaster emergencies efficiently and effectively. St. Kitts and Nevis’s share of the project is US$8.5 million. The Emergency Recovery project for the OECS was approved on March 7,2002, to help mitigate the impact of the September 1 lth attack on the tourism sector. The project will support strengthened airport and seaport security. The World Bank’s assistance for this project is US$21 million, including US$4.4 million for St. Kitts and Nevis. The Education Development Project, approved in FY 2002, is part of an intended umbrella program for the five OECS-borrowing countries. The overall program objective is to build human capital in the OECS which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of their economies and more sustainable growth. This objective will be achieved by: increasing Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-34- APPENDIX II access to education, improving quality of teaching and learning processes, and strengthening management of schools. The St. Kitts and Nevis project is for US$5 million. The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, approved in FY 2003, is part of a multi- country program which aims to support the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis to control the spread of HIV/AIDS through: scaling up prevention program for high-risk groups as well as the general population, strengthening treatment, care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS; and strengthening institutional capacity to better respond to the epidemic. The St. Kitts and Nevis project is for US$4 million. II. Economic and Sector Work The Bank is engaged in three categories of analytical work of direct relevance to St. Kitts and Nevis. The first builds on the Bank-wide program on small states and focuses on the issue of vulnerability in the Caribbean, including a study of macroeconomic volatility and income security in the Caribbean, research and a proposed project on catastrophic insurance for the OECS and Barbados, reviews of natural hazard risk mitigation strategies in the Caribbean and institutional arrangements for environmental management in the OECS, and technical assistance to help strengthen the measurement of poverty and social welfare in the OECS. Several of these reports were discussed in draft form at the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development at its biennial meeting in June 2002. The second body of work addresses long-term development in the OECS and institutional capacity, and includes an Institutional and Organizational Review of the OECS (completed), an OECS Procurement Assessment Review (completed), an OECS Financial Accountability Assessment (completed), and a report on Fiscal Issues in the OECS to include reviews of public expenditure for each of the six member countries (ongoing). Finally, the Bank will continue to work together with the IMF and the ECCB to fully review the financial sector including off-shore operations, including a planned Financial Sector Assessment Program report in the second half of 2003. Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas The World Bank and the IMF will continue to collaborate on financial sector and off-shore management, and in providing a wide range of technical assistance to Dominica on macroeconomic management issues through joint support to the Caribbean Technical Assistance Center.

Projects St. Kitts and Nevis is the eighth largest borrowing member of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) at the end June 30, 2003, with total approved credit of US$123.2 million. There was an equivalent of US$30.7 million in undrawn balances of committed resources for project financing. The factors which generally impact on the level of disbursement include weak implementation capacity due to a shortage of technical and managerial staff, the inability to provide counterpart financing on a timely basis and difficulties in the timely compliance with CDB’s procurement procedures. CDB has supported the economic and social development in St Kitts and Nevis by financing projects in agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, energy, transportation and communication, housing, education, disaster rehabilitation, small enterprises development and basic needs. The projects that are currently ongoing include: Nevis Power Project; Basic Education Project; Fifth Student Loans Scheme; Seventh Consolidated Line of Credit; OECS Solid Waste Management Project; National Disaster Management (Rehabilitation) Project and the Caribbean Court of Justice Project. Total approvals in 2002 were US$6.8 million for three projects, namely, the Nevis Electricity Company Limited (Add Loan) ($1.6 million); the Basic Education Project (Add Loan) (US$3.0 million) and the Court of Justice Project (US$2.2 million). Total approvals in 2001 were US$24.1 million for five projects. II.

Except for the financial sector no other metadata updates have been received since the initial posting on the DSBB. 1. Real sector There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. Data on GDP broken down by type of expenditure are not available at constant prices, while the data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual. A new CPI with weights from the 2000 household survey has now been introduced. No data are currently available on labor market developments. Results of the 2001 population census are still being analyzed. 2. Public finances Data on revenue, expenditure, and financing of the consolidated central government (St. Kitts and Nevis) are made available to Fund staff on request. There are a number of technical problems that need to be addressed, including a discrepancy between the overall balance (the difference between revenues and expenditures) and available financing. Previous missions have identified this discrepancy as arising from the inability to capture all expenditures, such as-appropriation-in-aid loans and the so-called “below the line” expenditures. The authorities could benefit from technical assistance in devising a set of fully integrated accounts for the central government that are produced on a regular basis. Also, it would be useful to institute a mechanism for the regular reporting of financial data of the rest of the public sector. The authorities do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. The latest data published in the GFS Yearbook are for 1994. 3. Balance of payments and external debt The balance of payments is compiled on an annual basis in a format that is not fully consistent with BPMS. However, timeliness has improved somewhat recently, with data for 2001 published in the March 2003 issue of the IFS. Data on external trade (especially exports) are not comprehensive, as they omit important categories of goods. Most components of the data on capital flows also need improvement. It would be useful to reconcile the data on the public sector investment plan for external loans with the external debt database compiled by the ECCB.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis On [Month, dd, yyyy], the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis.’ Background During the early- to mid-1990s the economy of St. Kitts and Nevis was able to record real GDP growth of about of 5% percent annually, which was interrupted in 1998 by Hurricane Georges, followed by Hurricanes Lenny and Jose in 1999. Post-hurricane reconstruction led to a temporary resumption of growth in 2000 and before September 11, 2001, but contributed to widening the fiscal deficit despite already high public indebtedness. Fiscal and debt problems have been exacerbated by large and persistent losses of the government sugar company. Real GDP growth in 2002 decelerated to 0.8 percent (from 2.3 percent in 2001) owing to significant declines in tourism, manufacturing, and construction, which were only partly offset by a strong sugar crop and an expansion in the retail trade and transportation sector. Inflation has remained low (less than 2 percent in 2002) reflecting the openness of the economy and the peg of ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [Month, dd, yyyy] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The overall fiscal deficit including grants rose to 16 percent of GDP in 2002, mainly due to higher capital expenditure, net lending to public enterprises, and higher interest payments. Primary expenditure out-stripped revenue growth by 5 percent of GDP, increasing the primary deficit to around 9 percent of GDP. To meet its financing needs, the government borrowed from regional commercial banks and issued paper in the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM). This allowed it to remain current on all obligations to domestic and external creditors and suppliers. Public debt rose by around 18 percentage points in 2002, to nearly 160 percent of GDP, reflecting the deficits of the St. Kitts central government and the Nevis Island Administration, the losses of the sugar company (3-4 percent of GDP annually) and of other public enterprises. The ECCB, which had previously reduced its discount rate (from 8 to 7 percent, in October 2001), lowered the minimum mandatory rate on savings deposits from 4 to 3 percent in September 2002. These measures, combined with weak credit demand, led to a decline in lending and deposit rates (by 70 and 40 basis points, respectively) since October 2001. The ratio of nonperforming to total loans increased by about 1 percentage point to 12% percent in 2002, partly due to weak activity. Considerable progress has been made in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the offshore financial sector. St. Kitts and Nevis was removed in 2002 from the list of jurisdictions that meet the OECD’s tax haven criteria and from the FATF’s list of non-cooperative countries and territories. A self-assessment of the regulatory regime for the offshore financial sector (Module 1) has been completed and AML/CFT legislation has been strengthened-inter alia by providing for exchange of information with other jurisdictions, increasing penalties for money laundering, and establishing a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to investigate suspicious financial activity. The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force commenced a mutual evaluation of St. Kitts and Nevis in parallel with the ECCU-wide FSAP. The external current account deficit widened to 33% percent of GDP in 2002. This was largely due to low tourist receipts and high imports for private sector projects in the tourism sector. The current account deficit was fully financed by official capital inflows and foreign direct investment. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt rose by 9 percentage points in 2002, to 70% percent of GDP. Progress with structural reform has been slow. No concrete steps have yet been taken to address the problem of the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Corporation (SSMC), though its losses (3-4 percent of GDP per year) have long been a heavy drain on the budget. Executive Board Assessment <Begin Typing Here> Public Information Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the Ih4F to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
