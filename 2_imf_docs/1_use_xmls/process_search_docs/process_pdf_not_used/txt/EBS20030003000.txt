Murillo Portugal and Alexandre Tombini (OED) attended key meetings. 0 This report covers Article IV issues. A detailed discussion of developments and policies related to the Stand-By Arrangement is contained in the staff report for the Second Review. The principal author of the Article IV report is Philip Gerson. . Article IV discussions concentrated on the priorities of the new government and policies to reduce Brazil’s vulnerabilities. The authorities stressed their commitment to medium- term fiscal policies consistent with debt sustainability. Reforms to the public pension scheme were a particular priority. Policies to enhance social equity were also critical, but these would be accommodated within existing budget constraints. . Brazil has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. . Brazil has made significant progress in establishing a comprehensive anti-money laundering institutional framework (AML). After progress in implementing AML instructions in the banking system, implementation is focusing on the insurance and securities sectors. The authorities are committed to ratifying and implementing the main international antiterrorism and antimoney laundering agreements. . Brazil’s statistical base is adequate for effective surveillance. Brazil is in observance of the SDDS. A comprehensive range of real, monetary, fiscal and external sector data is available in English and Portuguese on the website of the central bank (www.bcb.gov.br).

BACKGROUNDANDPROSPECTSFOR 2003 A. Medium-Term Perspective 1. Since the 1998 economic crisis, the Brazilian economy has undergone a number of important changes. The public finances have strengthened dramatically, with the consolidated public sector shifting from a primary deficit of 1 percent of GDP (in 1997) to surpluses averaging more than 3% percent of GDP during 1999-2002 (Figure 1). In addition, Brazil managed the transition to a floating exchange rate regime while maintaining inflation at relatively low levels, and important reforms have strengthened the financial system. 2. Despite these achievements, significant vulnerabilities remain. Three characteristics have defined the Brazilian economy over the last few years: a A large external financing requirement and significant exchange rate volatility. The gross financing requirement has fallen by half over the last four years, from US$83 billion in 1999 to US$43 billion in 2002, owing to a declining current account deficit and lower amortization requirements on medium- and long-term debt (Figure 2). Both in dollar terms and relative to exports, however, Brazil’s external financing requirement remains near the top among those of all emerging markets. As a result, the economy is highly susceptible to shifts in investor sentiment and other external shocks, which have affected the exchange rate. Between 1999 and 2002, the coefficient of variation of the end-of-week nominal exchange rate was 25 percent, almost twice that for the Chilean and Colombian pesos, nearly four-times that for the Thai baht, and six-times that for the Mexican peso. Factors Affecting the Debt Ratio, 2000-2002 0 A steady rise in the public debt stock to relatively large levels. Since 1999 the net debt stock has risen by a cumulative 7 percentage points of valorized GDP, reaching 56 percent at end-2002.’ (Gross debt as a share of nominal GDP- a concept that is easier to compare across countries-stood at 94 per- cent of GDP at end-2002).

According to the authorities, between end- 1999 and end-2002 the depreciation of the real led to an increase of 13 percent- age points in the debt ratio (close to 7 percentage points arising through the impact on exchange rate-indexed domestic debt).2 l Slow output growth. Growth has been anemic for several years, averaging less than 2 percent annually over the period 1997-2002, well below Brazil’s potential. External shocks and an energy crisis in 2001 account for part of Brazil’s poor growth performance, but high real interest rates, human capital shortages, the relatively closed nature of the economy, and institutional factors have also retarded investment and growth (Box 1). Slow growth has, in turn, hindered progress in improving the distribution of income, which is the most unequal in the region (Figure 3). 3. Fund macroeconomic policy advice has concentrated on the need to maintain disciplined monetary and fiscal policies to support sustainable growth. The authorities have done well to adopt the inflation targeting regime and substantially increase the primary surplus, both of which occurred in the context of Fund-supported programs. However, progress in implementing Fund recommendations to reduce the share of exchange rate- indexed debt has been frustrated by uncooperative market conditions. In addition, progress in structural reforms recommended by the Fund has been slow in areas that required broad political support, such as central bank independence and tax and pension reform. B. Developments in 2002 4. The 2001 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 23,2002. Executive Directors praised Brazil’s solid performance under the then-current Stand-By Arrangement and noted the significant progress that had been achieved in recent years in strengthening the fiscal stance and reducing inflation. They noted, however, that progress in the structural reform agenda had been lagging, and encouraged the authorities to make further advances in this area to reduce underlying vulnerabilities. 5. Since then, the Brazilian economy has come under considerable stress. A sharp drop in net capital inflows-prompted by worries about a possible shift in macroeconomic policies after the change in government, concerns about debt sustainability, and increased global risk aversion (in part spillover from events in Argentina)-resulted in a substantial 2 However, this figure overstates the impact of the currency depreciation because it does not consider the counterfactual of how large the debt stock would have been had the borrowing requirement been financed by alternative means, for example with fixed rate debt that would have paid very high ex ante interest rates.

Policies to Enhance Growth Brazil’s long run per capita growth rate during the past century (an average of 4.4 per- cent between 1901 and 2000) rivaled that of countries such as South Korea and Japan and was more than one percentage point higher than that of the U.S. Despite this growth performance, Brazil still has the highest economic inequality in the region and the breadth and depth of its poverty are well known. In addition, during the last two decades, Brazil’s per capita growth rate has been barely positive and considerably less than both global growth and that of Latin America comparators. Several factors have led to this growth slowdown including high public debt, inadequate infrastructure investment, distortionary taxation, lack of openness, declining urbanization, and slowing improvements in human capital. Restoring respectable long-run growth will require, first and foremost reducing the burden of the public debt. This implies maintaining a credible fiscal program and reducing the implicit debt of the pension system (which is easily the highest among middle income countries at between 250 and 300 percent of GDP). Catalyzing growth will also require, Improving the investment climate with 15 Brazil.

Creating a supportive environment for innovation with incentives for business research and development, greater protection of intellectual property rights and increased use of private-public partnerships to promote innovation, improve access to information technology, and encourage greater technology training. Fostering human capital development particularly through improvements in upper primary and secondary school education (expanding access and increasing enrollment and retention) and a reallocation of resources to early childhood interventions for the disadvantaged. Labor policy changes that encourage private training initiatives would also be beneficial.

In addition, spreads relative to U.S. treasuries widened from about 750 basis points at the start of the year to 2400 basis points by October. At the same time, rollover rates on the domestic debt declined sharply. Meanwhile, international capital markets closed to Brazilian issuers and foreign portfolio outflows increased. As market concerns mounted in mid-summer, the Fund reached agreement with the authorities on a 15-month Stand-By Arrangement for the equivalent of US$30 billion. 6. Market sentiment improved following the election, as evidence emerged that the new administration would adhere to prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The real has recovered about 10 percent of its nominal value and sovereign spreads have fallen substantially from levels at the height of pre-election jitters last October, aided in part by some improvement in global markets. In addition, the rollover rate on the domestic public debt has increased to close to 100 percent, and the authorities have begun placing debt at tenors of up to 18 months. Nevertheless, markets continue to be wary, as demonstrated both by the considerable volatility that persists in financial market variables and by the still-high level of sovereign spreads. 7. Notwithstanding the extraordinary events of last year, economic developments were in many ways consistent with longer-term patterns. Shocks-in this case domestic in origin-translated through the large external borrowing and domestic debt rollover requirements into a substantial depreciation of the currency and rise in the sovereign risk premium. These, in turn, produced a significant increase in the debt ratio and depressed growth through the impact of higher interest rates and lower external capital flows on consumption and investment. In light of this experience, Article IV discussions concentrated on policies to address Brazil’s three main vulnerabilities: its large public debt; its substantial external borrowing requirement; and its persistent slow growth. II. CHALLENGESANDPOLICIES 8. Throughout the discussions, the authorities stressed their commitment to reduce Brazil’s social and economic weaknesses. While voters had emphatically expressed a desire for change, with economic policies that put greater emphasis on growth and equity, experience had taught Brazilians that macroeconomic stability was a prerequisite for durable improvements in the well-being of the poor. Accordingly, disciplined fiscal and monetary policies were not only compatible with but were in fact essential to achieve the social objectives of the government and society. 9. The authorities saw the response of financial market variables since the election as an endorsement of their policy program. While the real had recently given up some of its post-election gains, and country risk spreads had now stabilized after falling substantially in late 2002 and early 2003, the authorities believed this reflected a deterioration of the global environment rather than Brazil-specific factors. More generally, they felt that external vulnerabilities had declined markedly, in part owing to the extraordinary increase in the trade Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lo- balance last year and its impact on the external financing requirement. Nevertheless, they recognized that country risks spreads were still high and that Brazil remained vulnerable to external shocks. Continued policy discipline and early progress on a range of structural policies were therefore essential, A. Fiscal and Monetary Policies Fiscal policy 10. Medium-term fiscal policy will be oriented towards ensuring a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. To this end, the authorities have already increased the primary surplus target for 2003 by % percent of GDP to 4.25 percent of GDP, in order to help stabilize the debt ratio in 2003. Moreover, they reiterated their pledge to maintain primary surplus targets over the medium term that are sufficient to ensure the public debt burden would remain manageable. More precise targets for 2004-06 would be announced in April, in the context of the presentation to congress of the annual Budget Guidelines Law. Staff calculations suggest that maintenance of the current primary surplus target over the medium term would lead, under a baseline scenario, to a decline in the net debt ratio to 5 1 percent of valorized GDP by 2006 (Appendix V). Of course, the debt dynamics are highly sensitive to changes in parameters, in particular the real interest rate, real exchange rate, and real growth rate. 11. The authorities and staff concurred that over the medium term, reforms to address the 4 percent of GDP annual deficit of the civil service pension scheme are critical to ensure the health of the public finances. The National Economic and Social Development Council--consisting of representatives of workers, employers, and other elements of civil society-has been charged by President da Silva with providing a recommendation on pension reforms by end-March. The government will submit a formal proposal to congress later this year.3 Brazil.

The authorities indicated that their proposal would likely involve a combination of measures: l the establishment of a cap on civil service pensions equal to that applying in the system for private sector workers; l the creation of complementary, defined contribution schemes for civil servants with a government contribution; l increases in retirement ages (currently 60 for men and 55 for women for old age benetits for individuals hired since a 1998 reform went into effect and 53 and 48 for men and women hired earlier) and in the minimum contribution period (currently 10 years); and l the enrollment of all new civil servants into the system for private sector workers. The authorities had recently reached agreement with all 27 state governors to proceed with a pension reform along these lines. (Support of the governors is essential as about half of the deficit of the civil service pension scheme arises at the state level). The authorities anticipate submitting a reform proposal to congress during the first half of the year. 13. In evaluating reform actions, the authorities face a potential tradeoff between short-term costs and longer-term benefits. Applying the full range of reforms to all existing workers would mean that benefits from measures such as the introduction of the cap on pensions and the increase in retirement ages would be realized relatively quickly. However, such a reform would also involve substantial short-term budgetary costs, due both to the loss of a portion of the contributions from current civil servants whose earnings placed them over the pension cap and to the need for the government to make employer contributions to the complementary funds. To reduce these costs, it was possible that the reforms would apply only to new civil servants, although this would substantially postpone the date at which the benefits of the reform would begin to be realized. The authorities also envisaged introducing a change in replacement rates for current and future pensioners by shifting from gross to net wages in calculating benefits, which could generate significant and immediate budgetary savings. Such a change would be politically difficult to implement, as indeed would be many of the measures being contemplated. Nevertheless, the authorities noted the existence of a broad consensus among all sectors of society in favor of reform, which augured well for progress this year.

The authorities recognized that measures were also needed to address the deficits of the pension scheme for private sector workers (RGPS). Reforms enacted since 1999 had reduced the deficit of this system to a little over 1 percent of GDP, and the authorities were confident that the remaining gap could be closed through enhanced enforcement and other administrative measures. They also noted that much of the deficit of the RGPS arose from transfers to rural workers under the program. They argued that these payments should be viewed in a broader context as a reasonably well-targeted social assistance program that was extremely valuable to rural communities and helped mitigate social inequities. (Social assistance spending is covered in more detail in Section C, below).

Maintenance of significant primary surpluses in the medium term was complicated by the rigid structure of the budget. The authorities noted that currently, about 25 percent of federal government revenues are transferred to subnational governments, about 55 percent are dedicated to wages and social security, and a further 10 percent cover constitutionally mandated expenditures on health and education. Although some mandated expenditures could be held in reserve, in general the structure of the budget forced spending cuts to fall disproportionately on investment and maintenance. 16. Ideally, issues related to revenue-sharing and revenue-earmarking would be addressed through a comprehensive tax reform. A key element of the tax reform would be the establishment of uniform rules governing the state value-added taxes to prevent predatory tax competition and reduce the dispersion of rates. The president had recently reached an agreement with the 27 state governors on the broad outlines of a tax reform proposal, including the establishment of a uniform code for state VATS to replace the 27 existing laws; the gradual elimination of cascading taxes (already partially underway); and a commitment to reduce over time the regressivity of the current system through a review of direct taxation. The reform was intended to be revenue neutral at all levels of government, including for each individual state. The authorities planned to submit a reform to congress during the first half of the year, although the timing of its approval would depend on the political calendar. As a fall-back position in the event a reform could not be passed this year, the authorities would seek to renew the existing arrangement for exempting a portion of federal revenues from earmarking (the DRU)-which is scheduled to expire at end-year-possibly with a higher exemption rate. For example, an increase in the exemption rate from 20 percent to 30 percent would leave an additional 1 l/4 percent of GDP in resources to the discretion of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - government, creating scope for a more efficient allocation of spending cuts in response to future shocks. The staff representatives noted that a reform would also need to address the bank debit tax (CPMF), whose rate is scheduled to decline at the end of the year (at a cost of more than 1 percent of GDP in revenues). The authorities stated that in the absence of a comprehensive reform they would likely submit legislation to congress to renew the CPMF at its current rate. 17.

Indeed, prior to the Asian crisis much of Brazil’s domestic debt was at fixed interest rates.

In addition to increasing the share of fixed rate debt, the authorities would also likely make greater use of price-indexed debt, particularly as they were also seeking to lengthen the average maturity of their debt. Demand for price-indexed instruments had recently grown (from very low levels), partly because of the rise in inflation expectations. To date most price-indexed debt has been linked to a wholesale price index that because it contains a high share of imported goods is a close proxy for the exchange rate, but the authorities hoped to begin placing debt linked to the official consumer price index instead.

The substantial volatility of the exchange rate in recent years greatly complicated the process of inflation targeting. The official inflation target had been breached in both 200 1 and 2002 mostly because of pass-through to prices of some of the substantial depreciation of the currency in those years (30 and Administered prices: 50 percent, respectively).4 In addition, li Excl. passthrough and 2001 inertia. 15% 11 Source: Central Bank of Brazil. Brazil: Contributions to 2002 Inflation 200 1 inertia: Passthrough 60% 0.9 7% 7.5 @ 2.3 Free prices: 18% li 1.9 the central bank had already announced an operational inflation target for 2003 that exceeded the official target range. To the authorities, the recent experience with inflation targeting did not suggest that this framework was inappropriate for economies subject to significant exchange rate volatility. It did, however, mean that central banks in emerging market countries were likely to miss their inflation targets more often than were those in other economies. In the face of large shocks, central bankers would need to accept that the economic costs of bringing inflation to within a narrow target range in a short period were at times too large to justify. In these circumstances, policy should seek to limit the pass-through of exchange rate shocks to nontradable goods prices (the “second round effect”), ensuring that the initial shift in relative prices (the “first round effect”) is preserved. 20. The authorities recognized that failure to achieve the inflation target could result in an erosion of credibility for the system. This was the case even though most observers understood the magnitude of the shocks Brazil had recently faced and the limits on the ability of monetary policy to offset them. The authorities stressed, however, that the achievement of the targets in 1999 and 2000 had established an important baseline level of credibility for the targeting regime. While alternative inflation measures that were less sensitive to exchange rate shocks existed (such as core inflation), the authorities felt that targeting these indices would diminish the transparency of the system, because they were either too abstract for the general public to understand or were based on consumption baskets too narrow to provide information about the behavior of overall prices. 21. The staff representatives agreed that given the magnitude of shocks Brazil had experienced, the credibility of the regime depended as much on policies as on outcomes. This meant that the central bank needed to respond quickly and forcefully to exchange rate movements, lest their inflationary impact spread to nontradables’ prices. Indeed, since 4 A forthcoming Selected Economic Issues paper examines the behavior of the exchange rate pass-through in Brazil.

Moreover, in recent statements and actions the central bank had reaffirmed its commitment to maintain low inflation and to increase interest rates in response to evidence of contagion from price increases in the tradable goods sector to the nontradables sector. 22. Despite the already high level of interest rates and the low stock of credit in the economy, the authorities believed that monetary tightening continued to be an effective policy instrument. Indeed, they believed that recent increases in interest rates were already beginning to affect aggregate demand. A decline in inflation expectations would probably lag a decline in actual inflation, however, because of the backward-looking nature of expectations. Nevertheless, monetary policy was only one of the tools needed to anchor inflation expectations: sustained fiscal adjustment and an improvement in the public debt structure to reduce progressively Brazil’s sensitivity to shocks were also required, Staff and the authorities concurred that, in addition, the granting of operational autonomy to the central bank-which was on the government’s reform agenda-would have a positive impact on the credibility of inflation targets. B. External Sector Issues 23. Staff projections suggest that over the medium term the current account deficit is likely to rise modestly to about 3 percent of GDP. While export growth is projected to remain strong-on the order of 44% percent annually in volume terms-import growth will rebound from its currently depressed levels as domestic demand recuperates. Thus, the trade surplus is projected to decline from its current level of about 3 percent of GDP to 2% percent of GDP over the medium term. Even at these lower, steady-state levels, the trade surplus would substantially exceed the balances recorded prior to 2002. In the authorities’ view, this reflected not just the impact of the recent currency depreciation but also a fundamental shift in the structure of the economy that had been under way for some time, as indicated by a gradual increase in the share of tradable sectors in the economy. Gross reserves are projected to rise from less than 60 percent of short-term debt (by residual maturity) to about 90 percent in 2008. 24. The authorities and staff agreed that at current exchange rates, Brazil was relatively competitive (Box 2). The current account deficit of less than 2 percent of GDP for 2002 and 2003 was well below the level of 3.3 percent that was required to stabilize the ratio of net foreign liabilities to GDP. Empirical techniques based on identifying the long-run equilibrium real exchange rate also suggest an undervaluation of the real, although probably by no more than about 10 percent. Brazil’s comparative advantage continues to lie mostly in primary and labor-intensive goods, including soybeans, footwear and steel. 25. External vulnerabilities would decline over the medium term through the impact of planned fiscal reforms. The authorities recognized a need to increase public saving, which had turned negative since the mid-1990s because of continued growth of current Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Box 2. Competitiveness and Export Performance This box uses two techniques to examine Brazil’s competitiveness: the macroeconomic balances approach used in the WEO, and a variation of the purchasing power parity methodology. It also reviews recent export performance. The macroeconomic balance approach. This approach suggest that the current real exchange rate could bc somewhat dcpreciatcd relative to its medium-term equilibrium value: the current account deficit required to stabilize Brazil’s net foreign liabilities at their present level is 3.3 percent, higher than the deficits projected for 2003-08. PPP methodology. The traditional PPP methodology was supplemented with additional variables to take into account common trends that affect the equilibrium real exchange rate over the long run. The model regressed the observed real effective cxchangc rate on the commodity terms- of-trade and extcmal debt, I20 I”” 8” 6” 40 2” 0 Brazil REER and Competitiveness defined using interest payments on foreign liabilities as a ratio to exports. As can be seen, the equilibrium exchange rate has depreciated significantly since the late-1990s largely reflecting the build-up of international debt, as well as falling commodity prices. Overall, the PPP estimates suggest that Brazil’s real exchange rate is broadly aligned, or possibly slightly undervalued (by around 10 percent) from a medium-term perspective. These estimates do not suggest an imminent reversal in the nominal value of the currency, in light of incipient inflation pressures. The growth in Brazilian exports also contains a structural component, reflecting the opening of new markets and the impact of trade agreements. Brazil’s main comparative export advantage continues to be in basic goods, raw materials and labor-intensive products, which again posted significant growth rates last year (see figures), suggesting that most of the recent gain in exports has been driven by the favorable exchange rate. Exports to nontraditional markets, however, or markets receiving trade missions grew by US$2.1 billion in 2002, offsetting more than 80 percent of the decline in exports to Argentina. From an historical view point, Brazil’s share in world trade has remained broadly constant at around 1 percent during the last decades, having been substantially larger only in the 1950s.

Arresting the growth of current spending- which would be facilitated by an increase in budget flexibility and possibly the pension reform-was essential to reverse this deterioration in the public sector accounts. As the debt stock declined, a drop in the country risk premium would also enhance public savings, increasing the pool of domestic resources available to finance private investment. Monetary policy also had a role to play in reducing external vulnerabilities by limiting the pass-through of the currency depreciation, so that the relative shift in the prices of tradables and nontradables that had contributed to the significant improvement in the trade balance would be preserved. 26. The negotiation of further bilateral and multilateral trade agreements was another element of the authorities’ strategy to reduce external vulnerabilities by increasing Brazil’s relatively low ratio of exports to external debt. Despite the steady improvement in the trade accounts in recent years, Brazil continued to face trade barriers in some key products-particularly agricultural goods and steel-especially in industrial economies. The authorities observed that while they were most interested in reducing industrial countries’ barriers to agricultural exports, these other countries were primarily focused on removing restrictions on access to Brazilian markets for services and in strengthening intellectual property rights. Staff noted that the Fund had taken an active role in calling on industrial economies to reduce protectionist measures. However, average tariffs in Brazil are high relative to other South American countries. In addition, Brazil employs a number of nontariff barriers and places restrictions on foreign investment in sectors such as financial services, media and transportation (Box 3). 27. The authorities stated that they remained committed to Mercosur. In particular, they would enter into negotiations for the proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas as a member of the South American trade block. Rather than proceed on separate tracks for agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services, the authorities intended to present a single offer, and to insist that negotiations on all sectors move at the same pace. They stated that they hoped negotiations on the FTAA could be completed by next year. C. Growth and Equity 28. The authorities saw increasing growth and equity as one of the key mandates conferred upon the government by the electorate. It was therefore a centerpiece of their economic strategy. In addition to the immediate positive impact that growth of employment and output would have on the well-being of the population, the authorities recognized the salutary effect rapid output growth would have on the public finances and the debt dynamics. 29. The authorities stressed that there was little tension between their macroeconomic and social goals. They saw very high real interest rates as the main impediment to growth, noting that risk spreads in Brazil were two- to three-times the level prevailing in many other emerging market countries. Therefore, fiscal policies aiming to reduce the debt ratio significantly in the coming years promised a substantial growth Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Box 3. Tariff Structure Despite the recent strong performance by Brazilian exports, significant barriers persist in its main export markets, especially the United States and the European Union. As discussed in the last Article IV report (EBS/O l/2 12, Box 6) Brazilian exports, particularly agricultural products, are subject to high tariffs, steep tariff escalation, nontariff barriers, and less transparent forms of protection. The average tariff for the 15 largest export products to the United States has been estimated at over 45 percent.

There remains significant scope for Brazil to open up its own trade regime. While average tariffs have slowly declined over the past two years, they remain above the minimum reached in 1996 of 11 percent and show a significant degree of tariff escalation. Compared to other South American countries Brazil’s tariffs are higher, with more dispersion. Nontariff barriers are also in evidence in Brazil. Brazil is a regular user of anti-dumping measures and of safeguards (recently involving textiles from Taiwan and South Korea). It also imposes import restrictions on a variety of goods, for example, used materials such as automobiles, and has erected other nontariff barriers. Brazil maintains a fairly restrictive regime of foreign investment in such sectors as air and land transportation, shipping, financial services, and media. In addition, barriers in business services and construction have been estimated to be equivalent to tariffs of 36 per- cent and 57 percent, respectively.

Similarly, trade reforms designed to promote exports would stimulate investment and growth not only by reducing macroeconomic volatility but also by allowing Brazilian firms to specialize in areas of comparative advantage. 30. Greater investment by the private sector was seen as critical to the restoration of growth. The authorities recognized that given the need to maintain healthy primary surpluses there was little scope to increase public investment. Indeed, public investment had borne the brunt of recent expenditure cuts to raise the primary surplus. In addition, they stated that there was no scope to significantly increase lending by the government development bank, BNDES, although some redistribution of lending across sectors within existing resource levels could be possible. They noted, however, that private investment was constrained by a lack of credit, with total bank lending equaling just 24 percent of GDP. While a reduction of the public sector debt stock would over time free more resources for the private sector, the authorities also saw a need for measures to reduce inefficiencies in the financial system Corporate Sector Analysis Although the corporate sector withstood the shocks that have hit the Brazilian economy since the late 1990s fairly well, its financial flexibility going forward may be more limited. Leverage ratios have increased, and a significant share of corporate debt is in foreign currency. While some of this debt is owed by firms with natural hedges via export earnings, much of it is not. These foreign currency mismatches have already contributed to problems in the electric utility and media sectors. While FX hedging is widespread, firms are reported to be flow- rather than stock hedged, running the risk that the hedge may not be rolled over at times of financial stress. Moreover, most of this hedge is provided by the government (through FX swaps and dollar-indexed debt) and is payable in local currency that must then be converted to foreign exchange through the market. As a result, hedging is subject to both sovereign and convertibility risk. Most local currency debt is at a floating rate. Local currency debt is also mostly short-term, which in situations of tight liquidity introduces rollover risk. The corporate sector is not a direct source of vulnerability to the financial system given that lending to the private sector is relatively low.

Reforms would therefore seek to reduce banking spreads and stimulate the flow of private savings to productive sectors. Banking spreads had declined in absolute value in recent years, but at 30 percent remained among the highest in the world, reflecting in part significant direct and indirect taxation (including the CPMF and reserve requirements); high Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- administrative expenses; and large recovery costs for loan losses. A key element in the authorities’ strategy to reduce spreads was the passage of a modern bankruptcy code to provide better protection for creditor rights and more rapid resolution of bankruptcies. Reforms were also planned to strengthen creditor rights in secured lending (such as for real estate and capital goods), which should also result in a fall in banking spreads. A comprehensive tax reform allowing for a decline in the rate charged on the CPMF would also help reduce spreads on bank lending. In addition, the authorities were seeking to enhance the role of credit cooperatives and microcredit mechanisms to stimulate the flow of credit to small and medium enterprises, which they noted were in many countries a key source of employment growth. Over the medium term, reforms to increase labor market flexibility were also planned. 32. Administrative reforms to the public sector also had the potential to increase growth over the medium term. Cross-country studies have documented a significant negative correlation between corruption and growth. Although Brazil does not suffer in this area to the same extent as do some other countries, the new government has established the fight against corruption as a high priority. Indeed, President da Silva highlighted in his inaugural address the need to confront “a culture of impunity” that through “corruption, evasion and waste continue[s] to deprive the population of resources that belong to it, and that could help it in its difficult tight for survival.” 33. The authorities recognized, however, that Brazil’s most pressing social problems could not be addressed through growth alone. Although per capita income in Brazil was higher than that in many emerging market countries, the extremely unequal distribution of income-with the richest 1 percent of the population accounting for about the same share of national income as the poorest 50 percent-meant that 15 percent of the population was living in extreme poverty and an additional 20 percent in poverty. Achieving a 10 percentage point reduction in the rate of extreme poverty while holding the distribution of income constant would, by the authorities’ reckoning, require a doubling of real per capita income, or nearly two decades of 4 percent real annual GDP growth. By contrast, the same reduction in extreme poverty could be achieved by increasing transfer payments to the poorest families at a cost of less than 1 percentage point of GDP annually. 34. The authorities noted that the tax and transfer system in Brazil has little net impact on income distribution. Because of the significant share of indirect taxes in public revenues, the tax system in Brazil was only moderately progressive, with small variations in the tax burden as a share of gross income across income deciles. Transfer payments were also only modestly progressive, in part due to social security payments, which account for about two-thirds of social spending. As a result, Brazil’s tax and transfer system reduces inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) by just 9 percent, from 0.65 to 0.59. By contrast, the authorities noted that in the United Kingdom the tax and transfer system resulted in a decline in inequality of 28 percent (from a Gini of 0.53 to one of 0.38).

Accordingly, the authorities felt there was considerable scope to reduce poverty by improving the efficiency of existing social expenditure, without creating additional budgetary pressure. One critical step in the process was to create systems to identify characteristics of families in the greatest need of assistance. A second step was to undertake a review of existing social programs to evaluate their effectiveness. Finally, there was also a need to increase the coordination and integration of social expenditure across programs, ministries and levels of government. To help achieve these aims, the government had recently created a Ministry of Assistance and Social Development to ensure that programs were well- targeted and were meeting beneficiaries’ needs. In addition, the government was in the process of developing its flagship social assistance program, Zero Hunger, which would provide targeted financial and other assistance to very poor families suffering from hunger. The program was introduced in January on a pilot basis and the authorities plan to expand it to provide R$50 in monthly assistance to 1.5 million families. III. STAFFAPPRAISAL 36. Brazil has made considerable progress in addressing micro- and macroeconomic imbalances in recent years. Disciplined monetary and fiscal policies-supported by significant improvements in fiscal institutions such as the Fiscal Responsibility Law and by the inflation targeting framework-have led to a sharp decline in inflation and an increase in the primary surplus. Social indicators have also improved, with notable gains in primary education and infant mortality rates. 37. In 2002, the Brazilian economy confronted a sudden stop in capital flows arising from concerns about the future course of economic policy and about the sustainability of the public debt. The resulting currency depreciation produced a rapid and dramatic shift in the current account balance, allowing the necessary macroeconomic adjustment to occur without a major loss of output. The costs of the shock are still being felt, however, in the form of higher inflation and an increase in the debt ratio. 38. The new government has made a commendable start in fulfilling its mandate to emphasize social concerns while maintaining macroeconomic stability. As a result, market sentiment toward Brazil has improved markedly since the election, with the real recovering some of its losses and country risk spreads declining significantly. Nevertheless, important sources of vulnerability remain, including the size and structure of the public debt, the still-substantial external borrowing requirement, and persistently slow output growth. A lasting resolution of these weaknesses requires a commitment to maintain policy discipline over the medium term and to complete a broad agenda of structural reforms. Progress in building the political support necessary for congressional approval of the structural reform agenda is well under way, as evidenced by the agreement reached with all 27 state governors on the broad outlines of pension and tax reforms. Early implementation of these and other key structural reforms could help provide a positive shock to markets, which would be particularly desirable given the uncertain global environment.

The decision to raise the primary surplus target to 4.25 percent of GDP for 2003 is a strong signal of the authorities’ commitment to ensure debt sustainability. As important is their public commitment to maintain primary surpluses over the medium term sufficient to keep the debt on a sustainable path. The presentation of the Budget Guidelines Law in April will provide an opportunity to demonstrate this commitment once again. Maintaining primary surpluses of at least the current level over the medium term should generate a substantial drop in country risk, with the potential to create a virtuous circle of lower real interest rates, faster output growth, and further declines in the debt ratio. However, even under the baseline scenario the debt ratio is likely to remain relatively high for several years. The rigid structure of the budget offers little margin to further tighten fiscal policy in the event of additional shocks, and measures to increase the flexibility of expenditure are therefore critical. In addition, as market conditions allow the authorities should proceed with efforts to improve the debt structure to reduce its sensitivity to exchange rate and interest rate shocks, although this may imply higher ex ante financing costs. 40. Over the medium term, maintenance of sizable primary surpluses will be facilitated by pension reforms to reduce the system’s annual 5 percent of GDP deficit. Reforms to the system for civil servants are especially critical. In evaluating its reform options, the authorities will need to balance short-term costs against long-term benefits. To offset these costs, and hasten the date at which the budgetary savings will accrue from the reform, the authorities should seek to include in their package a reduction in the replacement ratio for civil service pensions, if necessary mobilizing the broad consensus in favor of a reform to overcome possible political opposition to this measure. While the focus of reform efforts will rightly concentrate on the civil service system, reforms to the system for private sector workers will also be necessary if administrative measures are insufficient to reduce its deficit. Although much of that system’s deficit results from its welfare component-with large transfers to the rural population-such spending should be effected through an explicit budget transfer financed by general revenues rather than through the pension system and financed by payroll taxes. 41. The substantial exchange rate volatility of recent years has posed a challenge for monetary policy. In an environment of high volatility, it can be difficult to distinguish transitory movements in the exchange rate from more permanent ones. This creates the risk that a policy response may be too small or come too late to prevent inflationary pressures from spreading beyond the tradables sector. There are now clear signs that inflation has spread to the nontradables sector, and the central bank has responded properly, if with hindsight somewhat belatedly, by tightening monetary policy sharply since the fourth quarter of last year. Given the risk that inflation expectations can become entrenched, and the reputation of the central bank eroded, it will become necessary to tighten monetary policy further unless there are early signs of an abatement of inflationary pressures. The credibility of the central bank’s anti-inflation strategy would be enhanced, and the costs of disinflation reduced, by early action to grant the BCB operational autonomy.

The authorities’ intention to seek reciprocal, negotiated reductions in trade barriers at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels is welcome. Multilateral liberalization offers the promise of an outcome that is in the best interests of both the Brazilian economy and the international trading system, and should be prioritized even as negotiations over an FTAA and other agreements proceed. Further increases in Brazil’s outward orientation have the potential to significantly boost prospects for medium-term investment and growth, as well as to reduce external vulnerabilities. The authorities’ commitment to conclude negotiations on the FTAA by next year is particularly welcome. At the same time, the authorities should move to reduce Brazil’s remaining trade restrictions. 43. Sustained implementation of the authorities’ structural reform agenda, along with continued sound monetary and fiscal policies, should substantially reduce vulnerabilities and generate a return of output growth. Over time, such growth will result in improvements in the well-being of the entire population. However, addressing the needs of the poorest will require more than just growth. Given the limited scope for increasing social assistance spending in the near future, the authorities’ desire to increase the efficiency of social expenditure is well-founded. In the future, reductions in revenue earmarking, savings from pension reform, and a strong macroeconomic environment should create scope for increasing social assistance expenditure, allowing a significant improvement in the lives of many millions of Brazilians. 44. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Brazil be held in accordance with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15,2002.

Safeguards Assessments Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) is subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement that was approved on September 6,2002 and is scheduled to expire on December 3 1,2003. A safeguards assessment of the BCB was completed on June 14, 2002. The assessment concluded that substantial risks may exist. Staffs findings and proposed recommendations are reported in EBS/02/99. The BCB is progressively implementing these recommendations. VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement On July 1, 1994 the Brazilian authorities introduced a new currency, the real, with a floating exchange rate subject to a floor of parity with the U.S. dollar. On March 6, 1995 the authorities adopted a system of adjustable exchange rate bands consisting of a wider band (adjusted once a year) and a more narrow band (adjusted several times a month). The operational band was the miniband until January 12, 1999, and the maxiband thereafter. On January 12, 1999 the miniband was R$1.1975-R$1.2115 per U.S. dollar. On January 13, 1999 the miniband was abolished and the exchange rate was allowed to fluctuate within the wider band (maxiband). Also on January 13, 1999, the maxiband was widened from R$l .12- R$1.22 per U.S. dollar (established on January20, 1998) to R$1.20-R$1.32 per U.S. dollar. On January 15, 1999, the wider band was also abolished and the real left to float for the day, On January 18, 1999, the independent floating of the real was confirmed as the new foreign exchange regime. Through November 1999, Brazil continued to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, although it no longer maintained restrictions under this Article. The dual exchange rate arrangement-consisting of an official (or “commercial”) market for most current and capital transactions and of a “fluctuating” market for tourism, some nontrade related services, private unilateral transfers and nonregistered capital account operations-was eliminated as of February 1, 1999. Still, two issues-the rate of the financial operations tax (IOF) on exchange operations carried out in relation to credit card purchases abroad by residents, and the requirement that importers enter into forward FX contracts for the payment of imports financed under certain conditions-had been giving rise to restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. With a letter dated November 11, 1999, the Brazilian authorities informed the Fund that they had decided to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, effective November 30, 1999. Subsequently, they abolished, as of October 30, 1999, the requirement for importers mentioned above; the other remaining restriction was removed on February 1,2000, when the IOF rate on exchange operations carried out in relation to credit card purchases abroad by residents was lowered to 2 percent.

Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation with Brazil was concluded by the Executive Board on January 23,2002 (EBS/O l/212). Brazil is on the standard 12-month cycle. Brazil has participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and, in this connection, a joint Fund/World Bank mission visited Brazil in March and May/June 2002. The FSSA was discussed by the Executive Board at the time of the First Review under the Stand-By Arrangement in December 2002 (SM/02/377). X. Technical Assistance in 1998-2001 The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), in September 1998, provided technical assistance (TA) to Brazil on estimating the extent of evasion of social security contributions and improving the collection of social security contributions. A mission from FAD, with the participation of World Bank staff, visited Brazil in January 1999 to provide TA for complementary social security reforms. A follow-up mission, which evaluated the sustainability of the social security system in light of the reforms that had already been carried out, and focused on advising on reforms of the social security system for public sector workers, visited Brazil in January 200 1. In February 1999, FAD provided TA on social safety nets while participating in the area department mission; FAD staff also did follow-up work in the same area while participating in area department missions in March 2000 and July/August 2000. Brazil has also continued to receive technical assistance from FAD on reforming the social security administration through various visits by an FAD staff member, including in the context of the January 2001 mission. In September 2001 an FAD mission conducted a fiscal ROSC, and in December 2001 an FAD mission provided TA on tax reform. The Brazilian authorities have a good track record in implementing TA recommendations in the fiscal area. Several missions from the Statistics Department (STA) visited Brazil during 1998-2001 to provide TA on money and banking statistics, quarterly national income accounts, and government finance. These missions conducted a detailed evaluation of Brazil’s economic statistics, examined the legal and institutional framework for compiling and disseminating statistics, and assessed Brazil’s data dissemination practices. These missions also assisted the national authorities in the subscription of Brazil to the SDDS in early March, 200 1. In April 200 1 a money and banking statistics mission visited Brazil to continue the ongoing work with the BCB in improving the analytical quality of Brazil’s monetary aggregates. In October 2002 a government finance statistics mission provided recommendations for the implementation of GFSM 200 1. In the context of Fund surveillance, a mission from the Legal Department (LEG) and the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department (MAE) visited Brazil in October 1999 to review exchange regulations and discuss issues related to Brazil’s acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. As mentioned above, Brazil consequently accepted, effective November 30, 1999, the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-33 - APPENDIX I obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and abolished the two remaining restrictions that were identified. Two missions from MAE visited Brazil in January and February 2000, respectively, to assess compliance with the Base1 Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, and to assess the observance of the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies (Code). The former mission was carried out jointly with the World Bank. XI. Resident Representative The Fund maintains a resident representative office in Brasilia.

These goals require priority for a stronger push on primary and in particular secondary education, a focus on improving the system of transfers to reduce inequality, and higher productivity growth through fiscal balance, less red tape, and more trade. These priorities imply difficult choices: to empower people; to channel social spending to the poorest; to generate growth through private-sector productivity; and to use natural resources in a sustainable way. The World Bank Group is implementing its Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in support of this vision for Brazil. The program includes programmatic adjustment lending, investment lending, analytic and advisory activities, and the operations of IFC and MIGA. The Board discussed the 2002 CAS Progress Report on June 13,2002. The next full CAS will be presented to the Bank’s Board around August/September 2003. Five pillars guide the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy at the national and subnational level. They are the priorities in the development and implementation of the country program: 1. Investing in people. A large and increasing part of the Bank program is reserved for interventions considered essential for poverty reduction. The most important area is education, supported by the Bank through investment projects at the state and federal level as well as analytical work. The Bank also supports investments in public health care, rural poverty reduction, market-based land reform, urban services, water and sanitation, social protection, social spending reform, and labor market policy. 2. Growing through productivity. Stability and growth are especially intertwined in Brazil: growth promotes fiscal stability, which, in turn, brings down the cost of capital for investment. Bank assistance is directed to energy and transport infrastructure, the financial sector, private sector development, higher education, and science and technology. Investment loans are underpinned by programmatic sector adjustment lending supporting reforms in the financial sector and energy regulation. 3. Stabilizing the economy. The Bank has provided non-lending services on economic management and governance, including municipal capacity building and fiscal and financial management. Support of social security reform is an important part of the program, including advisory work, technical assistance, and lending both for investments and for policy reforms. 4. Delivering government services to all. Participation of community associations in the implementation of Bank projects has proven effective in land reform, rural poverty reduction, water and sanitation, and urban projects.

Bank analysis has focused on gender issues and on fiduciary issues, including procurement and financial management. Managing Brazil’s natural inheritance. The Bank will continue to focus on the overlaps between environmental, poverty reduction, and growth objectives. The Bank’s environment program has two main objectives: (i) strategic focus in Brazilian environmental management, especially ecosystem protection, and (ii) the decentralization of environmental management and supporting emerging environmental constituencies. The program focuses on water resource management, soil conservation and land management, ecosystem protection in the Amazon, and the decentralization of environmental policy. Within its program of analytical support, the Bank has recently completed a Country Economic Memorandum, a study of growth policies for Brazil, a study on trade policy options, and a study on labor market policies. State economic memoranda for Piaui, Maranhgo, and Rio Grande do Norte have recently been completed. A study of municipal spending on education, including the Fundefeducation fund, has also been completed. The Bank is completing a study on the causes and effects of inequality. Bank and Fund have shared responsibility in a joint Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) initiated in October 2001 and recently completed. The exercise aimed at assessing the vulnerabilities of Brazil’s financial system, its development needs, and the implementation of relevant financial standards. It has been highly welcomed by the Brazilian authorities and identified important areas for improvements. The Bank prepared a series of Policy Notes for the incoming administration to summarize the Bank’s international policy experience, as well as its understanding of the challenges facing Brazil. They were presented as contributions to the new Government and now serve as the basis for the policy dialogue and communication of the Bank’ positions in the areas of: (1) Education, (2) Health, (3) Social Protection, (4) The Financial Sector, (5) Infrastructure Provision and Regulation, (6) Private Sector Development, (7) Innovation and Knowledge, (8) Forest Development and Conservation, (9) Rural Development and Natural Resources, (10) Municipal and Urban Management and Housing, (11) Water and Sanitation, (12) Macroeconomic Stability, (13) Fiscal Sustainability, and (14) Governance and the Public Sector. The Bank has an active portfolio of 52 ongoing projects and US$5 billion in loans to Brazil. There are US$272 million in Bank-managed trust funds, including the Global Environment Facility and the Rainforest Trust Fund, administered through an additional 14 donor-financed projects. The average project age is four years and about half of active loans are direct to States rather than to the Federal Government. Annual investment project disbursements are between US$O.5 billion and US$l billion. Under the present CAS, annual lending reaches up to US$1.7 billion. Investment projects are designed to improve the quality and impact of public expenditures. Bank Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - APPENDIX II lending is concentrated on targeted poverty reduction and on investments in the poorest Northeast region, where they constitute a significant share of spending. The Bank continuously seeks to leverage, replicate, and scale up projects. This requires an increased focus on knowledge, partners, and synergies with IFC and MIGA. On August 9,2002, the Bank announced that it could recommend to its Board an increase in the lending program by up to US$2 billion through December 2003. This would be above the annual lending ceiling of the Country Assistance Strategy of US$1.7 billion. The Bank’s increased support would be based on an agreement with the Government on policy reforms that will keep Brazil on the path for stability and growth. Recent adjustment lending has been for financial sector reforms, energy sector reforms, and fiscal reforms. The second programmatic financial-sector adjustment loan (US$400 million), covering banking and corporate reforms, was approved in June 2002. Technical assistance support in these areas continues. An energy-sector adjustment loan (US$450 million), addressing key regulatory issues in the sector, was also approved at the same time. A complementary technical assistance loan is being prepared. The first programmatic fiscal reform adjustment operation (US$750 million) was approved by the Board in FYO 1, and a second loan is under preparation. A complementary technical assistance program covering budget, financial, and debt management reforms is underway. New adjustment operations would play a key role to: (a) continue and deepen key sectoral reforms; (b) finance part of the nominal fiscal deficit and the external financing requirements of the public sector; and (c) signal to the markets the commitment of the new administration to sound economic and sectoral policies. The specific areas being considered for increased financing to support reforms and investments are: (i) Fiscal policy, including the consolidation of fiscal responsibility, social security, and tax reforms; (ii) Human development, including consolidation and broadening of recent achievements in education, health and social protection; (iii) Environmental management, including improved enforcement of environmental policy and systematic application of environmental policies; (iv) Financial sector, including the institutionalization of monetary responsibility and banking system safety; and (v) Regulatory framework to improve competitiveness and the investment climate to increase growth and exports. As the first Loan to Brazil under its new Government, a First Human Development Programmatic Sector Reform Loan (HD PSRL) was approved on February 25, 2003. This Loan supports an ongoing program of human development reforms that tackles core sectoral issues of targeting, resource allocation, and efficiency of spending. The Program includes, in addition to the Loan in question, up to two further loans depending on the pace and depth of future reform implementation, for a total of US$l.5 billion and a new US$l5 million companion Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) to facilitate the monitoring of achievements and the design and implementation.

Both of the loans approved in 1999 have a repayment period of five years and a grace period of three years. The interest rate is LIBOR + 400 basis points and a 0.75 percent commitment fee and a one-time service charge of 1 percent applies. There is no national counterpart requirement. The basic features of each operation are described below: Sectoral loan for social protection and reform This program included support for programs being implemented and was aimed at improving the efficiency and targeting of social spending-programs which constitute Brazil’s social safety net-as well as funding for new reforms in health, education, labor, and social welfare. The conditionality of the tranches was based on the continued satisfactory execution (material and financial) of the selected programs, and on progress in implementing social policy. This program receives partial funding from the World Bank. After an extended analysis by its Social Affairs Committee, the Federal Senate approved this loan in October 1999. The contract was signed on November 5, 1999 and disbursement of the first tranche (US$l .122 billion) was immediately disbursed. The second tranche (US$660 million) was disbursed on April 2000, and the third and last tranche (US$418 million) was disbursed on December 2000. Multisector credit This program aimed at increasing credit available to small- and medium-sized enterprises and supplemented the program approved in September 1998 for the National Economic and Social Development Bank (BNDES). The loan contract for this program was signed on July 28, 1999 and was completely disbursed by December 2000. ’ Prepared by the staff of the IDB. Reflects information as of February 13,2003.

There are also 6 loans to the private sector for US$399 million; 44 technical assistance projects, with a total budget of US$38.0 million; 9 microprojects totaling US$4.2 million, and 22 operations of the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) for US$29.6 million. The IDB’s strategy in Brazil comprises four areas for action: (i) public sector reform and modernization of government at all levels; (ii) opening up the economy and modernization of the productive sectors, and reduction of Brazil cost; (iii) poverty reduction and provision of basic social needs; and (iv) the environment and natural resources. The basic sectoral composition of the lending program is set out below, in accordance with the four strategic areas. It should be noted that the majority of the programs contribute to progress in more than one of the strategic areas.

In general, Brazil’s statistical base is broadly adequate for surveillance. Nevertheless, weaknesses in some areas hamper policy analysis and formulation. In particular, the national accounts suffer from inadequate data sources on the expenditure components of GDP, and the timeliness of public sector statistics outside the federal government need to be improved. The authorities need to develop further their strategy to implement the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSA42001). Although statistics on money and banking, balance of payments, and external debt are generally good, the classification of some data needs to be improved. National accounts National accounts are compiled in accordance with the System of National Accounts 1993. The annual GDP estimates are generated from supply and use tables, which ensures that the estimates are consistent. A problem with these estimates is the lack of sufficient time series for source data, which requires compilers to rely extensively on extrapolation techniques using levels from the 1985 base year, the last year for which economic censuses were conducted. With these data, there is a strong possibility of price assessment errors due to the high inflation that prevailed until mid- 1994, that may affect the accuracy of current-price GDP estimates. Work is being conducted for updating the benchmark year estimates for the national accounts. Quarterly estimates of GDP (both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted), are compiled in current and constant prices using the production and the expenditure approach. The authorities have published annual national accounts through 200 1, and these are published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Since September 2000, the statistical office began publishing quarterly GDP estimates by the production approach. Starting on September 200 1, a breakdown of quarterly GDP by expenditure components is also published. Prices Starting in July 1999, the Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) compiled by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) is the official consumer price index. The IBGE, the private Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), and the University of Sao Paulo all prepare their own consumer price indices with a different coverage of regions and population groups. The IPCA covers the movement of prices of goods and services purchased by households in 11 metropolitan areas. The weights applied in the calculation of the index are based on the 1995-96 household budget survey. Wholesale price indices are published only by the FGV. Wholesale and consumer price indices are reported regularly for publication in the IFS. The export price data reported for publication in the IFS are total unit values of exports and unit values and wholesale prices of coffee exports. A producer price index is not yet compiled, but could be introduced in 2002.

It recommended centralization of the overall responsibility for fiscal statistics in a single coordinating agency and establishment of an inter-institutional committee to discuss GFSM 2001 technical issues. It prepared a draft implementation strategy distinguishing recommendations that could be taken in the short-term from longer-term recommendations to be considered by the new administration. Monetary and financial sector data Several missions from the Statistics Department (STA) visited Brazil during 1998-2001 to provide technical assistance on monetary and financial statistics. The missions found that some problems remained in the sectorization of certain financial system accounts, which undermined the accuracy of the monetary aggregates and the consistency with external and fiscal accounts. STA agreed with the authorities on an action plan to improve the classification of monetary accounts by sector and by instrument. The missions also highlighted the importance of expanding the coverage of depository corporations survey data to include financial investment funds and cooperatives, and to expand the coverage of the financial corporations survey to include pension funds and insurance companies. The authorities have advised STA that they are in the process of including the financial investment funds within the-depository corporations survey. The BCB revised the national definitions of money in accordance with international practices and started publishing time series on monetary aggregates on an internationally comparable basis beginning in August 200 1. Balance of payments Brazil has recently begun to provide balance of payments information according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The BCB is supplementing the registry of the foreign exchange system with surveys to compile data on transportation and insurance services. Compilation of reinvested earnings and undistributed branch profits in the current account is deficient, in part because the registry of the foreign exchange system does not capture these transactions. For international reserves, the BCB has introduced accrual accounting for interest on bonds included in international reserve assets, valuation adjustments arising from exchange rate changes are now excluded from reserves, and monetary gold is valued at the London market price on the day of the transaction. On June 2002, Brazil disseminated annual data on the international investment position pertaining to 200 1. Quarterly balance of payments data are reported regularly for publication in the IIFS.

Both were observed prior to September 30, 2001. Statistical benchmarks will be reassessed and amended as necessary during reviews of the program.

The main factor underlying the movements in the debt ratio was the nominal exchange rate volatility experienced during the year (see Figure 1). However, higher inflation resulted in a reduction in the debt ratio in the fourth quarter. 2. In addition to movements in the overall size of the debt, there were also significant changes during the year in its composition. As a result of the depreciation Rgure 2.

In addition, due to financial market instability and reduced appetite for government instruments partly due to mark-to-market requirements, the government shortened maturities 30 during the year (see Figure 2). Average Maturity of Newly Issued Debt in Months (right axis) Share ofDebt Coming Due Within 12 Months (left axis) 301 2 01 Medium-term outlook 3.

Under these assumptions, the debt is expected to rise slightly in 2003 to 57 percent of valorized GDP although will decline dramatically as a share of nominal GDP following the sharp rise in 2002 (see Figure 3).

Throughout the projection period, debt ratios relative to nominal GDP differ from the usual methodology in Brazil of expressing debt relative to valorized GDP. Valorized GDP is calculated by valuing the flow of nominal GDP at end-period IGP-DI prices2. The IGP-DI is a price index that contains a large proportion of tradables and therefore, whenever the exchange rate depreciates significantly as it did in 2002, the IGP-DI accelerates. This rapid increase in the IGP-DI resulted in a large increase in valorized GDP during the year and thus a relatively smaller debt ratio. In addition, the divergence between the nominal GDP deflator and IGP-DI index (see Figure 5) results in a sizeable divergence between the behavior of debt expressed as a ratio of valorized GDP and that as a ratio of nominal GDP in 2002. 6. It should also be noted that, largely as a result of the recently announced increase in the primary surplus, the forecast of public sector net debt has improved relative to the last review (see Figure 6). While this is a reassuring trend, it is highly dependent on the macroeconomic assumptions underlying the program forecasts. A sensitivity analysis of this central scenario is, therefore, an important component of any debt sustainability analysis. Sensitivity analysis Figure 6. Public Sector Net Debt 7. As is well known, Brazil’s debt is vulnerable to changes in the key macroeconomic parameters-the exchange rate and SELIC interest rate in particular. Figure 7 shows that, relative to the baseline forecast with a 4% percent primary, the impact of a 10 percent shock to the nominal exchange rate, a 1 percent permanent increase in the SELIC, or a 1 percent permanent decline in real growth. Figure 8 shows the same picture but scaling the impact of the shocks relative to historical outturns. In particular the figure shows the effect of a 2 Expressing debt as a ratio of valorized GDP aims to make the stock numerator comparable with the flow denominator (by revaluing the flow at end-of-period prices). Nevertheless, the theoretical argument for revaluing the flow at IGP-DI prices-an index with a high tradable component-is less clear and acts to wash out the impact of exchange rate movements on the debt ratio; using the GDP deflator would perhaps be a more neutral methodology. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDIX V permanent one standard deviation shock to each of the key macroeconomic variables.3 It should be noted that the historical volatility of the real SELIC (relative to the IGP-DI) is very high in Brazil ranging from 6-7 percent following the floating of the real to negative 6 percent in 2002. As a result, a one standard deviation shock to the SELIC has an extremely large effect on the size of the debt.4 Figure 8.

Impact of Permanent Shocks on Net Debt by 2006 8. Of course, it is likely that if Brazil were to receive an external shock these variables would deteriorate in tandem. Figure 9 shows a combined negative scenario in which the currency depreciates to R$4.0 by end-2003, real interest rates rise by 4 percent to offset inflation, and real growth falls by 1 percent. A permanent shock of this scale would result in a debt ratio that rises in 2003 due to the exchange rate depreciation and remains constant at a little over 60 percent of GDP. Figure 9.

Insurance Against Shocks From A Higher Primary Surplus -Shock to Real Exchange Rate (4.25 p&u-y) i -b-Shock to Real SELIC (4.25 primary) i *Shockto Real Growth (4.25 primaty) I 9. One way to view the government’s decision to increase the primary surplus is through an insurance analogy. In particular, the government’s actions can be viewed as a prudent fiscal authority purchasing an insurance policy-through a tighter fiscal stance-to guard against vulnerability to external shocks. Figure 10 compares the path of government debt if Brazil were to continue with a primary fiscal target of 3% percent of GDP to the debt path with a primary surplus of 4% percent of GDP and separate one-standard-deviation shocks to the key macroeconomic variables. Relative to a scenario with a 33/ percent primary surplus, the higher primary would fully offset a permanent one standard deviation shock to the real exchange rate and would offset about one-half of the impact of a similar shock to growth. However, given the large volatility in the real SELIC, the higher primary balance is not sufficient to offset a one standard deviation shock to real interest rates (given the volatility in real interest rates following the floating of the real>. While clearly a higher primary would provide greater protection against shocks, it should be borne in mind that such a level of economic insurance would likely prove costly in limiting the government’s ability to pursue its policy objectives and would again delay the benefits of reform for the poor. Concluding remarks 10. The recent increase in the primary surplus proposed by the government was a welcome development in signaling its commitment to ensure that the debt dynamics remain on a sound footing. While the authorities medium-term target has yet to be announced, if we assume a primary surplus over the medium-term that is equal to that announced for 2003, public sector net debt will decline to close to 50 percent of valorized GDP by the end of this administration’s tenure. Clearly, the debt dynamics remain vulnerable to shocks to key macroeconomic variables (interest rate, growth, and the real exchange rate). However, in this regard, it is important that the government has reaffirmed its commitment to react to shocks and generate primary surpluses over the medium term necessary to ensure a steady reduction in government debt. 4 Although, it should be noted that the historical standard deviations are not necessarily a good guide to the prospects for shocks in the future.
