Introduction and Summary of Issues The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Dhaka during October 28- November 6, 1995. The staff team’ met with Minister of Finance M. Saifin Rahman, Finance Secretary Nasimuddin Ahmed, Governor of Bangladesh Bank Khorshed Alam, and other officials, as well as representatives of the private sector and banks. Bangladesh has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. A prolonged period of political instability is adversely affecting economic policy. Elections held on February 15, 1996 were boycotted by the main opposition parties, which have demanded Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s resignation and new elections under a caretaker administration. As indicated above, the discussions on which the present staff report is based were held with the previous administration in late 1995. Since then, principally because of the political developments, it has not been possible to hold follow-up substantive discussions on the policy strategy for carrying forward the many structural reforms identified in this paper. Never- theless, and in view of the fact that the last consultation was concluded in February 1995, it is proposed to proceed with the present consultation. This would allow Executive Directors the opportunity to consider the scope and sequencing of reforms that are needed to forestall further deterioration to macroeconomic stability and to revive the reform process. At the last consultation, Executive Directors underscored the importance of preventing slippages in financial policies so as to safeguard macroeconomic stability. A key theme of the last consultation was why Bangladesh, despite the record of stabilization, had not achieved significantly higher growth and improved social indicators. Directors were in broad agreement that continuing and deep-seated structural factors remained the chief impediment to higher investment and output growth. To create the conditions for a significant acceleration of growth and a reduction of poverty, Directors stressed that a more vigorous implementation of reforms, particularly of the financial sector and public enterprises, would be essential. Since the last consultation, macroeconomic performance has deteriorated and excess demand pressures have mounted. In addition, the political impasse has diverted attention from many of the pressing structural reforms identified in the last consultation. The key macro- economic issues are: (i) determining the appropriate adjustments to fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies to preserve macroeconomic stability; and (ii) identifying the structural reforms--within a medium-term framework--that should be pursued. Core minimum data are reported--in most cases--on a regular basis. However, significant weaknesses persist, including in the quality and timeliness of data for the national accounts, consumer prices, and central government and public enterprise finances.

Report on the Economic Situation and Strategy The macroeconomic stability achieved in the early 1990s suffered erosion in 1994/9.P and early 1995196. Economic growth remains in the CSpercent range. A. Policy Context Since independence in 1971, but particularly in recent years, adjustment measures were aimed at achieving sustained economic growth and development to reduce poverty and absorb the rapidly growing labor force. Given the huge challenges--a vast population and widespread poverty, low social indicators, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to adverse weather and other shocks--the Bangladesh economy has made notable headway since the early 1980s. In terms of industrial structure, financial deepening, and openness of the economy, Bangladesh has narrowed the gap with South Asia and, in some respects, including inflation and external indicators, compares well with other developing countries (Charts 1 and 2). These achievements have been the result of reforms since the mid- 198Os, and particularly in the early 199Os, focused on prudent financial policies, improving the fiscal structure, financial liberalization, and trade and exchange systems reform. However, saving and investment performance--and, thereby, GDP growth--have remained behind many other economies, especially in East Asia (Chart 3). Moreover, despite a reduction in population growth, the GDP growth rate of about 4 percent has not significantly alleviated poverty, which still afflicts nearly one half of the population.3 The central challenge for Bangladesh is how to raise the growth rate to 7-8 percent, which is the minimum needed to significantly raise per capita income and effectively address the problems of pervasive poverty. In determining why Bangladesh has not already achieved a markedly higher growth rate, attention has focused on policy shortcomings to explain the relatively low investment and savings ratios, particularly against the background that a broad measure of macroeconomic stability had been achieved by the early 1990s. The low level of investment, particularly private investment, has been a major concern, and investment regulations were eased significantly in the early 1990s. The Government’s strategy--supported until 1993 by SAF and ESAF arrangements--was to pursue a range of structural reforms to encourage investment, while at the same time achieving macroeconomic qiscal year begins July 1. 3The forthcoming paper on selected issues for the Article IV consultation will include a chapter on poverty, as well as chapters on issues in agricultural policy, the implementation of the Annual Development Program, estimates of demand for money, and the impact of the Uruguay Round.

However, these reforms have been too slow or have not been sufficiently far reaching in key areas to achieve the critical mass of reforms that would achieve the breakthrough to significantly higher investment and growth.4 The continuing failure to observe a marked pickup in investment has been attributed, in particular, to a wait-and-see attitude of the private sector, including by foreign investors, to ensure that both macroeconomic stability and structural reform are firmly rooted before funds were committed, and high interest rates, reflecting serious problems in the banking system. B. Economic Developments and Policies Through 1994/95 The authorities were successful in achieving macroeconomic stability in the early 1990s. Inflation fell to 3 percent in 1993/94, the external current account deficit narrowed sharply, and foreign exchange reserves increased to the equivalent of 7 months of imports (Table I and Chart 4). Although a relatively stable external environment helped--and export performance was strong--this achievement can be attributed in the main to prudent financial policies. The reduction in the central government deficit was relatively modest--2 percent of GDP between 1989/90 and 1993/94--but was sufficient to keep domestic financing of the central government low. The fiscal adjustment was largely due to higher revenues--with improved structure reflecting the introduction of VAT and tariff reform--but resulted also from difficulties in stepping up public infrastructure spending. Monetary policy was accommodating, but with little demand for credit--as private sector activity remained subdued--growth in money demand was met largely by increases in foreign exchange reserves. The growth rate in the early 1990s remained stubbornly in the 4-5 percent range. Based on the experience of other countries, the improved macroeconomic policies through 1993/94 would have been expected eventually to yield a marked increase in long-term economic growth as a result of both faster capital accumulation and higher productivity growth. Indications are that Bangladesh’s total factor productivity growth may have picked up to about 1 percent per annum, an improvement from the very low levels observed in the 1980s. In contrast, the investment/GDP ratio--despite the increase to 14 percent by 1993/94--remained very low, with private investment at only 7 percent of GDP. From the perspective of savings-investment balances, an improved savings performance by both public and private sectors supported the small increase of 2 percentage points in the investment/GDP ratio and allowed a significant narrowing of the external current account deficit--from about 7 percent of GDP in 1989190 to an unusually low level of less than 2 percent in 1993/94. The reasons for the improvement in private sector savings during the early 1990s are not yet fi.rlly clear. Since several possible explanations--including significant changes in the ‘See, for example, the analysis presented in “Bangladesh--Background Information on Output and Investment Performance” (SM/95/16, l/25/95) and “The Response of Investment and Growth to Adjustment Policies--Lessons from Eight Countries” (EBS/95/162, g/29/95).

The authorities’ aims for 1994/95--to support GDP growth ofjust over 5 percent, keep inflation to 4 percent, and fbrther strengthen the balance of payments--were thwarted by supply constraints and a rapid credit expansion in the second half of the year. Nonagricultural output rose by 6% percent, reflecting the steady growth of private manufacturing and construction. In particular, the authorities pointed to the expansion of the garment sector and many small industries, in response to policies enacted in the early 199Os, which offset the declines in traditional jute and cotton textile sectors. However, foodgrain output fell sharply--by about 6 percent--following droughts. As a result, GDP growth slowed to just over 4 percent. Real domestic demand growth increased to over 6 percent in 1994/95, reflecting expansion of both consumption and investment. Although exports--led by garments--recovered very strongly from the disappointing performance in 1993194, imports surged. The external current account deficit widened sharply to 3 ‘/4 percent of GDP. With little change in net capital inflows, the overall balance of payments surplus declined. Gross official reserves peaked at $3.5 billion (7 months of imports) in April 1995, and fell back thereafter (Chart 5). Excess demand pressures were quickly reflected also in sharply higher inflation. A new consumer price index, based on 1985/86 with broader geographical and income coverage, increased from about 3 percent in 1993/94 to almost 9 percent in 1994/95, affecting not only food, in the wake of shortages, but also nonfood and nontraded items. Strong growth in domestic demand reflected the stance of both fiscal and monetary policies. The revenue/GDP ratio--at just over 11 percent--remained almost as budgeted and little changed over three years (Table 2). Tax revenues were boosted by buoyant VAT receipts, reflecting higher consumption and construction activity, which helped compensate for the impact of reduced tariff and income tax rates. Overall, fiscal policy was expansionary and the central government deficit increased from 5% percent of GDP in 1993194 to 6% percent in 1994/95, as a result of high spending in three areas: (i) current expenditure was higher than targeted, owing in part to an unbudgeted government wage increase; (ii) the turnaround in the food account to a sizable deficit reflected largely the Government’s intervention in the marketing of rice following the drought; and (iii) Annual Development Program (ADP) expenditure rose to a record 8 percent of GDP, with a lower share than in previous years financed by aid. With foreign financing of the central government remaining at 4% percent of GDP, domestic financing, especially bank credit, increased sharply. Monetary policy was accommodating. Private sector credit grew by 24 percent in 1994195 after several years of slow growth, with credit growth for construction and trade finance particularly high (Table 3). Broad money growth--which had been very high--slowed to 16 percent by June as increased domestic demand and food shortages were reflected in higher imports and lower foreign exchange reserves (Table 4).

However, these rates remained negative in real terms, and were insufficient to rein in credit expansion. Exchange rate policy remained unchanged in 1994/95. In recent years, to maintain competitiveness, the taka/U.S. dollar rate has been adjusted periodically to prevent an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate. However, adjustments were not made to prevent the moderate real effective depreciation of the taka that occurred, given the weakness of the dollar and, until 1994/95, the relatively low inflation in Bangladesh. In 1994/95, the taka depreciated in nominal effective terms by 6 percent, and in real effective terms was little changed (Chart 5). The maintenance of a constant taka/U.S. dollar rate in the face of upward market pressure on the taka for most of the year led to a continued buildup in official reserves. Since April 1995, however, the maintenance of a stable taka/U.S. dollar rate--except for minor adjustments--in the face of excessive credit growth and strong demand for imports, including for food, led to a steady loss of reserves. Structural reforms progressed very slowly, if at all, in 1994/95. Although some steps were taken to improve banking regulation and supervision, restructuring of insolvent banks had yet to begin. Public enterprise reform and privatization were put on hold, implying a continued substantial burden on the budget and the banking system. The maximum tariff rate was reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent and the preshipment inspection (PSI) scheme was expanded, leading to a sharp fall in the assessed values of some imports. C. Prospects and Policies in 1995/96 Against a more difficult political background, there was a marked deterioration in macroeconomic performance in the first few months of 1995196. Although the outlook for the year was affected by the carryover of excess demand conditions, the authorities hoped that the announced fiscal and monetary policies would be sufficiently tight to meet their targets-- achieving a higher GDP growth of 5% percent, holding inflation to 4 percent, and maintaining a strong balance of payments. Major structural measures would not be taken until after the elections. The fiscal stance in the 1995/96 budget remained expansionary, with relatively low revenue growth and a continued rapid increase in ADP spending, implying a central government deficit rising to 6% percent of GDP. Tax revenues were projected to grow by less than nominal GDP, owing to further reductions in tariffs and corporate income tax rates that were not offset by improvements in coverage and administration. Moreover, some of the tax changes tended to weaken the fiscal structure, including the extension of tax holidays and exemptions from value- added tax (VAT) on selected items.

A large food account deficit was expected, given the rebuilding of stocks and a sharp increase in international prices. ADP spending was budgeted to increase to around 8% percent of GDP. As a result, net domestic financing was projected to remain close to 2 percent of GDP, even after assuming an increase in foreign aid. In the authorities’ monetary program, the growth of broad money was projected at 13 ‘/4 percent (year-on-year), based on targeted growth and inflation rates and a trend decline in velocity. Sales of BB bills would remain the main policy instrument. However, it was unclear to what extent the authorities were prepared to tighten monetary conditions such that credit growth was reduced substantially, as implied by the monetary program. The staff team cautioned that policies were not in place to achieve the authorities’ fiscal and monetary programs, and that additional measures would be needed. In the event, there were policy slippages, rendering the macroeconomic situation even more difficult. Fiscal and monetary policies became more expansionary than programmed. Inflation remained high, the external current account deficit widened further, reflecting weakening growth of exports--particularly garments--and worker’s remittances, as well as much higher imports, including food imports making up for crop shortages. Foreign exchange reserves fell from $3.1 billion in June 1995 to $2.2 billion by November. Despite strong revenues in the first quarter, net credit to the central government was sharply higher than targeted, reflecting a higher taka component of ADP outlays and some spending that has yet to be identified. Private sector credit expanded by 29 percent in the year to November. Moreover, the stock of outstanding BB bills fell, injecting credit to the banks, as interest rates on these instruments were kept negative in real terms (Chart 6). Despite political instability, and the impact of floods (which may limit any rebound in the foodgrain harvest), the authorities noted that with some continued growth of industrial production, GDP growth could still reach 5 percent in 1995/96. Although the staff team agreed that some of the increased domestic demand was for investment that should help growth in later years, it was probable that consumption was also rising fast. Moreover, a continued rapid expansion of credit to both the private and public sectors would put strong downward pressure on reserves and further fuel inflation. Without policy correction, the staff team’s view was that the significant achievements of macroeconomic stability in the past few years could easily--and very quickly--be reversed.

Report on Policy Discussions Against the background of recent deterioration in macroeconomic performance, discussions focused on two core issues: (i) how to preserve macroeconomic stability with short-term action on fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies; and (ii) how to regain the momentum of structural reform. A. How to Preserve Macroeconomic Stability The authorities agreed with the staff team that a continuation of the recent trends could have very serious adverse consequences for the economy. In the period through the elections and until a new budget for 1996197 could be presented, the staff team recommended fiscal and monetary measures, combined with a move to a market-determined exchange rate policy, to reduce demand pressures and protect the reserve level. Although there was agreement on the urgent need for corrective measures to prevent any further erosion of financial stability, the authorities indicated that early implementation would be very difficult for political reasons. 1. Fiscal policy The staff team recommended limiting the central government deficit in 1995/96 to some 5% percent of GDP and net domestic financing to 1% percent of GDP. For this to be realized, it was desirable to increase the revenue effort by close to ‘/r percent of GDP from the budget target--in line with a desirable medium-term improvement. However, the authorities believed that an increase of only half of this was feasible, given the revenue loss from increasingly disruptive strikes. The revenue/GDP ratio would thus remain unchanged from 1994/95, and almost all of the burden of fiscal adjustment would fall on expenditures. The authorities agreed that a carefiA review of current expenditure was in order, but indicated that the budget target could be exceeded. There was increasing pressure for wage increases for civil servants and wage payments for public enterprises, and the food account deficit could also be significantly higher than budgeted. The authorities agreed that short-term fiscal adjustment would require targeting ADP expenditure at a more realistic level--the staff team suggested a level equivalent to some 87 percent of the budget target. To achieve this, priorities should be set with core projects--particularly infrastructure, human resource development, and social sectors--being pursued, and others being postponed or canceled, in line with advice from the World Bank. The staff team--while in principle in favor of a larger ADP-- expressed concern that some projects had not been fi.Aly appraised; the quality of projects could therefore be enhanced by tirther appraisal and prioritization. Finance Ministry officials indicated that pending a general cutback, they were delaying or vetoing many of the newly proposed ADP projects, despite increasing pressure.

Moreover, the less the fiscal adjustment made, the more reliance would need to be on monetary policy. Based on the recommended fiscal adjustment and a revised reserve target--keeping reserves to $2.6 billion by end-June 1996--lowering broad money growth to 1 1’/2 percent in 1995/96 would be consistent with holding inflation (new index) to 6 percent, while still providing room for real growth of private sector credit. Given the changing relationships between monetary aggregates and inflation, the targets of monetary policy would need to be reviewed frequently. In formulating a reserve money program to guide monetary operations in 1995/96, it was assumed that the currency/deposit ratio would return to a normal level (it was unusually high in 1994/95, possibly reflecting the negative real interest rates). In this case, the reserve money multiplier would rise and reserve money would need to be held very close to its September 1995 level through June 1996. To achieve this objective by mopping up remaining excess reserves and tightening monetary conditions, a substantial increase in sales of BB bills--the main instrument of policy--would be required, and the treasury bill auction should also be made fully functional. However, the authorities considered that the implied rapid rise in short-term rates to, say, 10 percent, and maybe more, would not be acceptable, although they intended to move gradually in that direction. In the meantime, they might consider more direct controls, including raising the statutory liquidity requirement (SLR). The staff team’s view was that this would be a retrograde step; to improve efficiency, a timetable should be introduced to phase out the SLR as well as to develop secondary markets for BB and treasury bills, to remove floors on deposit rates, and to eliminate the remaining bands on lending for agriculture, exports or cottage industries. The authorities would consider phasing out the SLR only over the medium term, and also found it difficult, in the present political environment, to eliminate the bands on lending rates, particularly that for cottage industries. 3. Exchange rate policy In the absence of a formal nominal anchor, the authorities in recent years have relied upon fiscal and monetary policies, in circumstances of subdued private demand, to keep inflation low. In the staff team’s view, the strategic move to money targeting to control inflation--which is under way--implied that exchange rate policy should move away from the present arrangements of targeting--however loosely--a real exchange rate, and the taka/U.S. dollar rate should become market-determined. In an economy subject to substantial structural changes, it would naturally be difficult to maintain a fixed nominal exchange rate level. The authorities in October 1995 had considered making a change to a market-based arrangement and announced the possibility to banks. They were motivated primarily by short- term considerations, namely the need to stem the reserve loss since April. The staff team urged that the move to a market-based regime, once decided, be made rapidly to dispel speculation of a depreciation that had been brought about by the earlier announcement. As for the modalities, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- the staffteam recommended that the exchange rate be determined in the interbank market, and that Bangladesh Bank intervene only to smooth out fluctuations. To minimize disorderly conditions, it was crucial that monetary policy be sharply tightened. The staff team’s view was that exchange restrictions and import controls--even temporary--should be ruled out; and reliance to control demand placed squarely on sound fiscal and monetary policies. The disavowal of trade and exchange restrictions to protect the balance of payments, in the present difficult conditions and following acceptance of Article VIII, would reaffirm the progress Bangladesh has made in economic policymaking. In the event, the authorities have refrained from taking action, except for very minor downward adjustments in the takaAJ.S. dollar rate, and the uncertainty surrounding the exchange regime may have contributed to a slowdown in export receipts and workers’ remittances. The authorities have preferred to avoid the uncertainty of a flexible exchange rate in the present political climate, and have instead applied moral suasion to banks to increase margin requirements for opening letters of credit for imports. Although not applied to all banks, and penalties for noncompliance were not specified, this move was seen by the authorities as contributing to some slowdown in import growth. However, bottlenecks at the port, the reimposition of official tariff values for some imports--effectively raising tariffs--and the slowdown in export orders also began to moderate the growth of imports.’ Regarding competitiveness, the staff team’s position was that, at least until recently, this had not been an issue. The real exchange rate had declined over a long period, supporting a strong export growth based on increasing diversification into new sectors. In the key garment sector, Bangladesh continued to fare well in international comparisons of costs of production. Thus, the recent slowdown in exports in 1995/96 could be reflective of sector-specific difficulties--such as the disruption to the shrimp sector by bad weather--renewed bottlenecks at the port, and general problems of confidence. Nevertheless , given the ongoing erosion to Bangladesh’s record of macroeconomic stability, competitiveness warranted close watching; developments affecting the Indian rupee would also have to be considered. B. How to Regain the Momentum of Structural Reforms The major medium-term task remains to implement a program of accelerated structural reform that will overcome the impediments to investment, place the economy on a path of 7-8 percent growth, and significantly improve Bangladesh’s social indicators.6 ‘The staff is assessing the jurisdictional implication of the guidelines for margin requirements, and is also looking into the status of outstanding balances under, and possible restrictive features of, bilateral payments agreements with the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. 6Annex I contains details of the medium-term macroeconomic framework. The staff report for the last consultation (M/94/295, 12/l 3/94) contained a comprehensive assessment of the structural reform agenda. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- The economy’s limited response to the recent increase in demand continues to reflect the pervasiveness of structural impediments to growth, including the problems of the banking system, the trade regime, the structure of taxes, and the continued large role of the public sector in production, as well as the implementation of public investment. In addition, in 1994/95, fertilizer distribution and pricing policies were widely seen as major impediments to agriculture, a sector that had benefited greatly from reforms in the early 1990s. While not disputing the need for further reform, the authorities did point to the substantial increase in investment registrations in 1995, in response to the reforms already introduced, which was seen as a leading indicator of an increase in capacity. If a higher growth path is to be attained, Bangladesh will need to achieve a substantially higher investment/GDP ratio (rising from less than 15 percent in 1994/95 to close to 20 percent early in the new decade), higher savings, greater efficiency in the use of resources, and major improvements in human resource development. Toward these goals, continued macroeconomic stability and availability of foreign aid inflows will be crucial, but not sufficient. The focus must increasingly fall on the range of structural reforms that are critical to encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign, and to reducing the role of the public sector. Moreover, the challenges facing Bangladesh to become more competitive will increase over time. Following the Uruguay Round agreement, the erosion of preferential access to European markets as well as new opportunities in other export markets will lead to greater competition Corn other low cost producers. The transition period provides the opportunity to ensure that the garment industry, in particular, remains competitive. In the absence of intensified reform efforts, it will be increasingly difficult for Bangladesh to maintain even the current rate of growth. The key elements of a comprehensive reform program that could lead to the desirable improvement in investment, savings, and growth, have remained essentially unchanged from previous years. They include: (i) reform of the financial system, including the restructuring of problem banks; (ii) public enterprise reform and privatization; (iii) a further improvement in the fiscal structure; (iv) further trade liberalization; and (v) labor, legal, and public administration reforms. The authorities agreed that reforms in all these areas were required and they looked forward to working with the Fund, the World Bank, and other donors in formulating a new reform program. While the groundwork for financial sector reform was progressing, major reforms in this area, as well as public sector reform and privatization, would have to await a stronger political consensus. In the first four of the areas noted, the authorities considered that substantial incremental measures would be feasible in 1996. Financial sector reform has been pursued for many years and further steps were taken in 1994/95, including improvement in regulations and bank supervision. Agreements were reached between Bangladesh Bank and several commercial banks aimed at enhancing capital adequacy and loan recovery. Efforts were also made to compel inside borrowers (bank directors) to repay their overdue loans. Loan classification and provisioning standards, and capital adequacy requirements, were upgraded. Despite these efforts, very serious problems remain. The ability ofBangladesh Bank to enforce its rulings is one important issue. Moreover, although extensive Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- background work is under way, little progress has been made in resolving problem loans or in restructuring the banking sector--which is seriously undercapitalized based on the authorities’ loan classification and provisioning standards, and is largely insolvent based on more stringent international standards. Under these circumstances, the authorities requested technical assistance from MAE and initiated discussions toward a comprehensive reform package with the World Bank. The continued very high spreads, adversely affecting investment and savings, are testimony to the need for speedy reform. The potential fiscal cost increases with delays in reform. The staff team stressed that for the reform to be successful, measures must be taken to ensure that banks would: (i) restore their capital adequacy and, at least, break even immediately following the restructuring; and (ii) prevent the same problems from recurring. The first objective would require recapitalization efforts much larger than currently envisaged, and the authorities should be prepared to determine who would bear the cost. To achieve the longer- term objective, measures must be put in place to improve bank management, loan recovery through the legal system, and training, and to enable Bangladesh Bank to move swiftly and decisively to exercise authority. The privatization of state banks should be accelerated. The stafFteam emphasized that it would be crucial for the credibility of reform that no loan write-offs were declared in the coming months, and any relief, for example in the wake of floods, should be provided through the budget. The authorities agreed that a comprehensive reform of the public enterprise sector was long overdue. A major cause of the problems of the banking sector had been the burden imposed by inefficient public enterprises, despite the reform efforts for individual industries. Public enterprises continued to accrue large operating losses or reduced profits in 1994/95 caused, in part, by price controls by the Government. (For example, the Bangladesh Chemical and Industrial Corporation’s profits were reduced by the decision to sell fertilizer at below market prices.) The staff team suggested that, in the period ahead, a time-bound agenda of reform be formulated together with World Bank and AsDB staff. High priority should be given to restarting the reforms in the ener,g and jute sectors, and privatizing the textile sector. To further improve the fiscal structure, the staff team argued that further tax reforms, starting with the 1996197 budget, should be planned in line with the targeted increase in the revenue/GDP ratio by about */z percent of GDP a year over the medium term to contribute to higher public savings. The main challenge would be to improve the efficiency of the tax system and introduce the structural changes in VAT and income taxes. In this context, any lowering of income tax rates would need to be matched by the removal of exemptions and of tax holidays. The coverage of VAT should be extended to sectors now being excluded (including textiles and agriculture) and to selected distribution sectors. Other measures would include ,lower thresholds, improved administration and enforcement, and an increase in the turnover tax. The authorities argued that the expansion of the tax base was constrained by a loss-making public sector (including public enterprises and banks), the small size of businesses, and weak inf?astructure and administration, and favored an increase of only about ‘/4 percent of GDP per year. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - The staff team pointed out that a comprehensive review of public expenditure--now being conducted with the World Bank--should help to ensure that budget allocations--both current and ADP--would be most likely to encourage growth, including allocations to health and education. Consideration should also be given to expanding social safety nets, as well as retrenchment and training programs, to facilitate restructuring the public sector. Progress has been made in trade reform in recent years, with reduction in the average tariff rates and removal of most nontariff barriers. However, important distortions remain. The staff team urged that the remaining trade-related quantitative restrictions (mainly in the textile sector) be eliminated as a matter of priority. To reduce uncertainties and encourage private investment, it would be important to announce an ambitious timetable for further reduction in the level and dispersion of tariffs to bring Bangladesh closer in line with faster-growing developing economies; this should include reducing the maximum tariff to 30 percent in 1996/97, with further reductions thereafter, while also reducing the number of tariff bands, and moving away from the system of official assessment of tariff values. The authorities indicated that they would consider some further trade liberalization in the near future, although they would be unlikely to reduce the maximum tariff from the present 50 percent to 30 percent as soon as in the 1996/97 budget. C. Statistical Issues Despite improvements, long delays continue to be experienced in updating methodology, improving coverage and consistency, and in official publication of key economic and financial data. In recent months, there were delays in finalizing some key series, including updated CPI and national accounts, that hampered assessment of economic developments. The authorities indicated that they would continue to implement recommendations of the 1994 STA multisector mission and several follow-up missions, and would welcome new technical assistance from the Fund, AsDB, and other donors. IV. Staff Appraisal After successful macroeconomic stabilization in the early 1990s the Government’s focus rightly expanded to targeting a much higher medium-term growth rate--on the order of 7-8 percent. This is an indispensable element of any policy framework to begin to alleviate the poverty that still afflicts close to half the population. The breakthrough to this substantially higher growth rate has not yet been achieved, despite the efforts at structural reform. The greatest economic challenge facing Bangladesh thus remains to accelerate the design and implementation of a reform program that is sufficiently strong to place Bangladesh firmly on such an ambitious growth path. However, the maintenance of macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite for achieving higher growth, and the marked slippages from the significant achievements of the early 1990s must be corrected without delay. A political consensus to put priority on economic reform is of crucial importance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- Recent developments illustrate how quickly--in the context of a revival of private sector demand--insufficiently tight fiscal and monetary policies can pose a threat to hard-earned macroeconomic stability. The rapid rise in domestic and export demand in 1994/95, in the context of constrained supply, was met by an increase in inflation to a level not seen since 1990/91 and by a doubling of the external current account deficit. The fiscal revenue/GDP ratio has not been increased; expenditure has been substantially higher than is consistent with a prudent level of domestic financing; and monetary policy has become expansionary. In addition, there has been little or no progress in key aspects of structural reform, with privatization and public enterprise reform delayed, civil service reform stalled, and very serious problems remaining in the banking system. In sum, the prospects for a substantial takeoff in private investment and potential output remain stymied. Increasing political uncertainty has adversely affected performance and prospects for macroeconomic stability and reform. With a policy stance that is too loose, the prospect in 1995/96 is for an exacerbation of inflationary pressures and further erosion of the external position. The 1995/96 budget and monetary conditions are inconsistent with achieving the authorities’ inflation and external objectives, and the authorities now face a significant policy challenge. In short, immediate corrective action is required to reduce demand. The central government deficit in 1995/96 should be limited so that recourse to domestic financing does not exceed 1 ‘/z percent of GDP. The staff team would prefer that the revenue effort be increased, in line with the medium-term aim of increasing the revenue/GDP ratio. However, given the authorities’ views that even a modest revenue effort would be problematic, and the difficulties of containing current expenditure and the food account deficit, the short-term burden will inevitably fall on limiting taka-financed ADP. Targeting ADP expenditure to a maximum of some 87 percent of the budget target should be combined with prioritization--with the help of the World Bank--to emphasize human resource development and social sectors. In this way, ADP quality can be improved. A substantial increase in BB bill sales is also required to markedly tighten monetary conditions. Sharp increases in the bank rate and in market interest rates on bills to re-establish positive real interest rates would help rein in credit and money growth. Such monetary tightening would also stem pressure on the exchange rate. The staff supports a shift in exchange rate policy. A move to a market-determined arrangement should be decisive, thereby increasing transparency of policy and removing the speculation that now prevails and adversely affects exports and remittance receipts. At the same time, the moral suasion on banks to restrict import financing should be revoked; it can only lead to misallocation of resources and further inflationary pressures. In a longer-term context, a flexible market-determined exchange arrangement will complement the move to money targeting to achieve the inflation objective, and be appropriate to the changing structure of the economy. In the short term, such flexibility will help prevent further loss of reserves. To prevent any overshooting of a market-determined exchange rate, a substantial monetary tightening is necessary. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Turning to the medium-term challenge, Bangladesh will need to achieve a substantially higher investment/GDP ratio, higher savings, greater efficiency in the use of resources, and major improvements in human resource development. Although 1994/95 saw a welcome increase in the investment/GDP ratio, significant foreign direct investment flows are still elusive. This is a clear indication that efforts in areas where reform has been implemented have not yet gone far enough to reach the critical mass of reforms that will firmly establish private sector confidence and foreign investment, while reducing the role of the public sector. Acceleration of reform is essential. A time-bound plan of action should be agreed as soon as possible that, in the f&rework of a substantial tightening of financial policies, could be supported by the Fund (under the ESAF) as well as the World Bank, AsDB, and other donors. Financial sector reform has been pursued--with little success--for many years and remains vital to a fully functioning economy. The high costs of intermediation are discouraging both savings and investment, and the potential fiscal cost of the banking problems grows each year. Decisive reforms--including privatization of state banks and restructuring of insolvent banks--should be accelerated, improvements in regulation and supervision consolidated, and loan recovery enhanced by ensuring that the legal process will allow Bangladesh Bank to move swiftly to exercise authority. A renewed program of public enterprise reform and privatization-- supported by the World Bank and AsDB--should be a very high priority. The 1996/97 budget provides the opportunity to introduce further tax reforms in the context of a targeted increase by about % percent in the revenue/GDP ratio. Structural changes in VAT and income taxes are warranted, while the share of trade taxes is reduced. A comprehensive review of public expenditure will assist budgetary allocations--both in the current spending and in ADP--that are most likely to encourage growth, including by emphasizing health and education. Consideration should be given to expanding social safety nets, as well as retrenchment and training programs to facilitate restructuring the public enterprises and civil service. Progress has been made in trade policy in recent years, but elimination of remaining trade-related quantitative restrictions is overdue and an ambitious timetable for further reduction in the level and dispersion of tariffs is a priority. Identification of recent economic problems and effective surveillance have been hampered by weaknesses in statistics and in monitoring developments, particularly on inflation, GDP, and the position of the central government and public enterprises. Delays in producing updated CPI and national accounts data have also increased. The staff would urge that attention be given to producing timely and more accurate data. For most series, the data should be published regularly on a given schedule that is announced to the public. Technical assistance recommendations in improving the methodology and timeliness of series should be followed up, and further help provided where necessary. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bangladesh be held on the normal 12-month cycle.

Indeed, in studies presented to the Executive Board in 1995 (referred to on page 8, footnote 4), it was concluded that the remaining serious structural impediments continued to hinder a more robust private sector response, and reforms undertaken so far had been insufficient to generate investors’ confidence, both domestic and foreign. Against this background, any medium-term projections would critically depend on the Government’s commitment to forcefully implement reforms in the areas as suggested in this report. These reforms should aim at encouraging investment, raising national savings, and enhancing efficient use of available resources. Attempts should also be made to continue to focus on sectors where Bangladesh has a strong comparative advantage--an abundant and relatively inexpensive labor force. Other important assumptions underlying the medium-term scenarios presented in this annex, including maintaining financial stability, remain broadly the same as those in the last consultation. Under the reform scenario, the main macroeconomic objectives over the medium term would be to achieve a progressive acceleration in GDP growth to 7 percent by the end of the decade, which would allow a rise in per capita income and an absolute reduction in underemployment and poverty; to hold inflation to no more than 4 percent, broadly in line with intlation in trading partner countries; and to maintain gross international reserves at close to 4 months of imports. A significant shift would be required in the structure of the economy, including the expansion of outward-oriented labor-intensive industry. This would involve an acceleration of industrial sector growth to over 10 percent per annum, while agricultural output would grow at 2% percent. The balance of payments would remain structurally dependent on aid flows, although to a slowly diminishing degree. To achieve the GDP growth target, an increase in investment to 18 percent of GDP by the end of the decade, together with broad efficiency gains, would be required. Public investment is projected to be flat, while private investment, including foreign investment, would be expected to increase rapidly. To avoid undue pressure on the external accounts, this would need to be accompanied by a significant further increase in national savings. Public savings would rise by 3 percent of GDP over five years, while private sector savings would also increase in response to structural reform, including the effects of financial sector reform. The increase in public sector savings. would be achieved primarily through higher revenues, with tax revenues projected to increase by a further 2’/2 percent of GDP over the next five years. Both current (including the food account) and ADP expenditures would increase slightly as a share of GDP. The overall central government deficit is to decline from 6% percent of GDP in 1994/95 to about 4% percent by the end of the decade in order to keep recourse to net domestic financing low. This would, in turn, greatly facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, and allow sufficient room for the expansion of private sector credit. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - ANNEX1 The improved savings performance would be consistent with a decline in the current account deficit from close to 5 percent in 1995196 to less than 3 percent by the end of the decade. Aid inflows are assumed to increase by about 4 percent annually in U.S. dollar terms, slower than the rate of growth of nominal GDP. Thus, despite an increase in foreign direct investment--from a very small base--the capital account surplus would decline as a percentage of GDP. Debt and debt-service indicators would improve steadily. If macroeconomic stability is not maintained and reforms are not implemented forcefully, the recent gains in financial stability can be quickly eroded, with serious implications for investment and growth. Under the low-growth scenario, GDP growth would remain at about 5 percent per annum, underpinned by a low investment/GDP ratio. The sluggish revenue performance would contribute to low government savings, and even assuming an unchanged ADP/GDP ratio from 1995/96, this would imply that the central government deficit would remain at above 6 percent of GDP. With foreign financing/GDP falling steadily, net domestic borrowing would increase to 3 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. This, together with a continued loss-making public enterprise sector, would add further to imlationary pressures in the economy and could crowd out private sector growth. The balance of payments position would deteriorate, with the reserve/import coverage declining to a very low level. Bangladesh has maintained and, to some extent, improved its fiscal sustainability in recent years, owing primarily to a very high grant element in external financing and improved primary fiscal deficits. Over the medium term, under the reform scenario, Bangladesh would maintain fiscal sustainability relatively easily. However, a combination of lower GDP growth and much higher interest rates on external financing--although a small possibility--than envisaged would begin to challenge fiscal sustainability, requiring further reduction in the central government primary deficit. The prospect for maintaining fiscal sustainability would be complicated by potentially large budgetary costs arising from the need to recapitalize and restructure commercial banks and with public enterprise reform. (Potential costs of bank restructuring have not yet been included in the medium-term calculations.) Although preliminary sensitivity analysis suggests that fiscal sustainability will not be markedly affected, this needs to be monitored carefi.rlly. More generally, the projected tight fiscal position is required less for solvency criteria than to be consistent with the growth and inflation targets. Bangladesh has significantly improved its external position in recent years, with the external debt/GDP ratio and the debt-service ratio declining steadily. Over the medium term, Bangladesh would be able to service its external debt obligations comfortably, if the assumed official financing continues to be provided with a high degree of concessionality (long maturity and grace periods and a low interest rate). With the grant element of financing thus remaining high, the net present value of the debt-to-export ratio would decline from the present level of about 200 percent to about 100 percent by the end of the decade. The debt-service ratio would continue to be very low under both scenarios. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - l ANNEX I . Table 1.

In general, data are available on a timely basis through the Office of the Resident Representative, however there is generally a long reporting lag for data reported in official publications. In July 1994, a multisector statistics mission from the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) evaluated the quality of the macroeconomic statistics and recommended improvements in the operational database through the implementation of international methodological standards. The mission also sought to promote greater harmonization between SEA and STA databases to facilitate data reporting to the Fund. Progress by the authorities, however, has been slow in implementing the recommended improvements. The mission identified several general characteristics of data problems: (i) a lack of timely and reliable data in some sectors for monitoring economic and financial developments on a short-term basis; (ii) use of outdated samples and weighting systems to compile real sector indicators that fail to capture the impact of structural changes in the economy; (iii) use of alternative data sources and estimation method as preferred sources and methods are either unavailable or not current; and (iv) methodological inconsistencies across sectors. The present status of the data and suggestions for improvement are described by topic below. A. Real sector Bangladesh has a fairly complete system of real sector statistics. The national accounts have been published through 1993194 in the Monthly Stafistical Bulletin, prepared by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, and plans are under way to rebenchmark the accounts. However, there are shortcomings in the data. The accounts suffer from significant downward bias of the manufacturing and trade sectors due to undercoverage of small- and medium-size business establishments in the current 1984/85 benchmark, an underestimation of private consumption, and possible overestimation of value added from agriculture. The Fund staff have compiled a GDP series based on 1989/90 weights, but the official data have not yet been published on this basis. B. Prices Price series include the full complement of CPI, PPI, a wholesale price index, and unit value indices for external trade. All of the price series are in need of revision and updating. A follow-up mission in April 1995 by STA urged that the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics promptly publish its new CPI, which are rebased from 1973/74 to 1985/86 and now include a national CPI. The new CPI data on a 1985/86 basis were released in December 1995 in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin (dated June 1995). However, the CPI based on a 1973174 basis Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public1 -33 - ANNEX III . will be retained as the official inflation figure. Also, receipt of data from districts is very slow, in part due to a lack of computerization, and CPI data are still reported with a two- to three-month lag. In the future, when the results of the new and upgraded household expenditure survey (HES) become available, a major revision of the CPI would be appropriate. C. Government finance Budget estimates are prepared once a year. The main shortcomings are a lack of coordination and reconciliation of data among different sources, a lack of frequency and timeliness in data compilation, incomplete coverage of government transactions, and lack of central monitoring of government borrowing and debt. A recent follow-up mission by STA recommended that the 1995/96 budget adopt the new classification system consistent with the Fund’s government financial statistics (GFS) methodology and that the revised government finance data be available for July 1996. At present, Bangladesh does not report GFS to the Fund for publication in the GES Yearbook and KS. The STA database contains data for the budgetary central government for the period of 1973-89. D. Money and banking statistics The current reporting system for commercial banks, based on the recommendations of earlier STA technical assistance missions, is clear and well organized with a highly detailed book of guidelines for completing the report forms. Nevertheless, there are inconsistencies in the monetary data reported by the commercial banks to Bangladesh Bank that point to the need to modernize the infrastructure of the banking system through, inter alia, the introduction of a modem chart of accounts, increased training, and computerization of banks’ operations. The main deficiency is the inconsistency between the monetary and fiscal accounts, where the definition of the central government varies from consolidated central government in the monetary accounts to budgetary central government in the accounts of the Ministry of Finance. E. Balance of payments Balance of payments statistics are compiled on a quarterly basis with a lag of about two quarters. The basic data are derived primarily from exchange record data. With the liberal&ion of the trade regime and eventual abolition of exchange control, the usefulness of this source will diminish. Besides, exchange record data do not measure the actual availability of goods in the country during a particular period. In addition, both current and capital accounts data have serious coverage deficiencies and some classification problems. Several measures need to be taken to improve the data, including classification of standard components in conformity with the fifth edition of the Balance of PaymentsManual, shortening the reporting lag of official publications, which is still about six months, and in the long term, conducting enterprise surveys on a quarterly basis covering all major companies having significant services, income, transfer, and capital transactions with nonresidents.

Exchange Rate Arrangement Since August 13, 1979, the value of the taka has been pegged, within margins, to a currency-weighted basket. Until January 1, 1992, when the official and secondary exchange markets were unified, the authorities maintained a secondary market in which proceeds from workers’ remittances and most services and exports were sold. Since then, the taka has, in practice, remained little unchanged against the U.S. dollar. Beginning July 1995, however, four minor downward adjustments of the taka vis-a-vis the dollar, by a cumulative of 2% percent, were made, respectively, on September 10, October 1 and 27, 1995, and January 8, 1996. As of February 1, 1996, Bangladesh Bank’s selling and buying rates of the taka were Tk 40.9O/US$l and Tk 4l.lOAJS$l, and the selling and buying rates in the interbank market were Tk 41.093/US$l and Tk 41.095KJS$l.

Cumulative IDA commitments totaled $6.4 billion (net of cancellations) and IFC assistance was $22 million as of December 3 1, 1995. About 35 percent of IDA lending has been directed to the agricultural and energy sectors. Agricultural lending has aimed at increasing food production by the use of modem inputs, flood control, and input and output pricing policies that provide adequate incentives to farmers. Energy projects have concentrated on the development of natural gas resources and the expansion of power-generating and transmission facilities, including rural electrification. Industrial lending has sought to improve the efficiency of public sector enterprises and promote exports and efficient import-substituting industries. Infrastructure credits have focused on road maintenance and rehabilitation, and inland water transport. In 1993/94, IDA supported a major bridge project to link the poorer north-west to the rest of the country. Lending to the social sectors has emphasized primary education and skills development, and primary health care and family planning. IDA has also provided sector adjustment credits, including two industrial sector credits in 1986/87 and 1992/93, a 1988/89 energy sector credit, a 1989/90 financial sector credit, a 1991/92 public resource management credit, and a 1993/94 jute sector adjustment credit to achieve policy and institutional reforms. No new adjustment lending is planned in the near future. However, fbture sector investment operations will emphasize policy institutional reforms as a precondition for efficient use of new resources. About one third of new commitments will be for human resources, including general education and population and health. Agriculture and natural resources, energy, the financial sector, and infrastructure--much of it to benefit the rural poor--will account for most of the remainder of proposed new lending. IDA will also consider lending for micro-credit working through NGOs. IDA chairs the annual Bangladesh Aid Group meeting and IDA’s Resident Representative chairs regularly scheduled donor meetings in Dhaka. The next Aid Group meeting is scheduled to be held in Paris on July 11-12, 1996. ‘Prepared by World Bank staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38- ANNEXV Table la.

As of December 3 1, 1995, the AsDB had provided Bangladesh with 120 loans amounting to $4,675 million, and $107 million for 204 technical assistance grants for project preparatory and advisory services. The AsDB’s overall operation strategy for Bangladesh focuses on poverty reduction through equitable and sustainable growth and direct anti-poverty intervention. The medium- term priorities will be: (i) to foster a faster rate of economic growth through market orientation, increased domestic resource mobilization, accelerated human development, and improved infrastructure; (ii) to improve employment opportunities and access of the poor to basic social services; and (iii) to protect and improve the environment as well as natural resource management. In the agricultural sector, the AsDB’s current operation program is to promote better foodgrain management and crop diversification through improvement of water resources and rural infrastructure, including agricultural extension, increased involvement of private sector and NGOs, and better delivery of rural credit. In the energy sector, the program emphasizes the following areas: (i) reducing system losses; (ii) improving accounts receivables and rationalizing tariffs; (iii) reducing the role of the Government; and (iv) encouraging private sector participation. In the transportation sector, the AsDB is supporting reform of the railways through its Railway Recovery Program Loan, including restructuring and commercializing Bangladesh Railway, improving operation efficiency and reducing subsidies, and increasing private sector participation. In the industry and finance sectors, the AsDB supports the Government’s efforts in promoting domestic and foreign investment. In developing financial and capital markets, the AsDB has provided assistance to strengthen the Securities and Exchange Commission and has reviewed issues of the insurance policy. The AsDB intends to strengthen Bangladesh Bank’s supervision and regulatory role and supports the banking sector reform program. In the social sector, the AsDB focuses on the following areas: (i) increasing overall Government expenditure on education; (ii) allocating greater share of education budget to the lower level of education while improving cost recovery in higher education; (iii) rationalizing higher education and vocational education; and (iv) capacity building through decentralization. In the health services, the focus is on improving the health of women and children. ‘Prepared by the Asian Development Bank staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - ANNEXVI Table 1.
