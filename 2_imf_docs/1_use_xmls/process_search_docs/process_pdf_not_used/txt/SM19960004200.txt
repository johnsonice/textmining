Introduction and Summarv A staff team h/ visited Rome during December 5-18, 1995, to conduct the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions. The mission met Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury Dini, the Governor of the Bank of Italy, the Ministers of Budget, Finance, Industry, Labor, and Public Administration, other government officials, representatives of industry, the trade unions, and officials of financial institutions. Mr. Grilli (Executive Director) attended as an observer. Italy has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4; it maintains exchange restrictions vis-a-vis Iraq pursuant to U.N. resolutions. The timeliness, coverage, and quality of Italy's economic data are adequate for effective surveillance, despite certain weaknesses. At the last consultation, concluded on March 17, 1995, Executive Directors noted that rapid progress in fiscal consolidation was the central policy priority. While welcoming the headway being made in 1995, Directors believed that the 1995-97 fiscal plan was not ambitious enough. They recommended accelerating adjustment, setting targets consistent with the requirements of European integration. Directors expressed grave concerns about the risks of a resurgence of inflation, stemming mainly from the persistent weakness of the exchange rate. With the lira outside the ERM--and re-entry not being viewed as a viable option--Directors noted that the monetary authorities needed to help anchor expectations by building credibility in their commitment to price stability. A staff visit in May-June 1995 focused on the new three-year fiscal plan for 1996-98. In a follow-up letter to Prime Minister Dini, the Managing Director commended the determination with which the government was addressing Italy's long-standing public finance problems, noting the prospect of a better-than-budgeted outcome and a stabilization of the debt-to-GDP ratio already in 1995, as recommended by the Fund. Similarly, he expressed support for the greater ambition of the new three-year plan, which aimed to meet the Maastricht criterion of a fiscal deficit of less than 3 percent of GDP by 1998, then assumed to be the test date for early EMU participation. The 1995 consultation mission took place on the eve of a political crisis, with auspicious economic conditions and broadly positive policy developments contrasting with recurrent financial market tensions. The weakness of the lira has entailed sizable relative price movements which have made the recovery unbalanced, raising concerns over its sustainability and how quickly the recent surge in inflation will be reversed. With the political situation inducing a short-sightedness that could in time prove costly, the kev nolicv issues were: (i) how to ensure a more balanced economic expansion; and (ii) how to bring forward the credibility gains without which even the government's own fiscal targets would remain elusive. The mission argued that the appropriate response to both issues lies in an azzeressive strategy of frontloaded fiscal adjustment, supported by monetary, incomes and structural policies. Though difficult, and requiring political resolution, such a strategy is both highly desirable and doable. u Messrs.

Politics. oolicies. and financial markets A nonpartisan government led by Mr. Dini took office in January 1995, following the turbulent period of Mr. Berlusconi's center-right coalition government (May-December 1994). Throughout its tenure, the Dini government operated without the benefit of a firm majority in Parliament. The government narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in late October, in return for a commitment to resign after passage of the 1996 budget. The budget approval process nonetheless remained highly contentious, culminating in further cliff-hanging confidence votes in mid-December. Mr. Dini's subsequent resignation on January 11, 1996, opened a formal government crisis; at the time of writing, the attempt to form a broad-based government to enact institutional reform had failed and early elections appeared likely. Despite the fragility of its position in Parliament, the government succeeded in passing a number of key economic measures in the course of last year, including: a supplementary budget to safeguard the 1995 fiscal targets (March); a strengthened three-year plan for 1996-98 (June); a comprehensive reform of the pension system (August); and the budget for 1996 (December). Financial markets have reflected these mixed developments. On the one hand, progress on economic policies over the past year has led to a discernible improvement in market confidence from the trough reached in March 1995 (Chart 1). By early 1996, with Italy benefiting from German monetary policy easing and the weakening of the deutsche mark against the U.S. dollar, the lira-DM exchange rate touched a 12-month high and long-term interest rate differentials narrowed to around 420 basis points. On the other hand, the improvement in market confidence associated with the progress underway on the fiscal front remained fragile and fell short of what could reasonably have been expected in a more stable political environment. Periods of market optimism have been recurrently interrupted and reversed: for example, the confidence that began to sprout during the summer, following approval of pension reform, was shaken as from late September. As a result, the real effective exchange rate of the lira remained substantially below historical levels, depreciating by an additional 3% percent (relative unit labor costs) in the course of 1995 (Chart 2) --thus falling further from a level that was already widely viewed as undervalued at the time of the last consultation. Relative to the second quarter of 1992, the lira remained at end-January 1996 the most depreciated EU currency in nominal effective terms by a significant margin. At the same time, after taking account of the effects of tax changes, long-term interest rate differentials against Germany remained little changed from their level a year earlier. 1/ 1/ An estimated 50 basis point reduction is attributable to the announced abolition of withholding tax on government bonds for foreign investors and domestic corporations.

A strong but unbalanced recovery In large part because of the weak lira, growth has remained strong, in contrast to some other European countries. 1/ Real GDP growth accelerated from 2.2 percent in 1994 to an estimated 3.2 percent in 1995 (Table 1). The driving force of the economic revival has been extort growth, with the weakness of the lira sustaining further gains in market shares and boosting the current account surplus to 2% percent of GDP. As the recovery proceeded, investment in machinery and eouinment responded to the surge in highly profitable exports, all the more so since temporary fiscal incentives acted to bring forward investment decisions. 2/ In contrast, public consumntion and investment-- traditional majnstays (together with public transfers) of the dependent economy of the South--continued to decline, affected by fiscal cutbacks and the impact of corruption scandals on public works. Private consumntion also remained sluggish as wage moderation and the contraction in dependent employment restrained the growth in total compensation. 2/ Uncertainty over employment and future income, along with rising inflation, also served to depress consumer confidence and sustain precautionary savings. Domestic demand was thus subdued even though activity was buoyant. The combination of a weak lira and the gathering recovery reinforced other factors (higher world commodity prices and indirect tax increases) to boost inflation from a 25-year low of less than 4 percent in mid-1994 to an average of 5.4 percent in 1995. Underlying inflation, as measured by consumer prices adjusted for increases in indirect taxes and terms of trade changes, remained relatively contained (around 4 percent). This owed much to the restraint exercised by the July 1993 agreement on wage bargaining, which continued to contain increases in minimum contractual wages to the official inflation objective (2% percent). The agreement thus implied a more stringent wage policy than anticipated, &/ so that, with real wages declining and productivity increasing (in part due to enterprise downsizing), unit labor costs fell for the second consecutive year. Overall, economic slack persists: the output gap is estimated at 2% percent for 1995, and the unemployment rate remains close to peak levels. u Looking at a longer time horizon since the early 198Os, however, Italy's macroeconomic performance compares unfavorably in several dimensions with partner countries (Chart 3). Over this period, Italy's growth rates were lower, and inflation and unemployment higher, than the G-7 and EU averages. 2J The so-called Tremonti Law (August 1994) introduced fiscal incentives for profits re-invested before end-1995 (partially extended in the 1996 budget), and exerted a one-off effect on the timing of investment decisions. u A large proportion of the growth recorded in private consumption reflected expenditure by non-residents, i.e., tourists--a further manifestation of the lira's competitive strength. g The cumulative overrun of actual over targeted inflation in 1994-95 amounted to some 35, percentage points, with most of the overshoot in 1995.

Exports of goods and services have increased by nearly 40 percent in real terms since 1992 (a rate twice that of the United Kingdom and over three times that of France), while real GDP has expanded by only slightly over 4 percent (less than half the growth rate recorded in the United Kingdom and only marginally above that of France). l./ The non-tradables sector has been affected by significant labor shedding, and a disproportionate share (two-thirds) of the number of bankruptcies has been concentrated in services. Given the uneven regional distribution of export-oriented industries, heavily concentrated in the Center-North, 2/ the unbalanced nature of the recovery has compounded deep-seated regional imbalances, widening the large disparities in income and unemployment. Following a much steeper output decline in the southern regions during the 1992-93 recession, real GDP in the Center-North is estimated to have expanded by an average 3 percent a year in the 1994-95 upswing, versus 1% percent in the South. Similarly, employment has been rising strongly in the industries of the North, 3J where in some areas conditions of near full employment prevail, with a growing number of firms reporting a lack of skilled labor. Correspondingly, there are anecdotal reports of demands for large, enterprise-level wage increases in the North. Employment has, in contrast, languished in the South, affected also by the restructuring of state-owned enterprises which account for a large share of employment there. Thus, the national rate of unemployment (an average 12 percent in 1995) translates into a rate almost three times higher in the South (over 20 percent) than in the Center-North. From an international perspective, Italy displays the highest degree of dispersion of regional unemployment rates among OECD countries, reflecting in good part one of the smallest inter-industry wage differentials and very low levels of inter-regional labor mobility. 4J There has also been a disturbing emergence of higher rates of youth and long-term unemployment--at least in u Staff estimates suggest that the production of tradable goods and services grew by 6 percent since 1992, twice as fast as that of non-tradables. The unbalanced nature of the recovery is illustrated in the background paper. 2J Where the share of exports in GDP is almost four times that in the South. 3J Staff studies would indicate that labor market reforms introduced since 1991 (new instruments of redundancy which reduced firing costs, less restrictive employment protection legislation, the abolition of wage indexation and a new wage bargaining system) have served to increase the responsiveness of employment to output.

In sum, financial market developments have strongly influenced the nature and composition of the economic expansion underway in Italy since early 1994. An undervalued real exchange rate has made for an upswing that has disproportionately affected the export-intensive sectors. The economy has thus been brought more swiftly toward its resource constraints. Exceptionally strong export growth has generated a large current account surplus that, at present exchange rates, is likely to persist, Prices, sustained by currency depreciation, have risen markedly relative to wages, sharply redistributing income from labor to capital: profit shares have exceeded the levels reached at the previous cyclical peak, testing the consensus on incomes policy and possibly leading to higher wage increases at the local level. And high real interest rates have continued to redistribute income from debtors to creditors, weighing on the public finances in a situation where the largest debtor is the state. lJ 3. The nolicv setting Fiscal adiustment has made some appreciable headway in recent years, which, if consolidated and advanced, could finally serve to place Italy's public finances on a sound footing (Chart 5). After the lull of 1994, significant gains were again made in 1995, in particular: the state sector overall deficit narrowed to 7.3 percent of GDP (from 9% percent of GDP in 1994), which compares favorably with the initial budget target of 8 percent of GDP. 2J With the primary surplus widening to 3.4 percent of GDP, the relentless rise of the public debt-to-GDP ratio was finally halted. Importantly, the improvement since 1993 has--for the first time--stemmed fully from a decline in primary spending (amounting to 4 percentage points of GDP in 1993-95), thanks to health care changes, the first steps in pension reform in 1992, initial reforms in public administration, a contraction in public employment and wage restraint (the wage bill fell by some 55, percent in real terms in 1993-95), as well as lower capital spending. The level of primary spending is currently some 3% percentage points of GDP below the EU average, while the revenue-to-GDP ratio is broadly in line with that observed in the rest of the EU (Chart 6), with however very different relative positions between revenues from direct and indirect taxation (Chart 7). This commendable progress on a number of fronts is subject to two caveats. First, the performance in 1995 was aided to a good degree (roughly lJ A potential source of social tension is also seen to lie in the disparity between holders of public debt, enjoying high real rates of after- tax return, and dependent workers paying high tax rates on labor income. 2J Fiscal targets in Italy are formulated primarily in terms of the cash borrowing requirement of the state sector; a commensurate improvement is estimated to have occurred also at general government level (an overall deficit of 7.1 percent of GDP, versus 9 percent of GDP in 1994).

Second, while meaningful structural measures have unquestionably been taken, every year has also seen significant reliance on measures with one-off effects --amplifying the size of the corrective action required upon their expiration-- as well as frequent recourse to tax amnesties, with a potentially adverse impact on future tax compliance. Thus, in 1995, of the 2% percentage points of GDP improvement in the state sector primary balance, about 1 percentage point was attributable to one-off measures. The role of such measures was even more prominent at general government level--the relevant basis for Maastricht purposes--where a postponement in the repayment of tax refund liabilities contributed significantly to the outcome. I/ With this background and inflation on the rise, monetary policv remained cautiously restrictive. Beginning in mid-1994, the Bank of Italy raised official interest rates in three steps (by a cumulative 200-250 basis points) to quell inflationary tendencies, and pushed up money market interest rates in reaction to recurrent exchange market tensions (Chart 8, upper panel). The growth of money and credit aggregates remained moderate, with M2 expanding by 2.1 percent on a three-month moving average to December 1995. Italy's net ODA disbursements have oscillated around 0.3 percent of GDP since 1990 (an estimated 0.27 percent of GDP in 1994), a slight decline from the levels prevailing in the late 1980s. 4. Outlook and risks The near-term outlook is for economic growth to ease to a projected 2.7 percent in 1996, narrowing the estimated output gap to under 2 percent. A deceleration in both import and export growth--with nonetheless continued market share gains--would still make for an appreciable contribution to growth. The composition of domestic demand is expected to shift toward consumption, in line with a pickup in growth of real disposable income. As fiscal incentives are phased out, outlays on machinery and equipment are set to moderate from their recent pace; this is likely to be compensated in part by a recovery in construction, with total investment growing by some 3% percent. The external current account surplus is set to remain strong. After four successive years of decline, employment is expected to pick up and the rate of unemployment to fall marginally. Although the near-term prospect is for inflation to decline with the passing of the effects of the March 1995 increase in indirect taxes, key issues in the outlook are the degree of catch-up in real wages, the behavior LJ Repayments of tax refund liabilities in 1995 were 0.9 percentage points of GDP below their originally-planned level, and 0.3 percentage points of GDP less than in 1994. Such payments appear below-the-line in the state sector accounts, but--in line with EU conventions-- contribute to the overall balance at general government level, where deficits are to match changes in indebtedness.

The staff projection of year average inflation of 4.6 percent in 1996 (versus a target of 3% percent) assumes a lira-DM rate of 1,100, some real wage catch-up (to which there appears to be a general acquiescence), a stabilization of profit margins, and a moderation from recent high productivity increases. While the outlook thus remains broadly satisfactory, it is subject to downside risks in both the short- and medium-term. The former mainly take the shape of a weaker external environment or continued unsettled domestic political conditions which, together with still uncertain job prospects and fiscal outlook, could thwart the improvement in household confidence and the projected pickup in private consumption. Of greatest concern, however, are the effects that the combination of an unduly weak lira, a booming export sector, and regional and sectoral imbalances could exert over time. In the absence of a correction of the lira's excess real depreciation through a stronger nominal rate, this combination--through its effects on price formation, wage demands, and interest rates--risks placing the economy on a significantly worse inflation and public finance trajectory than presently thought likely. How to avert such an outcome was the central focus of the discussions. III. Policv Discussions The mission coincided with a critical phase in Italy's political process, with the deadline for the government's resignation looming and the major political forces jockeying for position, holding policies hostage to electoral considerations, and exercising pressure to accommodate special interests at the expense of the budget. Following a series of adjustment packages presented to the public in recent years, there were also signs of adjustment fatigue. In this environment, the staff saw a heightened risk of moving to the increasingly intractable inflation and fiscal path noted above. To avert this risk, it urged capitalizing on the progress made so far, and on the still favorable economic situation, with the adoption of an integrated strategy aimed at engendering confidence, comprising the following elements: l accelerated fiscal consolidation, aiming at a general government deficit of under 3 percent of GDP by 1997; l a monetary policy stance focused on reining in inflation, in part through exchange rate appreciation as a result of fiscal-policy-induced changes in confidence; Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - l an incomes policy tuned to the re-appreciation of the exchange rate; and l structural reforms that give medium-term sustainability to the credibility gains arising from fiscal adjustment and monetary rigor. While stressing the obstacles--economic, political, and social--to such a strategy, the authorities did not rule out its feasibility in the event of a broad-based political agreement in the new year. In presenting the EU Presidency's program in mid-December, Prime Minister Dini drew Parliament's attention to the EMU timetable set by the Madrid European Council and to the consequent need to bring forward official plans by one year, to 1997, if Italy wished to participate in EMU from the start. He characterized the required effort as "difficult, but not impossible." 1. Fiscal nolicv: the oace of adiustment a. The three-year fiscal plan. 1996-98 The government's plan for 1996-98 (Table 2) was formulated with the aim, as advised at the time of the last consultation, to participate fully in the process of European integration. To this end, it broke the pattern of slippage from and relaxation of each successive plan (Chart 9), and sought to satisfy the Maastricht fiscal deficit criterion by 1998. This is to be achieved through a gradual improvement in the general government primary balance, of around 1 percentage point of GDP each year. lJ It is also dependent on relatively optimistic interest rate assumptions, under which the interest bill would fall by almost 2 percentage points of GDP from its 1995 level. The plan emphasizes expenditure restraint, with current primary spending to be kept constant in real terms and thus declining in relation to GDP, while the revenue-to-GDP ratio remains at about its 1995 level. As habitual in the Italian presentation, the plan does not contain specific measures, but does indicate the size of the discretionary measures (manovra) required to bridge the gap between a "no measures" projection (tendenziale) and the plan's targets; the size of the manovra declines gradually from 1.7 percent of GDP in 1996 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 1998, as the effects of structural measures taken since 1992 are increasingly felt. 2J I-J The better-than-targeted outcome for 1995 reduces the envisaged general government primary adjustment in 1996 to % percentage point of GDP. 2J The staff again recommended moving away from this method of presentation, which gives an economically misleading impression of the fiscal effort since much of the so-called "adjustment" it includes is required merely to compensate for the expiry of one-off measures and avoid backsliding; furthermore, there has been a tendency to inflate the size of the baseline tendenziale projection. While the authorities agreed with this observation, the method of presentation appears too firmly entrenched as the customary approach to measuring fiscal correction for any changes to be forthcoming.

While welcoming the current program's improvement on previous plans' targets, the staff noted that the structural improvement in the primary surplus implied by the plan was relatively modest, equal to % percentage point of GDP per annum over three years (see table); that the plan's lack of specificity and protracted character weakened its credibility further; and that, following the EU decision setting 1997 as the first test date, the plan no longer met the requirements for early EMU participation, with the risk that fading hopes of participation could result in policy drift and a loss of momentum. All in all, the plan now seemed to fall short of what was desirable and doable under the circumstances and, moreover, appeared unlikely to generate the significant confidence effects assumed in the projected decline in interest rates.

While the authorities tended to feel that time was on their side in allowing for a continued process of gradual fiscal adjustment, the staff noted that, if an early horizon of confidence in policies was not established, there would be a risk that the imbalances in the economy could give way to a higher-inflation, higher-interest rate scenario in which the three-year fiscal plan would unravel. The prospect of a slowdown in EU growth exacerbated the situation further. To illustrate these points and provide a sense of the cost of not embarking on accelerated adjustment, the staff prepared two scenarios, summarized in Table 3 and Chart 10 (see Box 1 for details). The base scenario gives the authorities' plans the benefit of the doubt except for the incorporation of the staff's estimated slippages from the 1996 budget targets (see further below) and of known expenditures not provided for in the plan, as well as an updating of the macroeconomic variables. In this scenario, lack of confidence persists, with high interest rates undermining the authorities' manovra and the excess depreciation of the real exchange rate being corrected through higher inflation. The general government deficit remains well above the government's plans (by some 2 percent of GDP in 1997-98) and hence well in excess of the Maastricht target in 1997. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - Box 1: Fiscal Scenarios To illustrate the costs and benefits of an accelerated fiscal adjustment aiming at a general government deficit of less than 3 percent of GDP by 1997, Table 3 contrasts this effort with a base scenario and the authorities’ three-year plan (DPEF). The cumulative primary adjustment (actual and structural) in each case is shown in Chart 10, along with a “current services” projection. The starting point for the scenarios is the projected 1995 outturn, which is set to be better than in the DPEF (an overall deficit of 7.1 percent of GDP, versus a targeted 7% percent of GDP), essentially because of the delayed reimbursement of tax refund liabilities (totalling 0.9 percent of GDP). The base scenario is intended to illustrate likely developments on the basis of “announced policies.” In interpreting this concept, it assumes that the marwvra measures announced for 1997-98 are fully implemented and yield the officially-estimated amounts. 11 In addition, it incorporates (i) the staffs estimated slippages from the 1996 budget targets; (ii) the additional expenditures associated with current and back payments under the Constitutional Court sentence on pensions (some 0.3 percentage points of GDP per annum); and (iii) the assumption that tax refund payments not made in 1995 are carried out in the subsequent three years, in line with the authorities’ intention of fully repaying all such liabilities by end-1998. In addition, interest payments are larger than in the plan because of higher inflation. As a result of the 1996 overrun, the expiration of one-off measures in 1997-98 not foreseen in the original manovra, and a worse macroeconomic environment than in the government’s plan, the base scenario yields a general government deficit well in excess (some 2 percentage points of GDP) of the plan’s targets; in the Maastricht reference year of 1997, the deficit would reach 6.2 percent of GDP. In the accelerated adiustment scenario, additional measures are taken to attain the target of an overall deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 1997. The required primary adjustment is 2.7 percent of GDP over two years so as to raise the primary surplus to 6% percent of GDP by 1997. To secure the sought-for confidence effects, it is assumed that the bulk (three-fifths) of the effort is undertaken in 1996--including an increase in indirect taxes yielding about ?4 percentage point of GDP-and that the measures for 1997 are legislated at an early stage. Macroeconomic assumptions are adjusted for the estimated effects of accelerated adjustment: a contractionary effect on GDP growth in 1996 (about 314 percent less than in the base scenario), together with lower inflation (resulting from a stronger lira), and lower interest rates. In the latter regard, confidence effects resulting from the front-loaded adjustment are assumed to reduce real interest rates by between % to 1 percent comparedto the basescenario. 1/ This assumption appears justified to the extent that the DPEF and its targets are approved by Parliament; in addition, in the past, measures actually taken each year have usually exceeded the amounts envisaged in the DPEF. This assumption explains why the base scenario yields better results than the “current services” The second scenario assumes accelerated fiscal adjustment so as to reach an overall deficit target below 3 percent of GDP by 1997. Given the track record with regard to multi-year commitments, and the elusiveness of confidence gains despite recent progress, the staff took the view that policy credibility could best be strengthened through an array of concrete measures supporting relatively near-term and firm commitments, such as those set by the requirements for early EMU participation. Such accelerated adjustment is calculated to require a front-loaded primary correction of 2% to 3 percent of GDP over two years--inclusive of action, discussed below, for estimated budget overruns in 1996. The additional fiscal contraction and assumed exchange rate appreciation would dampen GDP growth by about 3/4 percent initially.

The authorities did not disagree with the potential benefits of accelerated adjustment, and--if the political conditions allowed--did not rule out the possibility of aiming higher than the current plans; in this vein, they viewed the staff recommendation as "useful prodding." However, they placed considerable emphasis .on the difficulties of bringing forward their plans by one year. They were concerned that the expected confidence effects would fail to avert a "home-made" recession, especially if the strengthened consolidation effort were to coincide with a slowdown in partner country growth. In this regard, they drew attention to the link between the rate of output growth and the real interest rate in determining the evolution of debt dynamics: in 1992-93, there had clearly been considerable fiscal adjustment but, with the slowdown in growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio had increased sharply. They also saw limited scope for fast-yielding measures: primary spending had been cut back significantly in recent years; direct tax rates were already excessively high and--with rampant evasion- -higher rates would raise the incentives to evade; and the experience of March 1995 had reinforced concerns about the inflationary impact of indirect tax increases, which would also imperil the trade unions' continued adherence to incomes policy. In such an environment, they saw a concrete risk that faster adjustment might indeed achieve the Maastricht fiscal deficit target--but place beyond reach the criterion for price convergence and, through its effects on growth, the required decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The staff acknowledged that an accelerated strategy would involve making hard choices and require political resolve. But the economic difficulties should not be overstated: the adjustment is only about 1 percentage point of GDP more by 1997 than the authorities envisage under the plan's targets, and it implies a pace of structural primary improvement of under 1 percent of GDP per year--considerably below the effort of 1992-93, at the height of the recession, as well as that of 1995. In addition, the size of the recommended adjustment is not out of line with that of other countries with fiscal IJ Staff calculations using MULTIMOD to illustrate the implications of rapid fiscal adjustment in all EU countries yield a somewhat higher short-run output cost in Italy in 1996, but this loss is more than compensated by a rebound in growth thereafter. See Progress Toward EMU: Developments and Selected Issues, SM/96/41. Several studies also indicate that in a high public debt environment, where expectations and confidence effects may have become particularly acute, fiscal adjustment can well lead to a strong expansion of private demand, through expectations of future income and not solely via interest rate effects.

With regard to the concerns about growth, the staff acknowledged that the 1992-93 recession had worsened the debt dynamics temporarily, but the gains from that consolidation effort had eventually come through--as was now apparent. The longer-term difficulties stemmed instead from reactions such as those of early 1994, when concerns about weak growth led to backtracking in the path of primary adjustment. Such concerns also bred ill-advised measures, such as the fiscal incentives for investment, which had in the event proved to be procyclical and to cost the 1995-96 budgets roughly 0.3 percent of GDP at a time when profits were at record highs. The staff thus stressed that, in a country with severe fiscal problems, the policymaker's eye had to be kept firmly on the medium term, and adjustment pursued consistently over the cycle. There was agreement that, for confidence and other reasons, the bulk of the adjustment should be on the expenditure side. But the search for immediate expenditure savings is well-trodden ground in Italy, and the authorities pressed the staff for specific suggestions. The following areas for action were identified: the wage bill, through a strict enforcement of the hiring freeze (in contrast to recent exemptions) and greater staff mobility, consistent with the devolution of responsibilities under fiscal federalism; improved targeting of health expenditures; greater reliance on user fees for health and other services; an end to the de facto exemption of pensioners from the payment of health contributions; enforcement of a hard budget constraint on local authorities; reduced transfers to enterprises, notably in the transportation sector; fiscal incentives limited to where warranted by externalities (in contrast to the above-noted investment incentives); elimination of the privileges for particular groups (notably the self-employed) that persist even after the recent pension reform; rationalization of defense spending; cutbacks in the reserve funds for new legislative initiatives; and limits to the carry-over of unspent appropriations. It was nonetheless clear that the many emergency packages of recent years had limited the scope for expenditure cuts with fast-yielding effects. The staff thus felt that action on the expenditure side would need to be complemented by revenue measures, all~the more so given the lower-than-planned lJ The accelerated scenario implies a cumulative improvement of 611 percentage points of GDP in the primary balance over six years (1992"97), of which 2.7 percentage points in 1996-97. Other episodes of adjustment in countries with fiscal problems- -over a comparable period of time--recorded improvements in the general government primary balance (in percentage points of GDP) ranging from 7%"8 (Ireland, 1986-89; Belgium, 1982-87); to 11 (Greece, 1990-95); and 15 (Denmark, 1982-86).

The authorities were concerned that this argument, having already been used (and contradicted by events) at the time of the March 1995 package, had worn thin, and saw considerable risks in any further action on indirect taxes. They also felt it premature to tamper with tax rates until the effects of the efforts underway to expand the tax base and reduce tax evasion had been given a chance to unfold, with an assessment to be made later in 1996. b. The 1996 budget The 1996 budget is the first installment of the three-year plan. It aims to reduce the overall state sector deficit to 5.8 percent of GDP (Lit 109.4 trillion), by raising the primary surplus to 4.3 percent of GDP (from 3.4 percent of GDP in 1995). To achieve this, the budget includes revenue and expenditure measures valued at Lit 32.5 trillion (1.7 percent of GDP). J/ On the revenue side, the main measures are intended to enlarge the tax base, reduce tax evasion, strengthen the assessment of taxable income for self- employed and firms, increase tax autonomy at the local level, adjust excise taxes, and extend the tax on companies' net worth; significant revenues are also expected from an expansion of lotteries. Although the package is presented as being about equally split between expenditure and revenue measures, its focus on state sector accounts results in an overstatement of the action taken to tackle public expenditure, since a major component of the measures presented as spending cuts consists of reduced transfers to bodies outside the state sector. The genuine expenditure cuts consist mainly of a continuation of the hiring freeze and additional controls on health expenditures. On the other hand, the budget relies less than in previous years on temporary measures--under one-sixth of the measures can be defined as one-off, with their effects expiring fully by 1998 at the latest. l.J Essentially due to the lower yield of some tax amnesties, foregone corporate tax revenues due to the investment incentives (which had been assumed to be self-financing), lower receipts from the tax on interest income (due to stagnant bank deposits), and shortfalls in nontax revenues. 2J There are presently four VAT rates: 4 percent on certain food items and other basic products; two intermediate rates of 10 percent and 16 percent; and the standard rate of 19 percent. The EU requirements call for one (or at most two) reduced rates between 5 and 15 percent, in addition to a standard rate of at least 15 percent. 3J As in the past, the size of the manovra is considerably larger than the targeted improvement in the primary balance (0.9 percent of GDP), principally because of the need to compensate for the expiry of one-off measures. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - The budget was tepidly received by the markets upon its presentation in October, and the changes introduced in the approval process--although ostensibly leaving the overall deficit unchanged--tended to accentuate initial concerns. These centered on a number of shortcomings with regard to the reliability of the measures and the budget's assumptions and coverage. u The staff joined other observers in judging that corrective action--estimated by staff to amount to close to 3/4 percent of GDP--would be required to achieve the 1996 budget targets and meet the payments mandated by the Constitutional Court rulings on pensions. The authorities were confident about the reliability of their budget projections at this stage. In this they were comforted by early indications-- subsequently confirmed-- that the highly uncertain response to new procedures for assessing past tax liabilities of certain taxpayer categories (concordato) had been in line with official estimates for 1995, demonstrating an improved efficiency of tax administration and boding well for the efforts against tax evasion. They also expressed their determination to hold the wage bill to within the budgeted amount. Nonetheless, the authorities stood ready, as in the past, to take additional measures should their need be apparent at the time of the quarterly cash results in March 1996. They also expressed their intention to provide separately for the costs of the Constitutional Court rulings, with past obligations to be covered by bond issues and the ongoing costs by a special levy; these measures remain to be taken. 2. Incomes oolicv: the issue of catch-up There is a broad consensus in Italy, shared by the staff, that the agreements between government, industry, and labor abolishing wage indexation (1992) and establishing a new framework for wage negotiations (1993) have contributed crucially to containing inflationary pressures in the aftermath of the lira's exit from the ERM. The centerpiece of the July 1993 accord was the agreement to base increases in national minimum contractual wages on targeted inflation, a guideline adhered to in all major contracts concluded in 1994-95, despite the implied real wage erosion. IJ First, a large portion of the measures are of highly uncertain yield, with inter alia a heavy reliance on prospective gains from curbing tax evasion and new lotteries. Second, there is no guarantee that, faced with reduced transfers, local authorities will not respond- -as in the past--by building up debts for which the central government will later be responsible. Third, budget estimates about the cost of investment incentives and the projected flow of pension retirees appear optimistic. Fourth, the budget makes no provision for the cost of complying with Constitutional Court rulings regarding pensions, estimated at some 2 percent of GDP payable over an indeterminate number of years. Finally, there are concerns that the scheduled renewal of public sector wage contracts for the next two-year period (with pressures to compensate for the inflation overshoot of 1994-95) could jeopardize budget targets. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - The true test of the accord, however, lies ahead. The agreement foresees that national negotiations for the next two-year period, while remaining based on targeted inflation, will also discuss the possibility of catch-up for past real wage losses, "taking into account" terms of trade movements. In addition, to allow for greater flexibility, the framework also calls for the national agreements to be complemented by plant-level negotiations linked to developments in firm profitability and productivity; these second-tier negotiations are currently underway. 1/ While recognizing that there undoubtedly was scope for real wage increases in line with productivity gains, the staff argued that a "catch-up" for past inflation overruns caused by the exchange rate and increases in indirect taxes --the two factors that largely account for the overshoot of the inflation targets- -would be at odds with the spirit and the economics of the 1993 agreement. Catch-up for excessive exchange rate depreciation--which ought to be reversed- -would entrench the effects of the lira weakness, while catch-up for indirect tax increases would sustain their second-round inflation effects. Catch-up in this context was counter-productive and tantamount to accepting higher inflation and inflation inertia. The discussions nonetheless revealed general acquiescence to some degree of real wage catch-up in the private sector. This was true even beyond the trade unions, with the view being put forth that such a catch-up could usefully help revive languid consumer spending. The trade unions, for their part, clearly felt under pressure from their rank-and-file and were critical of the other parties to the agreement: the government for having raised indirect taxes and firms for the sharp increase in price mark-ups. There was agreement that the best way to secure continued adherence to the 1993 accord was through policies that achieved the official inflation targets. 3. Monetarv and exchange rate policv: shapinp. exnectations Monetary conditions generally tightened over the past year, as suggested by high real short-term rates (recently around 5 percent); a flattening of the yield curve; a change in the term structure of spreads over Germany (with the discount rate differential increasing through 1994-95 while the long-term bond yield differential trended downward); and forward yield curve differentials compared with Germany becoming more sharply downward-sloping during 1995 (Chart 8, bottom panel). The term structure therefore suggests that policy- related interest rates have been kept high in relation to the expectations of inflation reflected in long-term rates. In addition, the growth of monetary aggregates remains moderate, while credit expansion has been restrained by the scope for self-financing afforded by large profits, with the working out of problem loans also making banks reluctant to lend. lJ For details of the accord, see Demekas, Dimitri - Labor Market Institutions and Flexibility in Italy, WP/94/30, March 1994.

In the event that a government could muster the political support for an acceleration of fiscal adjustment, there was agreement that monetary policy should initially support the confidence-induced appreciation of the lira, while standing ready to use the scope that this would provide for the durable reduction in interest rates necessary to bring down the fiscal deficit. In the absence of accelerated fiscal adjustment, the discussions centered on the inflation risks and on the forward-looking conduct of monetary policy required to counter such risks. In May 1995, the Governor of the Bank of Italy announced that the central bank would tighten monetary policy should inflation, excluding the effect of indirect taxes, tend to exceed 4% percent in 1995 and 4 percent in 1996. This was the first statement setting inflation targets by the central bank, and an important step in making the Bank's objectives explicit, as recommended during previous consultations. The staff noted, however, that the clarity of policies was blurred by the difference between the 1996 target announced by the central bank and that set shortly thereafter by the government in the medium-term plan (3% percent, inclusive of indirect tax increases), and urged greater coordination. The authorities indicated that forward-looking indicators of inflation were taking on increasing importance in shaping monetary policy, as the reliability of the monetary and credit aggregates had diminished. While the central bank's public reports have begun to focus more on inflation, the authorities stressed that there was no intention to emulate the Bank of England's Inflation Reports, nor to adopt a more formal inflation-targeting framework. The reluctance to embark on such a framework resided essentially in the central bank's view that targets for inflation cannot be pursued by monetary policy alone, but require the joint effort of incomes policy and, especially in a high-debt country, fiscal policy. In the latter respect, the staff discussed with the authorities a study on whether Italy is in a situation in which high public debt renders inflation a purely fiscal phenomenon, against which monetary policy is essentially \ powerless-- in a Sargent-Wallace "unpleasant monetarist arithmetic" framework (see Box 2 and background paper). The study finds that fiscal policy is more responsive to monetary tightening than the unpleasant monetarist arithmetic hypothesis would allow, suggesting that a high public debt should not deter the central bank from pursuing a goal of price stability--a finding with which the authorities concurred, while also stressing the high costs when monetary policy has to act alone. In recognizing this tenet, the staff nonetheless noted that the behavior of wage-setters and the fiscal authorities also depends on their perception of the central bank's resolve in pursuing price stability, and of its track record in resisting accommodation to pressures arising from labor costs and fiscal deficits. It was thus incumbent on the central bank to shape expectations.

An increase in interest rates may worsen the debt dynamics, with possible inflationary consequences in the future. In an extreme case, dubbed “unpleasant monetarist arithmetic” in a 1981 article by Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace, the effect may be so strong that a monetary tightening may actually have perverse effects on current inflation. Monetary policy then could not be used independently of fiscal policy, despite the government’s access to fmancial markets; any attempt to disinflate through monetary policy alone would be not only futile but counterproductive. A staff study (see background document) explores this issue using vector autoregressions with data for Ireland and Italy from the early 1980s through mid-1990s. Chart 1 shows the response of inflation to a one-standard-error increase in the official discount rate in the two countries. In neither country is there any indication of the perverse effects of monetary policy suggested by unpleasant monetarist arithmetic.

The opposite extreme would be “market discipline” where unsustainable government borrowing would force adjustment in fiscal policy so that the worsening of the debt dynamics resulting from higher interest rates would be transitory, offset eventually by adjustment of primary expenditures and revenues. The interaction between monetary and fiscal policy can be explored empirically; Chart _ 7 shows the effect of the discount rate on the primary balance. Here, in both countries an increase in the discount rate induces a strengthening of the primary balance. Although this effect is weaker in Italy then in Ireland, it would tend to offset the deterioration of the debt dynamics associated with a monetary tightening.

I/ Similarly, monetary policy would need to be tightened pre-emptively if slippages in the 1996 budget became apparent and were not corrected in a prompt manner. During the fall of 1995, the timing of Italy's possible re-entry into the &J, with a view to eventual participation in EMU, was under discussion. The authorities acknowledged that there were difficulties in re-entering at the time of the discussions, given the weakness of the lira and the volatility of the foreign exchange market. In this connection, the mission discussed tentative calculations of an equilibrium exchange rate. Based on the assumption that an equilibrium current account would maintain a constant net external position in relation to GDP, such calculations indicated that the lira had recently been undervalued in a range around 10 percent. 2/ There was agreement that such calculations were subject to considerable margins of error and choice of assumptions, including regarding what constituted a "desirable" current account position in the medium run--with, for example, the central bank viewing favorably a further reduction in the net external liability position (which has declined considerably in recent years, to 5 percent of GDP at end-1995). The authorities thus did not offer their own estimate of an equilibrium exchange rate, but concurred that the lira had been unduly weak in relation to fundamentals. Staff and authorities agreed that a stronger lira, together with a more stable political situation, were preconditions for ERM re-entry: the staff stressed that it would be both futile and risky to put this condition for EMU participation in place unless fiscal plans were first strengthened sufficiently to reduce interest rate premia and raise the lira toward an appropriate ERM parity. 5. Structural policies: UnderDinning credibility The discussions focused on those structural reforms which were viewed as most important to sustain into the medium term the credibility gained by accelerated adjustment. Of these, much emphasis was placed on the need for reform of the budget orocess. While there was no disagreement that the lJ In assessing the outlook for inflation, the Bank of Italy assumed that there would be wage catch-up of some 1% percent in response to past differences between actual and target inflation, in addition to a 3% percent increase in line with the official (government) inflation target and an average of 1 percent for productivity increases; the resulting 6 percent wage increase was seen to be consistent with the central bank's target inflation of under 4 percent. 2J Evidence of lira undervaluation was examined at the time of the last consultation (see SM/95/48, 3/g/95, Annex V), and is reviewed in the background paper.

The authorities tended to see the problem as lying primarily in the budget approval process, with a need above all to reduce the scope for parliamentary amendments. In this, they saw a role for "fiscal rules," with the Budget Minister and the Minister for Institutional Reform having put forward proposals to enshrine Maastricht-type criteria in the Constitution. The staff emphasized the complementary need for more transparent and accountable budget preparation and implementation procedures (see Box 3, and background paper); with existing budget procedures, imposing a simple fiscal rule would likely primarily result in creative accounting to circumvent it. The staff agreed that the recently-approved pension reform was an important breakthrough: it introduced a system with many desirable properties, corrected various distortions and set up a framework whose parameters could easily be modified without requiring a systemic reform (see Box 4, and background paper). However, the reform is being phased in too slowly. The authorities took the view that this was a price worth paying for securing agreement on the reform while preserving social consensus. They noted that the reform provided for a first review by 1998, allowing for changes in the parameters if the savings envisaged for 1996-98 had not materialized. They were reluctant to consider changes earlier, since the prospect of a reduction in benefits could trigger another surge in the propensity to retire, with adverse fiscal consequences. With regard to its long-run effects, the reform will reduce substantially the benefits for the self-employed, whose contributions are lower than those of dependent workers. For dependent workers, comparisons of the new and old systems are highly sensitive to assumptions about individual choices over retirement age and years of contributions, as well as on macroeconomic variables. Assuming real GDP and earnings growth of 1% percent, the two systems are broadly equally generous; faster GDP growth would yield higher pensions under the new system, but it would not compromise its solvency, as faster growth would also generate a more-rapidly-growing contribution base. The reform will not, however, provide scope for reducing the current high level of payroll contributions and will not avoid a deterioration of the finances of the social security institute as adverse demographics materialize I/ In March 1994, the staff presented an assessment of Italy's current expenditure management system, identifying the main problem areas in budget preparation, monitoring, and implementation, and making suggestions to address these and enhance transparency and accountability for spending decisions. For a summary of the report, see Italy - Background Economic Developments and Issues, SM/95/48-Supplement 1, 3/g/95, Chapter II.

The objective of such reforms is to facilitate the adoption of fiscal adjustment measures, ensuring that macroeconomic constraints are brought fully to bear on tax and expenditure decisions, and to increase accountability for expenditure decisions and the transparency of the budget process. Empirical evidence at the European Union level suggests that countries with more “centralized” budget formation processes have been able to achieve better fiscal management. At the budget preparation stage, a higher degree of centralixation (reflected, for example, in special authority vested in the finance minister) can help ensure that the budget proposal fully intemalixes macroeconomic wnstraints, and limit the extent of “free riding” by spending ministers. The adoption of sound fiscal policy decisions can be made easier by ensuring that amendments presented in the Parliamentary debate on the budget cannot alter the document’s substance, short of a rejection of the whole budget proposal. At the budget implementation stage, expenditure centers need to face hard budget constraints, that can be enforced by the finance minister, implying limited flexibility in the transfer of funds within and between expenditure categories, as well as between different fiscal years. In order for ex-post controls to be effective, the accountability for expenditure decisions has to be well-defined. Finally, transparency of the budget process is essential at all stages-it limits the scope for creative accountin,, 0 increases the credibility of ftscal management, and facilitates the enforcement of budget constraints. At present, budgetary procedures in Italy can be characterizcd as follows: l Government stage: The process leading to the formulation of the government’s budget proposal in Italy is not very central&d when compared to other EU countries. Italy has three ministers in charge of the economy: the Treasury Minister (responsible for public expenditure), the Finance Minister (responsible for tax revenue) and the Budget Minister (responsible for planning and macroeconomic projections). The budget proposal is drafted by the Minister of the Treasury, but none of the three Ministers enjoys special or formal authority in budget negotiations. Furthermore, cabinet committees that bring together expenditure ministers in order to coordinate public expenditure across departments raise the possibility of forging strategic alliances between ministers in order to raise their spending bids. l Parliamentarv stave: The scope for amendments is now more restrictive than in the past: for example, amendments cannot change the overall budget balance approved in the multi-year budget framework (DPEF). However, amendments that increase expenditure or reduce taxes are still admissible without government consent, unlike in France and Germany. Futiermore, the number of amendments can be staggering and de facto constrain the government at the budget formation process. l Budget imulementation stage: The implementation of the budget in Italy is inordinately flexible with respect to that in other EU countries. There are no cash limits on expenditure ministers; the Fiance and Treasury Ministers lack the ability to block expenditure decisions; and transfers of expenditure authorizations tithin and between expenditure chapters are pervasive. Furthermore, unspent balances on expenditure funds are systematically carried over to the following year, not only for capital expenditure but also for current spending. l Information wntent of the budget: The entire budget process in Italy is characterized by its lack of transparency. There is a plethora of budget documents, covering different definitions of government and drawn on different accounting principles. These documents do not “aggregate” expenditure items according to well-defined categories.

It also took measures to close loopholes and correct distortions. Main Features of the New System l to qualify for retirement a worker will have to reach 57 years of age and a minimum amount of Eligibility: contributions. Under the old system retirement required a minimum age of 60 (women) or 65 (men), and 35 years of contributions; however, early retirement without a penalty was available for those with 35 years of contributions, irrespective of age. The new system eliminates the possibility of early retirement without penalty. l Retirement benefits: pensions will be computed multiplying (i) the value of accrued lifetime contributions capital&d at the rate of growth of GDP and (ii) a transformation co&icienr stipulated in the law, which increases with the age of retirement. Under the old system, pensions were equivalent to a constant proportion of the (actuarially adjusted) average of salaries over the years worked. l Other benefits: rules governing invalidity and survivors’ pensions have been tightened; the amount of benefits will now be linked to the level of income of the invalid and/or survivor. l Loouholes/distottions: social security contributions have been made obligatory for certain categories of self-employed workers previously exempt; state workers will pay contributions on their entire remuneration, rather than on a fraction of it; a contribution to a fund for public housing scheduled to expire at end-1995 has been extended and earmarked to finance pensions; part of the contributions to other welfare funds have been relabelled as contributions. l Transition Rules: the new system will be immediately in force for all individuals who begin to work in 1996; it will not affect workers with more than 18 years of contributions as at end-1995. Workers with at least one year but no more than 18 years of contributions by end-1995 will have their pensions computed as a weighted average of the benefits generated by the old and new formulae. For those not affected by the new system, early retirement with a full pension will still be feasible over the next decode, although under increasingly stringent conditions (different for dependent and self-employed workers); public sector workers will be eligible for early retirement with less than a full pension under certain conditions, which will also be tightened gradually. Medium- and Long-Run Effects l According to official estimates, the reform is set to yield annual savings of the order of 0.4-0.5 percent of GDP in 1995 2005, with slightly more than half of those savings stemming from lower expenditures (mainly due to the gradual tightening of eligibility criteria for early retirement). Higher revenues are expected from the contributions of previously exempt self- employed workers and the extension and relabelliig of the contribution for public housing. l Since the pensions system will continue to operate on a pay-us-you-go basis, it will remain vulnerable to adverse demographic developments, even when it generates actuarially fair pensions on an individual basis. Increases in the dependency ratio, such as the one expected over the next 30-40 years, or a fall in the share of labor in national income, would affect the solvency of the pension system. l The reform improved the economic properties of the pension system: it eliminated the incentive for early retirement (although it failed to provide a real economic incentive to postpone retirement beyond the minimum age); and introduced a clearer link between contributions and benefits, which under a pay-as-you-go system may reduce the welfare cost of wage- based contributions. Potential Amendments to the New System l Raising contribution rates of the self-employed from 15 percent (the rate actually paid) to 20 percent (the notional rate used to compute benefits) would yield fiscal savings equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP annually over the next decade. Alternatively, lowering the rate used to compute the benefits to 15 percent would not have any effects in the short- to medium-run, but would reduce pension outlays proportionately in the long-run. l Completing the gradual increase in the minimum retirement age (and/or the minimum number of years of contribution) by the year 2000, rather than 2008, would generate savings below 0.1 percent of GDP over the next decade. l Pro-rating the benefits of those with more than 18 years of contributions would not generate significant savings.

Remedial strategies aimed at accelerating the phasing-in of the new system-- while undoubtedly helpful and worth pursuing-- would not suffice in themselves to generate the savings needed to prepare for a demographic transition. Thus, a more drastic revision of key parameters of the system would in time be needed. In this regard, the reform does provide for a review of key parameters every ten years in the light of demographic developments, but does not mandate automatic adjustments. lJ The privatization nrogram advanced in 1995, despite delays caused by political wrangling, and proceeds were close to target (some % percent of GDP). The government finally succeeded in obtaining approval of a law on regulatory authorities in November 1995, opening the way for privatization of public utilities. There is also a need to privatize financial institutions owned by foundations, in part because these have become prominent participants in recent privatization offerings. Efforts in this direction are hampered, however, by the special legal status of such public-law banks which constitute much of the banking system. 2J The staff suggested that governance and efficiency considerations as well as the immediate concerns to garner revenues and develop equity markets argued for hastening the privatization of this sector. While there is agreement that profound structural changes are needed to equip Italy's financial svstem for a liberalized and competitive environment, there is also some pessimism over whether these changes will take place quickly enough to avert further problems down the road. Bank profitability improved in 1995 after a "black year" in 1994, but the downward trend of the past ten years is likely to continue, as sharpening competition continues to cut into intermediation margins. The growth of non-performing loans had decelerated, but such loans were slightly above 10 percent of the total in November 1995, with a strong concentration in the South, where two major banks and several smaller ones had required a large infusion of funds from the state and/or other banks. The industry had seen some major mergers and acquisitions in recent months, and this restructuring was expected to continue in response to changing market conditions. The cost reductions that could be achieved through restructuring and greater efficiency were, however, limited by constraints on staff layoffs. Finally, the assumption that banks will not be allowed to fail may delay the weeding out of uneconomic or egregiously l-J The recent papers on the fiscal consequences of aging (SM/96/7 and SM/96/11) discuss Italy's pension reform from an international perspective. 2J Public-law banks, which include 7 of the 10 largest banks, have politically-appointed management but do not constitute state property; instead, they are owned by "foundations" which, in principle, have charitable purposes. The authorities have been preparing for their restructuring and eventual privatization by separating the banks from their foundations: under the 1990 banking law, a foundation typically owns a holding company which owns part or all of a bank or group of banks; a 1994 law encouraged foundations to diversify by selling minority stakes fin their banks. As of 1996, directors of a foundation will not be allowed to serve also as directors of the bank.

In discussing the high level of unemployment, there was agreement that the nub of the labor market problem was regional and structural, rather than cyclical. In this regard, the mission argued that nation-wide wage bargaining --with sectoral accords applicable to all regions--and the long- standing trade union policy of defending national minimum wage parity were clearly in conflict with large regional productivity gaps. These factors had served to depress labor demand in the South and discourage migration flows. In particular, unduly high entry wages discouraged the absorption of new entrants into the labor force, especially at the lower end of the skill spectrum. While one trade union still firmly defends the principle of national minimum wage parity, the mission found a growing consensus on the need for greater regional wage differentiation, albeit as part of a larger regional development strategy. Finally, the mission reviewed Italy's economic data, which are on the whole adequate with regard to coverage, quality, and timeliness; there are however weaknesses on the income side of the national accounts and budget documents suffer from lack of transparency (Appendix I). The authorities confirmed their support for the standards for data publication now under elaboration in the Fund, noting the importance of proper coordination among international organizations and indicating that compliance might require strengthening the timeliness and periodicity of some series. IV. Staff Avvraisal The Italian economy is delicately poised, a precarious mixture of gathering strengths and lingering weaknesses in the face of considerable opportunity. The strengths are notable. Fiscal adjustment, which began in earnest in response to the ERM crisis of 1992, has begun to pay off. 1995 was a particularly positive year in this regard: the correction in the public finances was significant and--a first for many years in Italy--it clocked in ahead of targets. Most noteworthy was the breaking of the seemingly inexorable rise in the debt ratio, a year earlier than planned. On the structural side, pension reform was another concrete achievement. Concurrently, economic performance has also been strong, with vigorous growth and underlying, if not overall, inflation still reasonably contained. Together, these factors have alleviated some of the concerns of financial markets, and the lira has tended to recover from its exceptionally depressed levels of a year ago. Nonetheless, uncertainty about future fiscal adjustment has continued to bear down on the lira, which has been and remains unduly depreciated. This has led to an unbalanced recovery in an economy already saddled with large structural imbalances, as well as to high interest rates, which have continued to frustrate fiscal consolidation ambitions. The risk is that the lira's Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - weakness will eventually resolve itself through higher inflation rather than through nominal appreciation, compounding Italy's still unresolved public finance situation. Risks in this regard are accentuated by the fragility of some of the progress made in 1995: the dependence of the fiscal consolidation gains on one-off measures and favorable economic conditions, and the vulnerability of the exchange rate to the vicissitudes of Italy's political process and the associated concerns of a blurring of the focus of economic policies. Such an eventuality would be most unfortunate, again postponing the prospects for sustained non-inflationary growth that would follow from fiscal consolidation and lower interest rates. It is against this background that the staff sees a need to step up the pace and structural content of fiscal consolidation. The authorities' plans, while commendably brought forward from earlier intentions, have been overtaken by events: the strength of the economy in 1995, the tightening of the EMU timetable, and the continuing difficulties of fashioning a working majority in Parliament. In this situation, policy credibility can best be enhanced by capitalizing on the Maastricht timetable through a set of front-loaded measures aimed at achieving the 3 percent of GDP deficit criterion in 1997. While such accelerated adjustment might have adverse consequences for growth in the short run, a well-designed, confidence-enhancing policy package would help ensure that such costs would soon be more than fully offset by favorable medium-term effects. The central element of the confidence-building program would thus be a primary fiscal adjustment of some 2%-3 percent of GDP over the next two years. To secure the required confidence gains, the adjustment should be front-loaded in 1996--exploiting the still propitious economic conditions--and the measures for 1997 legislated at an early stage. As much as possible of the adjustment should be on the expenditure side, as in the authorities' plans. While the scope for cuts with fast-yielding effects has been gradually narrowed, such scope remains and is not negligible; its use will however require that hard choices be made to curtail otherwise beneficial spending that a high-debt country simply cannot afford. To this end, all the options identified during the discussions will need to be kept on the table. But expenditure cuts alone are unlikely to yield sufficient immediate savings to secure the recommended additional adjustment. The current plan's commitment not to raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio from its 1995 level is misplaced in Italy's current circumstances. Alongside the all-important effort to reduce widespread tax evasion, where recent measures are welcome, an early increase in VAT and excise taxes is, in the staff's view, an unavoidable part of the needed fiscal adjustment. Although this may have a temporary impact on headline inflation, this effect would be tempered by a strengthening of the exchange rate, to the extent that it is seen as part of a coherent package to rectify Italy's public finance imbalances. In time, the savings generated by the consolidation effort can and should be used to lower direct tax rates without worsening the overall balance. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - With a credible acceleration of fiscal adjustment, the setting for monetary policy would become more favorable. In such circumstances, monetary policy should foster the confidence-induced appreciation of the lira in order to reduce inflation and provide the basis for the early and durable reduction in interest rates required by the public finances. A stronger lira, together with a more stable political situation that reduces foreign exchange market volatility, are preconditions for ERM re-entry. In the absence of a renewed fiscal effort, however, the burden on monetary policy would remain considerable. Indeed, monetary policy might need to be tightened further if slippages in the 1996 budget are not rectified in a timely manner or if wage increases threaten to be inconsistent with target inflation. The central bank's determination to react in this way must be clear to those involved in negotiating fiscal measures and wage settlements. To sustain the credibility gained through accelerated fiscal adjustment and monetary rigor, structural reform needs to be given renewed impetus. In particular, a reform of the budget process stands out as essential to sound public finances. Such a reform should encompass all stages of the budget process; bring fully to bear the macroeconomic constraints on spending; increase accountability, now unacceptably diffuse; and ensure transparency in the plethora of inordinately obscure budget documents. The recent pension reform introduced a system characterized by clear rules, actuarially sound principles, and appreciable savings over the next decade. It failed however to eliminate completely the asymmetry in the treatment of dependent and self-employed workers, it is to be phased in at an extremely slow pace, and it leaves in place a comparatively generous system by international standards. These are issues that will need to be addressed, at the latest, in the periodic reviews of the projected savings. There are two other areas where decisive structural action is called for. With the law on regulatory authorities finally in place, the privatization of large public utilities should now proceed apace. In addition, privatization of banks owned by public foundations should be given a high priority. Finally, the persistence of unemployment and the duality between North and South highlight the need for reforms to increase labor market flexibility, including through greater regional wage differentiation. In sum, the staff recommends a strategy of accelerated fiscal adjustment supported by monetary, incomes and structural policies. This is a difficult course, but it is doable and highly desirable. Difficult because it will mean confronting some hard choices in the public finances, and will involve some temporary repercussions for the real economy. Doable because the additional adjustment required is not far beyond what is needed to meet the government's present plans, and not without precedent in other European countries. And desirable because it will ease the burden of high interest rates, help disinflation, and enable the country to share fully in the benefits of European integration.

The authorities publish a full range of economic and financial data. During the discussions, the staff explored means to improve the electronic transmission of data. 1. Real sector Household income accounts are not available on a quarterly basis and releases of national accounts often lag those in other G-7 countries. Italy has not been a regular and timely reporter of real sector statistics to the Fund for IFS purposes. 2. Government finance Budget documents lack transparency and focus excessively on the state sector. 3. Balance of pavments Balance of payments data are submitted according to the national presentation and need to be converted to the presentation of the Fifth Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. In addition, there are methodological issues concerning mainly the financial account of the balance of payments.
