Discussions were held during June 12-23. The Indonesian team was led by State Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance, and Industry, Kwik Kian Gie, and included Finance Minister Sudibyo, Acting Bank Indonesia Governor Nasution, and other members of the Economic Team. The staff also met with Parliamentary Speaker Tanjung, and members of the President’s National Economic Council. The staff team comprised Messrs. Singh (head), Moghadam, Giorgianni, Vamvakidis, Ms. Ramakrishnan (all APD), Mr. Perone (PDR), Mr. Mansoor (FAD), Mr. Dattels (MAE), and Mr. Mahar (assistant, APD). The team worked closely with overlapping MAE and LEG technical assistance missions. Messrs. Dodsworth, Downes, Felman, and Ha from the Fund resident office, Messrs. Baird and Nehru from the World Bank resident mission, and Mr. Kuek from the AsDB resident mission worked closely with the teams. Indonesia is an Article VIII country, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on current international transactions. The capital account is basically free; the main remaining restrictions are on derivative transactions, and market issues by nonresidents. Indonesia has not yet accepted the proposed Fourth Amendment to the Articles. At the 1999 Article IV consultation, and on a number of occasions since then, Executive Directors have emphasixed the need to accelerate bank and corporate restructuring with improved governance. Directors have also recently emphasized that the authorities need to deliver concrete results in these areas. Indonesia has subscribed to SDDS, although there are serious weaknesses in the database, notably for fiscal measurement and in the balance of payments data. A safeguards assessment is planned for October.

Indonesia is in the third year of reform following the Asian crisis, under the framework of Fund-supported programs, and Fund exposure is about $10 billion. . Macroeconomic stability has been substantially restored. Prices have been flat for more than a year, reserves have recovered to the equivalent of about 80 percent of short-term debt, and the economy has been growing since late 1999. . A new democratically elected government has been in place since last year. . However, there are fragilities. The recovery is narrowly based. Although important progress has been made in recent months in driving asset recovery by IBRA and the JITF, viewed over a longer perspective, this area has been a major weakness of the reform programs. Also, market sentiment has deteriorated in 2000, placing the economic achievements at risk. . Therefore, the medium-term outlook is not assured. Although the macroeconomic framework under the program is still within reach, risks of an alternate scenariereflecting a prolonged period of reform weakness and domestic uncertainty-have increased. Such an alternative outlook would seriously weaken the prospects for fiscal sustainability and introduce new vulnerabilities. Policy Issues . Indonesia faces four sets of policy challenges in the medium term: 9 Speeding up asset recovery and restructuring. Political leadership will be required to change the incentive structure faced by recalcitrant debtors. 9 Restoring the banking system to full profitability. Enhancing supervision and governance, and reprivatizating banks will be essential. 9 Implementing decentrahzation with fiscal neutrality. Safeguards are also necessary to avoid failures of service delivery that could cause instability. 9 Greatly improving the governance of public institutions. Fiscal transparency and privatization top the agenda. . Reasonable progress has been made in these areas since the first review. While close monitoring will remain essential, the staff recommends completing the second review. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2- 1. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Brief Perspective 1. Indonesia is into its third year of economic reform following the crisis. Indonesia’s reforms have been strongly supported by the international community, within the framework of three Fund-supported programs, and Indonesia’s obligations to the Fund now amount to the equivalent of about $10 billion. The first two arrangements with the Fund were interrupted, and new arrangements were put in place following changes in the political leadership.’ 2. Significant progress has been achieved in macroeconomic stabilization. Although stabilization and economic reform failed to take early root under the first stand-by arrangement, macroeconomic stability was restored progressively during the 1998 extended arrangement. Recovery has also begun (Text Table A and Figure 1). Table A. Macroeconomic Stabilization and Growth 1998 1999 mm Jan.-Jun.

However, progress in structural reforms has been slow and uneven, especially in the core bank and corporate restructuring areas. Bank recapitalization and restructuring have moved ahead only with significant delays, and a principal weakness of the successive programs has been the virtual absence of corporate debt restructuring. Lack of political ‘Indonesia’s first stand-by arrangement (SBA) was approved on November 5, 1997, with a total amount equivalent to SDR 3.7 billion being drawn (out of a total of SDR 8.3 billion). The SBA was replaced by an extended arrangement on August 25, 1998, under which the equivalent of about SDR 3.8 billion was drawn (out of an augmented total of SDR 5.4 billion). A new extended arrangement for SDR 3.6 billion was approved on February 4, 2000 and, thus far, about SDR 0.5 billion has been drawn.

The consensus for improving fiscal transparency and governance in the public sector has also been weak, keeping market confidence low in Indonesia’s reform programs. These areas, together with the compliance of Indonesia’s banking system with international prudential standards, remain the core outstanding tasks for sustaining the recovery. 4. Against this background, the transition to a democratically elected government last year gave rise to an initial upturn in confidence. Indeed, the new government moved quickly to adopt a Fund-supported economic program, and secured necessary financing assurances through a successful Consultative Group meeting and a Paris Club rescheduling. However, the new coalition government inherited deep political, social, and economic problems that have generally taken precedence over economic reforms. During its first nine months in offtce, the authorities have been confronted with an upsurge of sectarian violence, threats of secession from various provinces, and a series of political disputes and scandals. All of these developments have severely strained the political alliance supporting the government, and affected the implementation of the economic program. 5. Nevertheless, macroeconomic stability has been sustained and progress is beginning to be made in the core structural areas of the new program-which are to press forward with bank and corporate debt restructuring, accelerate asset recovery, and restore faith in public institutions. Although the first bimonthly review was delayed by implementation slippages, the government has since tried to move more forcefully, particularly in recapitalizing and restructuring the banking sector, and pushing forward the process of asset recovery and debt restructuring. Recent Economic and Market Developments 6. The macroeconomic achievements under the program are still fragile: . The recoverv remains narrowlv based (Fig& 2). Although amnt”al real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2000 was 3.2 percent, above the 7. program assumption of 2 percent, the recovery has depended primarily 6o on private consumption (rising non- oil export volumes have also helped 5o in recent months).

Gross fixed’investment appears to have bottomed out but, with real GDP still some 10 percent below pre-crisis level, there has been minimal new investment.

The CPI has been flat for most of the first half of 2000-reflecting the large output gap as well as restrained fiscal and monetary policies. However, the depreciation of the rupiah in 2000 (see below) risks unsettling price expectations, especially with respect to the sensitive rice price, and 12-month inflation rose to 2 percent in June. . The poverty situation, although improving, remains highly vulnerable. Available data indicate that the return to positive growth and declines in food prices over the past year have had a significant impact in reducing the poverty rate. According to some estimates, the poverty rate that had peaked in mid-l 998 (at about 20 percent), has since returned to 11% percent, which is close to its pre-crisis level (about 8- 10 percent). However, more than half the population is judged to face a high risk of falling below the poverty line.2 As such, the impact of sudden shocks-such as a further depreciation of the rupiah--on the social and poverty situation would be high, and risk unraveling the progress that has been made over the past year. . Although external accounts and reserves have developed more favorably than expected in 2000, there are continuing weaknesses. The trade balance was in surplus by over $6 billion in the first quarter, and net international reserves (NIR) are above the program floor by about $3 billion. However, these developments have reflected the impact of the higher oil price and continued weakness in non-oil imports (which have been significantly below program projections), rather than a broad-based recovery of non-oil exports (though there are encouraging signs of a pick up).’ Private capital flows, have yet to recover and, as such, nonborrowed reserves are still low and external vulnerability remains high (Figure 3).4 Rescheduling agreements with the government’s international creditors have provided temporary relief. As stipulated in the Paris Club agreement, the authorities reached agreement with a steering committee of bank creditors to reschedule some $346 million of payments falling due on two syndicated bank loans. Discussions on rescheduling another $35 million of bilateral bank loans are underway. *The forthcoming Selected Issues paper contains a chapter prepared by the World Bank on recent trends in the poverty situation in Indonesia. ‘Although non-oil export growth is recovering in 2000, this is over a weak 1999 base, and limited to resource-intensive sectors with relatively low demand for imported inputs and financing. The lack of corporate debt restructuring as well as of trade finance are regarded as the main factors keeping Indonesia’s export recovery below that of other Asian countries. 4The forthcoming Selected Issues paper contains a chapter on external developments and vulnerability set in a medium-term context of alternative scenarios.

Political uncertainties combined with slow policy implementation have caused the rupiah to depreciate by about 20 percent in nominal effective terms during 2000, much of it materializing since the first quarter. The rupiah continues to trade around Rp 9,000 to the U.S. dollar, well below a range consistent with economic fundamentals as assessed by the staff, and also well below the FY 2000 budget assumption of Rp 7,000. The exchange rate weakness goes beyond that explained by the strength of the dollar and the recent rise in U.S. interest rates, and has been much greater than other regional currencies (Text Figure B). Stock prices have fallen by about 25 percent in 2000, partly driven by the withdrawal of foreign investors (Text Figure C). Table 9.

Until end- March, forward exchange rate data were pricing the rupiah at about Rp 7,500 per dollar over the next year. Since then, forward rates progressively weakened in line with the Rp/$ spot rate-in July, the 12-month forward rate was over Rp 9,000 per dollar-while the July consensus forecast expects the rupiah (spot) to appreciate. The widening difference between the forward rate and market expectations for the spot rate points to an increase in the risk premium demanded by investors holding rupiah-denominated assets. 9. The room for easing monetary policy no longer exists, and short-term interest rates have risen. Since April, the rise in world interest rates and a widening of risk premia have led to an increase in the one-month SBI rate by over 250 basis points to 13% percent, the highest rate since July 1999. Forward market data which, until April, embodied sharp declines in short-term interest rates, now show increasing trends (Text Figure E). Longer- term interest rates have risen by more than short-term rates, implying a steepening of the yield curve (Text Figure F). With the increase in risk premia and the still relatively benign inflationary outlook, real interest rates remain very high and threaten the emerging recovery. 10. Reflecting the political nature of the uncertainties, BI has limited its foreign exchange intervention during this period. During Apt-i-July, intervention has been small-limited to about $20-$30 million of daily sales-and NIR remains almost $3 billion above the adjusted program floor. The authorities took the opportunity of lumpy oil and other receipts during the first quarter to accumulate reserves well ahead of the program path.

The fiscal deficit in 1999/2000 was substantially lower than expected (1.5 percent of GDP compared with a program projection of 3.8 percent) largely as a result of higher revenues, partly associated with higher oil prices. The FY 2000 budget-which aims at an overall deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP-is also benefiting from higher than assumed oil prices and related revenues. The additional revenues are, however, being partially offset by delayed fuel price increases, non-implementation of the VAT in Batam Island, and a more depreciated exchange rate than assumed in the budget. II. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK AND POLICIES A. Macroeconomic Framework 12. The authorities remain committed to achieving the main targets in the macroeconomic framework for 2000 (Tables 1 and 2). The framework aims at delivering 3-4 percent growth in 2000, keeping inflation in the low single-digit range and, as agreed at the first review, bringing about a faster recovery in gross foreign exchange reserves and further reducing Indonesia’s external vulnerability. The latest (July) consensus forecast is still consistent with this framework (Text Table C). Table C. Forecasts for 2000 July Consensus PrOgram Real GDP growth Private consumption Fixed investment CPI Inflation (averaee~ (Annual percent change) 3.8 34 3.5 S-6 3.3 4-5 3.9 34 Source: Asia Pacific Consensus~ 13. However, as explained above, the risks to the short-term outlook have increased. The potential for upside outcomes-as assessed at the first review-is now more than balanced by increased downside risks. Achievement of the macroeconomic framework for 2000 is predicated on a swift reduction of the political uncertainties, intensified program implementation~specially in the core areas of asset recovery and debt restructuring-and return of the exchange rate closer to the budget assumption. Even then, growth and inflation outcomes are likely to be centered closer to the lower and upper ends, respectively, of their target ranges. However, without the factors noted above, the emerging recovery could stall, placing at considerable risk the benign medium-term outlook that was developed at the time of approval of the 2000 extended arrangement (EBS/OO/S, l/20/2000).’ ‘Box A traces the impact of a weaker exchange rate on the macroeconomic framework. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- 14. The benign medium-term outlook is predicated on the entrenchment of a virtuous cycle-under which rising market confidence would stimulate new investment and capital inflows, reduce real interest rates, and raise growth.6 Under this scenario, asset recovery, intensified program implementation, and greater political stability drive rising market confidence. Corporate debt restructuring finally takes hold and is considerably advanced during 2001. As such, the output gap is closed relatively quickly (by 2002), the macroeconomic conditions steadily improve and remain strong, and Indonesia’s government debt burden falls from its recent level of about 90 percent of GDP to about 70 percent of GDP by 2003-04. However, even with this reduction in the public debt, the burden of government debt service payments on revenues will remain relatively high at about 40 percent, mitigated by continuing strong international financial support of Indonesia’s program. In this scenario, private flows progressively replace exceptional offtcial financing in an orderly way. 15. However, recent market pressures caution that the-medium-term outlook could develop differently. In such an alternate scenario, the Table D.

Official financing support is jeopardized and 6The baseline medium-term outlook-the benign scenario-has been updated from that contained in the staff report for the new extended arrangement (EBS/00/8), without significantly changing its major parameters and objectives. AMex I contrasts this revised baseline outlook with an alternate scenario. Greater detail on the two scenarios is contained in a chapter on the medium-term outlook and external vulnerability in the forthcoming Selected Issues paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- real GDP growth remains low. Text Table D illustrates the impact of the alternate scenario on the key macroeconomic targets. Although the alternate scenario is an extreme formulation, based on a prolonged period of reform weakness and domestic uncertainty, it is illustrative of the sensitivity of the baseline medium-term outlook. 16. The impact is most apparent in the debt and external vulnerability indicators. Under the alternate scenario, lower growth and asset recovery prevent the debt ratio from falling significantly below current high levels. The lack of financing possibilities forces persistent and large current account surpluses and compresses discretionary social spending in the fiscal budget, risking also the liquidity and solvency of the central government. Inflation would rise with a weak exchange rate, and the macroeconomic policy mix would need to contend with renewed uncertainty and outflows in the capital account. In particular, the return of flight capital would not take place, putting great pressure on reserves. Despite the large current account surpluses, the alternate scenario suggests that-in such an environment-reserves could quickly decline, narrowing effective coverage of imports and short-term debt, giving rise to external arrears, and jeopardizing external stability. Average obligations to the Fund would amount to the equivalent of about $4.8 billion in 2003-04, as much as 40 percent of projected reserves in the alternate scenario. 17. The alternate scenario underlines the significance of financial and corporate sector restructuring to Indonesia’s recovery. The private sector’s ability to invest, already much curtailed during the crisis, will remain weak until debt restructuring is firmly advanced. Further, as the capital market in Indonesia is not yet developed, bank credit will remain the main funding source for the corporate sector. In the absence of any improvement in corporate sector balance sheets, the capacity of the recapitalized banking system to extend credit will remain limited. The authorities recognize the link between asset restructuring and economic recovery, and they expressed their determination to intensify efforts in these areas, thereby allaying the concerns that drive the alternate scenario. B. Fiscal Policy 18. The team reviewed with the authorities the role of fiscal policy in delivering near-term recovery and contributing to medium-term fiscal sustainability. There was agreement that, given the increased risks to the emerging recovery, it is important to maintain fiscal stimulus in 2000, while planning for early consolidation. The FY 2000 budget implies a positive stimulus of about 1% percent of GDP, on the basis of an overall deficit target of 4% percent of GDP (Table 3). The authorities expressed their determination to avoid expenditure shortfalls, which would detract from the targeted fiscal stimulus, and maintain the efficacy of social expenditures. At the same time, the authorities agreed that higher oil revenues-that do not affect the stimulus-would be used to reduce the deficit below the targeted level in the interest of fiscal sustainability (13). ’ On the basis of recent ‘Henceforth, ‘T refers to relevant paragraphs of the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-IO- oil prices, the authorities have estimated that net oil revenues in FY 2000 (after allowing for oil subsidies and the delays in implementing petroleum price increases) could be higher than budgeted by about % percent of GDP. At this stage of the budget year, the authorities have assessed that the other factors influencing the budget outcome could be broadly balanced- with lower interest payments from the delayed issuance of restructuring bonds and an early encouraging trend in VAT receipts providing a margin against other revenue shortfalls and the impact of a more depreciated exchange rate. 19. The authorities remain committed to the fiscal reforms proposed in the context of the FY 2000 budget. They have agreed to implement the petroleum price increases on October 1, with compensation for the poor (7 4). At this stage it is their intention to impose the VAT on Batam island on January 1,200 1, although plans to develop the area into a free trade zone are being reviewed. Tax laws are at an advanced stage in Parliament and their passage is expected during August. Asset recovery plans for IBRA and for the privatization of state-owned enterprises have been elaborated consistent with the original budget targets (Sections IV and VI). 20. The team discussed three principal aspects of a forward-looking strategy to begin fiscal consolidation consistent with the baseline medium-term outlook. First, the team cautioned the authorities that the macroeconomic risks of fiscal decentralization need to be quickly addressed to allow for its orderly implementation, safeguarding the central government’s revenue base (Section III). Second, the authorities agreed that future wage policy-including any increase in October-needs to be closely linked to civil service reform in the context of decentralization; these plans are under study, for which the authorities are trying to build consensus, and proposals are expected by September. Third, the authorities have begun initial work toward the 2001 budget, and are basing their efforts on a framework that anticipates a reduction in the budget deficit to about 3.7 percent of GDP, as foreshadowed in the baseline medium-term outlook. In particular, the Minister of Finance is planning to strengthen the revenue effort in 200 1, and to improve fiscal transparency and measurement by the start of the next fiscal year (Section VI). C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 21. Monetary and exchange rate policies have come under renewed scrutiny, from within and outside the government (and BI), because of declining market sentiment. The general perception that short-term political factors have driven the declining rupiah has made it difficult to formulate a monetary policy response. With considerable slack in the economy, the authorities have debated whether monetary tightening is an appropriate response, given that political uncertainties have been at the core of the problem. The authorities acknowledged that their public debate on these issues had confused markets, and that lessons had been learned from the experience. In the end, monetary policy has been gradually tightened, foreign exchange intervention has been limited so as not to resist underlying trends, and the authorities have reconfirmed their commitment to a floating exchange rate system and an open capital account. The staff has agreed with this approach, particularly since the consensus forecast continues to anticipate early appreciation of the spot Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-ll- rupiah rate;.more aggressive monetary tightening would be unlikely to offset the political concerns driving market weakness, and could risk further unsettling bank and corporate restructuring. 22. The authorities were confident that their recent monetary tightening should help bring base money within the program path (Table 4). They pointed out that base money had moved above the program path because of increased currency demand by the public, and could not be abruptly reversed. Contributory factors had included cash withdrawals from banks that are being merged with Danamon-a consequence of fmther delays in implementing Danamon’s recapitalization and integration, as well as political uncertainty and weakening confidence ahead of the August meeting of the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR). 23. Provided market confidence improves, the monetary tightening should be temporary. The team agreed that, as confidence returns and risk premia fall, the room to lower interest rates should return. It was agreed to revisit the base money program once market sentiment had durably improved. Meanwhile, with NIR well above the original program floor, the authorities have agreed to raise this floor by about $l% billion (about half of the excess margin above the current program path); in doing so, they have been motivated by sending a strong signal that macroeconomic policies will be protective of the reserve gains that have been achieved thus far under the program. III. FISCAL DECENTRAJBATION 24. The authorities are preparing to implement an ambitious decentrallzation plan in 2001. The context for their efforts, and the main outstanding preparatory steps, are summarized in Box B (and MEFP Box 2). The authorities acknowledged that the plan has to contend with numerous obstacles and carefully balance conflicting interests, especially in light of the troubled situation in some regions. The central challenge is to develop a pragmatic and phased approach-in light of low administrative capacity in many districts- while meeting political imperatives and containing centrifugal forces. The team reviewed the macroeconomic and microeconomic (including governance-related) risks to decentralization, and discussed the measures that could be taken to reduce these risks. Overall, the team emphasized that delays to making operational the key implementing institutions had raised the risks of decentralization, and that much strengthened efforts and better coordination will be necessary to bring about orderly implementation. A. Macroeconomic Risks 25. The macroeconomic risks arise from the specified revenue sharing arrangements. These arrangements specify minimum levels of domestic revenues to be transferred. However, the underlying laws-as well as the regulations issued thus far--do not provide a positive list of activities to be assumed by regional governments. Thus, the risk remains that the general government deficit could rise following decentralization, if Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. 12 - subnational government spending rises without a matching reduction in central government expenditure. 26. Decentralixed revenues are expected to total about 4% percent of GDP in 2001.’ In comparison, discretionary transfers in FY 200%matched by subnational spending- already amount to about 3% percent of GDP. However, the authorities agreed that the macroeconomic risk was larger than the incremental resources (1 l/4 percent of GDP) to be transferred to subnational governments. This was for at least three reasons: (i) spending units within regional govermuents would likely change following the implementation of decentralization; (ii) there could be resistance to the absorption of staff and projects at the subnational government level; and (iii) new spending initiatives could be launched by the resource-rich districts benefiting from revenue-sharing provisions. The staff estimates that the macroeconomic risk could reach up to 2% percent of GDP, and emphasized that coordinated efforts were needed to minimize it. 27. The team discussed a range of measures to contain the macroeconomic risk. Most importantly, the team urged early identification of the functions that would be transferred to absorb the resources decentralized in 200 1, and robust mechanisms to assure compliance on the part of the subnational governments. The Coordinating Team (CT) is leading efforts to complete the identification of transferred functions by September, ahead of tinalizing the 2001 budget. The team discussed other safeguards to fiscal neutrality, most importantly, subjecting subnational government borrowing to strict limits, and precluding bank lending to the subnational governments. The authorities appreciated the lessons from international experience, and expressed their determination to avoid the problem of excessive local government borrowing in Indonesia. The team proposed, in particular, that all borrowing by subnational governments should be prohibited until the transition to decentralization is complete and the transferred resources have been efficiently and fully absorbed. The authorities are considering this proposal. In any event, they pointed out that external borrowing at the local level will require prior central government approval. Finally, the authorities agreed to build in a contingency in the 2001 budget to cover the risks of nonneutrality, and are developing a new budget monitoring system at the district level. B. Microeconomic Risks 28. Decentralization in Indonesia harbors considerable microeconomic risks. These risks could arise from a number of sources. Lack of clarity in expenditure assignments could interrupt the delivery of essential services, specially since the decentralized expenditures lie principally in the social spending areas. Lack of oversight could give rise to new governance problems in spending and renewed corruption. There could be delays in or obstacles to the reassignment of human, physical, and financial resources that could aggravate this problem. In particular, since the process entails a large scale reassignment of central government *This is the minimum level prescribed in the law, and the authorities expect to adhere to it. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - personnel to regions, there could be resistance from both sides-the reassigned personnel as well as the receiving subnational governments. The authorities considered these risks to be small because health and education personnel (especially teachers), who comprise the majority of the transferred personnel, already are located in the regions.9 In any event, regulations are being developed governing the reassignment of personnel in the context of planned civil service reform. Contingency plans are being drawn up for the central government to maintain service delivery in key areas where there could be failures at the local level. Finally, the World Bank is working with the authorities to maintain governance in decentralized spending, building on the safeguards that were developed for social safety net expenditures. IV. BANKING SYSTEM REFORMS 29. The reform programs since late-1997 have focused on addressing Indonesia’s systemic banking crisis. The ultimate object has been to restore a viable banking system, more resilient to shocks and with stronger safeguards that would allow an orderly replacement of the comprehensive public guarantee of bank liabilities by a limited deposit insurance scheme. The first phase of the strategy stretched through mid-1999 and required 66 unviable private banks (with a market share of 14 percent) to be closed; 13 private banks (market share of 21 percent) to be taken over (BTO) by the government (through IBRA); and 4 state banks (market share of 25 percent) to be merged as part of their resolution process. As a result, over 70 percent of the banking system has come under state control (Text Table E). Subsequent phases of the strategy aim at recapitalizing and restructuring the banking system, instilling good governance, and reprivatization. Table E.

Overall, the 2.8 million central government employees to be eventually decentralized, 2.3 million are already in regions. In 2001, some 0.7 million of the central government personnel may have to be physically transferred from the center (0.3 million) and from provincial capitals (0.4 million) to districts.

Considerable progress has finally been made in recapitalizing the state banks. Because of their size and insolvency, this has been the most expensive part of the exercise. When completed, state banks are expected to require a total bond issue of over Rp 300 trillion, about two-third of the estimated total cost of recapitalizing the banking system (Text Table F). Table F. Projected Bond Issuance for Bank Recapitalization and Resolution Rp.

The strategy has provided for a number of safeguards to accompany recapitalization. These safeguards have included changes of management on the basis of new tests of fitness and propriety, approval of business plans, the engagement of international firms to assist in key areas of bank management, and the rationalization of staff and functions. Nevertheless, the cost of recapitalizing the state banks has turned out to be much more than was originally expected. Many factors contributed to the increased recapitalization cost, especially the lack of transparency as to the true condition of the banks at the outset, declining loan recoveries, long periods of negative interest margins, and the protracted nature of the process of developing and agreeing on viable business plans. The two largest state banks-Mandiri and BNI-have been restored to a capital adequacy ratio of over 4 percent of risk-weighted assets, and the other state banks (BRI and BTN) should be recapitalized during the second of half of 2000 (129-30). Mandiri’s restructuring has been especially complex because it entailed the integration of four deeply insolvent state banks. 32. However, the restructuring process at the state banks is still far from complete, and a number of risks remain. The largest state banks-especially Mandiri--continue to face serious liquidity problems, and their open positions in foreign currency still need to be fully unwound. These risks would be heightened by prolonged weakness of the rupiah. Despite some progress in operational restructuring, the state banks also need to downsize considerably further, thereby reducing their high operating costs, raising their earnings potential, and preparing to raise their capital adequacy ratios through privatization. However, recent management changes in the state banks have become politicized, taking place without Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- the recommended international executive search process, while Bank Mandiri has also allowed its management contracts with an international bank to lapse. These events have created uncertainties in markets about the commitment to the restructuring process and, in particular, about the pace of divestment. Against this, the authorities have reassured the team that they remain fully committed to the agreed restructuring objectives. Banks taken over (BT0 banks) 33. The strategy for the BT0 banks called for their early privatization. This is because some of these banks-in particular banks BCA and Bali-were considered to have been among the strongest of the previously privately-owned banks, with attractive branch networks. Bank Danamon was to be used as a “platform bank” for the merger and downsizing of 8 BT0 banks and then sold. Thus, the strategy entailed that IBRA would begin divestment in 2000 and complete the sale of all the BT0 banks in 200 1. Toward this end, IBRA has sought to restructure and recapitalize the BT0 banks within an accelerated timeframe, although numerous delays have impeded the timetable.“’ Nevertheless, banks BCA and Niaga have now been fully recapitalized, an initial divestment (22.5 percent) of IBRA’s share in BCA has been completed, and the integration process for Danamon is moving ahead (122). In parallel, IBRA has been trying to reach settlement with the former owners of the BT0 banks with respect to their prudential violations (Section V.A). 34. There have been a number of obstacles to the orderly implementation of this strategy for the BT0 banks. Delays in reaching governmental consensus on the resolution strategy were a major contributing factor for each of these banks. In the case of Bank Bali, its capitalization and subsequent sale to an international bank had to be abandoned after the former owners mounted a legal challenge and the staff of the bank resisted the sale. The authorities have now reached agreement with the former owners, allowing Bank Bali to be recapitalized wholly by IBRA, in preparation for its privatization. Regarding Bank BCA, the authorities have been discouraged by the market response to its IPO, although the team stressed that the decision to exclude strategic and bank investors was an important contributing factor.” In the case of Bank Danamon, the strategy to integrate 8 deeply insolvent BT0 banks into it has been a major challenge because it is tantamount to virtual closure of the integrating banks; resistance to the integration has delayed the process and ‘90 accelerate the reprivatization of the BT0 banks, IBRA undertook a more radical transfer of nonperforming loans from most of them, taking also category 4 loans off the books of the banks. ” Market analysts have also pointed out that an inadequate income-yielding loan portfolio deterred potential investors and depressed the price. The recapitalization bonds in bank BCA carry an interest rate well below average lending rates, which reduces the return on equity of the bank. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- increased the cost of resolution. Finally, the team detected growing resistance within the government and Parliament to sales to foreign banks. 35. However, the authorities have reassured the team that the strategy of quickly resolving and privatizing the BT0 banks remains intact. The new MEFP commits the government to seek majority privatization of banks BCA and Niaga during the second half of 2000, and to sell Bank Danamon in 2001 (~21-22). IBRA’s present estimate is to obtain Rp 3 trillion in FY 2000 from the sale of banks BCA and Niaga. However, parliamentary approval for these sales has still to be secured. B. Future Prospects 36. The team discussed with the authorities the factors that bear on the future strength of the banking system. One key plank is to maintain a strong and independent central bank, especially in light of the political criticism Bank Indonesia (BI) has encountered in recent months. The team stressed the importance of fully implementing all the corrective actions that have been developed in response to the disclaimer issued by the Supreme Audit (BPK) on BI’s accounts late last year. BI explained that it was basically on track in implementing these corrective actions. The SDDS standard has been adopted, the divestiture program for BI’s subsidiaries is being finalized, and an improved opinion from the Supreme Audit (BPK) has been secured on BI’s 1999 financial accounts (7 35). 37. The authorities also drew attention to a number of indicators that suggested the banking system had stabilized. In particular, they pointed out that aggregate interest margins (net of provisions) became positive in late-1999 and that there was a retum to profitability in the recapitalized banks in 2000. The authorities agreed that much improved supervision by BI and renewed commitment by the Ministry of Finance to maintaining governance were crucial to restoring viability. However, such oversight was still at an early stage, and the staff emphasized that the provisions in the program for an onsite presence at the state banks had yet to be fully implemented and tested (Box C). 38. Therefore, the team cautioned that risks remained high in the banking system and that the full restoration of intermediation would likely be delayed. All the resources necessary to raise supervision capacity had yet to be committed within BI, establishment of a physical presence within state banks had been subject to delays, and uncertainties were beginning to arise from the planned transfer of the supervision function out of BI by 2002 (as stipulated in the new central bank law). In addition, prolonged weakness of the currency would have serious implications for bank restructuring and profitability. Also, banks that intend to undertake substantial new lending would likely need to raise additional capital, especially in light of the need to achieve an 8 percent capital adequacy ratio by end-2001. In this context, the team emphasized the benefits of maintaining an attractive environment for the entry of foreign investment into the banking system, while closely monitoring the ability of many private banks to achieve the 8 percent capital ratio. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- 39. The team emphasized that financial intermediation risked remaining constrained even if bank profitability and liquidity were improved. A deterrent to new lending was the slow pace of corporate restructuring and the absence of creditworthy borrowers. Also, the substantial resumption of lending will likely require greater market confidence in the legal and juridical basis on which the banks can operate. In this regard, the legal reforms in the program aimed at delivering consistent application of the bankruptcy law, and ability to seize collateral, would be crucial. Finally, the team pointed out that broader capital market reform and development would be important to restoring intermediation and growth. Greater reliance on corporate bonds and equity, rather than on bank credit, needed to be nurtured. V. CORPOIUTEDEBTRESTRLJCTLJRING 40. Previous staff reports have pointed to the lack of corporate debt restructuring as among the most significant weaknesses of the Indonesian reform programs. Against this background, the team reviewed with the authorities, the World Bank, and private sector representatives how best to acquire momentum in this area. While many saw room for improving the institutional structure, the clear consensus was on the need to change the incentive structure facing debtors, through raising the legal deterrent. The INDRA scheme- introduced in 1998 to provide an exchange rate guarantee to restructuring debtors-had not attracted interest from the private sector, and has been allowed to expire.” 41. As part of the institutional setting, the team focused on the functioning of IBRA and JITF, the two main institutions that have led corporate debt restructuring. IBRA- as a major creditor and owner with extraordinary legal powers-has the ability to force restructurings and asset sales. In contrast, the JITF has had a very different mandate- seeking to mediate out-of-court settlements between private debtors and creditors-since it does not hold the debt itself. Under the enhanced corporate restructuring framework that has now been adopted by the authorities, the JITF has acquired some leverage to ensure that the restructuring process in high profile cases moves as quickly as possible. However, essential differences remain. Most importantly, whereas IBRA can directly use its special legal powers, and its staff have been indemnified against legal challenge, the JITF’s enhanced leverage relies on an incentive structure of “sticks and carrots.” Also, the JITF’s new framework has still to be tested for its effectiveness+specially the newly acquired ability to refer recalcitrant debtors to the Attorney General for legal actions in the “public interest.” The role of the judiciary will be a key determinant of progress for both IBRA and the JITF. ‘*Only one firm has made use of the facility. Generally, debtors and creditors have appeared to have been distrustful of the scheme because it requires them to provide resources up front to the government. Also, the original motivation for the scheme no longer exists. Current uncertainties notwithstanding, the rupiah is relatively more stable compared with its behavior at the depth of the crisis, and interest rates have come down to pre-crisis levels. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- A. IBRA 42. IBRA is critical to the success of corporate debt restructuring. The total nominal book value of IBRA’s industrial assets and transferred loans is reported at Rp 370 trillion, equivalent to about US$45 billion.” More than half of IBRA’s portfolio is concentrated in its transferred loans (held by its AMC), with the remainder comprising of (mainly industrial) assets pledged by former banks owners (held by its AMI). However, the market value of these assets has declined from earlier estimates, and is now estimated at less than Rp 100 trillion. Failure of the former bank owners to pledge-and transfer-sufficient assets to meet their settlement obligations has contributed to the low market value of IBRA’s assets. At this stage of the program, the team’s efforts focused on finalizing an appropriate governance structure for IBRA and developing a detailed and time-bound schedule for accelerating asset sales and restructurings during the second half of 2000, consistent with the budget target for cash asset recovery from IBRA (Annex 2). Governance framework 43. Although IBRA was established in 1998, it has lacked a proper governance structure. IBRA’s weaknesses were highlighted in the recently completed audit.14 Since the exposure of the Bank Bali scandal last year, the authorities have been trying to adopt a governance structure that balances independence with accountability. After successive delays, such a structure has now been adopted (7 13-15). The main element is the creation of a new governing board for IBRA comprised of independent and professional members. This is supported by the World Bank and the Fund, who advised strongly against the creation of a political board consisting of the economic ministers-recommended by the independent consultants. Policy oversight will continue to be exercised by the FSPC. 44. The new governing board faces a number of early tests. First, it needs to ensure that comprehensive corrective actions are taken in response to the results of IBRA’s first audit. Second, it needs to give much greater momentum to asset sales and loan restructurings, so that the FY 2000 recovery target can be met and assets returned to the private sector. Third, the new board must entrench procedures to maintain quality control over “This excludes IBRA’s investments in the seven private banks that have been recapitalized at public expense and in the BT0 banks. “‘The auditors have issued a disclaimer opinion to IBRA’s accounts on the grounds that (i) the accounting standards used by IBRA do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) liquidity support and payments under the deposit guarantee could not be reconciled with BI and the Ministry of Finance; and (iii) the ultimate value of assets and the size of contingent liabilities could not yet be determined as they depend on the outcome of pending legal actions and other factors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- restructurings, to avoid accommodating special interests of debtors and creditors, and to safeguard the interest of the state. Asset Management Credits (AMC) Operations 45. IBRA’s AMC expects cash asset recovery of about Rp W-9 trillion in FY 2000, almost half of IBRA’s total recovery target. The majority of Ah4C’s receipts is expected to accrue from the settlement, auction, or refinancing of its corporate loans, including from the 21 largest obligors. 46. The AMC’s strategy has been to focus on the largest debtqrs, while outsourcing or selling smaller loans (1 18-19). This strategy has been appropriate given that the large corporate debtors (those over Rp 50 billion) represent more than three quarters of the value of loans, but about 1 percent of the total number of debtors. The authorities explained that results are slowly being achieved. They have met their initial target of drawing up restructuring term sheets or filing legal actions for about 35 percent of the 21 largest obligors’ debt value.15 Were this progress to be sustained, IBRA expects to have dealt with all of its 21 largest obligors by the end of the year. I6 However, noncooperation from debtors remains a substantial problem and, although IBRA has intensified legal actions against such debtors, much will depend upon follow-through by the Attorney General and more consistent decisions from the judiciary. Indeed, the Attorney General has recently announced that he is taking four noncooperative former bank owners to court. Asset Management Investment (AMI) Operations 47. IBRA’s AM1 has faced complex challenges in dealing with the shareholder settlements with former owners. The process of reaching settlement agreements has been prolonged, associated asset transfers have been delayed, and IBRA’s control over the holding companies’ assets has been compromised by a complex management structure that has effectively left ownership rights with the former owners. As a result, asset value has eroded. Recent estimates suggest that less than a third of the book value of the shareholder settlements are covered by the market value of transferred assets. IBRA is undertaking a legal review of the shareholder settlements to assess whether the former bank owners are liable for additional transfers of assets. I5 The 21 largest obligors represent the consolidation of 340 debtors and account for close to 40 percent of IBRA’s corporate debtors. I6 The AMC has established a monitoring system that allows it to track the restructuring of loans through eight stages from initial negotiation to the signing of term sheets (stage six) and, finally, to settlement. Most of the corporate loans that are in the FY 2000 program have already reached at least stage six. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - 48. IBRA’s AM1 expects to contribute about Rp 7 trillion from the cash sale of industrial and other assets in FY 2000. As with the AMC, this is an ambitious target, given the low cooperation of the former bank owners. To advance the process, IBRA has obtained letters of commitment from most bank owners, and financial advisors are being appointed for each planned asset sale. Nevertheless, risks remain that the owners or current management teams could still seek to block the sales of their companies. B. JITF 49. For the first time, quantitative targets for JITF-led restructurings have been adopted by the authorities. The JITF’s strategic target is to complete debt restructurings with a book value of about $12 billion by April 200 1, building on the progress that has been made since the first review (7 3842). A quarterly time path toward this end has been agreed with the authorities. Achievement of this objective will depend-inter alia-on building up the JITF’s caseload. Toward this end, the FSPC is committed to refer a steady stream of high-profile cases to the JITF for structured mediation, and quantitative targets for such referrals are structural performance criteria for end-September and end-December 2000. 50. The team emphasised that much will depend on the JITF’s ability to apply the enhanced structure of incentives and penalties on debtors. Provision has been made for the application of a number of penalties on noncooperative debtors who do not negotiate in good faith under the new time-bound structured mediation procedures. Penalties include the delisting of companies from the Indonesian stock exchanges and the referral of debtors to the Attorney General. At the same time, the authorities have broadened the incentives for debtors who successfully restructure under the new procedures. These incentives include temporary tax relief and accelerated conversions of debt to equity (y 43). Finally, the FSPC has directed IBRA to support JITF-led restructurings wherever it is a minority creditor. C. Supporting Legal Reforms 51. The virtual absence of a legal deterrent to recalcitrant debtors has been a root cause of the lack of progress in corporate debt restructuring. Although reform of the insolvency system was an early objective of the successive economic programs, there is general consensus that the judiciary has been resistant to reform.” As such, IBRA’s efforts in filing cases in the commercial court against noncooperative debtors have met with limited success. IBRA has been the lead or supporting creditor in 45 separate such tilings, but has ” Early in Indonesia’s reform process, the bankruptcy law was amended and measures developed to improve its application by the judiciary. Key amendments included the establishment of a specialized commercial court to hear bankruptcy petitions and strengthened rules for more expeditious and transparent proceedings. (See the paper on Corporate Restructuring and Related Legal Reforms in the forthcoming Selected Issues). The Fund has provided technical assistance in this area, see Annex V. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- received adverse rulings in at least half of these cases. Market observers and legal analysts have commonly attributed the adverse rulings to external influence on the court system. 52. The current program contains intensified measures to address governance within the court system (7 46-49). A key part of the strategy has been to appoint ad hoc judges from the private sector to the commercial court. Effective implementation of this measure has been excessively delayed, initially because of resistance from the judiciary and, more recently, because of difficulties in reaching agreement with candidates to serve as prospective judges. The authorities explained that the obstacles to the assignment of ad hoc judges to actual cases before the commercial court have now been overcome. In particular, the Supreme Court has met a key condition of ad hoc judges, namely, to allow them to publish dissenting opinions. Ad hoc judges have recently been assigned to two bankruptcy cases tiled by IBRA. 53. The authorities have acknowledged that meaningful progress in legal reforms will ultimately depend upon a comprehensive overhaul of the judiciary. The President has accorded high priority to this objective. The process involves replacing most of the judges in Jakarta, including in the Commercial Court. Markets have focused on the candidate to succeed the retiring Chief Justice, as this appointment would send a strong message about the government’s commitment to address corruption in the court system, and on anticipated appointments to till vacant seats in the Supreme Court. The authorities have told the team that they are strongly committed to working with Parliament to appoint well regarded jurists-many from outside the judiciary-to these positions. The new MEFP also reports on progress with other initiatives to address corruption in the court system. The authorities were confident that, through their judicial reform program, an irreversible progress has been set in train that will ultimately improve court governance, although all the results may not be achieved immediately. VI. OTHERSTRUCTURALREFORMS 54. The economic program includes an agenda for improving fiscal transparency, public sector governance, and preparing key sectors for restructuring and privatization. The Fund has essentially led the fiscal transparency measures, while the AsDB has been in the lead on privatization and enterprise reform. The authorities acknowledged that a firm consensus within the government and the Parliament has yet to develop in all these areas. Nevertheless, progress was being made, and the authorities acknowledged that this was necessary for anchoring market confidence in the program. 55. The fiscal transparency measures embrace the following initiatives (15 l-53): (i) preparation of a law to increase oversight of private foundations; (ii) identification, eventual integration, and audit of all off-budget accounts (including the military); and (iii) improvement of treasury management by-inter alia-consolidating bank accounts. The law on private foundations has been submitted for Parliamentary approval as envisaged, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - considerable importance is attached to its early passage.” In the absence of such a law, compliance by ministries and government agencies with the Presidential instruction to report to the Ministry of Finance all off-budget funds has been low, and the staff has urged that sanctions be imposed on those ministries and agencies that have not cooperated. In response, the Minister of Finance has asked the State Audit Board (BPKP) to investigate likely misreporting by auditing their accounts. The BPKP has also begun its audit of the military, but its effective completion will depend upon the cooperation of the armed forces. The Minister of Finance places high priority on achieving all the fiscal transparency objectives by the start of the next fiscal year, including full integration of the Reforestation Fund and the Investment Funds with the budget.” 56. In parallel, an important event has been the strengthened commitment of the independent BPK (Supreme Audit) to initiate examination of the foundations associated with the armed forces and the national police. r” The focus of BPK’s inquiry will be-inter alia-on the sources and utilization of funds and the contractual relations with third parties (foundations and other sources of nonbudgetary revenues). Eventually, BPK intends to undertake a till audit of these institutions, complementing the efforts of BPKP. The authorities believe that both efforts-those of the BPKP and the BPK-will be facilitated by the passage of the law on foundations. 57. The agenda for improving public sector governance and preparing for privatization include the following initiatives (T[ 54-56): (i) successive rounds of international audits of key public enterprises and agencies; (ii) preparation of a plan for civil service reform in the context of decentralization; and (iii) privatization and enterprise reform (especially of the teIecommunication/energy sectors). The authorities explained that the reform process in these areas was broadly on track. Corrective actions for the group of four enterprises that were subject to special audits in 1999 are being implemented and publicized. Audits for the KUT, the Tax Office, and a new round of five public enterprises have been launched and should be completed by December. Regarding privatization, the authorities “Although many aspects of the draft law benefited from advice from the Fund, the staff is still seeking to strengthen other aspects-such as the coverage of the reporting requirements-before its passage by Parliament. “Integration of the Reforestation Fund has been delayed because new arrangements needed to be agreed between the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Forestries, and Bank Mandiri (which has held the deposits of the Reforestation Fund). In particular, these arrangements need to assure that, notwithstanding its fnll integration with the budgetary accounts, the resources of the Reforestation Fund will remain earmarked for funding forestry initiatives. 20While it is the BPKP (reporting to the MOF) that has the constitutional mandate to audit government agencies, the BPK (reporting to Parliament) has become more active in examining the accounts of government institutions with systemic importance.

The AsDB and the World Bank are maintaining close oversight of the process. 58. Other structural reforms are also moving ahead, principally under the guidance of the World Bank. In trade policy, the next major priority is to review the rice import tariff in August, with a view to adopting a timetable for its early elimination, especially given its close link to poverty concerns. Progress is also being made toward resolving the contractual disputes with independent power producers (IPPs) (7 61), although the outstanding agenda is still extensive; the authorities have continued to brief regularly the staff of the Fund, the Bank, and the AsDB on this issue. VII. PROCRAMMONITORINGANDSURVEILLANCEISSUES Program Monitoring 59. All quantitative performance criteria are expected to have been met for end- June. However, the base money benchmark for that date was exceeded, despite BI’s monetary tightening, reflecting a number of uncertainties that raised currency demand (Section ILC). Quantitative performance criteria have been proposed for end-October and end-December. While the base money targets for those dates have been maintained, the NIR floors have been raised as discussed in paragraph 23, and the ceilings on BI’s net domestic assets have been correspondingly reduced. 60. The three financial sector performance benchmarks and criteria for end-June have now been met, although with some delays. These comprise the publication of BI’s and IBRA’s audited 1999 accounts, and the adoption of a new governing body for IBRA.2’ Looking ahead, the new MEFP incorporates additional structural performance criteria and benchmarks covering the most important aspects of bank and corporate restructuring, especially quarterly targets for carrying forward asset restructuring and recovery by IBRA and the JITF (MEFP Table 2). 61. The remaining reserves and purchases under the arrangement are proposed to be slightly adjusted reflecting the delays in completing the first and second reviews (Table 6). 2’Publication of IBRA’s accounts by end-June was a structural performance criterion and this was met by June 30. The other two actions-publication of BI’s accounts and the adoption of a new governance framework for IBRA-were structural performance benchmarks for end- June; however, they were met in July.

The team has reviewed the weaknesses in the statistical base, focusing on the fiscal and balance of payments areas (Annex III). The priority is to improve fiscal measurement and reconcile above the line data on revenues and expenditures with financing sources. This effort is being led by a taskforce on treasury management in the Ministry of Finance, with the help of technical assistance from the Fund. Balance of payments data are being brought in line with the Fund’s manual. To improve the monitoring of bank performance and debt restructuring, efforts are underway to obtain regular data on bank profitability and the JITF is undertaking periodic surveys on debt restructuring. VIII. STAFFAPPRAISAL 63. Indonesia’s economic program is at a crucial stage. Many aspects of Indonesia’s economic and political transition have been subject to renewed uncertainty. Most importantly, markets have questioned political cohesion and policy coordination, and have perceived weaknesses in the commitment to maintaining good governance. As such, market sentiment has eroded during the first half of 2000, and investor confidence has not been restored as anticipated under the program. 64. The economic achievements of the past year are, therefore, in jeopardy. The economy rebounded in the last 2-3 quarters, but the recovery has been narrowly based and could not be sustained without market confidence. Indonesia continues to enjoy broad price stability, but the weak exchange rate and uncertainties over the government’s ability to resist wage pressures are beginning to affect expectations. The continuing high current account surplus is increasingly viewed as an indicator of weakness rather than of strength, reflecting low investment demand, and special factors such as higher oil prices. Although reserves have risen ahead of the program, the continued absence of private sector flows testifies to their fragility. 65. Equally, the medium-term outlook for Indonesia has much greater uncertainty. The program is designed to deliver sustained growth in the 5-6 percent range, underpinned by steady reduction in the public debt. Asset recovery and debt restructuring drive the process, entrenching a virtuous cycle of private capital inflows, improved exchange rate and interest rate trends, investment recovery, and fiscal sustainability. However, recent events have underscored that Indonesia is still highly vulnerable to the return of a vicious cycle of stalled reforms and deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals feeding into renewed capital flight and crisis conditions. Given that about half of Indonesia’s households still face high risks of falling below the poverty line, such an alternative cycle of economic and market events would have very far reaching social consequences. 66. Four sets of policy challenges define the course that Indonesia’s medium-term outlook is likely to take. First and foremost is asset recovery and restructuring, given that unrestructured debt amounts to almost 70 percent of GDP. A parallel challenge is to restore the recapitalized banking system to full profitability, thereby allowing it to support corporate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-25- debt restructuring and economic recovery. A third challenge is to implement decentralization with fiscal neutrality and without the microeconomic dislocations that could create new social discord. Finally, Indonesia’s new democracy has the historical challenge of resisting the resurgence of cronyism and restoring the governance of public institutions. 67. Three years into the crisis, Indonesia has yet to demonstrate its ability to deliver on the first challenge of asset recovery and restructuring. The amount of debt that has been restructured or recovered thus far is miniscule relative to the problem. The JITF has failed, as previous staff appraisals have emphasized, to give momentum to private debt restructurings. IBRA’s performance has been only a little better. Meanwhile, there has been serious and increasing erosion of the assets under IBRA’s control. as confirmed by the recently completed audit. The root cause has been the continued ability of powerful vested interests to resist restructurings and asset sales. 68. The first litmus test is whether Indonesia can break from these past failures and drive asset sales and restructuring under the newly proposed schedules. The targets that have been proposed by the authorities for achievement by end-2000 should, therefore, be regarded as the minimum essential effort. However, achieving them is still a daunting challenge. For IBRA, the effort is three-fold: to restructure the debt of IBRA’s 21 largest obligors; sell the pledged assets of the former bank owners; and sell two of IBRA’s BT0 banks. In all these three areas, the resistance of vested interest has still to be overcome, and the legal deterrent effectively and comprehensively applied to noncooperative debtors. The Attorney General’s recent decision to take legal action against four noncooperative former bank owners is thus encouraging. 69. The prospects are, if anything, even more difftcult in the case of the JITF. This is because the JITF does not have the power to drive restructurings in the way that IBRA has. Much will depend upon the authorities’ ability and willingness to identify high-profile restructuring cases that could be led by the JITF, and then to take prompt legal actions if debtors do not adhere to the new time-bound mediation procedures. The quantitative targets proposed by the authorities for building up JlTF’s case load, as well as for achieving restructurings, should become important policy goals for the entire economic team. Equally, the FSPC needs to adopt effective procedures for maintaining the quality of restructurings. 70. The second major challenge is to take the banking system back to profitability. Given the past experience of failed public recapitalizations in Indonesia, much more robust mechanisms are now needed for this task. The authorities need to demonstrate their commitment to maintaining governance in the state banks, quickly allaying market concerns over some recent management appointments. In particular, market fears of a resumption of directed lending to vested interests must be demonstratively addressed. This will require intensive vigilance on the part of Bl and the Ministry of Finance in exercising their supervision and governance responsibilities, respectively. While the capacity to exercise such vigilance is still weak and untested, it will help that considerable technical assistance is available, and the authorities are strongly urged to use this technical assistance. Ultimately, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-26- the best guarantor of governance and profitability in Indonesia is likely to be the accelerated privatization of the state banks. 71. The third major challenge is decentralisation. Recent staff technical assistance has confirmed that the authorities are still not adequately prepared to address the complexities of decentralization. The authorities need, therefore, to contend with this prospect-that all the enabling conditions and safeguards to allow for full decentralization to the district level in 2001, as required by the laws passed last year, may not be within reach. Thus, the authorities are strongly urged to phase decentralization in a pragmatic way. They are, in essence, trying to do this within the constraints of the law, to avoid going back to Parliament. While the authorities are obviously best placed to make this judgement, it is the staffs view that the authorities should not hesitate to do this, pointing out to Parliament the larger pit- falls of failure. 72. Failures in decentraliiation can arise in at least two ways. There are macroeconomic risks of fiscal nonneutrality, although these can be partly safeguarded with strict central control over the borrowing of the subnational governments, and by linking transfers of revenue to expenditure assignments. The larger risks may well lie in other areas. The pursuit of local goals by district governments could result in social instability. Resistance to transferred central government personnel is just one of the risks. Since the transferred functions include social spending, the delivery of essential public services could falter. Corruption could rise if oversight of spending programs is reduced. Ultimately, the ability of the center to contain these microeconomic risks is untested. 73. The fourth major challeng~well demonstrated by the risks associated with decentraliiation-lies in improving the governance of public institutions. The economic program-and the authorities’ original letter of intent-accorded high priority to rebuilding the public trust in the economic institutions and the judiciary. Such a goal was judged to be critical to the achievement of all parts of the economic program. However, market confidence in the government’s ability to move in this direction has eroded since then, and this factor has contributed to the decline in market sentiment. The governance agenda is well established. It is focused on the institutions critical to overcoming debtor resistance to asset recovery and restructuring. This includes the judiciary, where the early promise of reform has not been followed up by concrete actions. The President has frequently recognized the necessity ofjudicial reform, and a number of anticorruption institutions have been established. However, there have been prolonged delays to their functioning and, perhaps most importantly, the promised overhaul of the judiciary has yet to materialize. 74. The staffs further discussions with the authorities have better focused the economic program on these four core challenges. New targets, program benchmarks, and performance criteria have been established for guiding the policy effort and for monitoring results. There is no doubt that the risks to their achievement remain high. Greater ownership of the economic program is needed, not only in the economic team, but across the political spectrum. Fundamentally, economic reforms need to take precedence over political Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-27- considerations. For this to happen, there needs to be much greater awareness on the part of all the political parties of the implications of another financial crisis for Indonesia. 75. Statistical data allow for basic macroeconomic surveillance, as indicated by Indonesia’s recent compliance with SDDS, but serious shortcomings remain. Fiscal and debt data are particularly weak. There are often large discrepancies between above the line and financing measures of the deficit, and public sector revenue and expenditure are under- estimated as many foundations and off budget accounts are not captured. Bank and corporate sector data are also weak. The authorities are aware of these shortcomings and are committed to address them, in many instances with Fund technical assistance. 76. Given the scale of the challenges, the staff believes that the authorities have made a good effort at the second review to put together a strengthened program for the second half of 2000. The authorities have committed to the quantitative targets for asset recovery and restructuring, and have taken a number of actions to safeguard governance in the key economic institutions. Although political uncertainties remain, the staff is of the view that the strengthened program deserves the support of the Fund. On balance, therefore, the staff recommends the completion of the second review. 77. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Impact of a Weaker Exchange Rate on the FY 2000 Macroeconomic Framework It is the staff’s assessment that, if the recent exchange rate weakness can he quickly reversed, the damage to the macroeconomic framework can be minimlxed. In developing the revised baseline scenario for FY 2000, the staff has assumed an average exchange rate of around Rp 8,000 to the dollar. If this average exchange rate can be delivered, the macroeconomic targets of the program for FY 2000 remain within reach. This will require a steady restoration of market confidence and a gradual appreciation of the rupiah in the coming months. However, if market uncertainty is prolonged and exehange rate weakness continues through the end of the year, the macroeconomic framework will be affeeted. In such an alternate scenario, in particular, corporate debt restructuring will stall, new vulnerabilities could be introduced into the banking system, and these and other associated developments would place the macroeconomic targets at considerable risk. 9 A weaker rupiah would likely stall corporate debt restructuring negotiations, by introducing new uncertainties into the financial situations of debtor companies. For example, if the exchange rate remains at its mid-July range of Rp 9,OOGRp 9,500 to the dollar, the domestic value of the stock of external private debt obligations would rise about 8% percent of GDP at end-year. Also, recently agreed restructurings would risk unraveling. 9 There would also be potentially significant effects on banks’ financial position. Banks with unhedged open foreign exchange positions would be particularly affected. Exchange rate valuation losses for the banking system could increase the need for new capital injections to comply with capital- adequacy standards. For example, were the current exchange rate weakness to continue, losses could top Rp 6 trillion (over 12 percent of projected bank capitalization) by end year. 9 While the Bseai targets could be protected, as explained in the text, at an average exchange rate oi Rp/S 8,000, this may not be possible were the exchange rate to remain at its current level through end-year. In the absence of corrective measures, the FY 2000 government deficit would increase by about % percent of GDP. Foreign-currency sensitive expenditures (including oil subsidies, interest payments on external debt, and capital spending) would increase by about 2% percent of GDP. Two- thirds of this increase would, however, be offset by the increase in oil revenues, which are in foreign currency. Because of the large share of foreign financing of the budget (almost half of total financing), it is possible that a Enancing shortfall could still be prevented. However, if the weaker exchange rate is associated with policy slippage, foreign financing would be jeopardized, forcing budget cuts. 9 A more depreciated exchange rate would inevitably feed into higher inflation, through the increase of imported goods prices. Estimates of the short-run exchange rate depreciation pass-through on inflation suggest that average prices in 2000 would be higher by about 2 percentage points (3 at end- period) than the program baseline of 3 to 4 percent. However, rice and other food prices would be more severely affected. 9 The external targets would also be affected by prolonged exchange rate weakness. Larger than programmed capital outflows, only partially offset by an expected improvement in the trade balance, would likely emerge-leading to lower reserves. The counterpart of a weaker rupiah would be continued, or increasing, capital flight (including non-repatriation of export earnings). Using standard developing country estimates of short-term real price elasticities (0.3 for exports and -0.7 for imports), the trade balance could improve by up to 2 percentage points of GDP (over $2% billion). The improvement, however, is likely to be smaller given the high import intensity of some export sectors and the difficulties exporters are facing in securing trade financing. = Finally, all these factors would combine to constrain prospective growth-although, because of lags, the net impact on real GDP growth in 2000 may be small. Most importantly, investors would likely adopt a wait-and-see attitude as corporate debt restructuring fails to gain momentum. In the short run, net exports might benefit from the depreciated exchange rate, but could not be sustained without market confidence, and improvements in trade financing.

The authorities have established basic laws aimed at implementing decentralization in 2001. . Law 22/99 assigns all government functions to 333 districts except for finance, foreign affairs, defense, religion, and state administration which remain with the center. The 27 provinces, as second-tier governments, are to play a largely coordinating role. Regulation 25/00 to implement Law 22/99 was produced after discussions with each of the province governors and district heads in April 2000. While it further specifies the remaining roles of the center and the provinces, the roles of the district are still treated by default. . Law 25/99 governs resource transfers. It provides for(i) the sharing of the property and natural resource revenues (forestry, mining, fisheries, gas, and oil); (ii) a General Allocation Fund (GAF) of a minimum of 25 percent of domestic revenues; and (iii) a Special Allocation Fund (SAF). Implementing regulations are under preparation. Resource Implications . Shared revenues for 2001 are estimated at 1.5 percent of GDP and the GAF at 3.3 percent ofGDP, which together are I .2 percent of GDP more than FY 2000 discretionary transfers (3.6 percent of GDP). . Foreign borrowing will be controlled by the central government, but restrictions on subnational domestic borrowing are still to be formulated. Institutional Framework and Immediate Implementation Tasks . A Coordinating Team (CT) chaired by the Minister of Regional Autonomy and assisted by the Ministers of Finance and Home Affairs is responsible for implementing Laws 22/99 and 25/99. . A Regional Autonomy Advisory Council (RAAC) has been set up, under the chairmanship of the Minister of Home Affairs, to advise the President on issues that may arise in the course of implementation. The RAAC includes subnational government representatives (in the process of being appointed) and the Ministers of Finance and Regional Autonomy. . A Fiscal Balance Secretariat led by the Ministry of Finance is responsible for financial issues, and a Regional Autonomy Secretariat led by the Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for assignment of responsibilities and arbitration of disputes. . The CT is preparing guidelines to line ministries on functions and activities to be devolved. Meetings are planned at the provincial level during July/August between line ministries, provinces and districts to agree on a positive list of activities to be taken on by districts. . In parallel, the Ministry of State Apparatus and Administrative Reform and the Civil Service Board, assisted by the World Bank, are preparing regulations governing the transfer of personnel in the context of civil service reform. . The CT and RAAC will need to develop contingency plans for the central government to offer services in key areas where there could be failures at the local level.

Banking Supervision and Governance Sound banking supervision requires both an appropriate regulatory framework and effective application. Many needed amendments to the banking laws and regulations have been implemented since the onset of the crisis, and BI has taken steps to address the more diff%xlt issues of application and practice. However, significant work is still needed to strengthen banking supervision, which is being undertaken by BI with the assistance of two MAE advisors now in residence. BI Master Plan for Banking Supervision: The plan, developed in 1999 by BI (with Fund input), specifics actions to be completed by end-2001 to enhance overall supervision. Significant progress has been made toward some of the objectives, including developing a comprehensive tit and proper test for owners and managers, establishing a special investigation unit, and promoting transparency in the banking sector through published quarterly financial statements. However, intensive work is still required in many of the key areas, including: . data integrity and functionality . intensive supervision of systemically important banks l development of an early warning system . implementation of a risk-based supervision program . moving from an historical compliance focus to a forward-looking risk-based analysis. These areas will receive priority attention by the newly appointed MAE resident technical assistance advisors, who will develop shortly a workplan to meet all of the objectives set out in the master plan. Achieving Compliance with Bask Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision: The BI master plan is a necessary element for Indonesia to move towards full compliance with the Bask Core Principles. There is also a need for a broader review that includes areas outside of Bl’s direct control (such as judicial process) and an independent assessment of the application by BI of the current legislative framework. In the coming month, MAE will conduct an assessment, using the Core Principles Methodology adopted by the BIS, of Indonesia’s current compliance with the Core Principles. The resulting report will identify any remaining weaknesses and necessary corrective measures. On-site Supervisory Presence at the State Banks: As part of the new focus on intensive supervision of the systemically important banks, BI, with technical assistance from the MAE resident advisors, has put in place a framework for an on-site presence at the state banks. This framework: . establishes the duties and outlines the work responsibilities of the on-site examiner . establishes clear reporting lines to BI . allows the MAE resident advisors to work with the on-site examiners when assistance is required . includes an agreement between BI and each state bank addressing concerns over the legality of having a permanent supervisory presence. The on-site presence at each state-owned bank is close to being fully operational. In addition, an on-site examination of Mandiri is being conducted, and BI will complete by end-August a report including requirements for any necessary corrective actions. Governance and Oversight of the State Banks: Governance issues are critically important for the state banks since intensive supervision cannot take the place of effective governance. The Ministry of Finance has created a Governance and Oversight Unit to represent the shareholder’s interest in ensuring that the state banks operate under proper stewardship. The main responsibilities of the unit are to: l determine compliance with the banks’ performance contracts, including financial and operational restructuring targets . make recommendations to enhance governance and shareholder interests . prepare a divestment plan and coordinate its execution The unit has just begun its activities, and the June MAE mission made detailed recommendations regarding the scope of work that should be undertaken. Priority attention needs to be given to enhancing the banks’ governance, and reviewing their business plans and strategic objectives. The World Bank is taking the lead, with the unit receiving technical assistance from AusAid and the World Bank.

Medium-term prospects depend on the authorities’ ability to entrench a mutually reinforcing cycle of rising market confidence and economic reforms especially, progress with corporate and bank restructuring, asset recovery, careful management of fiscal and monetary policies, and improved governance. The staffs baseline projections hold out Indonesia’s continuing potential to achieve the outlook prepared at the time of approval of the extended arrangement-namely, the restoration of high and sustainable growth, low inflation, and a substantial reduction of the government’s debt burden. This requires prompt confidence-building measures to recover from the recent declining market sentiment. 2. In such a benign outlook, real GDP growth could reach its potential range of 5-6 percent by 2002, and be sustained thereafter (Figure I. 1). In the short-run, the recovery in output is supported by a gradual revival in private consumption, higher inventory build-up, and a resurgence of exports. As the corporate sector restructures and asset disposal gathers momentum, investment is expected to pick up. Any persistent weakness in the exchange rate will jeopardize achievement of the inflation target, necessitate a tighter monetary policy, and weaken the recovery. 3. As the economy recovers, the fiscal position is expected to improve, helping scale back government debt from over 90 percent to about 67 percent by end-2004. Although the largest quantitative factor contributing to a reduction in the debt/GDP is nominal GDP growth, primary surpluses and asset recoveries also play a key role. The central government deficit is expected to decrease to just over 1 percent of GDP by 2004, from below 5 percent in the current fiscal year. This path implies a gradual increase in the primary surplus to around 3 percent of GDP. Government debt service, although declining, will continue to absorb a relatively high proportion of revenues, keeping high the risks to fiscal sustainability. Achieving this fiscal outlook is dependent on carefully managing fiscal decentralization, and advancing fiscal reforms. J 4. The current account should turn gradually into small deficit. The recovery in investment is expected to lead to a pick up in intermediate and capital goods imports, more than offsetting projected strong export growth. As relations with external creditors are normalized, the current account deficit is increasingly financed by private sector inflows, primarily in the form of direct investment and a return of flight capital. However, such inflows would depend critically on a stable political environment, a well-functioning legal system, and transparent laws governing foreign investment. ’ The medium term outlook is elaborated in the forthcoming Selected Issues paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-44- ANNEX I 5. External vulnerability would steadily improve. The reserve position is projected to strengthen further and the external debt burden is reduced, while eliminating Indonesia’s dependence on exceptional balance of payments support. Gross reserves could rise to $35 billion, at least, while increasing short term debt coverage to about 130 percent. Alternate Scenario 6. The risks to such a favorable outlook have increased in recent months. The emerging recovery could quickly stall if market confidence does not improve from its recent low level. In that case, monetary policy would have to be tightened further in line with rising risk premia. Consumer confidence-which has driven the recovery so far--would be affected, and the anticipated steady recovery in investment over the program period would not materialize. With prolonged weakness in the exchange rate, bank and corporate restructuring efforts would stall. In addition, if fiscal decentralization is not managed in a deficit neutral manner, it could threaten the projected reduction in debt. 7. An alternate medium term scenario has been prepared to illustrate these downside risks. This scenario assumes a prolonged period of weakness in the exchange rate, which feeds into a pick-up in inflation, and risks wider social instabilities through the impact on the price and availability of rice and other sensitive food items. In this environment, corporate debt restructuring is likely to slow down, impeding the resumption of normal credit relations and, ultimately, choking the export recovery. The output gap would widen, instead of closing as projected under the baseline scenario, and growth would risk getting stuck in a narrow range of O-2 percent, depending on agriculture. 8. The fiscal position would be quickly affected by the weaker macroeconomic outlook. Fiscal reforms would, likely, slow. The burden of government debt service payments on a weaker revenue base would rise, in part as a result of higher interest rates.2 Moreover, the financing of the budget would become difficult-weaker cash recovery from assets and slower privatization could reduce domestic financing by about one percentage point per year. In addition, arrears to official creditors could emerge. Given the financing constraint, development expenditures would have to be compressed. ’ Staff estimate that every 1 percentage point increase in interest rates results in higher annual payments on recapitalization bonds of about Rp 3 trillion (or 0.3 percent of FY 2000 GDP). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - ANNEX 1 9. Under the alternate scenario, as growth falters, the objective of gradually reducing the debt ratio would be endangered. Total public debt is likely to remain at the current high level. In particular, the debt/GDP ratio may become unsustainably high if-as assumed in the scenario-primary surpluses are slow to materialize, asset recoveries from IBRA are reduced, and interest payments on recapitalization bonds are increased. A more depreciated exchange rate would also inflate the rupiah value of public external obligations. 10. On the external side, both export and import growth would be weak, and the current account could remain in surplus. Non-oil export growth may only be about a third of the baseline scenario. Weaknesses in the overall consumption pattern will also be reflected in low import growth. Despite the expected favorable external environment of partner countries in the medium term, the lack of restructuring and unfavorable market sentiment would greatly limit Indonesian companies’ access to trade/project financing. Rising risk premia would also make borrowing very costly. 11. Net private capital inflows could well decline in the medium term. In an environment where reforms stall, currency weakness continues, inflationary pressures are high, political instability is a constant threat, and governance is an issue, foreign investors are unlikely to be attracted to invest in Indonesia. Flight capital would remain offshore, and there could be renewed capital flight. Exceptional financing from the international community would also be threatened. 12. All these factors would intensify Indonesia’s external vulnerability. The potentially unstable macroeconomic environment would lead to an erosion of international reserves. Gross reserves could likely fall to 2 months of imports by 2004 (about $11 billion). Further, the external debt burden is likely to remain high-total (public and private) external debt may be over 80 percent of GDP in 2004, compared to just over 60 percent in the baseline scenario. Debt indicators would deteriorate (Table I. 1).

The core assets represent over 25 percent of total commercial bank credit outstanding, but they are largely nonperforming, and their recoverable value is estimated at about 20 percent of their book value (Rp 256 trillion). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-49- ANNEX II . Transfers of the shareholder assets into holding companies have yet to be completed. However, the market value of the assets already transferred amount to about one-third of their transfer value (Rp 104 trillion). IBRA’s ability to exercise stewardship over the pledged assets and to implement the shareholder settlements has been slowed by a complex management structure for the holding companies that left the former shareholders in effective control of their assets. This has led to asset stripping from the holding companies, and there are questions about the legal ability of IBRA to sell the assets pursuant to the master shareholder agreements. The change in the exchange rate since the master settlement agreements were agreed has also contributed to the decline in the market value of the underlying assets. . The current book value of IBRA’s equity holdings in banks taken over and in the private recapitalized banks is only a fraction of the almost Rp 150 trillion recapitalization bonds issued, reflecting the large negative net worth of these banks prior to their recapitalization. 3. Over the medium term, the largest share of recoveries (about Rp 53 trillion) is expected to come from the restructuring and sales of the AMC’s core assets. The disposition of the shareholder assets is projected to contribute about Rp 35 trillion. As for the bank equity holdings, assuming that these holdings are sold at current book value (i.e., below the BCA LPO, which was priced at 1.2 times book), IBRA will recover about 11 percent of the total recapitalization bonds issued to the BT0 and other recapitalized banks (equivalent to about Rp 16 trillion). The medium-term profile of asset recovery is presented in a chapter of the forthcoming Selected Issues Paper. IBRA Asset Recovery Targets for FY 2000 4. In FY 2000, IBRA aims to recover Rp 19 trillion in cash (after expenses) and an additional Rp 3.7 trillion in bonds (Table 2). The ADU and the AMC-about equally-are expected to contribute more than 80 percent of the total cash recoveries, with the remainder projected to come from the majority sale of banks BCA and Niaga. Other income should be sufficient to offset expenses. Including last year’s recoveries, by the end of 2000, IBRA will have recovered about l/3 of total future expected recoveries. Table 2.

The recovery target for the ADU is ambitious, and its feasibility will depend not only on market conditions, but also on cooperation from owners and managers. There were no sales during the first quarter of FY 2000. About 75 percent of total recoveries for the year are expected to derive from the sale of 5 companies out of 17 industrial, financial and real estate assets, in the last two quarters of the fiscal year. The authorities have sought to give credibility to the schedule by securing written commitments to sale from owners, and by engaging financial advisors. In all cases, full disposal of IBRA’s ownership in these companies is sought. 6. The AMC is, so far, on track toward meeting the recovery target for FY 2000. By end June, loan recoveries had reached more than Rp 3 trillion (slightly ahead of schedule), about half from IBRA’s largest corporate obligors. Prospective recoveries will principally stem from: . Debt settlements (including refinancing agreements); . Auction sales of Rp 11 trillion of retail&ME loans and of a small tranche (Rp 2% trillion) of restructured corporate loans, and . Collections from the outsourcing agents charged with the restructuring of commercial loans. More than half of the AMC loan recoveries is expected from corporate loan collections (Rp 6.5 trillion, of which about Rp 5 trillion is projected to be in cash). Therefore, much will depend on resolving, as envisaged, the debt of the top 2 1 obligors during 2000, as well as on IBRA’s ability to call on guarantees and offset cash pledges made available by cooperating debtors in the process of restructuring negotiations. 7. The sale of IBRA’s stakes in banks BCA and Niaga is key to signal the start of the process of returning assets to the private sector, and attracting new foreign investments in the banking system. The sales are also crucial to achieve IBRA’s cash recovery target for FY 2000. Particularly important is the strategic sale of IBRA’s remaining 70 percent stake in BCA, following the initial divestment achieved through an IPO earlier this year (which yielded just less than Rp 1 trillion). To this end, IBRA has developed and announced (for both banks) a schedule for the completion of their sales by December 2000. These actions include the approval of Parliament, and the appointment of financial advisors.

Indonesia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in September 1996, and now meets the specifications for the coverage, periodicity and timeliness of the SDDS data, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars. This makes Indonesia the 231d country to reach this stage. Indonesia made use of the allowed flexibility options with respect to the periodic&y and timeliness requirements for dissemination of the production index and labor market statistics. In end-May this year, Indonesia began publishing foreign exchange reserves data consistent with the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, Operational Guidelines. However, some weaknesses remain in the data base, particularly in fiscal and the balance of payments data. A safeguards assessment is planned for October 2000. I. Real Sector 2. Historical annual national accounts data have been revised to a 1993 base year, with improved coverage. Quarterly GDP data are made available to staff in a timely manner, but data are subject to frequent and large revisions. Furthermore, the estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators of uncertain quality. Most sectors are influenced strongly by seasonal@, but seasonally adjusted data are not prepared. No division of capital formation between government and nongovernment sectors is available and changes in inventories are calculated as a residual which, therefore, includes any statistical discrepancies. Movements in exports of goods and services in the national accounts differ substantially from the balance of payments data. 3. Labor market data, including wages and employment, are semi-annually available through periodic government publications. Data on average wages in the private sector are not available, but minimum and maximum wages for the formal sector are reported by economic sector and by region. 4. Both consumer (CPI) and wholesale price (WPI) data are collected and published monthly and on a timely basis. From January 1998, the CPI has been compiled with 1996 as the base year; with the weights updated on the basis of a 1996 cost of living survey. II. Public Finance 5. Comprehensive fiscal data for Indonesia’s public sector are not available and the data which are available are of questionable quality in terms of definition, coverage and timeliness. Large “statistical” discrepancies exist between “below the line” data provided by BI and “above the line” data reported by the Ministry of Finance. Of particular concern is the lack of an integrated system for the adequate coverage and timely reporting of the country’s public debt statistics. Data on public debt reported from the Ministry of Finance are often different from those reported by the central bank, and both are reported with significant lags. While the recent establishment of the debt management unit is encouraging, it is yet to become fully operational and will need to collect, report and analyze data on domestic and external debt, including contingent liabilities arising from government guarantees. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 - ANNEX III 6. Problems which contribute to the unsatisfactory reporting of fiscal data include: i) the current classification system of revenues and expenditures is based on a “source-use” criterion rather than the internationally accepted economic standard of “current-capital”; ii) there is no clear definition of the public sector with the consequence that revenues and expenditures of many entities (such as foundations) cannot be easily and consistently classified as ‘public’ or ‘private’; iii) it is unclear how to treat entities such as BULOG which has commercial functions but is set up as an administrative department; iv) rules and procedures to regulate extra-budgetary funds are lax, resulting in non-transparent and unaccountable off-budget activities; v) institutional arrangements for the auditing of public sector finances are weak, vi) the timeliness of reports on budgetary outcomes and financial accounts is poor; and vii) responsibilities for issuance of public debt and the subsequent management of the stock are spread over different organizational units within the Ministry of Finance. 7. The decentralization initiative commencing in January 2001 adds urgency to the need for upgrading Indonesia’s public sector finance statistics collection systems. In the future, about half of general government expenditure is expected to be managed by over 350 district and 27 provincial administrations. New fiscal data recording and reporting mechanisms must be developed for the central govermnent to effectively manage the execution of the state budget, to ensure transfers to regional administrations are calculated and managed transparently, to implement the nation’s medium and long term public debt sustainability strategy, and to generate good quality general government fiscal data. III. Monetary Accounts 8. Although BI balance sheet data are generally of good quality, and available in a timely manner, the quality of monetary survey data is compromised by a number of methodological problems associated with the restructuring of the banking sector, namely, bank closures, issuance of recapitalization bonds, transfers of non-performing assets to the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA), and some misclassification of foreign assets and liabilities by banks. These problems have complicated the interpretation of the monetary survey data. 9. Based on the recommendations of a recent STA money and banking statistics mission, BI is in the process of issuing new guidelines for reclassification of some of its accounts. All banks are required to follow the new guidelines for the end-August data submission, which will be published in September.

The adverse audit findings on the opening balance sheet of Bank Indonesia as at May 17, 1999 raised some potential concerns about the reliability of balance sheet data included in the monetary accounts. Particular issues raised by the audit included the valuation of Bank Indonesia credit to banks and government, reconciliation of data on international reserves and foreign currency assets and liabilities, and the separation of Bank Indonesia foreign assets and liabilities from those of the government and other agencies. 11. Actions taken subsequent to the May 1999 audit have resolved most issues of potential relevance for monetary data and balance sheet reliability. The only remaining issue concerns the valuation of Bank Indonesia claims on the government, that was the basis of the auditor’s qualified opinion on the end 1999 accounts. This issue does not, however, present an ongoing concern for monetary data from a conceptual perspective. It mainly concerns obtaining agreement on the value of the claims. This valuation issue is expected to be resolved following the conclusion of a separate audit of the liquidity credit facilities previously provided by Bank Indonesia to commercial banks that gave rise to the existing claims on government. V. Balance of Payments 12. The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and BI use different methodologies to process the raw customs data which do not yield the same end results. BPS releases preliminary trade data but does not tinalize them until up to a year later and with significant revisions. The IMF staff use the BI trade data as it is provided on a timely basis and is consistent with the balance of payments data. No reliable data is available on trade volumes. 13. External trade data are prepared on a monthly basis and incorporate estimates of imports to the export processing zone in Batam. However, there is no systematic collection of customs data on imports into Batam, which are estimated as a fixed proportion of recorded exports from the export processing zone. 14. A 1998 STA technical assistance mission identified serious deficiencies in the quarterly balance of payments accounts. In the national presentation of the balance of payments little detail is disseminated on current and financial transactions. Available sources to compile data on services transactions are limited. In recent years, some $10 billion of net service payments have been estimated on the basis of very limited information on services activity. Crude estimates are also made for profit and dividend remittances on foreign direct investment. In the financial accounts, there are no data on transactions in foreign financial assets apart from a low estimate for direct investment abroad. The data on inward direct investment in the form of equity are estimated as a fixed percentage of loan receipts from foreign direct investments. 15. Through a series of missions, STA is providing technical assistance to BI to introduce a reporting system that will allow BI to monitor developments in the foreign exchange market and to improve the coverage of balance of payments statistics. The system will cover Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - ANNEX III cross border transactions channeled via the domestic banking system as well as via accounts held abroad by residents. The reporting system is expected to become operational this year and will help to close gaps in the balance of payments statistics. 16. An international investment position is not prepared, but monthly external debt statistics are made available to the staff on a timely basis. The statistics on private sector debt, however, are unrehable. VI. Banking and Corporate Sectors 17. BI collects a very large amount of data on the banking sector, and significant resources, both within BI and the commercial banking sector, are devoted to collection and analysis of more than 60 separate reports. Unfortunately, there are significant weaknesses in one of the principal outputs, a monthly statistical database that provides the raw data used to produce key reports both for supervisory monitoring of the banking sector and monetary survey data. These data problems had been previously identified and, as a long term solution, BI has been developing a new process to collect consolidated information directly from the banks. The June MAE technical assistance mission recommended that this new process be reviewed by the recently appointed MAE resident TA advisors before introduction later in 2000. As an interim measure to provide reliable data on the largest banks for supervisory purposes, BI, with the assistance of the MAE technical assistance advisors is collecting monthly consolidated financial statement information directly from systemically important banks. 18. Lack of data on corporate debt restructurings from the Jakarta Initiative Task Force (JITF) has complicated the monitoring of progress in this area. To rectify this, the authorities have agreed to conduct periodic surveys (by the JITF) to assess progress in corporate debt restructuring.

In the fiscal year ending June 30,2000, the Bank committed only $133 million in new loans and credits to Indonesia. This was a sharp drop from the $2.7 billion, including $2.4 billion in fast disbursing adjustment loans, committed in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999. Disbursements too have dropped from $2.1 billion in FY98/99 to $1 .O in the year ending June 30,200O. Three hundred million of this $1 billion was from the first tranche of the Social Safety Net Adjustment Loan (SSNAL), which focused on the effective design and implementation of social programs for the poor. The second tranche (also $300 million) is expected to be disbursed later in 2000. In the medium-term, the Bank will assist Indonesia in restoring growth, while continuing to focus on poverty alleviation, social safety net operations, and the provision of basic social services, especially in education and health. IDA lending, which was discontinued in 1980, began again if FY 1998/99, following the crisis-related drop in per capita consumption. Of the IDA lending, $136 million was committed through three project loans in FY 1998199, and a further $120 million was committed in FYl999/2000. IFC, since its first investment in 1971, has made net commitments (loans, equity and guarantees) of $2.1 billion, including participations and net of cancellations. Indonesia is a member of MIGA and has benefited from guarantees totaling $313 million. A Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) has met under the chairmanship of the World Bank since 1992.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Indonesia On August,-, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Indonesia. Background Since the last Article IV Consultation, Indonesia has undergone a major political transition to democratic government. The reform program of the new government has been strongly supported by the international community. Indeed, the new government moved quickly to adopt a three-year IMF-supported economic program, and secured necessary financing assurances through a successful Consultative Group meeting and a Paris Club rescheduling. The new coalition government inherited deep political, social, and economic problems and, during its first year of office, the authorities have been confronted with an upsurge of sectarian ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

All of these have affected the implementation of the economic program. Nonetheless, significant progress has been achieved in macroeconomic stabilization. Preliminary data indicate that real GDP has risen by [4] percent (year-on-year) during the first half of 2000. The recovery continues to depend principally on growth of private consumption, though rising non-oil export volumes have also helped in recent months. Gross fixed investment appears to have bottomed out, but with real GDP still some 10 percent below pre- crisis level, there has been minimal new investment from private sources. Inflationary pressures have remained subdued-reflecting the large output gap as well as prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Gross reserves of Bank Indonesia have also been substantially replenished over the last two years to some $[27] billion. Some progress is also being made in the core structural areas, particularly in bank and corporate debt restructuring, although there have been delays. The government is making efforts to move more forcefully in imposing sanctions on recalcitrant debtors, recapitalizing and restructuring the banking sector, and pushing forward the process of asset recovery and debt restructuring. However, uneven program implementation, and increasing political uncertainty have made this progress slow and uneven, resulting in the recent deterioration in market sentiment. These areas, together with the achievement by Indonesia’s banking system of international prudential standards, remain the core outstanding tasks for sustaining the recovery. The authorities’ macroeconomic framework for 2000 entails achieving a real growth rate of 3- 4 percent, keeping average annual inflation at 3-4 percent, and a further build-up in foreign Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-65- ANNEX VIII exchange reserves. The approved budget deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP should help to promote recovery, while ensuring adequate protection for the poor. The room to lower interest rates should return once confidence improves and risk premia begin to fall. Looking beyond the current year, achievement of 4-5 percent growth and maintaining inflation below 5 percent in 2001 are well within reach. However, there are many risks in the near-term, and achievement of these objectives are predicated on swift reduction of political uncertainties and intensified program implementation. Indonesia’s first stand-by arrangement (SBA) was approved on November 5, 1997, with a total of SDR 3.7 billion being drawn (out of a total of SDR 8.3 billion). The SBA was replaced by an extended arrangement on August 25, 1998, under which about SDR 3.8 billion was drawn (out of an augmented total of SDR 5.4 billion). A new extended arrangement in the amount of SDR 3.6 billion was approved on February 4, 2000 and, thus far, about SDR 0.8 billion has been drawn. Indonesia’s obligations to the Fund now amount to the equivalent of about $10 billion.

At this second program review, we have committed to additional measures that will yield further concrete results in the areas of asset recovery, bank reform, and corporate restructuring. These measures are described in the attached Supplementary MEFP. We met all quantitative and structural performance criteria for end-June 2000. Quantitative performance criteria are now being proposed for end-October 2000 and end-December 2000 for the full set of monetary, fiscal, and external variables (Table 1). Additional structural performance criteria and benchmarks have been proposed through December 2000 (Table 2). During the remaining period of the arrangement, we will continue to consult with the Fund as provided in our letters of January 20,200O and May 17,2000, in order to assess progress in implementing the program and reach understandings on any additional measures that may be necessary.

INTRODUCTION 1. The government has strengthened implementation of the program set out in the Memoranda of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of January 20 and May 17,200O (Box 1). At the second review, the main achievements are (i) intensifying asset sales and debt restructurings by the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) and the Jakarta Initiative Task Force (JITF) under detailed quarterly targets; (ii) recapitalizing bank BNI and advancing BRI’s recapitalization; and (iii) adopting a detailed implementation plan for decentralization. II. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES 2. The macroeconomic framework for 2000 is being maintained. Growth and price developments continue to be consistent with that framework. Although market sentiment turned unfavorable in recent months, we are confident that 34 percent growth and the other key macroeconomic targets for 2000 can still be broadly achieved. The President has assured that there will be clarity and consistency in the implementation of the economic program, which are crucial to regaining market sentiment. Fiscal policy 3. Our efforts are directed toward fully implementing the FY 2000 budget, and avoiding shortfalls in key social safety net and infrastructure spending and associated foreign financing. Revenues have been more buoyant because of higher oil prices and, were they to exceed the budget target, the excess will be used to reduce the budget deficit. All tax laws presently before Parliament are expected to be approved by end-July. 4. The delayed budgetary measures remain important for medium-term fiscal sustainability and we have taken the following decisions: (i) the VAT on Batam island will be implemented on January 1,200 1, giving sufficient time to prepare for effective implementation and to ensure that bona fide exporters are not affected; and (ii) the first adjustment under a medium-term program for petroleum prices will be implemented in October, supported by protection for poor consumers. Monetary and exchange ratepolicy 5. Bank Indonesia (BI)‘s base money program is being maintained. As market confidence improves and risk premia fall, BI is confident that money market interest rates could be guided down. However, progress in this direction has been delayed by the recent weakness in the exchange rate, which required a temporary increase of interest rates. Meanwhile, the program floor on net international reserves has been raised as part of prudent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 68 - ATTACHMENT monetary policy to strengthen market confidence, as well as reflecting more rapid reserve accumulation earlier in the year (Table 1). 6. We are firmly committed to the exchange system underlying the financial program- to a floating exchange rate and preservation of Indonesia’s historically free capital account- as enshrined in the law on foreign exchange management that was enacted in 1999. Financing issues 7. We are making progress toward implementing the restructuring agreement that was reached with official creditors on April 13,200O. Thus, we have reached agreement with the bankers’ steering committee to restructure the government’s obligations to its commercial creditors of about US$346 million. 8. We are committed to delivering the policy framework underlying the budgetary support loans of the World Bank and the AsDB and, thereby, avoiding shortfalls in their disbursements in FY 2000. III. FISCALDECENTRALIZATION 9. In implementing fiscal decentralization, we are determined to safeguard public service delivery, fiscal stability, and the governance of public spending, and are being assisted by advisors from the international community. 10. Our implementation plan (Box 2) anticipates that, during July-September, we will prepare a positive list of work units and activities to be transferred to each district/province and estimate the costs of the decentralized activities. We will also progressively tinalize regulations on: (i) transfers of civil servants, assets, and spending to the districts; (ii) fiscal transfers and shared revenues required to finance transferred functions; (iii) guidelines for local government borrowing; (iv) accountability of local governments and financial management by adherence to budget process; and (v) financial information systems drawing on GFS guidelines. 11. We have agreed to the following safeguards to minimize the macroeconomic risks: (i) an adequate contingency provision will be included in the 2001 budget, and finalized in consultation with the IMF at the next program review; (ii) specific regulations and rules will be established for regional government borrowing especially from banks, to ensure consistency with the macroeconomic framework; (iii) regulations will be established to ensure that the transferred personnel are paid from the shared and transferred revenue; and (iv) fiscal transfers to the local govermnents will be phased in line with the transferred functions. 12. To implement this complex program, we are making fully operational four working groups under the Coordinating Team (CT), and three secretariats to advise the Regional Autonomy Advisory Council (RAAC). Local governments have elected their own local government associations to represent their views to the central government and to the RAAC. The RAAC was made fully operational on July 21.

We have adopted a new governance framework to ensure IBRA has the independence it needs to carry out its mandate. At the center of the framework is a new governing board, clearly separated from the political process, and composed of independent professionals, The board will make its first quarterly written report to the FSPC by September 30. Attached to the Board will be an independent audit committee. 14. The rest of IBRA’s institutional framework remains intact. In particular, IBRA will continue to report to the Ministry of Finance, while the FSPC will set the policy guidelines and approve sale and restructuring decisions over Rp 1 trillion (book value). 15. Meanwhile, IBRA is continuing to improve its transparency, as envisaged in previous MEFPs. On June 30, the agency published the results of a comprehensive audit of its financial position, including those of its industrial and bank holdings, as of end-1999. This audit raised a number of accounting and other issues which IBRA will address in a time- bound action plan to be tinalized in August, after consultation with the World Bank. IBRA’s first comprehensive annual report will be released during the third quarter. IBRA Asset Recovery and Restructurings 16. IBRA’s focus is to drive asset sales and debt resttucturings, return assets to the private sector quickly, and achieve budgetary collection targets. Toward this end, by end- September, IBRA’s new Board will approve a time-bound strategy for the disposition of all assets by its sunset date of end-February 2004. As part of this effort, international firms have been engaged to develop specific asset disposal strategies for all assets in the IBRA- controlled holding companies. 17. For FY 2000, IBRA announced on July 19, a quarterly schedule of asset sales procedures and projected cash collections, consistent with the budget target of Rp 18.9 trillion. Cash collections are estimated at over Rp 4 trillion during the April-June quarter, and projected at about Rp 7 trillion during the September quarter, and about Rp 8 trillion during the final quarter of FY 2000. These targets will be realized in the following ways. Asset Management Credits (AMC) Operations 18. In FY 2000, the AMC aims to collect at least Rp 8.8 trillion in cash, mainly by restructuring many of its largest loans, and selling them to investors or banks, and also by outsourcing and selling smaller loans, and by collecting debt service payments. Toward this end, the AMC aims at resolving the loans of its 21 largest obligors (comprising over 340 debtors with a book value of Rp 88 trillion) by end-2000. By end-June, 35 percent of the book value of these loans had been resolved, with term sheets having been tinalized for 93 debtors and legal actions initiated against 16 debtors. By September, the ratio should rise to around 70 percent of the loans. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 70 - ATTACHMENT 19. Regarding the AMC’s smaller loans: (i) all commercial loans (Rp 5-50 billion) have now been outsourced to domestic and foreign institutions, with the aim of putting the entire restructured portfolio back in the banking system by September 2001; and (ii) all retail loans (under Rp 5 billion) will be sold under open tender by December 2000. Asset Disposal Unit (AD(I) Operations 20. The ADU aims to raise about Rp 7 trillion for FY 2000, by selling over 20 industrial and other assets, through transparent and competitive bidding procedures. These assets include automotive, chemical, consumer and real estate-related concerns, all of which were acquired by the IBRA-controlled holding companies as part of settlements with bank shareholders. In all cases, IBRA’s aim will be to sell majority control to the private sector. To ensure that the sales process goes smoothly, written commitments from the shareholders have been obtained and were publicized on July 19. International advisory firms have been engaged for virtually all enterprises scheduled for sale this year. In addition, all necessary legal actions have been taken to secure clear title over the assets to be sold. Bank Restructuring Unit (BRU) Operations 21. The BRU expects to contribute about Rp 3 trillion to IBRA’s asset recovery target in FY 2000. IBRA has announced a timetable to complete the privatization of Banks BCA and Niaga by December, and Parliamentary approval will be requested in August. IBRA also expects to sell (in cooperation with the owners) some of its shares in the private banks recapitalized with public assistance. 22. IBRA is also advancing the reprivatization of its other BT0 banks, with the aim of fully completing the process by 200 1. The legal merger of Bank Danamon with eight other BT0 banks was completed on July 3, allowing the operational mergers to be completed by end-October. It remains our intention to prepare Bank Danamon for majority privatization in 2001. As for Bank Bali, an out-of-court settlement has been reached with the original owner, and the bank will be recapitalized in October, following a rights issue. Asset Management Investments (AMI) Operations 23. IBRA is enhancing its control over the pledged assets and taking steps to preserve the value of the enterprises in the holding companies. A new compliance team has been established within AM1 for this purpose-to monitor individual enterprises and identify specific problems. Based on recommendations of the compliance team, IBRA’s Board will adopt a corrective action program by end-August. This program will include, where necessary, changes in the management of the enterprises. Actions Against Noncooperative Debtors and Shareholders 24. The government recognizes that the asset recovery targets require strong action be taken against all noncooperative debtors and shareholders. Toward this end, the interministerial Committee for Resolving the Cases of Recalcitrant Debtors was established on July 17. The committee will decide a coordinated strategy for all IBRA’s problem cases, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-71- ATTACHMENT including prosecutions, using IBRA’s special powers to take over debtors’ assets, and imposing administrative sanctions (such as travel bans and disbarment from directorships). 25. IBRA is undertaking a comprehensive review of its legal powers, and related legal actions are planned to be taken as follows: . The Attorney General has commenced legal action against noncooperating shareholders from four of the 1998 BTO/closed banks (Pelita, Deka, Centris and Istimarat), who have not reached agreement with IBRA. The cases will be brought to court during August. . Shareholders of the 1999 BTO/closed banks who fail to complete negotiations by September will be referred to the Attorney General who will take legal action by October. . IBRA will by September take legal actions against those shareholders who have not complied with their MSAA or MRA agreements. Additional actions will be promptly taken in all cases where shareholders fail to complete their asset transfers consistent with their agreements. . IBRA’s AMC has tiled legal actions against 16 noncooperative borrowers (total debt of over Rp 6 trillion) out of about 340 companies belonging to the top 21 obligors. State Bank Restructuring State Bank Governance 26. A monitoring and governance unit for the state-owned and recapitalized banks was made operational within the Ministry of Finance at end-June 2000. The key tasks of the unit are to conduct quarterly reviews of banks’ compliance with their performance contracts, including business plans and performance targets; and to strengthen their management and governance structures to ensure highly transparent operations. The unit will closely monitor data on banks’ financial activities, including detailed information on new credit commitments and loan restructurings. By end-August, the Ministry of Finance will also prepare proposals for the state banks to bring their governance in line with international best practices. The Ministry of Finance will ensure that the annual audits of state-owned banks are publicly tendered to international firms. State bank restructuring and recapitalization 27. Bank Mandiri is implementing its business plan, closing unnecessary branches, and bringing virtually all of its assets and liabilities on-line by November 2000. The Ministry of Finance will work with Mandiri to develop by mid-August an appropriate strategy for reducing the bank’s dependency on high-cost deposits. Meanwhile, to ensure that the bank’s new policies for credit approval and risk management are executed efficiently, Mandiri plans Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 72 - ATTACHMENT to engage, by end-September 2000, experienced expatriate managers in senior positions and obtain institutional assistance in these areas. 28. Bank Indonesia is currently conducting an on-site examination of Mandiri, with a report expected in August. Any necessary corrective actions will be developed by end- September in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance. The government remains committed to beginning the bank’s privatization in 2001, and a firm strategy for this purpose will be developed by December 2000. 29. Bank BNI’s restructuring is also well underway. The second and final tranche of recapitalization bonds (Rp 32 trillion) was issued on July 3, after an international consulting firm verified that the bank has complied with its interim performance contract, and an international bank was engaged to assist in credit-risk management and loan workouts. A further review of the bank’s performance will take place by October 2000, following the completion of BNI’s June 2000 financial audit, after which the performance contract will be tinalized. 30. Regarding Bank BRI, a new management team was installed on July 18,2000, allowing its restructuring efforts to move forward. The bank’s business plan has been validated by the Restructuring Committee, an interim performance contract signed with the new management, and the first tranche of recapitalization bonds issued on July 25, for 70 percent of the bank’s recapitalization needs. The second and final tranche of recapitalization bonds should be provided by end-October, upon verification of the bank’s compliance with its interim performance contract, and implementation of a credit risk management function. 31. BRI’s future role focuses on micro, retail, and SME businesses. A detailed business strategy, as well as a divestment plan from corporate activities, consistent with the May I7 MEFP, will be developed by September 2000. BRI has begun to divest its corporate loans, intending to reduce their stock to no more than 20 percent of its total portfolio by end 2000, and to no more than 18 percent by end 200 1. 32. Regarding Bank BTN, a new management team was appointed in May 2000 and has prepared a business plan with its international advisors. The business plan-refocusing the bank on mortgage lending-has now been approved by the Restructuring Committee. The first tranche (70 percent of total) of its recapitalization was also approved by Parliament on July 21. Supervisory and Regulatory Framework 33. Implementation of Bank Indonesia’s master plan to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework for banks is well underway. A permanent supervisory presence is being established at each state bank and will be fully in place by August. The central bank is monitoring, on a quarterly basis, all banks’ progress against their business plans, to ensure they bring their financial situation into line with prudential norms, (notably the 8 percent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 73 - ATTACHMENT capital adequacy requirement) by end-200 1. In the event of non-compliance, prompt corrective action will be taken in accordance with recently enacted criteria. 34. A detailed action plan to bring the supervision and regulatory framework up to international norms over the next two years, will be developed by September 2000. By the same date, a time bound plan for bringing the supervisory, regulatory and governance structures of the pension and insurance industries, finance companies and capital markets into line with international standards will also be drawn up. Bank Indonesia Audit 35. The publication in early July of BI’s audited accounts for end-1999, as well as of international reserves data in line with the IMF’s SDDS, attest to the significant progress being made in improving the central bank’s accounts. The earlier BPK disclaimer on BI’s 1999 audit has been removed, and BI’s financial position at end 1999 has been clarified. By mid-August, BI will complete due diligence on all its subsidiaries and a plan for their divestment by December. BI has also submitted to BPK an interim June balance sheet. Over the coming months, BI will take further steps, including strengthening management information and internal control systems, to ensure that the reforms being implemented become firmly embedded in the governance culture of BI. Debt Management and Bond Market Development 36. The government is giving high priority to establishing sound debt management practices and developing the domestic bond market. The units currently involved in debt management (including the Debt Management Unit, the Directorate of External Loans, and the Directorate of Subsidiary Loan Management) will work closely to consolidate existing debt management activities by end-December. In addition, by the same date, the government will submit to Parliament a draft act providing legal underpinnings for debt management, including standing authority for debt service, and authority for borrowing within the budget cycle. 37. This framework for public debt management, as well as the plans for bond market development, will be set out in a strategy paper by the Debt Management Unit of the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia. This paper will be prepared for discussion in September and published in October. Preparations are being made to begin auctioning short- term government securities in the primary market by December (subject to Parliamentary approval), with the proceeds being used to retire some of the initial issues. V. COFWORATERESTRUCTURING,LEGALREFORM,ANDGOVERNANCE 38. Corporate restructuring is being carried forward by two principal institutions, IBRA and the Jakarta Initiative Task Force (JITF), supported by the coordinating and policy oversight role played by the FSPC. IBRA’s agenda has been summarized above. The JITF’s enhanced framework for its corporate debt restructuring efforts was put in place at the last review, as described in the May 17 MEFP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 74 - ATTACHMENT 39. The enhanced framework aims at delivering accelerated JITF-led restructurings. Between May 1 and July 15, the value of debt restructured under the JITF was $3 billion, bringing the total of restructured debt to $5 billion. Provided a favorable macroeconomic situation can be maintained, and on the basis of the measures specified in paragraphs 42 and 43, the JITF expects that an additional $3-5 billion will be restructured by end-December. The strategic objective is to restructure a total of $12 billion of debt by April 2001. 40. Toward these ends, the JITF is building its structured mediation case load. This case load has risen from about $8 billion on May 1 to $10 billion (as of July 15); it is projected to increase to $15 billion by end-2000 (excluding restructured debt). The present case load includes referrals of eight cases by the FSPC to the JITF (with a total debt of $5.5 billion); further referrals will be made monthly. The objective is to ensure a cumulative total of at least 12 referrals by FSPC with a minimum debt value of $7.5 billion by end-September and a cumulative total of at least I7 referrals with a minimum debt of $10 billion by end- December. 41. The JITF’s mediation schedules range from 3-6 months, depending on the complexity of the case. If the established schedule is not maintained because of debtor noncooperation, the JITF will send the case to the FSPC. The FSPC will promptly forward such noncooperation cases to the Attorney General for initiating bankruptcy proceedings and, if there is evidence of fraud, criminal investigations. Any forbearance granted by the Jakarta Stock Exchange with respect to the continued listing of a debtor will automatically be withdrawn upon a determination of noncooperation. 42. The ability of the JITF to meet these objectives will depend on the cooperation of the debtors and creditors and, in addition, the support of other governmental agencies and institutions. Weekly meetings between the FSPC, the JITF and IBRA are helping synchronize referrals to the JITF where IBRA is a minority creditor. On June 27, the FSPC issued a decree ensuring IBRA support for JITF-led restructurings agreed by a majority of private creditors. 43. The government is introducing additional and time-bound incentives for JITF-led restructuring. A decree will be issued, within four weeks of enactment of the new tax laws, providing immediate income tax relief with respect to (i) debt forgiveness; (ii) debt to asset settlements; and (iii) debt to equity swap. In addition, Bank Indonesia issued a decree on June 12 easing the divestment requirement for banks that hold equity in exchange for debt in the context of a restructuring. Finally, the Ministry of Finance intends to issue a decree by end-August which clarifies that, for the purpose of calculating the minimum financial ratios for regulated finance companies, certain types of subordinated debt instrument will be treated as equity. 44. The JITF will complete its first survey to assess progress in corporate restructuring by mid-August. Henceforth, such surveys will be done on a quarterly basis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 75 - ATTACHMENT 45. Regarding INDRA, in light of the stabilization that has been achieved, an exchange rate guarantee is no longer necessary. Accordingly, the registration period for INDRA has been terminated. 46. Progress is also being made to improve the functioning of the Commercial Court. The President has appointed a new slate of ad hoc judges to the Commercial Court and the government is working with the judiciary to ensure that they are promptly assigned to pending cases before the Commercial Court. As of July 20.2000, ad hoc judges have been assigned to 2 cases filed by IBRA. As a means of enhancing the credibility and transparency of the Commercial Court, the government will be submitting a new law by mid-August that will, among other things, provide for the publication of dissenting opinions ofjudges sitting on the Commercial Court. In the interim, the Supreme Court has issued a regulation clarifying that ad hoc judges may issue dissenting opinions that will be published. 47. The government is also implementing a broader judicial reform strategy. As a result of a recently announced initiative, 70 percent of the judges sitting in Jakarta courts have been replaced as of mid-July, including a number ofjudges of the Commercial Court. Together with Parliament, the President is also taking measures to appoint well-regarded jurists to the Supreme Court, including a Chief Justice who will replace the retiring incumbent in August. The government is also preparing amendments to the Supreme Court law designed to enhance the credibility of this important institution, 48. Progress has been made on two key initiatives to address governance problems within the court system. First, the Joint Investigating Team (JIT)--initially focused on court corruption and including well-respected individuals from civil society-has become operational within the Attorney General’s Office, and investigations are underway. It is expected that a number of cases will be referred to the JIT by the National Ombudsman Commission, an independent body that has been established to act upon complaints from the public regarding governance problems. In addition, Parliament has nominated, and the President will soon appoint, the members of the Commission for the Audit of State Officials, many of whom are drawn from civil society. The Commission will become fully operational by end-August 2000. 49. Other steps being taken to address governance problems within the court system include the preparation of an Advocate’s Law, to be submitted to Parliament in September, that will require all court advocates to be licensed. A condition for such licenses will be adherence to a uniform code of ethics. VI. PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM AND GOVERNANCE 50. Public sector transparency and governance are being carried forward in the following key areas of the program. 51. A law providing for the oversight and audit of private foundations has been prepared, and has been sent to Parliament. We will be working closely with parliamentary leaders toward its passage by September. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 76 - ATTACHMENT 52. We are making progress in identifying and integrating off-budget funds maintained by government ministries and agencies: . The Reforestation Fund was fully transferred to a special state revenue account on July 4, and will be fully integrated in the 2001 budget. . In response to a Presidential Decree issued in May, a number of ministries and agencies have reported the existence of off-budget funds, with a total asset value of about Rp 7.7 trillion (about US$ 860 million). BPKP will verify by September 30 for these agencies whether there has been misreporting, by surveying government accounts in the banking system. Sanctions will be developed by that date and applied on all cases of misreporting. Those agencies not reporting existence of off-budget accounts will be audited by BPKP by November 15,2000, and sanctions applied in cases of misreporting. 53. The next stage of the exercise involves taking decisions about the integration of the remaining off-budget funds with the central government budget. This process will be led by the task force already established to improve treasury management and procedures, and their recommendations received by September. Any funds remaining outside the budgetary framework will be subject to regular audit by BPKP with quarterly reports to Parliament. The task force will also complete its work regarding the consolidation of the bank accounts of government agencies by the same date. On this basis, detailed recommendations for improving treasury management procedures will be implemented by December 2000. The investment funds (RDA and RDI) will be integrated with the 2001 budget, and made subject to Parliamentary approval.’ In this way, we expect to establish full consistency between monetary and fiscal data by end-2000. 54. A number of key government agencies and enterprises are undergoing special performance audits, as envisaged in the May 17 MEFP. Thus: . The audits of the KUT program and of the Tax Office have begun. In both cases, they will be completed during the last quarter of 2000, and corrective actions will be developed by December. . The State Audit Board (BPKP) has begun to use the information that has become available upon the completion of the review of the off-budget funds to ensure that its audits of all public institutions (including the military) in 2000 will take account of all extra-budgetary funding. The Minister of Defense has approved BPKP’s audit of Defense Ministry operations. BPK has also begun examining the foundations of the military. . The first quarterly reports on the implementation of corrective actions by the first group of public institutions undergoing special audits will be published by mid- ’ For legal reasons, inflows and outflows will be presented as an annex. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 77 - ATTACHMENT August (BULOG, PLN, Pertamina, and the Reforestation Fund). BPKP is also undertaking a special audit of all transactions undertaken by BULOG in 2000. . As previously agreed, the government is launching a second round of special audits, comprising the national airline, the national toll road company, the domestic telecommunications company, the largest public port corporations, and a state-owned plantation company. The audits will be carried out with the assistance of international experts. 55. The government is beginning work on a comprehensive reform strategy for the civil service, in consultation with the World Bank. Preliminary recommendations will be developed by the inter-ministerial task force (that is being led by the Minister of State Apparatus) by September 2000, ensuring that any future wage adjustments-including any increase in October-are closely linked to civil service reform in the context of decentralization. The plan will be finalized by end-2000, and its implementation will begin in 2001 with decentralization. 56. Privatization and state enterprise reform are moving ahead and the government is committed to majority divestiture on a case-by-case basis. The FY 2000 privatization program now includes a total of 19 enterprises, although a small number of the planned transactions may not be completed until early FY 2001. Included in the FY 2000 group are several enterprises that are to be totally privatized and a number of financial holding companies that will be liquidated. The process of privatizing the Soerkamo-Hatta airport concession company is already far advanced, and the privatization of PT Pupuk Kaltim, PT Indofarma and PT Sucofindo will be formally launched in August. 57. A new medium-term SOE Reform Masterplan, prepared with technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), was published on June 29. The govermnent reaffirms its strong commitment to majority privatization of most state enterprises in the medium-term, to the early and full privatization of small and medium-sized enterprises that operate in competitive markets, and to the conduct of asset sales for enterprises that have no prospect of achieving commercial viability. Towards these ends, a Ministerial level Privatization Policy Committee will be established by Presidential decree by the end of August. During August, new guidelines and transparent procedures for handling different types of privatization will also be adopted through a Ministerial decree. 58. The government continues to give priority to the rapid restructuring and privatization of the telecommunications sector. By August, we plan to issue implementing regulations for the 1999 Telecommunication Law, as well as a new tariff policy, network inter-connection rules, model operator licenses, and a charter for the planned regulatory agency. The government remains committed to transforming Telkom and Indosat into competing full- service providers and having these companies divest their stakes in all noncore businesses. Each company will divest its holdings in at least two such businesses by end-2000, and all noncore holdings will be divested by end-2001. An inter-ministerial team on telecommunications-established on May 3&will prepare a detailed action plan by September to guide the development of the sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 78 - ATTACHMENT 59. As part of a two-year restructuring program, assisted by the AsDB, 32 state enterprises have been identified to have their accounts audited by independent auditors by end-2000; this plan will be extended to a further 30 state enterprises in 2001, 60. The government remains strongly committed to the comprehensive legal and policy reforms for the energy sector outlined in the MEFP of January 2000. In particular, two new laws concerning Electric Power and Oil and Natural Gas will be submitted to Parliament during September. The Ministry of Mines and Energy has prepared medium term plans to phase out fuel subsidies and restore electricity tariffs to commercially viable levels. 61. Further progress has been made toward resolving the contractual disputes with independent power producers (IPPs). Following the conclusion of several interim agreements, efforts are now focused primarily on negotiating long-term solutions for those plants that are already in commercial operation or far-advanced in construction. In parallel, we are also working to negotiate agreements in respect of projects that have not reached financial closing. VII. OTHERSTRUCTURALISSUES 62. The government will shortly publish a regulation narrowing the list of sectors that are closed to foreign investment. 63. In agriculture, there are three principal policy initiatives underway: For rice, the import tariff level and the BULOG procurement price will be reassessed and adjusted in August, prior to the next crop season, after widespread consultations. At the same time, we are preparing to change BULOG’s legal status to permit a more transparent accounting system and greater efficiency in the operating structure by September. In the sugar sector, cane farmers were supported for this crushing season with government funds to mills to purchase their cane. By end-September, however, we will announce a plan to increase the efficiency of the sugar industry by consolidating the large number of inefficient state-owned sugar factories on Java. As for KUT, from October, working capital for farmers will be extended only through commercial banks, which will make independent credit decisions and bear all repayment risk.
