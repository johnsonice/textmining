Loser and C. Puckahtikom July 6, 1995 The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with The Bahamas took place during March 27-April 12, 1995. u The staff met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and Planning, the Minister of Labor, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other senior officials. Mr. O'Connor, Advisor OED, participated in the discussions. During the 1994 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors emphasized that sustained recovery in the tourism sector would depend on reducing costs and improving the quality of the tourist product. They commended the authorities for relying on the private sector for upgrading tourist facili- ties, but observed that the Government should play a stronger role in improving performance by promoting policies aimed at strengthening external competitiveness. To put growth on a firmer basis, Directors recommended a substantial increase in public sector savings through improved tax administration and expenditure restraint. Also, they urged a faster pace of privatization to promote efficiency and greater labor market flexibility. The economic database remains weak. Data on the financial system and prices are current and reliable, but fiscal data are prepared with lags, and national accounts and external current account data contain various deficiencies. This hampers the capacity of the authorities and the staff to assess economic developments. The staff estimates real and nominal GDP (beyond 1992) and certain accounts in the balance of payments on the basis of partial indicators. The authorities will request technical assistance from the Fund to improve the statistical base. I. Backeround and Recent Economic Develouments The economy of The Bahamas is dominated by tourism. Tourism activity weakened significantly in the early 1990s reflecting cyclical factors and 1/ The staff team consisted of C. G. MuAiz (Head), M. Da Costa, R. Morales, S. Sosa, J. Zeas, and 0.

In 1993, aided by economic recovery in the United States, stopover arrivals increased by 6.4 percent (the first increase in four years); real GDP rose by 2 percent and unemployment fell beck to 13 percent. However, the recovery was not sustained and by the second quarter of 1994 stopover arrivals began to decline. For 1994 as a whole stopover arrivals grew by less than 2 percent, while total arrivals fell by 6.4 percent (Table 2). In the first quarter of 1995 stopover arrivals declined by an estimated 7 per- cent and total arrivals by 11.5 percent. Factors contributing to the weak performance of tourism since mid-1994 include the mild 1994-95 winter in North America; a downturn in global demand for cruise-ship travel; and continued strong competition in the region as evidenced by indicators which point to a further loss in The Bahamas' market share. As regards other sectors, agriculture, fishing, and construction per- formed well in 1994, and offshore banking activity recovered. Altogether, the staff estimates that real GDP grew little in 1994; unemolovment remained constant. Because of the fixed exchange rate regime and the openness of the economy, inflation in The Bahamas has not departed much from that in the United States. J/ Domestic inflation fell to 1.3 percent in 1994 from 2.7 percent in 1993 and an annual average of 6 percent in 1990-92 (Table 1). Since 1989 the Bahamian dollar has remained largely unchanged in real effective terms with respect to all trading partners. On a bilateral basis with currencies of its tourism competitors, the Bahamian dollar has remained about constant in real terms relative to the Barbados dollar, depreciated relative to the Dominican Republic peso, but has appreciated sharply "is-A- vis the Jamaican dollar (Chart 1). Public sector savings--already low in 1990--weakened further during 1991-93 as central government savings turned negative and the operating surplus of the National Insurance Board (NIB) declined (Table 3). However, the public sector deficit (on a cash basis) fell in relation to GDP from 2.4 percent in 1990 to 1 percent in 1993 as major capital projects by the public corporations were completed. I/ For a description of the tourism sector, see The Bahamas - Recent Economic Develooments; SM/94/111 (5/3/94). 2/ Stopover arrivals account for the bulk of tourist expenditure and give a better indication of developments in tourism than total arrivals.

Tax revenue rose by 2 percentage points of GDP due to increases in import duty and stamp tax rates introduced in the budgets for PY 1993/94 I/ and FY 1994/95, and a rapid growth in private demand (Table 5). Central government current expenditure, which in 1993 included the settlement of outstanding domestic payments arrears (2 percent of GDP) declined somewhat. The surplus of the public enterprises and the NIB remained unchanged relative to GDP (Tables 6-7); however, loss-making enterprises (the Hotel Corporation and the airline company) continued to rely heavily on government transfers. Credit exoansion was moderate during 1991-93 as credit to the public sector slowed end credit demand by the private sector was relatively weak (Table 8). Commercial banks were quite liquid during this period and increased their excess reserves at the Central Bank while reducing their external liabilities. In 1994, the net domestic assets of the financial system expanded at a somewhat faster pace. Credit to the public sector declined, but credit to the private sector expanded sharply reflecting renewed investment in tourism and increased demand for housing and consumer credit. As commercial banks' excess reserves began to decline, lending rates rose from 14 percent in June 1994 to 14.5 percent in December 1994, and deposit rates from 4 percent to 5 percent. In June 1994 the Central Bank abolished the ceiling on deposit rates. 2/ Reflecting the decline in the public sector deficit end week private demand, the external current account deficit narrowed from 7.5 percent of GDP in 1991 to 2.6 percent of GDP in 1993 (Table 9). The deficit widened to 4.4 percent of GDP in 1994 due to the winding down of the operations of a major exporter of pharmaceutical products, and a pickup in imports related to the refurbishment of tourist facilities. The deficit in 1994 was financed largely by long-term private capital inflows. The net inter- national reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank have increased in recent years, but the NIR coverage of base money has fallen below 80 percent and reserves have remained below the authorities' target of lo-12 weeks of imports (Table 8). The outlook for the economy in 1995 is mixed. Construction activity may remain strong due to additional (although smaller) renovation projects in the hotel sector, a transshipment project in Grand Bahama and larger public investment. However, as noted earlier, tourist activity declined sharply in the first quarter of 1995. The authorities are confident that better marketing. the continued renovation of facilities, and measures to reverse the declining trend of 1/ In 1993, the budget year was shifted from a calendar-year basis to a fiscal-year basis starting July. 2/ The ceiling was reduced in stages from 6.7 percent in 1993 to 6 percent in 1994. Almost all deposits had interest rates lower than 6 percent in the first half of 1994.

Even so, the staff estimates that stopover arrivals could decline by 1 percent in 1995 and total arrivals by 6 percent (see Table 2). On this basis, real GDP could register a small decline. Private demand remains fairly strong and the external current account deficit is projected to remain at about 4.5 percent of GDP financed largely by private capital inflows associated with the continuation of renovation projects in the hotel sector and the transshipment project noted above (Table 11). NIR would remain unchanged. II. Policy Discussions The discussions took place in circumstances when economy has started to show some signs of recovering from the 1991-92 recession and the investment climate has improved, but tourism and economic growth remain sluggish and unemployment high. Also despite an improvement in 1994, the fiscal position is still weak; public sector savings remain quite low and tax revenue is based narrowly on imports and tourism. Moreover, NIR remain below the authorities' target. Accordingly, the discussions focused on policies needed to strengthen the country's external competitiveness and growth performance in the context of the fixed exchange rate regime which the authorities wish to preserve. 1. Tourism policy and external comuetitiveness The staff observed that available indicators, such as those which pointed to a loss of market share, suggested that The Bahamas needed to strengthen its external competitiveness to achieve sustained growth in income and employment. The authorities noted that their strategy was to strengthen competi- tiveness by attracting private investment to improve and diversify tourist facilities in ways that would appeal to the upper-income end of the market. This strategy was beginning to show positive results. In 1994, a large international company, Sun International, invested US$lOO million to refurbish a 1,200.room resort on Paradise Island; room rates at the resort had risen by 50 percent, and occupancy reached 90 percent, compared with a national average of 62 percent. The authorities noted also that they were selling eight hotels (out of eleven remaining government-owned hotels), all of which were being refurbished. By end-1996 only one hotel was expected to remain in state hands. The authorities also reaffirmed their objective of establishing closer links between tourism and other sectors and noted that some progress had been made toward increasing the volume of domestic agri- cultural products supplied to the hotels. The staff welcomed these efforts. It emphasized, however, that to improve external competitiveness the Government should pay increasing attention to containing costs in the economy by, inter alia, following restrained expenditure policies, promoting labor market flexibility, and increasing productivity in the public sector. In this connection, the staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - noted with concern that wage increases in the public sector had been excessive in recent years, IJ contributing to higher costs of public services and undermining the capacity of the private sector to contain wage costs. The staff also expressed concern regarding the slow pace of privatization (except in the hotel sector), noting that privatization would promote efficiency and increase labor market flexibility including by helping to depoliticize wage settlements and employment practices. The authorities said that there had been no general wage increase in the Central Government during 1989-92, and that civil servants' wages were not excessive. However, they recognized that wage increases in certain enterprises had been large and emphasized their commitment to containing wage costs in the public sector. They also pointed out that wage costs in the tourism industry were being contained as the unions had agreed to modify and extend through 1997 the five-year wage agreement negotiated in 1990 which had been temporarily suspended in 1993-94. A 12 percent wage increase scheduled for 1993 had been phased over a 15-month period and converted in three lump sum payments that did not affect the base salary, and a 10 per- cent wage increase scheduled for 1994 was renegotiated to 7 percent. Other key features of the renegotiation included a reduction in the premium for working on holidays and greater flexibility in labor arrangements--including allowing for part-time employment and subcontracting of certain services. The Bahamian representatives said they would ensure that public utility rates and services were competitive. Rates on international telephone calls had been reduced and electricity rates to large commercial consumers were being reviewed. Efficiency in telecommunications and electricity would be increased through privatization. An Inter-American Development Bank study to be completed this year would advise on options for privatizing the electricity company, and joint ventures were being considered in telecom- munications. Overall, the authorities were confident that the upgrading of facili- ties, combined with measures to contain costs in the hotel industry, had improved the outlook of tourism over the medium term and provided a strong basis for maintaining the fixed exchange rate regime, 2. Fiscal policy The staff observed that notwithstanding the recent improvement in the fiscal position, the outlook for the public finances in 1995 was difficult. Central government revenue would be affected adversely by lower tourist activity while expenditure is projected to increase in real terms due to larger outlays on personal emoluments (on account of wage increases already 1/ In the Central Government the wage bill increased by 10 percent in 1994, including retroactive payments covering 1993. In the corporations during 1993-94 wages increased by 9 percent in the electricity company (BEC); 10 percent in the telecommunications company (BATELCO); and 11 percent in the NIB.

Also, with general elections scheduled to take place no later than August 1997, pressures were building for additional capital expenditure. The staff noted that if no corrective measures were taken, the central government deficit in relation to GDP would widen from 1 percent in calendar 1994 to no less than 2 percent in calendar 1995 and 2.5 percent in N 1995/96. The staff cautioned that a widening in the domestic borrowing require- ment of the Central Government would lead to pressures on international reserves at a time when demand for imports by the private sector was strong, or to a crowding out of private investment. It stressed that continued fiscal discipline was essential to maintain the fixed exchange rate parity and recommended that the authorities keep the central government deficit at around 1 percent of GDP. Given the outlook for the finances of the rest of the public sector, this would be consistent with an overall public sector surplus of about 1 percent of GDP and no domestic financing requirement. The authorities noted their commitment to fiscal discipline and said that they would limit the central government deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP during F'Y 1995/96; fiscal tightening beyond this level would depress economic activity unduly. On the revenue side, they would strengthen tax administration, including by updating property assessment values to market levels and reducing tax exemptions. On expenditure, they would contain political pressures for larger outlays, and would refrain from granting a general wage increase in the Central Government. Severance payments and other costs of privatizing government-owned hotels would be closely scrutinized and covered in part with proceeds from the privatization of a state bank; transfers to the enterprises would be restrained. In the event, however, the FY 1995/96 budget sent to Parliament in May 1995 envisages a central government deficit of 2 percent of GDP owing to higher current and capital expenditure than contemplated during the discus- sions. On this basis, the staff projects that the public sector balance would shift from a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 1994 to a small deficit in 1995, with public sector savings falling to 2.7 percent of GDP from 3.7 per- cent of GDP in 1994. The domestic financing requirement of the public sector which was negative in 1994 would reach 1 percent of GDP in 1995. As for the rest of the public sector, the staff stressed the need to reduce central government transfers to the enterprises by improving control and accountability, and restraining wages, beginning with the forthcoming wage negotiations with electricity workers. It also recommended that NIB finances be strengthened by reducing evasion, increasing the ceiling on the insurable wage, and keeping a firm lid on the wage bill. 1,' I/ The maximum insurable wage (the maximum wage subject to social security contributions) has remained unchanged at B$250 per week since 1984. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - The authorfties noted that subsidies to the enterprises were being reduced gradually; for example, the electricity utility now paid some taxes on its fuel imports, and they planned to phase out all subsidies over time. Also, user fees for water were scheduled to be raised later this year, and the differential in fees between users in the main islands and the smaller Family Islands would be reduced gradually. The Government also was committed to containing wage increases in the public enterprises, and an employment freeze had been introduced in the electricity and telecommunications utilities. The authorities were proceeding firmly but carefully in these areas given the strength of the unions and the need to avoid disruptions that could affect the tourist industry. In the NIB, the insurable wage would be increased in 1995 and subsidized lending to public enterprises would be limited; wage costs would be contained through greater wage restraint and an employment freeze. The Bahamas' import tariff regime is complex, containing about 120 different rates and numerous exemptions. u The authorities intend to rationalize import tariffs as proposed by FAD, but beginning in N 1996/97 instead of in FY 1995/96 as had been contemplated; additional time was needed to ensure that the relevant institutional and administrative changes were in place. The tariff reform would be revenue-neutral and would include converting specific rates to an ad valorem basis; substituting excise duties for stamp duties and levying excise duties on imports and domestic products without discrimination; unifying import and other duties into a single tariff; establishing a rate structure of no more than five rates; and removing all undesirable exemptions. u The authorities indicated that introduction of a sales tax--a long-standing recommendation of the staff to broaden the tax base and reduce the heavy reliance on trade and tourism taxes--would be postponed until the tariff reform was in place and its impact fully assessed. The staff recognized the authorities' concerns about the appropriate timing of the tariff reform and the introduction of a sales tax, but stressed the importance of moving rapidly in these areas to improve resource allocation and broaden the tax base. The Bahamas is a member of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), but is not a signatory of the CARICOM Common Market Agreement because of its dependence on import tariffs. The authorities noted that tariff ration- alization would eventually allow for closer trading relations with the Caribbean and Latin America, and acknowledged that broadening the tax base would facilitate deepening these relations. 1/ For a description of The Bahamas' tax system see The Bahamas - Recent Economic Develouments, SM/94/111, Section IV, (S/3/94). u The new tariff rates would range from O-50 percent, compared with a range of O-352 percent under the current system. Currently, the most frequent tariff rate is 42 percent, and the average tariff rate 34 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8. 3. Monetarv uolicy The Central Bank of The Bahamas does not conduct an active monetary policy and does not set targets for its credit operations. This, together with the fixed exchange rate regime, results in little control by the bank over the outcome of international reserves which depend largely on the residual demand for central bank credit by the Government and commercial banks' decisions regarding holdings of excess reserves. There is a need to strengthen NIR to ensure continued confidence in the fixed exchange rate regime. The staff, therefore, recommended that the Central Bank increase NIR relative to reserve money and imports in 1995 by setting limits on its net credit operations with the public sector and allowing interest rates to rise as required by market conditions. In subsequent years, fiscal and credit policies should aim at increasing NIR to 100 percent of base money and lo-12 weeks of imports, while allowing for appropriate levels of credit to the private sector. Central bank officials agreed with the desirability of increasing NIR but did not accept the staff's recommendation of setting specific targets for central bank credit. They also felt that it would not be possible to increase NIR in 1995. The outlook for tourism was not good; the domestic borrowing requirement of the public sector was likely to increase; and commercial banks were reducing excess reserves held at the Central Bank to meet the continued strong growth in private sector credit. The staff responded that this scenario underscored the need for fiscal restraint to avoid crowding out the private sector while strengthening the NIR position. Interest rate spreads remain high. 1/ The authorities attributed the spread to oligopolistic behavior and lack of competition, and a parlia- mentary committee is reviewing this issue. The staff advised the authori- ties not to regulate bank spreads and encouraged them to promote greater competition in the financial system, including by reducing and eventually eliminating restrictions on capital account transactions. u The staff stressed that the liberalization of the capital account should be preceded by strengthening fiscal policy, prudential regulations, and bank supervi- sion. Some officials were prepared to consider a phased liberalization of external capital transactions. Others were concerned that capital account liberalization would lead to destabilizing capital flows, a loss of lJ At the end of 1994 the weighted average interest rats on bank loans was 14.5 percent, and the weighted average deposit rate was 4.8 percent. u Borrowing by residents abroad or in foreign currency from domestic banks requires approval by the Central Bank. The Central Bank operates an Investment Currency Market through which, on approval by the Bank, Bahamian residents may purchase foreign securities at a 25 percent premium over cost. Of this 25 percent, 20 percent is refunded once the proceeds from the sale of the security are repatriated to The Bahamas. Purchases and sales in this market totaled about USSO. million in 1994.

The staff noted that capital flows were likely to reflect underlying policies. III. The Outlook for 1995 end Illustrative Medium-Term Prelections To assist the authorities in developing policies over the medium term, the staff prepared a set of illustrative projections for 1996-99 (Table 10). The staff's baseline Cxenario assumes that the upgrading of tourist facili- ties, measures to contain costs in the industry, and improvements in infra- structure would reverse the week performance of tourism of recent years and lead to growth in the sector of 2.5-3 percent a year--somewhat larger then the WE0 forecasts of economic grouch in the United States--The Bahamas' main tourism market. Tourist expenditure in real terms could increase at a somewhat higher rate, particularly in 1996, following the upgrading of hotel facilities. This level of tourism activity wauld permit a rate of growth of real GDP of 2-3 percent a year during 1996-99. The authorities believe that this scenario is pessimistic and are confident that the pace of recovery in tourism would be much stronger than projected by the staff. Nevertheless, the staff considers that a faster- than-projected rate of growth in tourism and GDP would require stronger efforts to strengthen competitiveness and improve resource allocation than are being contemplated by the authorities at present. Enhancing the country's growth prospects while reducing its reliance on external financing would require an increase in domestic savings. The staff would recommend, therefore, that fiscal policy aim at boosting public sector savings to 4 percent of GDP in 1996 and to 4.5-5.0 percent of GDP in 1997-99, through measures to reduce tax exemptions, strengthen tax end customs administration, expand the excise system in the context of tariff rationalization, contain expenditure, and improve the NIB's revenues. This level of savings would allow public investment to increase to 4.5 percent of GDP over the medium term and would be consistent with an overall public sector surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1997-99. It also would facilitate a buildup in NIR to 100 percent of base money and 11 weeks of merchandise imports over the same period. Fiscal restraint and the completion of the refurbishment of tourist facilities and port development in Grand Bahama would permit a reduction in the external current account deficit to 1-2 percent of GDP over the medium term. IV. Staff Auuraisal Since the 1994 Article IV consultation a year ago, the authorities have made progress in attracting private investment and strengthening the public finances. Nevertheless the economic situation remains difficult and the main issues discussed last year remain current: continued loss of market share in tourism; sluggish economic growth and high unemployment; a narrow Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - tax base and low public sector savings; and a slow pace of privatization. Hence, the main task facing the authorities continues to be to enhance the country's growth prospects by improving external competitiveness and resource allocation; strengthening public sector savings; and increasing international reserves to maintain confidence in the fixed exchange rate system. The authorities have taken measures to improve external competitiveness by attracting private investment to upgrade and diversify tourist facili- ties: privatizing its holdings in the hotel sector; and facilitating the renegotiation of the 1990 wage agreement in the hotel sector which had been framed under a more favorable external environment. These actions should enhance the capacity of The Bahamas to compete with other tourist destina- tions, provided that they are supplemented by additional efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity. Ultimately, the needed improvement in the quality and competitiveness of the tourism product must be carried out by the private sector. However, the Government can play a key role in this process by maintaining an environment conducive to private investment: adopting expenditure policies that keep taxes at competitive levels; shifting some of the tax burden from the tourist sector to the local economy; and promoting wage restraint. In addition, efficiency in services and utilities and labor market flexibility could be increased through privatization. There is an urgent need to strengthen public sector savings to help ensure fiscal consolidation while permitting adequate levels of public investment. The staff is concerned, therefore, that under current policies the overall fiscal position and public sector savings will deteriorate at a time when private sector demand is strong. Strengthening the fiscal position will require following restrained expenditure policies throughout the public sector; improving tax and customs administration; reducing tax exemptions; and raising the insurable wage in the NIB. Rationalizing the complex import tariff system and broadening the tax base will improve resource allocation, lower the tax burden on the tourism sector and give buoyancy to the tax system. The staff attaches high priority to the authorities' commitment to exercise tighter control than in the recent past over public sector expendi- ture , including by containing wage increases and freezing employment in the major public enterprises and the NIB. Also of importance is their renewed commitment to allow private participation in the electricity and telecom- munications utilities. Progress in this area has been slow and there is a need to move rapidly in this direction. The staff would also caution against further delays in introducing the proposed tariff reform, and advise the authorities to begin preparatory work for the introduction of a sales tax. Fiscal restraint also will help to strengthen international reserves and maintain confidence in the fixed exchange rate regime. While it may be difficult to increase NIR in 1995 as recommended by the staff, every effort Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - should be made to avoid a loss of reserves this year and to strengthen reserves in the coming years. For this purpose, the Central Bank is urged to pursue a more active credit policy and set limits on its net credit operations with the public sector while allowing interest rates to rise as required by market conditions. In this connection, the staff welcomes the removal of the ceiling on interest rates on deposits. The staff also would encourage the authorities to initiate a process of liberalizing capital account transactions to induce greater competition in the domestic banking system and help lower interest rate spreads. Capital account liberalization must be accompanied by a strengthening of fiscal policy, prudential regula- tions, and bank supervision. Economic analysis in The Bahamas is hampered by the lack of accurate and current data in a number of areas, particularly national accounts and the balance of payments. The staff welcomes the authorities' intention to give high priority to improving the statistical base. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with The Bahamas be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

IX. Technical Assistance: Following an exploratory FAD mission in early 1988, a member of the FAD technical assistance panel took up a position as budget advisor in the Ministry of Finance in January 1989. The assignment was concluded in early 1995. During November 1994-March 1995, FAD provided technical assistance aimed at rationalizing the tariff system and the fiscal incentives regime. MAE has provided technical assistance to the Central Bank of The Bahamas in several areas. From March 1984 to June 1989 an expert was assigned to establish and subsequently to head the Bank Supervision Department. From December 1987 to February 1990 another expert was assigned in the area of administrative procedures. A technical assistance mission in late 1990 reviewed monetary management, financial system liberalization, and exchange control. Its report was issued in January 1991. In October 1987 an STA technical assistance mission reviewed methods for compilation of national accounts data. Another STA mission reviewed international banking data in September 1988. X. Outstandine Statistical Issues: Data used in this report, except for national accounts and trade data, were provided by the authorities. National accounts estimates in real and nominal terms for years beyond 1992 (the latest year for which official data are available) were derived by the staff from sectoral indicators of activity, official estimates of sectoral weights in GDP, and estimated deflators. Trade flows were estimated by the staff from sectoral data. a. Real sector The Department of Statistics has published revised national accounts series in nominal terms for the period 1989-92. Data processing difficulties which have delayed updating of the series are being resolved and the authorities indicated to the mission that national accounts estimates for 1993-94 should be available by end-1995. b. Government finance Major aggregates of the budgetary operations of the Central Government are reported on a current basis to IFS, but GFS data have not been updated since 1986 and the country page for The Bahamas has been dropped from the GFS Yearbook. c. Monetary accounts Monetary statistics are regularly provided by the Central Bank of The Bahamas and appear to follow international methodology. Data reported seem Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - ATTACHMENT I to be consistent, and at present there are no statistical issues of concern regarding monetary statistics. d. bternal sector The balance of payments statistics are not reported to the Fund's Statistics Department on a timely basis. The June 1995 issue of International Finance Statistics contains balance of payments data through the fourth quarter of 1993. Trade statistics are estimated by the Fund staff and the Central Bank and there is no reporting of price and volume data for trade flows. There are no reliable import statistics by country of origin. Monthly data on tourist arrivals are available with a four-month lag, and tourist expenditure statistics are available with a delay of about six months. The authorities stated that the data processing difficulties which have delayed publication of a consistent series of trade data are being resolved and that trade data by economic classification for 1992-94 should be available by end-1995.
