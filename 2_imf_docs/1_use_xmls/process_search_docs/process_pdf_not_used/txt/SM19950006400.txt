Chabrier and C. Puckahtikom April 3, 1995 The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Sana'a during the period January 22-29, 1995. I/ The Yemeni representatives were led by the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank, and included senior officials from the Ministry of.Planning and other economic.minis-tries. The Prime Minister reviewed economic reform issues with the staff. I. Background Yemen's recent economic performance has been adversely affected by exogenous factors. The changes in external economic relations and the diminished financial inflows associated with the Middle East crisis of 1990-91 and developments in the former Soviet Union (FSU) have continued to have a negative impact. And during 1993-94 the country experienced major political strains, secession of the southern governorates, and civil war. In this environment, economic policy formulation and decision-making were impaired; there were major disruptions to economic activity; and the civil war resulted in large casualties and physical damage. The country's present economic difficulties, however, also importantly reflect the carry- over from earlier policy shortcomings which reduced the economy's capacity to adjust to outside events. I/ The mission members were Messrs. Jakubiak (Head), Alexander, Martey, Chami, and Darbar, and Mrs, Lansanah-Richardson as Staff Assistant (all of MED). Mr. Chabrier visited Yemen during the mission. A World Bank mission on structural reforms overlapped with the stay of the Fund team; Messrs. Tyler (Head) and Ghattas attended the consultation discussions as observers.

In the petroleum sector, crude oil production on average was unchanged, but natural gas output rose sharply. Estimated unemployment remained at about 25-30 percent. Inflation accelerated into the range of 50-60 percent. Large fiscal deficits and recourse to domestic bank financing were the central factors underlying these inflation rates (Table 1). The 1992-93 deficits averaged 17 percent of GDP as no major domestic revenue measures were taken in part because of political conditions; crude oil export revenues declined due to higher cost recovery by foreign oil companies, increased domestic consumption, and weak.ening world'prices; and current expenditures--particularly the wage bill and transfers--rose sharply as the Government sought to maintain their real levels against inflation. The fiscal position reflected an intensification of the budget's structural problems in the absence of corrective steps. The ratios of total and current expenditure to GDP remained sizable at 42 percent and 37 percent, respectively, mainly because of the large government wage bill--nearly 25 percent of GDP. However, the ratios of oil and non-oil revenue to GDP declined. Non-oil revenue performed weakly in the absence of measures due to an inelastic system and administrative difficulties, while the decline in the oil ratio reflected the weaker oil export performance and the under- mining of domestic product sales proceeds by the erosion of real prices. Government domestic bank borrowing for the budget accounted almost entirely for the expansion in aggregate credit and broad money (Table 2). But at 25-30 percent the monetary growth rate was well below the rising rate of inflation, and this increase in velocity suggested further weakening of confidence in the rial and further currency substitution. Willingness to hold the rial was, moreover, discouraged by the highly negative real interest rates resulting from the controlled and unchanged nominal rate structure, 2/ and in this environment the rial cost for the U.S. dollar in the parallel exchange market increased by 120 percent. I/ There have been significant improvements in the quality of Yemen's database since the last consultation (Appendix III). However, deficiencies attach to the current price national income estimates due to the inadequate quality of the price and cost information used. As a result, nominal GDP seems to be greatly and cumulatively understated for 1992-94. Staff estimates suggest that the understatemenl: could be about 15 percent in 1992, and cumulatively 30 percent in 1993, 65 percent in 1994, and 80 percent for the 1995 projection. On this basis, all ratios to nominal GDP in this report for these years would need to be adjusted by inverse factors. The macroeconomic data are inclusive of all military transactions. 2/ Commercial bank deposit rates are fixed at 11-15 percent, and the maximum loan rate at 17 percent.

The balance of payments remained weak over 1992-93. Government crude oil export receipts were about 40 percent lower (Table 3). While this loss was offset in part by a strong recovery in non-oil exports, the elimination of the deficit in petroleum product trade, and higher worker remittances, these gains were modest relative to the oil export loss and continued large current payments for imported goods and services and sizable debt service obligations. Additionally foreign loan disbursements declined. With these conditions, the current account 1/ deficits were equivalent annually to 12 percent of GDP, and the overall deficits were on the order of 20-25 percent. The two-year overall deficit of US$2 billion was financed largely by government debt service arrears of USS1.5 billion--of which USS1.3 billion related to FSU credits-- although central bank foreign assets were also heavily drawn down. The foreign exchange market consists of the official and parallel markets. 2/ 2/ The main official rate (YRls 12 per US$l) applies only to government transactions--including the central bank foreign exchange provided for basic food imports--and the banking system. There is also an official incentive rate (YRls 25) which has limited use; for customs valuation, essentially a rate of YRls 18 is used. The parallel market operates outside the banking system as prohibitions apply to commercial bank participation. This market is the venue for virtually all private sector transactions and is fully accessible for all purposes. At end-1994 the free-market parallel rate was YRls 103 and there was also an official parallel rate of YRls 84. The official parallel rate was established at this level in November 1994 under procedures mandated by law for managing the rate and with enforcement imple- mented by the Central Bank. The official rate was more than 700 percent overvalued at end-1994 by comparison with the free parallel rate. From May 1990 when Yemen was unified until end-1994, the real effective exchange rate in the official market appreciated by almost 700 percent (Chart 1). The real effective rate in the free parallel market initially depreciated through end- 1992, but subsequently appreciated by 25 percent over 1993-94 as inflation in Yemen exceeded the rate of depreciation of the parallel rate. 1/ The definition of the current account used in this paper excludes oil company transactions in order to better focus on Yemen's own-resource position. Z?/ Yemen continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. On succeeding to Fund membership in May 1990, the exchange system was free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The subsequent introduction of multiple currency practices constituted exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. These restrictions were not approved in concluding the 1993 consultation. 2/ The exchange system is described in detail in Section VI of the Recent Economic Developments report (forthcoming).

Report on Discussions The consultation discussions reviewed economic policies and major developments in 1994--particularly in view of political events--and focused on prospects and policies for 1995 and the medium term. Yemen continues to experience low non-oil sector growth, high unemployment, substantial domestic and external financial imbalances, accelerating inflation and depreciation of the parallel market rate, and mounting external arrears. With this environment, the central issues for discussion were the main policy reforms that would be needed for a prompt and substantive start on a comprehensive medium-term adjustment effort directed at addressing these difficulties. In concluding the 1993 consultation, Executive Directors urged that the authorities adopt this course of action. In line with Directors' views, the staff indicated that reform priority should attach to correction of the fiscal position, positive real interest rates as well as legal reforms needed for re-intermediation, exchange rate unification, price corrections, addressing the foreign currency exposure of banks, trade system liberalization, social safety net provisions, and resolving the external debt service burden. 1. Real sector The Yemeni representatives indicated that crude oil production in 1994 was nearly double its 1992 level: output rose to 340,000 barrels per day (b/d) due to the coming on stream of a major new field. Smaller new fields would move into production over 1996-97, but with declining yields projected for the country's oldest field, output was expected to peak at some 355,000 b/d in 1996 and fall off moderately over 1998-99 if new discoveries did not occur. Nevertheless, the 1994 external position and medium-term prospects had benefited. Exploration activity was continuing, and the Government had begun to revise contracts with foreign oil companies in order to enhance financial incentives. Natural gas reserves were sizable at 13 trillion cubic feet, and negotiations with foreign energy companies were underway to establish facilities for LNG exports of 5-6 million metric tons per year to come on stream in 1999. Further gains in LPG production had led to self-sufficiency, and the prospects for LPG exports were being considered. Although energy sector developments had been positive, real non-oil GDP was estimated to have declined by 3 percent in 1994 and inflation to have accelerated into the range of 75-100 percent largely owing to the difficult political environment and the civil war which had resulted in some import shortage, disruptions to production, and a weakening of the budget. Reconstruction efforts were now underway, and with a return to more normal conditions, non-oil sector activity was expected to recover in 1995 and inflation to moderate. The authorities accorded the highest priority to strengthening private sector growth in view of the declines in real per capita income and an urban unemployment level which was now estimated at more than 30 percent. The growth of the private sector labor market was not sufficient to absorb Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - returned expatriates, new market entrants, and redundant labor from public enterprises. This latter task was particularly pressing given the January 1995 government decision to pursue a brc'ad privatization program. It was widely accepted that many public sector enterprises were confronted with overstaffing and other inefficiencies which resulted in low profitability or financial losses. The sector was a cost to the budget, and the fiscal resources needed to address its problems and undertake restruc- turing were not available. Moreover, privatization would contribute to a more positive environment for non-oil sector growth and increased economic efficiency. The reach of t'he program was broad: industry, agriculture, tourism properties, housing, and other sectors would be covered. As development and employment consequences required special consideration, it was intended that the first new owner or lessee not be allowed to change the sector orientation of the property and that present 'workers be given employment preferences. Displaced labor would receive government retraining and job search assistance as well as end-of-service financial support. Separately, denationalization, which was an issue in the southern governo- rates. would be addressed. The staff agreed that an improvement in the non-oil sector's growth performance was essential in order to address unemployment and real income conditions, achieve a reduction in public sector overstaffing that could assist the budget and privatization, and strengthen the external position. The first policy objective to facilitate growth should be early implementa- tion of a forceful macroeconomic stabilization program which could provide the improved domestic and external financial environment conducive to private activity, foreign investment, and non-oil export growth. But far- reaching structural reforms were also needed to promote a more efficient functioning of the economy. To this end. a broad liberalization program should be quickly put in place directed at fully removing the price and nonprice regulatory impediments to efficient economic decisions. In the area of price regulation, the staff noted that controls were relatively limited but continued to apply to key commodities where they had resulted in substantial distortions. For example, the controlled prices for petroleum products and official imports of wheat and flour which continued to be set using the appreciated official exchange rate were equivalent in early 1995 to about 10 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of interna- tional prices evaluated at the free parallel rate. Moreover, regulated power tariffs did not cover current costs even with petroleum product inputs priced at one-tenth of their international equivalent, and a similar situation applied for water charges. Government oversight of public enterprise pricing also remained in place. Although private sector import transactions took place at t.he parallel rate, these prices benefited from the large and increasing overvaluation of the customs exchange rate. These price controls and distortions resulted in a considerable inducement to wasteful consumption and inefficient production decisions. Moreover, the balance of payments was adversely affected through Lower crude oil exports and the displacement of domestic production by imports, particularly in the case of foodgrains. As smuggling of controlled-price items had also Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - apparently taken hold, there were additional foreign exchange losses to be considered. Therefore, it was essential to move these prices to market levels and to free them. If price corrections for some commodities were politically sensitive or there were social safety net considerations, the process could be eased by transitional budget subsidies. This would more- over remove a major obstacle to exchange rate unification. The Yemeni representatives stated that the need to correct price distortions was recognized and steps were being taken. In mid-1994, the Central Bank had discontinued providing official foreign exchange for the remaining official rice imports. All rice imports were now undertaken only by the private sector, and prices were market-determined. The resulting price increases had. been substantial. In the area of nonprice regulation, liberalization should encompass in particular the full freeing up of the trade system and investment licensing. Administrative intervention in the exchange market was also detrimental. The Government's efforts should focus instead on enhancing the legal environment needed for private sector growth. Here, steps were needed on an urgent basis to ensure that business and banks could rely on effective and rapid judicial enforcement of the commercial code and loan contracts. For the public enterprises, the Government's commitment to privatization was welcome. However, the sector use and labor provisions attached to the program could be a hindrance and should be reconsidered. In the interim, those enterprises that remained in the public sector should be moved to a free-market basis through the lifting of government price, employment, and other guidelines and the granting of managerial autonomy. 2. Fiscal policv Official estimates indicate that the Government's fiscal position weakened in 1994. With expenditures and revenues as well as the scope for discretionary measures adversely affected by political developments, the deficit/GDP ratio moved to 22 percent. The civil war considerably lifted wage and nonwage defense outlays and spending for materials and services, but the budget outcome also reflected the full-year impact of the late 1993 increase in defense salaries, a rise in the civil service wage bill, higher current transfers, and expanded development spending. With disruptions to revenue administration, the ratios of tax and nontax revenue to GDP further eroded although steps had been taken to enforce payments of arrears on taxes and public enterprise profit transfers. I-/ Aggregate oil revenue 2/ recorded a 35 percent rise despite the interruptions to normal oil sector flows and domestic refinery operations.

The Yemeni representatives stated that the authorities intended to begin lowering the fiscal deficit in order to bring inflation under control. The erosion of purchasing power and the depreciation of the parallel rate were having disruptive social effects. .4 policy package for the 1995 budget which targeted expenditure restraint, new taxes, increases in controlled prices, and adjustments of the official and customs valuation exchange rate had been proposed to the Cabinet. It was estimated that the proposed revenue measures were equivalent to about 6 percentage points of 1995 GDP although there would be some offset from expenditure adjustments. With additionally the net effect on budget en:ries from the depreciation of the official exchange rate--particularly on oil export receipts--and the depreciation's effect in lifting the GDP estimate, the deficit/GDP ratio was expected to decline to 10 percent. The budget had not been finalized as cabinet discussions were continuing, but if agreement could be reached in the next few weeks, it was hoped that parliamentary approval would be received in early April. I/ To contain bank financing, legislation had been proposed to Parliament to permit the issuing of rial and foreign currency denominated government debt instruments. The staff responded that the deterioration in domestic financial conditions was a major concern given its negative ramifications for real income, growth, and the balance of payments. As the budget was the key policy instrument to be utilized to establish the stable financial environ- ment needed for economic expansion and strengthening the external position, it was essential to put in place a forceful fiscal stance for 1995 and the medium term that could quickly lower annu.al inflation into the single digit range. The fiscal correction should be front-loaded with the maximum possible effort in 1995 in order to sharply compress price pressures. This would also set the stage for early implementation of interest and exchange rate reform. The measures proposed to the Cabinet for this year were welcome as they represented a strong start at breaking loose from the recent policy inertia. At a minimurn, the full effort should be undertaken, but since the deficit and bank financing would still remain large, expenditure should be tightened further and additional revenue sources identified. Moreover, it was essential to support the anti-inflation thrust of the package through the reform of real interest rates. Given the magnitude of government outlays, a major expenditure restraint effort was appropriate, but to oe ef:fective this would need to address in particular the largest spending components--the aggregate govern- ment wage bill and current transfers. With a wage bill equivalent to nearly L/ Subsequent to the consultation discussions, the authorities in March increased electricity tariffs by 35-90 percent, more than tripled cigarette taxes wllile also moving them to an ad valorem basis, and doubled prices for 90 percent of tile petroleum product consumption basket.

There was little scope for absorbing into the civil service more redundant enterprise labor or in the context of privatization providing extended income support to more displaced workers. Earlier commitments of this type were already a weight on the budget, and new commitments should be avoided. To contain transfers, similar labor reforms were needed in the public entities, and pending privatization, these reforms should be accompanied by steps directed at shifting public sector activities to a financially self-supporting basis. Applying this principle would also provide relief to budget capital transfers. These steps moreover would provide scope for a larger reversal ,of the recent compression of development spending. Further major increases in medium-term domestic oil and non-oil revenue would also be needed. A substantial improvement in the administration of existing taxes was the first essential, since in all major categories recent revenue performance had been highly inelastic. In addition, non-oil resources would be substantially enhanced by fully correcting the customs valuation rate in the context of exchange rate unification; increasing public utility tariffs to fully cover current costs (including the costs of a phased correction of petroleum product prices); correcting and freeing up other controlled prices, particularly for public enterprise output and services; raising fees and charges for government services to restore at least their 1990 real levels; and introducing charges for presently free government services except where social considerations were overwhelming. As additional revenues would be needed further into the medium term, preparations should also be initiated for introduction of a broad-based sales tax on goods and services in 1996-97. With regard to domestic oil revenues, as exchange rate unification was implemented--whether in one-step or a phased manner--it would be important to price crude oil deliveries to domestic refineries using the depreciated official rate. This higher cost ideally should be fully passed through to petroleum product prices in order to benefit the budget and correct distortions. However, full exchange rate adjustment with commensurate product price corrections would result in major price shocks, for example, a one step correction would increase product prices ninefold. As price shocks of this magnitude could result in public resistance, consideration could be given to a phased adjustment to international equivalents over a few years (e.g., three years) and independent of the pace of exchange rate unification. While phasing would entail an explicit budget subsidy, the subsidy would be covered in rial terms by the increased budget receipts from domestic refineries. A parallel assessment applied to the pricing of official wheat imports. Since the social sensitivity to price shocks would be greater in this case, there was greater justification for a phased price adjustment and an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - explicit subsidy. 1/ However, a containment of the subsidy was needed, and could be realized by moving to a wheat import basket that distinguished between high and low qualities and by implementing price corrections for higher quality wheat also over three years. Social safety net considerations would arise regarding the pace of the price adjustments to be associated with low quality wheat which wou.Ld be consumed mostly by vulnerable groups. A practical approach could be to permit explicit subsidization over an extended period with prices corrected gradually. Consideration could also be given to some concessional pricing for narrow first tranches of public utility consumption as price corrections in these areas were implemented. The staff commented that, apart from pricing issues, exchange rate unification had implications for the budget's role in containing monetary growth. Due to oil export revenue, the budget generated a net foreign exchange surplus, and as the official exchange rate was depreciated, the rial counterpart of this surplus would rise significantly. This alone would give the appearance of a stronger overall budget position, although in fact it would only represent the use of the depreciated exchange rate in government foreign exchange transacti0n.s with the Central Bank. This had occurred in estimating the effects of the proposed 1995 budget package. Recognizing this, new targeted budget positions and use of bank credit would need to be appropriately lower relative to the pre-unification fiscal position in order to effectively contain monetary expansion and inflation. The proposed program of government domestic nonbank borrowing would assist stabilization, and institutional preparations for sales of rial- denominated government debt instruments to the general public at market-based rates of return should be quickly undertaken as time would be needed to gain broad acceptance. Until then, however, the containment of the monetary effects from the budget would need to come directly from corrective fiscal measures., Foreign exchange-denominated instruments should be avoided. This would be equivalent to an increase in external debt on nonconcessional terms and conflict with articulated official debt management policy. 3. Monetary policies Monetary and credit growth in 1994 at about 30 percent again resulted almost entirely from the financing requirement for the budget. A further rise in velocity contributed to the acceleration of inflation, and was accompanied by a further 60 percent increase in the rial cost for the U.S. dollar in the free parallel market. Negative real interest rates and disintermediation continued to mark the banking system, and consequently credit growth to the private sector at 18 percent was well below inflation, resulting in another large contraction in real credit availability. L/ The official retail wllent price (wilich illcl.ucies allowances for handling and transportation) is equival.(lllt to 40 percent of the world price #evaluated at the free parallel market rate (with the same allowances). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - The staff commented that present interest rate policy and disinter- mediation were detrimental to the economy and growth prospects. Negative real rates had adverse consequences for efficient economic and budget decisions in addition to financial intermediation, and thus growth and the viability of the banking system were impaired. Moreover, negative rates limited the foreign exchange available to the economy as flight from the rial was encouraged as well as the retention of assets abroad, and this contributed to the depreciation of the parallel rate and the widening of the deficit in the balance of payments. To address these issues, interest rate reform was urgently needed, encompassing the full freeing up of the nominal rate structure in order to give latitude to market forces, permit positive real returns, and eliminate the concessional central bank rates for credit to the Government and public enterprises. This reform should proceed in tandem with introduction of a strong 1995 budget in order to reinforce stabilization. Additionally, this timing would facilitate the introduction of government debt instruments. Re-intermediation was essential for a revival of economic growth as the private sector would need to obtain adequate credit resources from a well-functioning banking system. In addition to positive real interest rates for depositors, re-intermediation would require on the loan side legal reforms which allowed banks quick judicial recourse to address their presept nonperforming assets and offered assurances that problems of recourse and enforcement would not emerge in the future. Therefore, effective new laws and an effective commercial court system should be implemented on a very high priority basis in conjunction with interest rate reform. Success in removing obstacles to re-intermediation and a more rapid growth of credit to the private sector would require the Central Bank to assume an independent and active credit management role. Here, policies would need to be appropriately tight in order to ensure the sharp dampening of inflation. This would necessitate that credit to the Government be strictly limited so that the aggregate net credit growth rate could be targeted well below that expected for nominal non-oil GDP while fully meeting the genuine credit needs of the nongovernment sector. Reliance on credit ceilings could initially provide a conveniently simple approach, but direct controls should be replaced by indirect instruments as soon as practicable. The Yemeni representatives commented that the authorities recognized the role of positive real rates in containing inflation and the depreciation of the parallel rate and in advancing re-intermediation. However, given the high rate of inflation, it would be difficult to gain public acceptance for a full move to positive real rates. A more gradual approach would be needed over a few years. Legal reforms to address bank nonperforming asset prob- lems had been delayed by political developments, but it was expected that steps could now be taken. The staff observed that a further concern regarding the banking system was its sizable foreign currency csposure which, even wtlen evaluated at the official rate, exceeded aggregate barlk capital. Exchange rate unification would entail a domestic currency loss for any ballk with all exposure, and a particularly large exposure could put a bank at considerable risk. With Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - these conditions, the supervision authorities should review the soundness of individual institutions, and reach decisions on how to proceed. Final remedies might be required for a fundamentally unsound bank confronted additionally with substantial domestic currency losses. For a basically strong but significantly affected bank, the Government would need to make special provisions to maintain solvency. If a strengthening of the capital positions of government-owned banks were required, there would be fiscal costs to be accepted. Additionally, prudential oversight should pay close attention to asset quality in the new post re-intermediation environment where positive real interest rates attracted much larger deposits and there was rapid growth in lending to the nongovernment sector. With regard to institutional arrangements, competition within the banking system should be promoted by appropriate policies, such as a more liberal licensing stance toward banks meeting strong prudential standards. Increased competition would assist in containing spreads following interest rate reform and in providing an efficient channel for indirect monetary instruments. The Yemeni representatives indicated th.at the aggregate foreign currency exposure of the banking system mainly represented conditions at one large bank. Here, the differences between the bank and its customers over responsibilities regarding unsettled foreign debt had been resolved, and steps were now being taken to reduce the bank's foreign liabilities, including debt write downs by foreign banks and regular foreign exchange payments by former customers. Steps also had been taken to strengthen prudential requirements and supervision, Banks had been mandated to meet a more than doubling of the minimum capital requirement by end-1994. For the system as a whole, the new level was equivalent to about 9 percent of domestic nonreserve assets. Moreover, the monitoring of loan quality had been expanded and the enforcement of credit concentration restrictions tightened. 4 . External sector policicz Estimates for the 1994 balance of payments indicate a considerable improvement in both the current account and overall positions. The current account deficit declined to US$135 million--3 percent of GDP--essentially owing to the near tripling of government crude oil export receipts. The effects of the civil war were relatively limited: trade in petroleum products move into a net deficit and non-oil sector imports were lower. The improved current account was reflected in a lower overall deficit of US$515 million--or 12 percent--although the benefit was tempered by capital account developments. With the fall off in oil sector construction activity, direct investment inflows to meet local costs declined, and unrecorded private capital inflows (as suggested by the errors and omissions entry) were also Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - lower. L/ The financing of the overall deficit and a buildup of official reserves by about US$200 million--equivalent two months' imports--entailed further accumulations of government external arrears. Yemen's external debt was USS8.9 billion at end-September 1994, entailing a debt/GDP ratio of 215 percent and an obligations/current account receipts ratio of about 35 percent. The FSU accounts for about 65 percent of debt; for non-FSU debt, the ratios would be 65 percent and 10 percent, respectively. For end-1994, the stock of government external arrears is estimated at USS3.5 billion, with overdue servicing to the FSU accounting for about 85 percent of this amount. Medium-term balance of payments projections (1995-99) were prepared by the staff of the Central Bank and the mission on the assumption of unchanged policies. On this basis, the external outcomes reflect importantly two factors: the continued higher level of government crude oil export receipts and beginning in 1997 a substantial fall off in amortization obligations to the FSU countries. In the current account, the effect of the increased oil exports is to sustain on balance the downward shift in the level of the deficit'recorded in 1994: the medium-term deficit is forecast to average about US$160 million (4 percent of GDP) although a temporary weakening in 1995 is anticipated due largely to factors affecting oil exports. 2/ The projections also entail stagnant real non-oil sector imports excluding food due to contractions in economic activity as business and investor confidence further erodes and distortions are unalleviated, and a steady level of private remittances owing to unpromising domestic employment conditions. It is assumed that new oil discoveries and LNGiLPG exports would not come on stream during the period. In the overall position, a widening of the deficit is expected in 1995-96--to about US$675 million (18 percent) on average--owing largely to the 1995 weakening in oil export receipts: diminished loan disbursements as donor confidence erodes; a further fall off in oil sector direct investment outlays for local costs; and a neutral assumption regarding unrecorded private capital flows. l/ Over 1997-99, although these latter capital account conditions would continue, the overall deficit is expected to decline to US$215 million (6 percent) on average following the decline of FSU amortization obligations to about 10 percent of their level over the previous three years. For the entire medium-term period, financing gaps l/ The conventional capital account recorded a large turnaround and deficit (US$530 million) as net oil sector direct investment inflows were minor. 2/ Oil production is expected to decline this year before new fields come on stream in 1996, while at the same time deliveries to domestic refineries are projected to return to their pre-war levels. l/ The conventional capital account is forecast to remain in sizable deficit as a result of low loan disbursements and a general offsetting of reduced amortization obligations by rising oil sector net direct investment outflows. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - emerge equivalent to the #overall deficits plus minor increases in official reserves in order to maintain cover at two months' imports. To the extent that arrangements for exceptional financing were not put in place, external arrears would continue to accumulate. Despite the generall:y lower absolute levels of the medium-term current account and overall deficits, a steady post-1995 widening of the deficits emerges as a result of the weakening of oil export receipts from its new higher level as production falls off; the rising nominal costs of non-oil sector imports; declining loan disbursements and local foreign exchange spending for oil sector investment activity; as well as the general absence of positive trends elsewhere in an environment of policy inaction. Conse- quently by 1999, the current and overall deficits are projected to reach 6-7 percent of GDP with no evident prospect for a turnaround. Also, while debt servicing capacity improves--the ratio of the financing gap to total obligations declines from about 90 percent in 1995 to 50 percent in 1997-- capacity thereafter deteriorates as th,e ratio rises to about 95 percent by 1999. In considering medium-term external prospects, the Yemeni representa- tives commented that the higher level Iof oil exports would provide some continued relief to the recent intense pressure on official foreign exchange resources, permitting the now restored levels of official food imports and central bank reserves to be sustained. This apart, medium-term prospects with unchanged policies were of considerable concern. There would be little scope to expand own foreign exchange outlays for development projects which with a continued unstable domestic and external financial environment would limit the economy's growth. Moreover as meeting debt service payments would remain difficult, creditworthiness issues would continue to limit the avail- ability of external financial resources and impair the functioning of the economy. Medium-term prospects would be stronger if the reform package proposed for 1995 were implemented--this was in fact one of its major goals- -and this effort could subsequently be deepened and broadened. But in the absence of a political consensus, it would be premature to make the proposed program the basis for evaluating medium-term prospects. A conservative assessment could be maintained for the time being and subject to subsequent revision. The staff observed that the medium-term outlook suggested that a comprehensive adjustment effort and special attention to external debt servicing were needed to improve the structure of the balance of payments and to move toward viability. First, adjustment was essential to begin correcting structural imbalances, in particular the narrow dependence on volatile oil revenues and on private remittances, only small non-oil exports, and an import bill that was out of line with these current receipts. However, it should be recognized that, while there would be a positive impact on the balance of payments from adjustment, there were limits to what could be quickly achieved. For example, exchange rate unification could not be expected to have a large and immediate effect on the private sector's external position since the sector already operated at the free parallel rate. Consequently, for example, there would not be a Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - large rial price stimulus to non-oil exports. An improved performance would need to come instead from the rising confidence and investment in the economy promoted by stabilization, a broad freeing up from regulation and price distortions, and re-intermediation. Similarly, these factors would be the central sources for replacing imports with domestic production. Although assistance would come from correcting the customs valuation rate, the benefit would be reduced to the extent there was offsetting tariff rationalization. Thus, stabilization measures and structural reforms should be considered the basic policy tools needed to promote the economic growth required for strengthening the external position. Second, present external prospects suggested that, even if the now higher oil exports were supplemented by the benefits of adjustment, the country's large external debt would continue to meet with servicing difficulties. This issue should be directly addressed through an active program to reach arrangements with creditors on terms that were compatible with medium-term balance of payments prospects. This would entail regu- larizing existing arrears that could not be cleared and an appropriate rescheduling of future obligations. The arrears problem was adversely affecting the willingness of donors and creditors to disburse. Yet it would not be possible to sustain economic growth without a reasonable level of external financial support. A successful rescheduling outcome would be facilitated by adopting a strong adjustment program as creditor confidence would be enhanced. The Yemeni representatives stated that debt servicing problems were compounding the difficulties of identifying new credits. In 1994 it had not been possible for the Government to obtain any suppliers' credits. The sequencing in the Government's strategy would be first to begin to implement its reform program and then pursue the debt rescheduling issue. Present debt service policy was in principle to remain current on interest and amortization obligations on suppliers' credits and on all bilateral and multilateral loans except those relating to the FSU. These latter credits were viewed as largely political rather than economic debt. Actual debt service was current for all multilateral institutions, but there had been arrears to some regional and nonregional creditors apart from the FSU. Contacts on debt issues with the Russian authorities had been made through third parties, and a proposal had been received offering to cancel Yemen's FSU debt for a cash payment equivalent to 10 percent of the credits outstanding. While the authorities wished to resolve the FSU debt question, the financial resources to meet these terms were not available or in prospect. There had been no contacts with other countries on debt issues. To contain future debt servicing difficulties, a cautious debt management policy remained in place: no official commercial borrowing would be undertaken; new concessional loans were carefully considered; government- guaranteed suppliers' credits were limited to food imports; and the private sector was not permitted to take up new commercial loans or suppliers' credits without government approval. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - The staff stated that exchange rate policy was an area of central concern. The overvalued 'official rate gave rise to large price distortions leading to inefficiencies in economic and fiscal decisions and the under- valuation of foreign exchange outlays in the budget. This understating of budget external costs constrained the supply of foreign exchange available to the nongovernment sector--adversely affecting private sector growth--and also contributed to the depreciation of the parallel rate. The customs valuation rate entailed considerable loss of budget revenue. Moreover, the official rate and the segmentation of the exchange market contributed to an undermining of the banking system's intermediation role in the exchange market and its displacement by the informal market. Correcting the official exchange rates by unifyin{, 7 them with the free parallel rate was essential in order to address these problems. It would be best to unify all rates in one step guided by a freely- determined parallel rate, and to fully pass, through the unified rate into all aspects of the budget and domestic prices apart from very limited price phasing where politically necessary. Since the segmentation of the foreign exchange market limited the relevance of the official rate to the nongovern- ment sector and for many purposes it was only an accounting rate, the consequences of one-step unification would be limited and manageable. Admittedly, the closing of the large rate g,ap would have substantial scale effects on budget and other rial accounting entries which could be disorienting and give rise to reservations. If this was considered a problem, a dual rate system for a transitional period could be warranted. However, since inefficiencies would still be in place, the transitional period should be kept short by undertaking in 1995 a major initial correction of the official and customs rates to a unified level, and then moving to full unification with the free parallel rate within 12 months. Since a stable financial environment would be essential in order to limit further depreciation of the parallel rate, both substantial fiscal measures and realistic interest rates would need to be in place. Financial policies were the appropriate instruments for promoting rate stability since a freely-determined parallel rate would be needed to provide a reasonable indicator of the appropriate level for a unified rate. There- fore, government administrative interference with the free parallel market was counterproductive and should be avoided. This would include canceling the recent regulations that established and enforce an official parallel rate, and canceling the new prohibitions on commercial bank operations in the parallel market for customers and on opening import letters of credit if foreign exchange were not obtained at the official parallel market rate. The first regulation had been ineffective, but by moving transactions underground it impaired the Central Bank's 'capacity for prudential supervision of money-changing operations, and as all these steps were disruptive to market efficiency, cancellation was warranted even apart from the unification issue. At the time of full unification, efficiency considerations mandated that the segmentation of the exchange markets be terminated in order that all entities--including commercial banks, the Government, and the Central Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - Bank--participate in a single freely-operating market. The unified rate would need to be defended by tight financial policies--including the effective use of interest rate policy--in order to promote rate stability and external competitiveness. The Central Bank moreover would then conduct its transactions at the free-market rate, or at least within a two percent band vis-a-vis that rate with the Bank's rate also responding to slippages in relative inflation performance. The Yemeni representatives responded that the reform package currently under discussion incorporated proposals to make a strong start at correcting a unified official and customs rate. A one-step unification to the parallel rate was not feasible due to the scale of the changes that would be entailed, but once the break was made away from the present official rates, it might be possible to move relatively rapidly. The details on how to apply the adjusted official rate in the economy--for example, to oil sector transactions--had not been settled, although the principle of explicit budget subsidies to contain price shocks was now considered workable. The recent regulations directed at the parallel market had been intended only to dampen ,the depreciation of the rate and were viewed as temporary--until a comprehensive reform program could be implemented. The staff proposed that early reform efforts also address import licensing and prohibitions and export controls. The budget and economic efficiency would benefit from replacing import bans with reasonable tariffs (apart from those prohibitions retained for social or security reasons) and from a full liberalization of the import and export systems. It was not possible for government offices to make efficient decisions in these areas due to the overwhelming information requirements. Steps should also be taken to prepare for tariff rationalization, following the restoration of real tariffs from their eroded position by the correction of the customs exchange rate, But rationalization should be approached knowledgeably over the medium term. On a related topic, Fund management was continuing to propose that members availing themselves of transitional arrangements under Article XIV move as rapidly as possible to attain Article VIII status, and set out a timetable for taking the necessary steps. The Yemeni representatives responded that, while the 1994 balance of payments had improved, the external position was still not sufficiently strong to commit to a timetable. It was hoped that the reform efforts of the next few years wou move the external position to the point where this would be possible. Id 5. Data issues The staff commended the authorities for the significant improvements in the quality of the external sector data since that last consultation (Appendix III), but noted that major problems continued to impair the usefulness of the current price national income estimates. As the apparent large understatement of nominal GDP gave rise to major distortions in key economic indicators which hindered economic analysis, there was an urgent need to correct these data. Fund technical assistance that was already Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - planned under the UNDP/IMF project should target a major overhaul and be drawn upon as soon as possible to initiate what would be a substantial and demanding undertaking. It was also important to implement as soon as possible the plans to use the 1993 household expenditure survey to establish an up-to-date and comprehensive CPI. Fund technical assistance was also to be provided here. The Yem,eni representatives stated that this assistance would be welcome. The authorities were also seeking help in establishing asystem to conduct regular surveys to collect information on employment and wage conditions and would appreciate any assistance that the Fund could provide. III. Appraisal Staff Yemen has recently passed through a period of political challenge which put national unity at risk. It is welcome that, with a process of recon- ciliation well underway, a more positive political environment has been established, since it offers the prospect that national attention can now be focused on the economic pr'oblems that confront the country and the policy reforms that are needed. Strong policy reform Imeasures will in fact be required given the severity of the economic difficulties now confronting Yemen and the unpromising medium-term outlook for the economy--despite substantially higher oil production--if the policies of recent years are continued. For these reasons, the staff believes that there is an urgent need for a signi- ficant start in 1995 on a comprehensive medium-term adjustment program that would need to be continued in the ensuing years. It is welcome that the authorities are giving active consideration to initiating a reform program this year and that some steps have already been taken. But this program should be broadened and deepened in order to achieve a sufficiently comprehensive and forceful package of mutually-supporting measures that could quickly reverse present macroeconomic trends. The budget is the key policy instrument to be utilized to establish the stable domestic and external financial environment that is required for strengthening economic growth and the balance of payments and for early and successful implementation of interest and exchange rate reform. These considerations call for a fiscal stance for 1995 and the medium term that would ensure a major strengthening of the budget position, including through the strongest possible front-loading of measures in 1995 in order to quickly compress inflation. To this end, the authorities should seek to enhance the fiscal effort being considered for this year. The authorities are correct in considering expenditure restraint to be essential, and while contributions should be sought from all current spending categories, the substantial effort that should be targeted will need to address particularly the governjnent wage bill and current transfers through reform of government employment policies as well as labor and other structural reforms in the public enterprises. It would be important to make a start in these areas in '1995. Early significant revenue increases are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - also essential, and these could be achieved by a major improvement in revenue administration; unifying the customs valuation rate with the parallel rate; restoring the real level of government service charges; and full price correction and liberalization except for the limited phasing intended to contain price shocks for key commodities and to address social safety net considerations. Positive real interest rates are a powerful instrument for reducing flight from the currency and therefore rial velocity, inflation, and the depreciation of the parallel rate. Positive rates are therefore critical for the success of any stabilization effort as they would provide important support to fiscal reform. Moreover, the negative real rates resulting from Yemen's present interest rate policy also have adverse consequences for real growth, fiscal discipline, the banking system, and the external deficit. To address these issues, early interest rate reform is essential and should encompass full liberalization of the nominal rate structure in order to permit positive real rates for all depositors and borrowers, including the Government and the public enterprises. Positive rates moreover would be considerably more effective in stabilizing the parallel rate than attempting to fix it administratively by regulation. Regulatory efforts would instead be better directed if they focused on the supply side of the disintermedia- tion problem. For a revival of growth, it is essential to resolve the disintermediation problem in the banking system. But this will necessitate, in addition to positive real interest rates, the implementation of effective new legal arrangements that would allow banks to permanently address nonperforming assets problems. Priority also attaches to addressing the foreign currency exposure of the banking system. Evaluation of individual bank positions and decisions on how to proceed in each case should be undertaken in conjunction with exchange rate unification since banks with a large exposure will experience substantial domestic currency losses which could impair solvency. Moreover, prudential oversight should also pay close attention to asset quality in the new environment where successful reforms bring about re-intermediation and there is rapid growth of deposits and lending to the nongovernment sector. In the external sector, present prospects are that, even with increased oil exports and the economic benefits from comprehensive adjustment, the medium-term position will not be viable unless Yemen's large debt servicing obligations are directly addressed. Therefore, an active program should be pursued to reach settlements with creditors in a comprehensive manner and on terms that are compatible with balance of payments prospects. This under- taking would be assisted by a prior and convincing implementation of a strong and comprehensive adjustment program. To limit future debt servicing problems, the Government's cautious external debt management policies should be maintained. The immediate benefits to the balance of payments from exchange rate unification are likely to be limited as the private sector already operates at the free parallel rate. Thus, the task of achieving a steady improvement in non-oil export performance would largely fall to stabilization and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - structural reform measures directed at promoting growth by increasing confidence and i.nvestment in the econom'y, by removing inefficiencies and distortions through a broad liberalization, and by bringing about re- intermediation. These measures would also contribute to constraining imports although correcting the customs valuation rate will help the demand balance between imports and domestic production even with tariff rationaliza- tion. Thus stabilization and structura'l reform measures should be viewed as policy tools to promote external viability through economic growth. A correction of the official exchange rates to market levels is essential for eliminating inefficiencies in economic and fiscal decision making. Given the feasibility of phasing price corrections for key commodities and the large accounting ro:Le of the official rate, the staff considers a one-step unification of all official rates with a freely determined parallel rate to be a viable option. But given the considerable gap between the official and parallel market rates, official reservations regarding the size of the changes in budget and other rial accounting entries are understandable, and a dual rate system for a short transitional period could be warranted provided a strong start is initially made. For unification to be economically meaningful, the corrected rate would need to be fully passed through to all aspects of the budget and domestic prices apart from a few exceptional cases of price phasing to avoid large price shocks or assist vulnerable groups. Since a freely-determined parallel exchange rate provides a reasonable indicator of an appropriate level for a unified rate, government interfer- ence with the free market should be avoj.ded. Financial policies are instead the correct instrument for promoting rate stability, and in this regard for the success of unification, both substantial fiscal measures and a realistic interest rate policy would need to be in effect to limit inflation and further depreciation of the parallel rate. 'The staff recommends that at the time of unification the segmentation of the exchange market be terminated so that there would be only a single freeljr-operating exchange market for all private and government entities. Thereafter, tight financial policies would need to be continued in order to promote rate stability and external competitiveness. A substantial improvement in the growth performance of the non-oil sector is needed to lift real per capita income and alleviate unemployment. Stabilization will provide a conducive environment for growth, but structural reforms--particularly an early and broad liberalization of the economy--are also needed. Full price liberalization should be adopted as a central goal except where social safety net considerations prevail, and liberalization efforts should also incorpora.te the removral of nonprice regulatory impediments to an improved economic performance. Here, early trade system reform should be a major focus as well as the lifting of nonessential licensing requirements and controls affecting domestic economic activities. For the public enterprises, ful:L freedom from pricing, employ- ment, and managerial oversight by the Government will be essential for rationalizing their operations and subjecting these companies to market forces. The authorities' intention to move quickly with a broad Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - privatization program is welcome. This full reliance on the market could significantly benefit the economic efficiency of the concerned operations as well as the budget. Yemen's several exchange rates in the official and parallel markets constitute multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. Also the recent prohibition on the issuing of import letters of credit by banks unless the foreign exchange is obtained in the parallel market at a specified exchange rate constitutes an exchange restriction. During the consultation discussions, the authorities did not indicate that steps would be taken to eliminate these practices in the near future, and the staff does not recommend Board approval at this time. The staff urges the authorities to implement policies which would correct these practices and strengthen the balance of payments in order to allow a timetable to be set which would put Yemen in the position to attain Article VIII status by an early date. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Crude oil exports: Volume is projected on the basis of output forecasts by field, foreign company contract terms, and domestic refinery input as provided by the Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources (MOMR). Price forecasts for 1995 are based on MOMR information and for 1996-99 utilize the January 1995 World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections, adjusted for quality differentials. The official 1995 price projection is more conservative than the WE0 forecast. Oil output is expected to average 330 thousand barrels a day (tbd) in 1995, 355 tbd in 1996, 350 tbd in 1997, 340 tbd in 1998, and 330 tbd in 1997. Prices are projected to rise gradually, e.g., the Marib oil price (f.o.b.) is forecast to increase from an average of LJSs16.50 per barrel in 1995 to USS17.40 per barrel in 1999. In line with the MOMR output forecast, no new discoveries are projected. 2. Petroleum product exports and imports: Yemen exports high quality residual fuel oil and imports lower quality fuel oil for electricity generation. Export receipts are assumed to be determined by fixed domestic refinery capacity and world oil price movements as projected in the WEO. Import payments are assumed to rise in line with world prices. 3. Non-oil exports: Projections take into account the GDP growth of trading partners (by 4 percent a year), discounted to reflect only a partial opening of markets in neighboring countries. 4. Oil and gas sector imports: On the basis of historical data provided by MOMR, oil companies' capital goods imports are assumed to be 35 percent of their total gross expenditure in Yemen. The latter is projected taking into account past investments and prospective oil and gas field and infrastructure development. 5. Food imports: Projections are based on the population growth rate (3 percent a year) and elasticity with respect to the movement of international food prices as forecast in the WEO. 6. Other non-oil imports: Import prices are forecast in line with the WE0 projection of the export unit value of manufactures from industrial countries (1.5-2.0 percent a year). The volume of imports is forecast in relation to non-oil GDP growth and elasticity with respect to world manufactures prices. 7. Service receipts: Projections of oil processing fees and signature bonuses are made on the basis of information provided by the MOMR. Interest earnings on the banking system's foreign assets assume interest rate movements as forecast in the WEO. Tourism receipts are assumed to increase somewhat slower than nominal growth in major industrial countries. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - APPENDIX II 8. Service payments: Freight and insurance payments are taken as a constant proportion of non-oil imports, c.i.f. (12 percent). Interest payments on the banking system's foreign liabilities are estimated on the basis of interest rate movements as forecast in the WEO. Projected interest obligations on loans already disbursed from the pipeline are from official data. Projected interest obligations on new loans are based on assumed disbursements and WE0 interest rate movements, The latter are also applied to arrears outstanding. Oil company profits remitted abroad are projected on the basis of oil output and the production-sharing agreements with various oil companies. Oil company foreign expenditure is estimated on the basis of information supplied by MOMR as the share of total oil company current outlays not spent in Yemen on exploration, development and operations; it includes costs paid abroad for items such as overhead and salaries, etc. Other service payments are forecast to decline sharply in real terms because of lower foreign exchang;e availability, which is assumed to compress official travel and force .an accelerated replacement of foreign teachers by Yemenis. Government service imports related to loan disbursements are assumed to decline in line with lower disbursements. 9. Private transfers: Receipts are -projected on the basis of official estimates of the number of Yemeni work'ers abroad at end-1994 and assumptions of: (i) unchanged work opportunities for Yemenis abroad or at home and therefore an unchanged expatriate labor force over the projection period, and (ii) an increase of wage rates in neighboring countries by one percent a year. 10. Official transfers: Under unchanged policies, the authorities do not expect cash grants or grants-in-kind to be of significance. Projected official outward transfers are payments to international organizations. 11. Capital account: (i> Long-term loan and suppliers' credits disbursements: Forecasts for both pipeline and new loan disbursements assume an increased reluctance of creditors to make further disbursements, Under unchanged policies, it is assumed that the inability to attract suppliers' credits in 1994 will continue through the medium term. (ii) Amortization oblipations: Projected pipeline obligations for medium- and long-term loans are official data. The minimal new bilateral and multilateral loans arle assumed to be on very concessional terms, and therefore to have long grace periods. (iii) Oil sector dir'ect investment: Inflows are projected as indicated in item 4 above. 0utflow.s represent oil companies' cost recovery calculated according to provisions of the various production-sharing agreements. 12. Monetary movements: Central Bank foreign assets are assumed to be held equivalent to two months' imports. Given the sizable commercial bank foreign currency exposure at end-1994, the banks' net foreign asset position is assumed to be unchanged.

Government finance The coverage and quality of fiscal data have shown considerable improvement in many areas. More extensive breakdowns of revenues and expenditures into meaningful economic categories have become available, but further progress in making breakdowns for major categories deeper and more readily available would assist fiscal analysis and understanding the links between the budget and developments elsewhere in the economy. The accuracy of oil sector data has in particular been enhanced by the improved communication between the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources (MOMR), the Aden Refinery, and the Central Bank. The MOF is now able to closely monitor oil revenue developments through a separate administrative unit which received technical assistance from the Fund in 1993. Most revenue and expenditure data are available under the authorities' classification on a monthly basis. However, considerable hand compilation is required to convert these data to the Fund's classification. Therefore, at present, fiscal data are provided to the Fund only on an annual basis during consultation discussions. A computerized mapping between the two classifications would permit more frequent reporting. Fund technical assistance to computerize the MOF will take place over 1995-96. 2. Monetary statistics The quality of the monetary data is good and continues to improve. A number of classification changes were recently adopted to enhance accuracy. For example, data on government deposits were revised to separately identify deposits of the social security institutions. Reporting remains timely with both central bank and commercial bank balance sheets generally available with a two-month lag. The foreign assets and liabilities of the banking system and residents' foreign exchange deposits continue to be valued at the official exchange rate; however, the private sector transactions underlying the commercial banks' balance sheet and foreign currency deposits occur at the free parallel market rate. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - APPENDIX III 3. Balance of payments The balance of payments data have improved substantially in a number of areas. First, the MOME now provides the Central Bank with accurate data on foreign oil companies' exports, cost recovery, and profit remittances; accurate data on the sector's total exploration, development, and operating expenditure (from information obtained from each oil company); and its estimates of the proportions allocated to imports of capital goods and supplies, foreign overhead costs, and local expenses. Second, estimates of workers' remittances are now directly derived from estimates of the number of Yemeni nationals abroad, and information on wage rates in neighboring countries for workers of various skill categories. Third, customs data are used to report trade transactions. Fourth, the data on external financing and external debt service obligations have been fully re-evaluated in substantial detail and are accurate. There is room for improvement in the compilation methods for some services entries. Also, the official balance of payments does not presently include,interest on debt service arrears. 4. External debt The external debt data are now of good quality. The Central Bank, using all available loan contract information, has undertaken a thorough compilation of outstandin! 5 external interest and amortization obligations, payments, and arrears by creditor for public medium- and long-term debt and for public and private suppliers' credits for the period 1980-2000. This compilation has not yet been reconciled with those of Yemen's creditors. 5. Exchanve rate The Central Bank has regularly collected information on the daily free parallel market exchange rate; the data are considered accurate. 6. Prices, wages. and emplovment Consumer price indicles at present are calculated only for six major cities using baskets and weights that are very outdated--l969 for Aden and 1977/78 for five northern cities. A household expenditure survey was conducted in 1993 in order to provide the basis for an up-to-date nationwide consumer price index, but the results are still being processed. Data on wages and employment in the private or public sectors are not readily available. While public sector data are collected, they are fragmented among the Civil Service Commission and the various ministries responsible for overseeing the public enterprises and public authorities, and have not been aggregated. No employment or wage data are collected or surveys undertaken for the private sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public33 - APPENDIX III 7. National accounts There has been some expansion in the quantity of national accounts data; a constant price GDP series is now published (but not constant price GDE). Official estimates of the contribution of resident oil companies to oil sector GDP are now included in both the official constant and current price GDP. The quality of the constant price national account data suffer from inadequate compilation methodologies. The agricultural and manufacturing output surveys are not based on randomly selected sampling frames, and there are no surveys of activity in the services sectors. Estimates of profit margins in wholesale and retail trade and in transportation are made by applying the margins of other countries in the region to estimates of output and imports. Notional estimates of real value added are made for business and personal services. GDP is also understated because of the exclusion of qat production--the largest agricultural crop and reportedly one of the largest items in household expenditure. In addition to these problems, the quality of the current price national accounts is also burdened by use of inadequate nominal price and cost data. A comparison of the movements in the consumer price index, the free parallel market exchange rate, and the implicit non-oil GDP deflator suggests that the latter may as a result be seriously underestimated. The non-oil GDP deflator was some 20-40 percentage points below the CPI each year over 1991-94, resulting in a cumulative understatement over time. A second major problem stems from the use of the official exchange rate to value official external transactions--in particular the government share of oil output--and the incentive rate to value the foreign transactions of public enterprises. Fund technical assistance in the compilation of the national accounts and price indices is planned for 1995. 8. Militarv transactions All macroeconomic data are inclusive of military transactions. 9. Reporting of data in IFS The interruption to internal data collection caused by political developments in 1993-94 has prevented reporting to the Fund for publication of a country page in IFS. In January 1995 the authorities resumed reporting. The staff intends to publish an IFS page covering exchange rate, monetary, fiscal, and balance of payments data as soon as possible. A country page for Yemen was published in the 1994 GFS Yearbook.

Of the 101 projects, 79 have been completed, and 22 are still under implementation. Cumulative IDA commitments for ongoing projects stand at about USS421.5 million (net of cancellations). Of this amount, USS306.6 million remain undisbursed. The major part of project credits have been directed to the agriculture sector (32 percent of all lending) and human resources (about 25 percent). In fiscal year 1994, lending t'o Yemen included an Education Sector Investment Credit for US$33 million. A vocational training project is tentatively planned for presentation to IDA's Board in fiscal year 1995 but is now most likely to slip to early fiscal year 1996. The International Finance Corporation has made investments in agriculture, food processing, light manufacturing, and oil refining. Its total gross commitments remain at USS23.7 million. The Government's ability to implement development projects has been hampered by the impact of the national unification ,in 1990-91 and local political developments related to the administrative and institutional implementation of unification. IDA undertook a portfolio review in April 1994, and solutions to implementation constraints were agreed with the Government. However, littlle progress was achieved due to the subsequent civil war. Project implementation continues to deteriorate mainly due to constraints that cut across sectors and operations (such as, the long timespan required for credit effectiveness, lack of counterpart funding, effects of inflation and exchange rate distortions on civil works contracts, complex procurement po1icie.s and processes, opaque customs clearance, uneven quality of local project management, poor compliance with audit covenants, and mishandling of special accounts). To improve project implementation and to reduce the backlog of undisbursed balances, IDA is adopting a portfolio management strategy that focuses on the restructurin,g of ongoing operations, clearing of generic implementation constraints from the project implementation environment, and enhancing project design and quality at entry based on lessons learned. The recent establishment of an IDA Resident Mission is also expected to assist in the resolution of implem~entation issues and the monitoring of future project implementation progress. 1/ Prepared by World Band staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
