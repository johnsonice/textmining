GDP growth is projected to be around 7% percent in 2003 and 2004. Inflation is likely to remain low, but positive, as deflationary pressures have dissipated. The external current account surplus is expected to decline in 2003 to about 1% percent of GDP, but the external position will remain strong as sizable inflows of FDI and other capital are expected to continue. The main downside risks to the outlook stem from the weak global environment and a possible delayed impact of the SARS epidemic on exports. On the upside, rapid increases in monetary and credit aggregates could push growth higher, and pose a risk of increasing inflationary pressures. Policy Discussions: The staff supports the authorities’ efforts to rein in money and credit growth and tighten lending standards. The People’s Bank of China will likely have to continue to drain liquidity from the banking system in the period ahead. The staff continued to stress that exchange rate flexibility would enhance China’s ability to adjust to economic shocks and major structural changes. The authorities agreed with the benefits of more flexibility over the medium term, but expressed concern about the potential adverse impacts of an appreciation of the renminbi on the domestic economy at present. The longer-term fiscal position is a potential source of macroeconomic vulnerability due to quasi-fiscal liabilities in the financial sector and pension system and rising spending pressures. The authorities recognize the need for fiscal adjustment over the medium term, and they plan to keep the nominal deficit constant at the 2003 level, implying a reduction in the deficit of about % percent of GDP per year, roughly in line with previous staff recommendations. Reforms to the financial and state-owned enterprise sectors lead the structural reform agenda. Some progress has been made in reducing the stock and flow of nonperforming loans in the financial sector and in improving the commercial orientation of state-owned enterprises, but much remains to be done. Rising unemployment, poverty and widening rural- urban income disparities will also need to be tackled. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- 1. ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDOUTLOOK A. Introduction 1. China has managed to maintain a rapid rate of growth, despite the economic shocks that the country has faced and its increasing integration into the global economy. In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors considered that the key challenges going forward were sustaining rapid output and income growth and maintaining financial stability, while successfully managing the social costs of the transition. They reiterated their past policy advice that this would require continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and further progress on structural reforms, including addressing the intertwined problems of the banking system, state-owned enterprises, and fiscal sector. Directors urged the authorities to maintain the steady path of fiscal consolidation realized in recent years. The authorities were also encouraged to move toward more exchange rate flexibility. During the past year, China’s macroeconomic policies have contributed to achieving strong growth and lowering deflationary pressures, and fiscal consolidation resumed in 2003, albeit at a slower pace. Some progress has also been made on structural reforms, but the pace of reform will need to be stepped up, particularly in the financial sector and the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The authorities are well aware of the challenges they face in all of these areas. They continue to move ahead with reforms and changes in the structure of the government have been introduced to facilitate the process. B. Recent Developments 2. Economic activity in China was stronger than expected in 2002 and in the first quarter of 2003 (Figure 1, Table 1). After a significant slowdown in 2001 in both external and domestic demand, there was a rebound in 2002, pushing growth for the year to 8 percent. Exports grew strongly, rising by 22 percent, as China gained market share in major industrialized countries. Fixed investment registered 17 percent growth, underpinned by strong public sector and foreign direct investment. Domestic consumption also had considerable momentum throughout the year, with annual retail sales of consumer goods growing by 8% percent. In the first quarter of 2003, GDP grew by 10 percent (year-on-year), reflecting a 34 percent increase in exports and fixed investment growth of 28 percent. Despite the strong GDP growth, registered unemployment in the urban areas increased by 0.4 percentage point to 4 percent in 2002, reflecting the impact of the economic restructuring program and increasing urbanization of the population. The level of surplus labor still remaining in the agriculture sector is estimated at 150 million. 3. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the second quarter temporarily dampened GDP growth. However, the economic impact of the SARS outbreak appears to have been less than originally expected. Compared to the first quarter, the growth of retail sales in April-May declined by 3 percentage points to 6 percent (year-on- year), and growth of industrial production fell by 3 percentage points to 14 percent. The impact of SARS was most evident in the transportation sector, which posted a 53 percent decline in passenger traffic in May, compared with a 10 percent increase in the first quarter (all year-on-year). External trade continued to expand rapidly, however, and the services sector appears to have made a quick rebound from the epidemic.

Deflationary pressures have been easing.’ After registering a decline of 0.8 percent in 2002, consumer prices increased by ‘/z percent in the first six months of 2003 (year-on-year), as food and energy prices surged. Prices excluding these two components continued to decline, but at a slower rate than in 2002; they fell by about % percent in April- June 2003 (year-on-year) compared with about 1 percent in 2002. Deflationary pressures, which have been concentrated in goods prices (primarily tradables), appear to be mainly attributable to supply-side factors, including WTO-related tariff cuts, and increases in production capacity and productivity gains from strong investment growth. Prices of nontradables (mostly services), on the other hand, were stable throughout 2002; in the first six months of 2003, these prices increased on average by 1 percent (year-on-year). 5. Foreign trade grew rapidly in 2002 and so far in 2003. In 2002, the trade surplus reached $44 billion (3l% percent of GDP, $10 billion higher than in 2001), helped by strong export growth and gains in market shares in both traditional labor-intensive goods and electronics.’ Imports grew by 21 percent, reflecting China’s growing importance as a link in the region’s production chain, with more final assembly and processing work taking place in the country. Imports for domestic use also appear to have increased sharply with robust domestic demand conditions and further market opening under China’s WTO commitments. In the first six months of 2003, export growth remained robust at 34 percent and import growth surged to 44 percent. The trade surplus declined to $4 billion in the first six months of 2003 (customs basis), compared with $13 billion during the same period last year. 6. China’s overall external position has strengthened further (Tables 24, and Figure 2). The current account surplus rose from 1% percent of GDP in 200 1 to 2% percent in 2002. The financial account posted another large surplus in 2002, as FDI inflows amounted to $53 billion, and there was a continuing repatriation of portfolio investment from abroad. Official reserves increased by $76 billion (6 percent of GDP) in 2002, and by another $60 billion in the first six months of 2003, reaching $355 billion (equivalent to around 10% months of imports). While FDI inflows have remained consistently strong, the pickup in the pace of reserve accumulation during 2001-03 mostly reflects an improvement in non-FDI related capital account flows (Box 1). The sharp decline in the trade surplus in the first half of 2003 suggests that the current account was likely to have recorded at most a small surplus during this period. External debt remains low at 13 percent of GDP (at end-2002), and the net foreign asset position of the banking system is comfortably positive. i For a more in-depth discussion of recent price developments and an assessment of the factors contributing to deflation, see the Selected Issues paper. 2 An analysis of recent trends in China’s exports and their significance in the Asian region and the world is provided in the Selected Issues paper.

China: The Buildup of Foreign Reserves Between January 2001 and June 2003, China’s foreign reserves grew by China: Contributions to Reserves Buildup, 1998-2002 (billions of U.S dollars) $183 billion to about $355 billion. The pickup in the pace of reserve accumulation mostly reflects an improvement in the capital account balance, especially non-FDI related capital account flows. During 200 l-02, China recorded an average current account surplus of $26 billion a year, an improvement of almost $4 billion a year over the average surplus in the preceding three years (tabulation below). Meanwhile, the capital account recorded an average surplus of $34 billion a year during 2001-02, compared to the $1 billion a year average in the previous three years. While FDI inflows have remained consistently strong, such inflows rose by only $3% billion a year between 2001-02, compared with the previous three years. Excluding FDI and including the errors and omissions (which is believed to largely reflect unrecorded capital flows), the capital account improved by $45X billion a year during 2001-02 relative to the previous three years (last row of the tabulation). The increase in net foreign inflows is driven by a number of factors: Interest rate differential: The spread between global interest rates and the renminbi deposit rate narrowed markedly in 2001 and has turned negative since then, which has reportedly triggered a repatriation of a large amount of deposit/loan assets held abroad by domestic financial institutions. Changes in foreign exchange regulations: The combination of the relaxation of some exchange controls and tighter enforcement of remaining controls could have contributed to increased foreign exchange inflows. Expectation of renminbi appreciation: An anticipated appreciation of the renminbi, as reflected in the appreciation of the 12-month nondeliverable forward rate, might have fueled the rise in capital inflows in recent months.

China’s real and nominal effective exchange rates are estimated to have depreciated by about 12 percent from February 2002 (their most recent peak) to May 2003. About 4 percentage points of this depreciation have occurred since the beginning of this year. The effective exchange rates had appreciated significantly along with the U.S. dollar, from mid-1997 through early 2002. The current levels are close to those that prevailed in mid- 1997. 8. In 2002, the overall fiscal deficit reached 3.3 percent of GDP, a slight increase from 2001 (Figure 3). 3 Revenue increased by 15% percent, as reductions in some taxes (such as tariff cuts in line with the WTO commitments and lower business taxes on banks) were more than offset by higher collections owing to the strength of economic activity and improvements in collection efforts. Spending rose by 16% percent, reflecting higher capital expenditure and a significant increase in social expenditure (about 20 percent), including basic pensions and funds to support the closure of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and to reduce poverty in urban areas. 9. The budget for 2003 targets a broadly unchanged deficit (3.2 percent of GDP). Revenue is projected to increase by 8 percent, reflecting a continuation of tax reductions (further tariff cuts and a further one percentage point reduction in the business tax rate for banks and insurance companies), tax incentives for developing the country’s western regions and reemployment programs, and conservative assumptions about the underlying buoyancy of revenue. Budgeted expenditure growth at 7% percent is substantially below the double digit rates recorded over the previous three years. Spending increases are focused on development of the western regions, social outlays, and military spending. All other spending is to be limited to 2002 levels in nominal terms. The fiscal outcome in the first six months of 2003 was significantly better than projected-revenue increased by 27 percent (year-on-year) and spending growth was kept at 16l% percent. 10. Monetary conditions eased during 2002 and in early 2003 (Table 7). Deposit and lending rates were reduced by %--% percentage point in early 2002 and have since remained at that level. The 2002 growth target for M2 was revised upward in several steps, in response to higher M2 growth which reached 17 percent for the year. Growth of broad money and credit increased further in the first half of 2003, primarily reflecting the sharp rise in foreign exchange reserves and more aggressive lending by banks. For 2003, the authorities’ M2 growth target was initially set at 14 percent and was subsequently raised to 18 percent, but by June 2003, M2 growth was 21 percent, while loans to enterprises increased by 23 percent. The authorities began to sterilize part of the foreign exchange inflows in early 2003 and these efforts to rein in money and credit growth were stepped up in June. Concerns about the rapid pace of credit growth, especially lending to the real estate sector, has prompted a tightening of prudential oversight. 3 For 2002, the overall deficit according to the official budget classification was 3.0 percent of GDP. As Tables 5 and 6 indicate, the differences between the official and IMF definitions of the fiscal balance primarily reflect the treatment of privatization receipts and on-lending to local governments of funds borrowed by the central government.

Outlook 11. The staff expects the growth momentum to continue over the near term, and projects real GDP growth to be about 7% percent in 2003 and 2004 (Table 8). As the economy rebounds from the SARS epidemic, growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year. Economic activity would strengthen further in 2004, and it is expected to be growing at an 8 percent annual rate by the fourth quarter. Prices are expected to post small increases over the next year, as the effects of some increases in commodity and food prices would more than offset downward pressures from supply-side factors, including lower tariffs and ongoing productivity gains. The external current account surplus would decline somewhat, as further WTO-related trade liberalization boosts imports, while export growth would slow down from the very high rates recorded over the last year. Sizable net capital inflows, including FDI, are likely to continue and the external position is expected to remain strong. 12. The short-term outlook is subject to significant uncertainties. The main downside risk stems from a relatively weak global environment. In China, there could still be some downside risks associated with the SARS epidemic, including a possible delayed impact on exports. On the upside, investment activity continues to be very strong. There is, therefore, a distinct possibility that GDP growth could be considerably faster than projected, especially if the recent rapid rate of monetary expansion continues. More rapid growth could put significant pressures on resources and pose a risk that inflation could increase. 13. Medium-term prospects depend critically on the pace of structural reforms. If reforms are implemented in an expeditious manner, China should be able to maintain average annual GDP growth of 7-8 percent, lower the nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the financial system, and provide employment opportunities for the large labor surplus in the agriculture sector. Structural reforms, particularly in the enterprise and financial sectors and labor markets, are needed to sustain development and strong productivity growth, as well as to help China cope with increased competition arising from its WTO commitments and reap the benefits of better access to foreign markets. The external position should remain relatively strong over the medium term, with continued sizable FDI inflows moderating the impact of an anticipated decline in the current account surplus, as strong domestic demand and lower trade barriers stimulate imports of goods and services. II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 14. The authorities and the Fund staff broadly agreed on the factors underlying recent macroeconomic developments, prospects for the period ahead, and priorities over the medium term. The staff commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability and underlying growth momentum during a period of slow growth in the global economy, and despite the adverse impact of the SARS epidemic. The discussions focused on the management of monetary and exchange rate policies, medium- term fiscal sustainability, and the structural challenges facing the economy.

Over the last few months, the authorities have moved to reduce the pace of money and credit growth. Sterilization efforts, including through the sale of central bank securities, intensified in April, and the growth in reserve money declined to 6’% percent (year-on-year) as of end-June 2003. However, the slowdown in reserve money growth was achieved primarily through a decline in excess reserves held by commercial banks and had little impact on the growth in broad money or credit, which remained above PBC target ranges. 16. The authorities indicated that they would continue sterilization efforts, if necessary, but they saw little risk of incipient inflationary pressures. They noted that, while deflation had largely disappeared by end-2002, consumer prices had increased only moderately in the first half of 2003. With continued reductions in tariffs and strong productivity gains, they expected consumer price increases to remain low in the short term, and saw little justification for a significant monetary tightening. The staff argued that the PBC would likely have to continue to drain liquidity from the banking system in the period ahead to avoid a loosening of monetary conditions that could contribute to a substantial increase in inflationary pressures. The staff also expressed concerns about the impact of more aggressive lending by banks on overall loan quality and the risk that it could lead to new NPLs in the future. One area of particular concern was the rapid rate of growth in lending to finance construction. The authorities responded that they, too, were concerned about the rapid pace of credit growth. As a result, in addition to attempts to sterilize international reserve increases and keep commercial bank excess reserves at a relatively low level, the PBC has strongly cautioned the banks about their lending to the real estate sector. The staff supported the authorities’ efforts to rein in money and credit growth and the tightening of prudential oversight. Subsequent to the mission, the authorities announced a 1 percentage point increase in required reserves to 7 percent effective September 21 .4 17. Interest rates will continue to be gradually liberalized. In the second half of 2003, the authorities plan a modest increase in the flexibility that banks have in setting interest rates by widening the band around the central rates. They will continue to study the timing for deposit rate liberalization. The staff endorsed the plan to liberalize lending rates first, but encouraged the authorities to move more quickly to eliminate controls on lending rates, as this would improve the profitability of banks and allow them to price risk appropriately. 18. As China becomes more integrated into the global economy, shielding the money supply from international influences will increasingly require more flexibility in the exchange rate. The staff has over the past few years argued for a move toward greater 4 As of June 2003, banks held excess reserves (beyond required reserves) equivalent to 3 percent of deposits. The increase in the reserve requirement will absorb an estimated RMB 150 billion of excess reserves.

Greater flexibility would serve to moderate the impact on China of external economic shocks and facilitate adjustment to the major structural changes that are underway, with the beneficial effect of reducing volatility in output and employment. Greater flexibility would also reduce the risk of the economy becoming more vulnerable to financial shocks, as the prolonged maintenance of a de facto fixed exchange rate tends to promote sharp swings in capital flows. 19. Present circumstances, therefore, suggest that a reasonably quick move to greater flexibility would be advantageous. China is currently in a position of relative economic strength and could make its exchange rate more flexible without causing major disruptions to the domestic economy. It is difficult to make a definitive judgment about the underlying value of China’s currency. Nevertheless, the rapid reserve accumulation suggests that, if the exchange rate were more flexible, the currency would rise in value in the short term. Such a rise in the currency’s value would not be expected to be out of line with the kind of increase in the currency’s nominal effective exchange rate experienced during the period from 1999 through early 2002, which did not disrupt output and employment growth. Increased exchange rate flexibility, by itself, is also unlikely to have negative repercussions on the financial sector. Domestic commercial banks do not have a large net exposure to currency risk and have a net foreign asset position amounting to only about 5 percent of broad money. In addition, foreign currency-denominated loans to residents constitute only about 5 percent of domestic credit. 20. The authorities agreed with the staff on the desirability of moving toward greater exchange rate flexibility, but they expressed reservations about making such a move in the near term. They were particularly concerned about possible adverse impacts on the domestic economy. In view of recent increases in unemployment, growing gaps between rural and urban incomes, and overall considerations regarding social stability, the biggest concerns were with respect to implications of an exchange rate appreciation on growth and employment, and the impact of cheaper agricultural imports on rural incomes. The authorities emphasized the important role that stability of the renminbi had played during the Asian crisis, and argued that a stable currency would continue to be beneficial for the regional and global economies. They also noted that China’s external current account surplus was relatively small and declining, and that China still only accounted for about 5% percent of world trade and, therefore, could play only a very limited role in resolving global imbalances. Staff noted that a move to greater exchange rate flexibility now might also encourage more flexibility by other countries in the region concerned about competitiveness, thereby helping to facilitate the adjustment of external imbalances. This would enhance China’s standing internationally and strengthen its leadership role in Asia. 5 Currently, China’s exchange is set in relation to the U.S. dollar and is allowed to fluctuate +/- 0.3 percent around a reference rate. The reference rate has been set at about 8.28 yuan per U.S. dollar since the Asian crisis. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14- 21. The functioning of the foreign exchange market needs to be substantially improved. The supply and demand for foreign exchange is skewed by significant restrictions. Steps that need to be taken include allowing enterprises to choose freely the dealers with whom they conduct their foreign exchange business, further reducing foreign exchange surrender requirements, easing restrictions on the number of participants in the interbank market, and further developing instruments for foreign exchange risk management. The authorities noted that they have taken some initial steps to develop the foreign exchange market (Annex I). B. Fiscal Policy 22. Despite the SARS epidemic, the authorities were confident that the 2003 fiscal target for the budget deficit would be met. The staff agreed that this was a likely outcome. Strong revenue growth in the first half of the year, reflecting the underlying strength of the economy, higher import levels, and the improvements made in tax administration in recent years, suggest that revenue is likely to exceed the original budget projection for the year. The authorities estimated that U&S-related revenue and expenditure measures would each be limited to about 0.1 percent of GDP; expenditures would be financed within existing budget spending allocations. The staff welcomed the intention to keep overall spending within the budgeted total and emphasized that, if there were additional health-related spending needs or measures to help sectors heavily impacted by the SARS outbreak, they should be well targeted and fully reflected in the budget.” The staff also recommended that overperformance on revenue be used to further consolidate the fiscal position. The authorities were cautious about the extent of over-performance on revenue and expected that any additional revenue would be used primarily to reduce outstanding tax refunds owed to exporters.7 23. The authorities recognize the potential vulnerabilities in the fiscal position in the longer run, and have initiated a 3-year rolling fiscal framework to help formulate policies in more of a medium-term context. Substantial future demands will be placed on the budget by existing quasi-fiscal liabilities in the financial sector and the pension system, increased responsibilities for social services currently provided by SOEs, improvements required in the public health system, and other expenditures that will grow with an aging population. The authorities agreed that successfully managing these demands on the public finances will depend on further, far-reaching structural reforms. The staff emphasized that, even with quick and effective structural reforms to limit the size of contingent liabilities, pressures on fiscal resources will be such that both revenue and expenditure measures will be 6 Spending in the first half of 2003 was 40 percent of the budgeted level for the year. There is scope for contingency items to be cut, if necessary, to meet the budget target. 7The payments to exporters represent refunds for VAT and business taxes already paid on inputs. In 2003, the authorities budgeted RMB 120 billion (about 1 percent of GDP) for refunds. Refunds above this level, as in past years, will be paid depending on the availability of fiscal resources. As of end-2002, refunds amounting to roughly 2 percent of GDP had been claimed but not paid. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- needed to avoid putting public debt on an unsustainable path.8 In this regard, the staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to stabilize the nominal deficit at its 2003 level for the coming years, as this would reduce the overall fiscal deficit by about ‘% percent of GDP per year. 24. The authorities are making continued progress in strengthening tax revenue and improving public expenditure management (areas where the Fund is providing significant technical assistance). In particular, the computerization of tax administration is proceeding and increased collaboration between the different agencies involved has reduced tax evasion and fraud. The tax-for-fee reform, aimed at simplifying the rural tax system and reducing the tax burden on farmers, has been extended nationwide. The authorities are considering shifting VAT from a production to a consumption basis and extending it to services. They are also reviewing the possibility of unifying the corporate income tax system for foreign- and domestically-funded enterprises, but have not yet set any timetable for implementation. In addition, they are studying options to reduce the tax burden on the financial sector and move toward taxing personal income on a consolidated basis. 25. In the area of expenditure management, a new budget classification system is expected to be approved in the coming months and treasury reforms are proceeding. The new classification system will be implemented on a pilot basis in 2004 and used for the preparation of the 2005 budget.’ The accounts of eighty government departments and agencies, as well as those of ten provincial governments have been linked to the treasury single account system, and the process is expected to be completed for the entire government by 2005. The staff emphasized the importance of completing the new budget classification system in time for the 2005 budget and urged the authorities to coordinate the treasury reforms and changes to the chart of accounts with the introduction of the new classification system, and to continue to bring extra-budgetary funds onto the budget. 26. The system of center-provincial fiscal relations needs to be strengthened. Most of the envisaged tax and expenditure reforms will have implications for lower levels of government. Hence, it becomes even more important to reform center-province fiscal relations, including improving fiscal reporting of lower levels of government to reduce the risks of additional contingent liabilities being accumulated. Changes in the sharing formula for income taxes introduced in 2002 have brought additional resources to the center, which have been used in part to finance increased transfers to western provinces. The staff emphasized the need for more comprehensive reforms in line with previous technical assistance by the Fund (Annex III). While the authorities did not envisage further changes at this time, they recognized the fiscal problems faced by some lower levels of government and welcomed planned IMF technical assistance on this issue later in 2003. * Annex II provides a medium-term assessment of the fiscal position. A longer-term perspective is provided in the Selected Issues paper. 9 The budgets of two central government agencies and two provinces will be drafted in 2004 using the new budget classification.

The authorities have taken a number of steps to improve banking supervision. The newly formed China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) has set a comprehensive and ambitious agenda for itself. On-site examinations of all banks, including analysis of their off-balance sheet activities, will be initiated in the second half of this year. Increased training for bank examiners is underway, and the authorities are in the process of implementing many of the recommendations made by Fund staff.” The authorities fully recognized the challenges they face in resolving the NPL problem, but they thought the risks were controllable if they moved quickly. They noted that the macroeconomic environment was favorable to resolving this problem, and that increased attention to bank supervision would serve to lower the risk of new NPLs developing. The authorities acknowledged that, although some progress has been made (Box 2), further efforts will be needed to reduce the large stock of NPLs, which has been primarily inherited from the past. They added that the four state commercial banks have now been given a dual target-reducing the NPL to loans ratio by 3 percentage points and reducing the stock of NPLs by 3 percent each year. Staff continued to emphasize that, while some improvements are being made, data weaknesses and classification problems in many of the banks could mean that the magnitude of the problem is larger than the official numbers suggest. 28. While some progress has been made in disposing of distressed assets, strong efforts need to continue to dispose of the large stock of remaining assets. The staff recommended improvements in creditor rights, foreclosure, and bankruptcy procedures to aid in the disposal of NPLs. The staff also continued to encourage the authorities to improve the ability to write-off NPLs by lowering the tax burden on the banks by allowing for the full deductibility for loan-loss provisions and shifting the base for the business tax from a gross interest to a net interest basis. Expediting the liberalization of lending rates would also aid resolution of the problem by adding to bank profitability and helping banks to improve their operations by learning to price risk appropriately. The authorities agreed that there was a need to move quickly on all these fronts, but felt that good progress has already been made on asset disposal. 29. The staff welcomed the increasing attention being paid to bank supervision. The staff emphasized the importance of moving quickly, given the short period of time left before the sector is opened to foreign competition (by end-2006) as part of the WTO accession agreement. In the near term, emphasis should be placed on reaching full compliance with lo A summary of the staffs findings on the NPL problem in China is contained in the Selected Issues paper.

Nonperforming Loans in the Financial System Reported nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the financial system amounted to 43 percent of GDP in mid-2003 (see tabulation below). Of this, the NPLs in the banking system amounted to 30 percent of GDP, or 21 percent of total loans. The four State Commercial Banks (SCBs) held close to half of all NPLs. Rural credit cooperatives reported 32 percent of their loans as being NPLs, while joint stock commercial banks fared better than other banks, with only 9 percent of their loans classified as nonperforming. Most NPLs in the banking system are old (loans made before 2000) and the debtors are primarily in state-owned enterprises, and the vast majority of them are classified as doubtful or loss. ’ The reported data indicate that, between end-2002 and mid-2003, the ratio of NPLs to GDP declined by about 2% percentage points. Over the same period, the ratio of NPLs in the banking system to total loans declined by 3% percentage points, reflecting the strong growth in lending. The reduction in reported NPLs as a percent of total loans was fairly broad-based across different segments of the banking sector. Notwithstanding the downward trend in NPLs, potential data weaknesses and potential problems in implementing new prudential regulations suggest that the scale of problem loans may be larger. These weaknesses include the reporting of NPLs according to the old loan classification system by some subsectors (which may underestimate the level of NPLs compared with the new loan classification system), a discrepancy between the past due status and classification of loans, and the relatively large share of loans classified as special mention. Key gaps in reported data also remain. For example, information on restructured loans and foreclosed assets is not readily available.

Additional steps also need to be taken to improve the internal operations of banks, including improving risk management and controls, training of staff, and upgrading accounting systems.” 30. The authorities are considering participation in a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). They have initiated a comprehensive self-assessment of the banking sector based on the 1997 Basle Core Principles, which they expect to complete within the next year. After the self-assessment is completed, the authorities will make a decision on when they might participate in an FSAP. SOE Reform 31. Progress has been made in SOE reform over the past few years, but further efforts will be needed. Since 1997, more than 27 million workers have been laid off as a result of the closing of loss-making (mostly large and medium-sized) SOEs and depleted mines and the reduction of redundant employees in SOEs. In early 2002, major steps were taken to introduce competition in the state monopoly sectors of electricity generation, telecommunications, and civil aviation. However, state monopolies are still maintained in a number of industries. Overall SOE performance improved in 2002 as their industrial value added increased by 11.6 percent and profits rose by 20 percent.12 SOEs now account for about % of industrial value-added, compared to about % a decade ago. 32. The authorities agreed with the staff that continued SOE reform is critical for successful restructuring of the economy, especially the resolution of the problems in the financial sector. They explained that their strategy for reforming the SOEs is to ensure the viability of state ownership in key industries vital for the national economy while exiting from other industries and from all small and medium-sized SOEs. The creation of the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in March 2003 would facilitate the achievement of this objective. For the large SOEs that are to remain under state control, the authorities intend to improve corporate governance by: (i) pushing forward with establishing a share-holding system, enhancing the role of independent directors, and diversifying ownership structures; and (ii) creating an effective incentive mechanism for senior managers. The authorities plan to close an additional 2,500 large and medium-sized SOEs, covering about 5 million employees, over the next 4-5 years. l1 The CBRC has provided written comments to BIS endorsing the objectives of the New Capital Accord (Basle II). However, as in most non-G-10 countries, it will take time before banks can improve risk management skills and information systems to support the use of an internal rating based approach for capital regulation. In the meantime, regulations are being revised to incorporate other aspects of Basle II, such as enhanced supervisory review and improved market discipline through information disclosure. l2 A significant part of this increase in SOE profits is accounted for by petroleum companies, reflecting higher world oil prices.

Transparent procedures and adequate market infrastructure for the sale of assets need to be established to ensure that the state receives proper value for its assets. While supporting the authorities’ plan to enhance corporate governance and reduce state equity holding of SOEs, the staff stressed that hard budget constraints need to be enforced and loss-making SOEs closed in a timely fashion. Bank lending should be done strictly on a commercial basis. To the extent that continued support is needed to manage the social pressures of SOE reform, this support should be fully reflected in the budget. 34. The authorities explained that the 2003 budget had set aside 11 billion yuan (0.1 percent of GDP) for subsidizing bankrupt SOEs. The funds are being used mainly to pay overdue wages and severance payments, as well as re-employment subsidies for laid-off workers. Unemployment pressure and costs to the budget are the main considerations for setting a schedule for closing loss-making SOEs. The authorities also pointed out a wide range of efforts being made to improve the social safety net, including the increase in pension payments, the expansion of coverage of unemployment insurance and the minimum allowance system, and reforms underway to improve the public health system and provide emergency assistance to those in need. Labor and capital markets 35. Unemployment and the gap between rural and urban incomes continue to be pressing social problems. While the number of laid-off SOE workers (xiagang) has declined, the number of registered unemployed in urban areas has continued to increase. The authorities see the increases in the urban unemployment rate as stemming from the impact of the economic restructuring program, including the downsizing of the SOE sector, and the increased urbanization of the population.13 The authorities have implemented several initiatives over the last year to mitigate the social costs of reforms. These include: (i) payment of subsistence allowances for laid-off SOE workers; (ii) expansion in the coverage of unemployment insurance; (iii) expansion of the coverage of the minimum urban living standard assurance; and (iv) easing of policy restrictions on the movement of rural labor. Regarding the last point, administrative restrictions on the hiring of rural migrants in urban areas have been lifted, although many aspects of the hukou system remain in place.14 Increased budgetary resources are also being provided to fund the provision of social services in western provinces. The staff welcomed the increased attention and resources being devoted to social insurance, but urged the government to further relax restrictions inherent in the hukou system. Increasing budgetary resources for the development of the poorer western provinces will also depend crucially on center-provincial fiscal reforms. l3 Despite the increasing migration to urban areas, 60 percent of the population still lived in rural areas as of end-2002. l4 The hukou system is a registration system for workers set up in the 1950s to restrict migration from rural to urban areas. An urban hukou designation is still needed for a resident to have access to many basic services such as education, health, and social security.

The current system is severely underfunded with a cash deficit projected to widen further in coming years. To reduce the cash deficit, the authorities are expanding the administrative level of pooling to the city and, eventually, to the provincial level, and plan to extend the coverage of the system to include self-employed and other workers currently not covered. The staff cautioned that changes to the system would need to include adjustments to key parameters, such as the retirement age and benefit payments, which are currently not envisaged by the authorities. The staff emphasized that any expansion in coverage without changes to these key parameters would provide additional revenue in the short term, but only at the cost of a substantial increase in future liabilities. 37. The authorities have continued with their gradual approach to capital account liberalization. The Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program was initiated in December 2002. This program allows qualified foreign investors to invest in the domestic stock market within approved limits. Thus far, four foreign investors have received approval with an approved amount totaling $725 million. The authorities are also considering the introduction of a Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program that would allow domestic investors to invest in overseas markets, including Hong Kong SAR. No timetable has yet been set, and initial limits under the program are expected to be modest. The staff endorsed the authorities’ gradual approach to capital account liberalization and welcomed consideration of a QDII program which has proven useful in other countries that implemented gradual capital account liberalization. Trade Policy, WTO, and Other Issues 38. Reductions in tariffs and nontariff barriers continue to be implemented broadly in line with the WTO accession agreement. China’s compliance with the WTO agreement has generally been viewed as positive thus far, although there have been some complaints about enforcement issues and delays in implementation. The authorities emphasized their intention to meet all WTO commitments as scheduled, including significant steps to further open up the services sector in the areas of banking, insurance, and retailing before the end of 2003. The staff noted that the trade reforms that have been implemented as part of WTO commitments have been more broad based than earlier efforts and are taking place in a multilateral context rather than through regional or bilateral agreements. As a result, the reforms have encouraged more internal integration (including through the removal of inter- provincial barriers), and fostered the creation of a more open economy that is becoming increasingly integrated into global and regional trade.15 39. China continues to provide debt relief to a group of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). Debt relief has already been provided to 3 1 African countries and, in l5 A discussion of China’s trade reforms and their impact on trade patterns worldwide and in Asia is provided in one of the chapters of the Selected Issues paper.

Thus far, China has signed debt relief protocols with 8 countries and is engaged in discussions with three more. 40. China does not have a separate anti-money laundering framework, but continues to enforce existing provisions contained in various other laws. No changes in legislation have been introduced since the last Article IV consultation. 41. China continues to implement improvements in the quality and coverage of statistics in line with international practice (Annex IV). The authorities joined the GDDS in 2002, and intend to subscribe to SDDS in the future. The staff welcomed this effort, but emphasized that there is a fundamental need to improve statistics in several key areas. These include reporting data on the international investment position (IIP) to the Fund as required by Article VIII, Section S(a)(vii) as soon as it is available; preparation of annual and quarterly GDP on an expenditure basis; and improvements in labor statistics. The staff also continued to encourage the authorities to strengthen the monitoring of capital flows and data provision to the IMF on reserves and external debt, in line with the benchmarks established for surveillance purposes. The authorities confirmed that efforts were underway in all of these areas and that they are following the reform plan in the GDDS. Regarding IIP, they indicated that they have done considerable work in compiling this data. Problems with several data sources need to be resolved before this exercise can be completed and the data reported to the Fund. III. STAFFAPPRAISAL 42. The Chinese economy has continued its impressive growth and increasing integration with the global economy. Economic activity remained strong in the first half of 2003. The negative impact of the SARS outbreak appears to have been less than initially expected, and the economy seems to be making a rapid recovery. Growth momentum is projected to be maintained, and low (but positive) inflation is expected to continue for the period ahead. The current account surplus is projected to decline from its 2002 level, but sizable net inflows of capital are likely to continue, and China’s external position is expected to remain strong. 43. The short-term outlook is subject to significant uncertainties. Economic growth in advanced countries could be slower than currently envisaged. In China, there could still be some risks associated with the SARS epidemic, including a delayed impact on exports. On the upside, investment activity continues to be very strong, and money and credit growth have been well above target ranges, which could contribute to considerably faster GDP growth than currently projected. 44. Controlling monetary growth and credit expansion has become more difficult in the face of increasing capital inflows. Fast growth in broad money and credit primarily reflects the sharp rise in foreign exchange reserves and more aggressive lending by the banks. The PBC will likely have to continue to drain liquidity from the banking system in the period ahead, and additional efforts to tighten monetary conditions may be needed. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - 45. As China becomes more integrated into the global economy, shielding the money supply from international influences will increasingly require more flexibility in the exchange rate. Present circumstances suggest that a reasonably quick move to greater flexibility would be advantageous. While China’s exchange rate policy served the region well during the Asian Financial Crisis, a move to greater flexibility now would be beneficial for China and for the Asian region, in addition to contributing to the ongoing adjustment of external imbalances that is taking place worldwide. Such action also could help to forestall rising protectionist pressures against China in some major trading partners. 46. China could make its exchange rate more flexible without causing major disruptions to the domestic economy, as it is currently in a position of considerable domestic and external strength. Greater flexibility would serve to moderate the impact on China of economic shocks and facilitate adjustment to the major structural reforms that are underway, with the beneficial effect of reducing volatility in output and employment. Greater flexibility would also reduce the risk of the economy becoming more vulnerable to financial shocks, as the prolonged maintenance of a de facto fixed exchange rate tends to promote sharp swings in capital flows. To increase flexibility, options that might be considered include widening the band, pegging the exchange rate to a basket of currencies, and an adjustment in the central rate, or some combination of these options. The functioning of the exchange market also needs to be substantially improved, regardless of whether there are changes in the exchange rate arrangement. 47. The staff continues to support the authorities’ gradual approach to capital account liberalization. The implementation of the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme will be a positive factor for domestic markets. Similarly, the strong external position provides scope for the authorities to introduce the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme and to continue to cautiously lift restrictions on overseas investment by Chinese companies. While these initiatives are useful and might reduce reserve accumulation somewhat, they will not have a substantial impact on capital flows in the short run, and they would not be effective substitutes for the benefits of greater exchange rate flexibility. 48. The fiscal position will remain reasonably sound in the near term, if the authorities achieve their objective of holding the 2003 deficit to the level targeted in the budget. Spending should be kept in line with its budgeted level and any additional measures to assist individuals and businesses significantly affected by the SARS outbreak should be well-targeted and fully included in the budget. Any over-performance on revenue should be used to reduce outstanding tax refunds to exporters and to further consolidate the fiscal position. 49. The medium- and longer-term fiscal position remains a potential source of vulnerability. Substantial future demands will be placed on the budget by existing quasi- fiscal liabilities in the financial sector and the pension system, increased responsibilities for social services currently provided by SOEs, measures to address weaknesses in the public health system, and other expenditures that will grow with an aging population. Successfully managing these demands on the public finances will in part depend on further, far-reaching structural reforms. However, even with quick and effective structural reforms to limit the size Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - of contingent liabilities, measures on both the revenue and expenditure sides will be needed to avoid putting public debt on an unsustainable path. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to keep the level of the fiscal deficit roughly unchanged in nominal terms over the next few years. The staff strongly supports the Ministry of Finance’s efforts to establish a framework of 3-year rolling fiscal forecasts that will set policy considerations more in a medium-term context. 50. A number of important reforms will provide crucial support to the fiscal adjustment effort. Additional tax reforms will enhance efficiency and improve the buoyancy of revenues, while ongoing improvements in tax administration will also support revenue-raising efforts. On the expenditure side, more prioritization will be needed to make room for rising social expenditure needs and improvements in public expenditure management will facilitate these efforts. Since most of the recommended reforms will have implications for lower levels of government, it becomes even more important to reform center-province fiscal relations, and to ensure that these government entities have sufficient fiscal resources to efficiently and effectively carry out their responsibilities. 51. Progress has been made on financial sector reform, but much remains to be done to establish a sound and competitive banking system. The CBRC has made a good start in its efforts to improve banking regulation and supervision, and these efforts will need to be sustained. The staff agrees with the authorities that additional capital injections in the state- owned commercial banks should only be made when the banks have demonstrated substantial improvements in performance and governance. Moreover, such decisions should be made in the context of clear plans regarding the future ownership structure of the state- owned banks. The staff welcomes the commencement of work on a self-assessment of the financial sector, and strongly recommends that China participate in an FSAP, as this could help in formulating the next steps in financial sector reform. 52. Further efforts will be needed to reduce the large stock of NPLs and the flow of new NPLs. The ability of banks to resolve distressed debts needs to be strengthened by improving the legal framework for creditor rights, foreclosures, and bankruptcy. The ability of banks to lower their NPLs would also be helped by reducing the tax burden on financial institutions, including through the allowance of full deductibility for loan-loss provisions and a shift in the business tax from a gross interest to a net interest basis. Expediting the liberalization of lending rates would also aid resolution of the NPL problem by adding to bank profitability and helping banks improve their operations by learning to price risk appropriately. 53. SOE reform continues to be a vital component for successful restructuring of the economy. The recently established State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council will have an important role to play in safeguarding the value of state assets, improving overall SOE governance, and facilitating diversification of SOE ownership. To further increase commercial orientation and prepare for more competition (including from foreign companies), hard budget constraints need to be enforced and loss-making SOEs closed in a timely fashion. Transparent procedures and the market infrastructure for the sale of assets need to be established to ensure that the state receives fair value for its assets and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - the proceeds from any sales. The staff supports continued efforts to establish modern enterprise management systems in SOEs, improve incentives for senior managers, relieve SOEs of their social responsibilities, separate core businesses from secondary businesses, transfer more activities to the non-state sector, and increase competition, including by breaking up large state utilities and monopolies. 54. Unemployment and the widening gap between rural and urban incomes continue to be pressing problems. A significant portion of the rural population still lives in poverty while, at the same time, urban unemployment has increased. Addressing these problems will require fundamental policy changes, including reform of center-province fiscal relations, and increases in education and social spending. Recent measures taken to reduce discrimination of rural workers in urban areas are welcome and need to be supplemented by further reforms to the hukou system to allow freer movement of labor. Job growth in the private sector could also be stimulated by improved access to financing and reduced barriers for individuals and firms to enter new lines of business. One aspect of social spending that is in need of further reform is the pension system. Key parameters of the current system need to be revised to ensure long-term viability and minimize contingent liabilities. Any expansion of pension coverage should take place only after reform of the current system has been implemented. 55. Trade reforms, including those implemented as part of WTO accession, have contributed to the rapid expansion in international trade. Another round of tariff reductions was implemented in January 2003, and significant market opening initiatives are scheduled for the remainder of the year, including in banking, insurance, and retailing. The staff encourages the authorities to implement these commitments as scheduled. 56. Improvements have been made in the provision and timeliness of statistics, but shortcomings remain in several areas. The following are the most important priorities for the period ahead: providing annual and quarterly real GDP data on an expenditure basis; reporting data on the international investment position as soon as feasible; presenting the fiscal accounts on a standard government finance statistics (GFS) basis; and compiling data for unemployment consistent with international guidelines. 57. The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Projected Obligations to Fund: None VII. Exchange Arrangements: 1. On January 1, 1994 the Chinese authorities introduced a unified exchange rate system. Under the new system, domestic enterprises are required to sell their foreign exchange to designated banks and can freely purchase foreign exchange from banks for trade and trade-related transactions with the necessary import documentation. Although the authorities formally adopted a “managed float” system, the renminbi has in practice been tightly linked to the U.S. dollar, especially since the Asian crisis. The PBC has limited movement of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar to +/-0.3 percent around a reference rate announced daily, through purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the interbank market. On July 3 1, 2003 the exchange rate was Y 8.28 per U.S. dollar. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - ANNEX I 2. China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation and surrender requirements on proceeds from exports and from invisible transactions and current transfers. All enterprises authorized to conduct current account transactions may retain foreign exchange equivalent to 20 percent of their current account foreign exchange earnings in the previous year, except for special purpose transactions, such as donations and international postal remittances, for which the ceiling is 100 percent. They must sell the rest of their foreign exchange earnings to authorized banks. Importers must provide valid proof and commercial bills to obtain foreign exchange. There are no measures currently in force that have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. 3. In 1998, new requirements expanded the scope of documentation required for most forms of current transactions and required prior verification of the underlying transactions in some instances (e.g., the customs service must certify the value of imports before banks can provide foreign exchange for payment). Following China’s WTO accession, regulations reducing the scope for domestically-funded entities to conduct business with foreign banks operating in China are to be fully eliminated by end-2003. 4. Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. In general, a capital account transaction requires the approval of the SAFE. Effective December 1,2002, qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs) are allowed to invest domestically in A shares, subject to the following restrictions: (i) QFIIs must have minimum experience in the industry (5 years for fund managers; 30 years for insurance companies) and at least US$lO billion in assets under management in the latest financial year, and be cleared of any major irregularities in their home market over the past three years; (ii) a QFII that is a bank must be among the top 100 international banks by assets in the latest financial year; (iii) a QFII that is an insurance or a securities company must have a minimum paid-up capital of US$l billion; and (iv) for each QFII, ownership of any Chinese company listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchange is limited to 10 percent, and the total shares owned by QFIIs in a single Chinese company cannot exceed 20 percent. QFIIs must set up a special renminbi account with domestic banks and use the services of domestic securities companies. Close-ended QFIIs can only remit capital after three years, in installments of no more than 20 percent of the total each time, and at intervals of one month or more. Other QFIIs can only remit capital after one year, in installments of no more than 20 percent of the total, and at intervals of three months or more. Prior to December 1, 2002, nonresidents could purchase only B shares. The face value of B shares is denominated in U.S. dollars or Hong Kong dollars. These shares are listed on the Chinese Securities Exchange and may be bought only by foreign investors. Domestic investors may purchase B shares with new or existing foreign currency deposits. Nonresidents are not permitted to issue capital or money market securities in the domestic market. Purchases of capital and money market instruments abroad by residents are restricted to a few financial institutions and listed enterprises, as are foreign stock and bond issues which also require prior approval. In 2001, domestic investors were allowed to purchase B shares and measures were introduced to ease restrictions on the purchase of foreign exchange with RMB for the advance repayment of foreign debts, foreign exchange on-lending and domestic foreign exchange loans.

However, in December 200 1, this approval process was eliminated under a pilot project in some provinces. Also, since December 2001, FFEs no longer need SAFE approval to convert foreign currency into yuan for capital investments, and commercial banks are now responsible for verifying the related documents. 5. An annual foreign borrowing plan sets mandatory ceilings for all medium- and long- term borrowing by government departments and enterprises (except FFEs which are subject to individual limits negotiated in the investment approval process). The State Development and Reform Commission determines the ceilings, while the SAFE is responsible for the approval of each issue and management of external borrowing (pre-approval investigation covers the financial situation of the enterprise, the need for the loan, and whether the terms of the loan are consistent with the use of the proceeds). For short-term borrowing by financial institutions (less than a year), the amount of borrowing is subject to an overall limi determined by the SAFE on an annual basis (there are also enterprise-specific limits); financial institutions can conduct business within this limit without explicit approval, but must register the borrowing with the SAFE. .t 6. Regulations on guarantees by residents to nonresidents have the following key features. First, guarantees consist of collateral and pledges in addition to what are commonly known as guarantees. Second, prior SAFE approval is required for financing guarantees provided by banks and all guarantees provided by other institutions (with the exception of FFEs). Prior approval is not required for nonfinancing guarantees. Third, both domestic and foreign-currency-denominated guarantees are covered by the regulations. Fourth, the approval process for guarantees is based on prospective guarantors’ profits, assets to liabilities, and asset-quality-ratio requirements. 7. China maintains controls on FDI, although it has generally pursued an “open door” policy toward inward FDI. In the case of outward FDI, foreign exchange is provided after a SAFE review of sources of foreign exchange funds and an assessment of the investment risk involved, approval by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), and registration with SAFE. In 2002, on a pilot basis, 10 provinces and municipalities were authorized single quotas of foreign exchange within US$200 million for overseas investment. In the case of inward direct investment, nonresidents can invest in China subject to meeting certain regulations and MOC approval. On April 1, 2002, a new four-tier classification system for foreign investment was introduced, defining activities where foreign investment is encouraged, permitted, restricted or banned. In effect, this resulted in the opening up of many industries previously closed to foreign investment, particularly in the services sectors, consistent with China’s WTO-related commitments. 8. Domestic financial institutions and firms cannot engage in such derivative transactions for purposes of speculation. However, transactions designed to hedge interest rate or exchange rate risk are possible. All transactions involving derivative instruments under foreign debt items must be registered with SAFE, except those undertaken by FFEs.

An analysis of the sustainability of China’s government debt based on the standard Fund framework does not suggest major difficulties over the next few years; however, over the longer term, large quasi-fiscal liabilities and rising expenditure pressures are key sources of potential fiscal vulnerability. The standard Fund framework cannot be easily extended to longer horizons because data limitations preclude precise estimates of quasi-fiscal liabilities, and there are considerable uncertainties in trying to gauge the magnitude of potential expenditure pressures over the longer term. ’ 2. China’s official government debt is low, but would be significantly larger if quasi-fiscal liabilities were included. Official data show that the stock of explicit government debt stood at 26 percent of GDP at end-2002.2 Contingent liabilities include nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the banking system, untinded pension obligations, and external borrowings by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and semi-governmental finance companies. Owing to lack of data, this debt sustainability analysis only includes estimated losses from reported NPLs and the minimum transition costs of shifting to a viable pension system.3 However, potential data weaknesses and inevitable problems in implementing new prudential regimes suggest that the scale of problem loans may be higher. Transition costs of the pension reform could also be substantially higher, depending on the magnitude of changes to the pension parameters. On the other hand, China could potentially use its substantial stock of state assets to finance government debt obligations. Moreover, potential pressures on spending are expected to intensify over time, and the bulk of their impact on the fiscal position would fall outside of the medium-term horizon that this debt sustainability analysis is based on. 3. The debt sustainability analysis is based on the staffs macroeconomic projections and on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework. Key assumptions include: ’ One of the chapters of the Selected Issues paper looks at longer-term fiscal sustainability, focusing on the sensitivity of this analysis to changes in key assumptions, such as the GDP growth rate, interest rates, the initial stock of explicit government debt and contingent liabilities, and spending pressures. 2 This includes regular issues of bonds to finance the central government’s budget deficits, as well as the bonds issued to recapitalize the four state-owned commercial banks in 1998 and bonds used for on-lending to local governments. 3 Losses from NPLs are estimated to be 35 percent of GDP at end-2002, and are assumed to fall to 32 percent of GDP at end-2003; unfunded pension liabilities are assumed to be 7 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38 - ANNEX II l GDP growth is projected to average 7% percent a year. l The nominal value of the deficit will be held constant at its 2003 level, implying a decline in the primary deficit of about % percent of GDP a year. l The average domestic real interest rate increases gradually to 3 percent within five years, reflecting gradual liberalization of the financial sector.4 4. Under these assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline from 66 percent of GDP in 2003 to 61 percent in 2007 (Table II. 1). The sensitivity analysis suggests that fiscal sustainability may not be a major concern over the next few years, provided that structural reforms continue to be implemented. To take into account the uncertainties about the future macroeconomic conditions, spending needs, and the actual level of contingent liabilities, the effects of a higher real interest rate, lower growth, wider primary deficit, and a higher stock of contingent liabilities were simulated. Isolated or combined temporary adverse shocks on these key variables would only increase the debt-to-GDP ratio in the short run. However, if the GDP growth rate is reduced permanently, and fiscal consolidation does not take place, the debt-to-GDP ratio could be put on a rising path. Individual temporary shocks. A temporarily lower GDP growth rate or higher public spending would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 68 percent in 2004, and a higher real interest rate would increase the ratio to 70 percent, but these ratios would then decline as in the baseline scenario.5 Combined temporary shocks. Should GDP growth be slower, the real interest rate higher, and public spending more expansionary all at the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to about 77 percent in 2004 and then decline. Higher initialpublic debt stock. If debt-creating flows were to be 10 percentage points of GDP higher in 2003, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 76 percent in 2003, but would fall to 69 percent of GDP by 2007. Combined changes in trends. If the rate of real GDP growth declined permanently by 1 percentage point, the real interest rate increased by 1 percentage point, and the primary deficit increased by around % percent of GDP annually, China’s debt-to-GDP ratio would increase throughout the period to 2007. 4 Given the existing interest rates and maturity structure of public debt, the projected return of modest inflation produces a decline in the aggregate effective real interest rate during the projection period. 5 The standard deviations and means for all variables have been calculated on the basis of the last 7 years.

Fiscal advice has been provided in the context of an on-going technical assistance program covering the period 2000-2003 to support the government’s economic reform effort. The project benefits from financial support from UNDP and from the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), as well as the participation of the World Bank in the implementation of the Provincial Expenditure Review. Discussions for a successor project to commence in 2004 are underway. The fiscal technical assistance program has concentrated on four key areas: Tax policy: To simplify and reduce the tax burden on farmers, the authorities have launched pilot projects to replace various local fees and charges by a lower local tax, and are expanding the tax-for-fee reform nationwide in 2003. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to remove important distortions in the current tax system. In particular, the VAT should be converted from a production base to a consumption base, and should be extended to services. Moreover, the income tax rate for domestic and foreign-funded enterprises should be unified, and the scope of enterprise income tax incentives should be reduced. Taxation of the financial sector should also be reformed, including by allowing tax deductibility of specific loan loss provisions, and shifting the base for the business tax from a gross to a net interest basis. Tax administration: The authorities have been putting in place the basic building blocks of a modem national tax administration, including risk management techniques and a modem computerization system. The operational effectiveness of the national tax administration still needs to be improved, for instance, by developing a nationally consistent organizational structure, improving compliance management, and developing self-assessment practices. Public expenditure management: To improve the efficiency of public spending, a number of budget and treasury reforms are being implemented. The budget coverage is being expanded to include extra-budgetary revenue and spending. The budget preparation cycle has been brought forward and extended and a shift to departmental budgets is being implemented. New functional and economical budget classifications are soon to be adopted. However, major implementation work in the treasury and accounting areas, including the adoption of a new chart of accounts, is still needed. Intra-government fiscal relations: The revenue-sharing formula for income taxes has been revised in 2002, providing more resources to the central government for transfers. The current transfer system has, however, favored richer provinces, thereby increasing regional disparities and making it more difficult for poorer regions to meet minimum standards of public services. Local governments’ revenue sources are limited, while their expenditure responsibilities are substantial, including health, education, unemployment insurance, social security, and infrastructure. A more thorough reexamination of revenue and spending assignments and of the design of the transfer system is therefore needed. Key considerations should include giving more control over tax rates to local governments, while centralizing some spending responsibilities such as pensions. Transfers should be more rule-based and allow each province to deliver minimum standards of public services.

China has made significant strides in bringing its statistics into line with international good practice. In April 2002, China participated in the Fund’s GDDS, where the metadata provides the most comprehensive documentation available in English. In June 2003 the process of annually updating the metadata began. However, weaknesses remain in the quality of the data, including coverage, frequency and timeliness. The main statistical issues are as follows. Real sector 2. Data on the expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis; nor are deflators for the expenditure components-either on a quarterly or annual basis. The data are produced in cumulative form, with minimal revisions of previous data, making it difficult to assess quarterly developments accurately or to make seasonal adjustments. Constant price measures of GDP are also suspect because of deficiencies with the price indices used for deflating and their application. Nevertheless, the National Bureau of Statistics has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national accounts data, including quarterly estimates of GDP by industry and estimates of GDP by type of expenditure. Further improvements are intended, including the adoption of the 1993 System of National Accounts, further development of income and expenditure data, and improvements to quarterly GDP estimates. However, no target dates have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of the nonstate sector, presents new problems for data compilation. The ability to change the collection of data is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system. Extensive technical assistance has been provided from multilateral and bilateral institutions. 3. Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment data also have a shifting base that does not allow a consistent time series. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series. Retail sales and fixed investment data are published only in nominal, not real, terms. 4. Labor market statistics-including employment and wage data-are not comprehensive, and are only available on an annual basis, with considerable lag. 5. Prior to December 2000, the consumer price index was not produced in a time series format, as there were only comparisons between the current month and the previous month, and the current month with the same month of the previous year. For most items, the weights were for the previous year’s expenditures with the other weights being updated each month. Technical assistance missions in September 1991, April 1995, and June 1997 dealt with the concepts and methodology of internationally used index formulae. The authorities have received technical assistance and training on price index methodology under a cooperative program with Statistics Canada. A technical assistance mission in August 1999 reviewed the methodology to compile fixed-base price indices in test projects in four provinces and found Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - ANNEX IV that only in one province the index was adequate. In January 2001, the NBS began to publish a new fixed base CPI, which more accurately reflects consumer spending patterns (e.g., the weight of services increased, while the weight of food declined). The number of survey items has been expanded to more than 550 from the previous 325. The weights of the major CPI components were provided to the staff during the 2001 Article IV mission. Government finance 6. Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Budgetary data exclude spending associated with domestic bond proceeds on-lent to local governments and official external borrowing. Also, data on the social and extra budgetary funds are only provided annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification remains very poor, though this should start to improve next year with the introduction of the new budget classification system. 7. China irregularly reports central government and local government budget data for publication in the GRS Yearbook. The latest published data are for 1999. No data are provided on government debt. The data also exclude government social security and extrabudgetary operations. The revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue and grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of expenditure is by function only and lacks an economic classification. In addition, the functional classification does not comply with international standards. 8. The annual updates of GDDS fiscal metadata are not yet available. Monetary accounts 9. In recent years, improvements have been made in the classification of accounts of the monetary authorities and the banking institutions. From 2002, compilation and reporting of monetary data include foreign-currency-denominated accounts of residents and accounts of the branches of foreign banks. 10. However, the monetary and banking surveys lack sufficient detail with regard to bank claims on the government, and this hampers the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing side. In addition, detailed breakdowns of bank credit extended by industry (e.g., manufacturing, real estate, etc.), and by borrower (e.g., the various elements of the state and nonstate sectors), are not publicly available. The staff continues to encourage the authorities to report information of this nature for analytical purposes. 11. Due to the restructuring of the banking sector, new statistical issues have arisen, such as how to record the transfer of NPLs to the AMCs, and how to classify these companies in the banking survey. 12. The reported NFA position of PBC does not include exchange rate valuation effects nor interest earnings on foreign reserves. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - ANNEX IV Balance of payments 13. SAFE relies on an “international transactions reporting system” (ITRS) which produces data of sufficient quality derived from information on foreign exchange transactions conducted by banks. To supplement the ITRS, SAFE conducts periodic surveys to collect data on travel credits, to gather balance sheet information from financial institutions, and to obtain data on portfolio investment and direct investment. 14. The data are compiled largely in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BUMS), and disseminated on an annual basis within six months of the close of the reference period. It appears that the authorities are close to being able to publish quarterly estimates of the balance of payments. Within the current account, component detail is available on goods, services, income, and transfers. Data on the financial account are also available with significant component detail for functional categories, but with little sectoral breakdown. The data are compiled in U.S. dollars. However, the data on financial accounts are not compiled on a transaction basis, therefore exchange rate valuation effects are included. The authorities have indicated that they had almost completed the compilation of international investment position (IIP) statistics for 2000, but that some data categories still needed to be improved, and therefore no IIP data have been published so far. 15. The Fund has provided extensive technical assistance for China to improve balance of payments and IIP statistics. In August 2002 a seminar was held on Balance of Payments and IIP statistics in Chengdu, China. The coverage of direct investment transactions remains a problematic issue in the Chinese balance of payments and IIP statistics. Data on these transactions, received mainly from the Ministry of Commerce (formerly Ministry of Foreign Trade and Cooperation), apparently do not cover all required elements such as disinvestments. On the other hand, the direct investment survey developed by SAFE has not provided reliable data. Another issue that has to be addressed by the authorities is to extend verification and auditing programs to reduce measurement errors and ensure the long-term performance of the ITRS. For this purpose regular training programs for staff in the provincial offices of SAFE were recommended. 16. The Fund has also provided technical assistance on the coverage, timeliness, and periodicity of China’s data on official reserves, reserves-related liabilities, as well as on other external assets and liabilities, financial derivative activities, and other contingent and potential liabilities. In 2002, the authorities indicated that they were close to reporting reserves data in accordance with the SDDS template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity. The authorities also noted that the definition and coverage of China’s external debt data follow closely the recently-published External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users. Such data are apparently compiled monthly but published only on a semi-annual basis (monthly data have not been provided to Fund staff on a regular basis). Despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there remains a need to strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation, while introducing additional transparency in data dissemination.

In June 1999, the PBC resumed reporting monthly monetary data and has agreed to their publication in IFS. These improvements in reporting notwithstanding, a number of breaks remain in the series, and comparable historical data are not available. 18. Since 1994, China’s Ministry of Finance (MOF) has regularly reported annual GFS data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The GFS database currently includes data on the central government budget forl990-97, and on provincial and local governments for 1995-1999. The MOF also reports annual GFS data for publication in IFS. Data through 1998, relate to revenue, expenditure, and the deficit/surplus of the central, provincial, county-level, and municipal governments’ budgets. These data are provided with substantial delays. The latest published data are estimates for 1999. 19. Reporting of data to STA for IFS has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag. Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the timeliness of consumer price, industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS has improved substantially. However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no data published on producer prices, wages, and trade volumes and prices/unit values. Data dissemination to the public 20. The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly improved the timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and the main real sector indicators. However, the monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series (e.g. unemployment) or the disaggregation necessary for analysis. Moreover, several important time series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not released in a systematic and timely manner. Extensive annual economic data are available in various statistical yearbooks, but these are published nine months or more after the end of the year.

The World Bank has been active in China since 1980. World Bank commitments to China as of June 30,2003 totaled about $37.22 billion for 245 projects. About 90 of these projects are still under implementation, making China’s portfolio by far the largest in the Bank. World Bank-supported projects are found in almost all parts of China and in many sectors of the economy, with infrastructure (transport, energy, industry, urban development) accounting for more than half of the total portfolio, and agriculture, social sectors (health, education, social protection), environment, and water supply and sanitation comprising the remainder. 2. In FY2003, lending totaled $1,145 million in IBRD loans for six projects. Given the increased availability of domestic financing-as a result of China’s fiscal stimulus policy- and a shift of the government’s development program to the central and western areas, the focus of the World Bank’s assistance program is now on the poorer and institutionally weaker inland provinces. As a consequence, the amount of lending per project has been scaled back to suit the absorptive capacity of those provinces, leading to a lower lending level compared with previous years. Of the projects approved in FY 2003, two supported urban environment improvements in Shanghai and Tianjin, one benefited local power supply, and three assisted highway development. A summary of Bank commitments and disbursement to China is given in Table III. 1. Details of the sectoral breakdown of past lending can be found in Table 111.2. 3. Over the next two years, lending is expected to total around $2.5 billion, with support provided to development of health, education, agriculture and infrastructure in the interior provinces, and for urban management and the environment largely in the more developed eastern areas. Since China is no longer borrowing IDA funds, the Bank, in collaboration with the government and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), has developed a mechanism to blend grant resources with IBRD loans, resulting in more concessional loans (at an interest rate of about 2 percent) for the social sectors and poverty reduction. Use of this blending mechanism with other development partners is envisioned. 4. The current World Bank Group assistance strategy, covering both lending and non-lending activities, is designed to help China: (i) improve the business environment and help accelerate the transition to a market economy, mostly through an array of knowledge transfer activities; (ii) address the needs of the poorer and disadvantaged people and lagging regions, through investment lending in rural development, infrastructure, and the social sectors, as well as AAA and training; and (iii) facilitate an environmentally sustainable development process, through investment lending in natural resource management, watershed rehabilitation and wastewater treatment, energy, global environment projects supported by the Global Environment Facility and Montreal Protocol, and policy work. ’ Prepared by World Bank staff.

In addition to financial assistance the provision of non-financial services in the form of technical assistance, policy advice, seminars and training is an essential part of the cooperation program. The government has strongly endorsed Bank efforts to make its non-lending activities more responsive to the country’s evolving needs, by having a better balance between detailed studies of issues requiring lengthy technical analysis and quick delivery of briefer policy notes, supplemented by other forms of collaboration like senior-level workshops. Some of our recent or upcoming outputs include policy and technical notes on fiscal issues at both the national and sub-national levels, state asset management, the management of domestic debt risks, selected financial sector issues, energy sector reform, environment and water management, and the impacts of WTO on policy reform and poverty. A major economic report that looks at growth, poverty and inequality has been completed recently, and during FY2004 reports on the reform of public service units and on national market integration are expected. In addition, the World Bank expects to provide assistance to the Government to support preparations for the 1 I* Five Year Plan, and to broaden and deepen its work on finance, corporate governance, environmental, social and urban development issues. Representation: The People’s Republic of China assumed China’s representation in the World Bank on May 15, 1980. Capital Subscription: China holds 4,480 million shares or 2.85 percent of the total authorized capital of the IBRD. Currently, China is fully subscribed. Technical Assistance: A technical assistance loan to the People’s Bank of China to enhance the central bank’s supervision, research, and clearing capabilities was approved in FY 1993. A second technical assistance project, approved in the same year, is financing reform-supportive studies and economic research, the strengthening of core agencies responsible for macroeconomic management and local training institutions, and preinvestment support. Technical assistance for economic law reform was approved in FY 1995. Fiscal technical assistance, also approved in FY 1995, supported the implementation of a broad range of public sector reforms. Assistance in bond market development has also been provided. In FY 1999, technical assistance projects were approved for reform of accounting, pension and enterprise systems. Further technical assistance support for economic research and preinvestment was also provided in FY 1999. A supplemental loan for financial sector technical assistance was approved in FY200 1. A large program of technical assistance is currently financed by trust funds from within and outside the Bank, covering statistical reform, poverty, social sectors, debt management, and social security.

In October 1997, responsibility for managing the Bank’s total program for China was decentralized to the Beijing office. International Finance Corporation (IFC): As of June 30,2003, IFC has committed financing for 58 projects in China. For these projects IFC has provided US$1.33 billion: US$836 million for IFC’s own account, and US$494 million for the account of participating banks. A resident IFC office in Beijing has been in operation since 1992. In July 2000, a joint IFC/World Bank regional office for private sector development was established in Hong Kong SAR, with management of this program decentralized to that office. IFC’s activities in China focus on the following six areas: (i) catalyzing investment through limited-recourse financing; (ii) promoting development of the indigenous private sector; (iii) promoting liberalization and modernization of the financial sector; (iv) emphasizing investment in China’s interior regions; (v) encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure; and (vi) supporting transformation of state- owned enterprises.

The current country operational strategy of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) is focused on three strategic objectives: (i) economic efficiency enhancement; (ii) promotion of growth to reduce poverty in poor inland provinces; and (iii) environmental protection and natural resource management. Significant country, regional and global developments, and major policy changes in AsDB require an updating of the country operational strategy for the PRC, which was adopted in 1997. The new Country Strategy and Program for China will be completed in late 2003. The new strategy will designed to promote pro-poor economic growth by enabling greater access of the poor to the benefits of economic prosperity and opportunity to achieve it. 2. Since China became a member of the AsDB in 1986,94 public sector loans totaling $12 billion (see table IV. 1) and 392 technical assistance projects amounting to $209 million have been approved as of 3 1 December 2002. In addition, AsDB has approved nine private sector projects without government guarantee in PRC including investments in two commercial banks, three investment funds for small and medium enterprises, two power projects loans, and two water sector project loans. The projects involve aggregate investments of $2.1 billion, for which ADB’s funding commitment consisted of $152 million of direct loans, $79 million of equity investments, and $172 million in complementary financing. 3. The 2003 public sector lending program is estimated at $1.6 billion for eight projects. These are: Harbin Water Supply ($100 million, approved in March); Wuhan Wastewater Management ($83 million, approved in April); Ningxia Roads Development (Tongxin-Yanchuanzi) ($250 million); Western Yunnan Roads Development ($250 million); Gansu Clean Energy Development Project ($49 million); Yichang- Wanzhou Railway Project ($500 million); Fujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development II ($80 million); and Xi’an Urban Transport ($300 million). In addition, the technical assistance core program included 23 projects totaling $12.1 million. The lending program mix will reflect the recommendation made in the AsDB Poverty Reduction Strategy, which calls for increasing public sector lending to poverty interventions. 4. The AsDB’s proposed program in the next few years will address four major issues: growing income disparities, developing an enabling environment for a market economy and private sector development, addressing environmental degradation and promoting regional cooperation. The strategic thrust in AsDB’s major project areas has now shifted to the less developed inland provinces. More than two-thirds of the proposed projects are located in inland provinces. The new assistance program will emphasize ’ Prepared by the staff of the Asian Development Bank.

In addition, environment protection and resource management will emerge as important themes with the increasing number of projects in urban environment improvement, wastewater treatment, renewable energy and land degradation through the Global Environment Facility Operational Program 12. 5. The AsDB’s lending program will continue to be supported by a technical assistance program giving priorities to Project Preparatory TAs and Advisory TAs. The focus of the TA program has been sharpened with strong linkages to governance, private sector development, environment, poverty and regional cooperation. Efforts to promote social development will be facilitated through new TA proposals for the education sector. In line with PRC’s increased decentralization, TA proposals for forging strategic partnerships with provincial governments in addressing specific thematic priorities have also been included. 6. Overall, China has demonstrated a strong project implementation capability. The good performance reflects the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the design, implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening process for development projects, particularly those proposed for external assistance. Loan disbursement and contract award performance is good. 7. The establishment of the China Resident Mission in Beijing in June 2000 has fostered closer interactions with stakeholders, including government officials, NGOs, the private sectors and other donors. AsDB’s presence in Beijing has contributed to improving portfolio management and project administration and enhanced the development impact of its lending and knowledge-based operations.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with the People’s Republic of China On October 31, 2003, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with China.’ Background Over the last few years, China has maintained its strong growth momentum and continued its rapid integration into the global economy. Despite the difficult world economic environment and domestic uncertainties, China’s GDP growth has remained above 7’/2 percent in recent years, supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Spurred by accession to the WTO in December 2001, China’s exports have expanded rapidly since then. At the same time, robust domestic demand and further market opening under China’s WTO commitments have also led to strong import growth. Real GDP grew by 8 percent in 2002, underpinned by the strength of exports and fixed investment, which registered growth rates of 22 percent and 17 percent, respectively. In the first quarter of 2003, the growth of exports and fixed investment increased to 34 percent and 28 percent (year-on-year), respectively; as a result, GDP grew by 10 percent (year-on-year). The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in the second quarter temporarily dampened GDP growth as activity in the services sector weakened. However, external trade continued to expand rapidly, and the services sector appears to have made a quick rebound. Deflationary pressures have been easing. After declining by 0.8 percent in 2002, consumer prices increased by ‘% percent in the first six months of 2003. Despite the strong GDP growth, unemployment continues to rise; registered unemployment in the urban areas increased to 4 percent in 2002, up 0.4 percentage points from 2001. The level of surplus labor in the l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the October 31, 2003 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

China’s overall external position has strengthened further. The current account surplus rose from 1% percent of GDP in 2001 to 2% percent in 2002, mainly on account of increases in the trade surplus and private transfers. The financial account posted another large surplus in 2002, as foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows amounted to $53 billion and there was a continuing repatriation of other capital from abroad. Official reserves increased by $76 billion in 2002. In the first 6 months of 2003, the trade surplus declined sharply as import growth exceeded export growth. However, reserves rose by a further $60 billion, reaching $355 billion by end-June (equivalent of around 10% months of imports). While FDI inflows have remained strong, the pickup in the pace of reserve accumulation in 2001-03 mostly reflects other capital inflows. As the economy rebounds from the SARS epidemic, growth is expected to pick up in the second half of 2003 and to reach 7% percent for the year. Economic activity would strengthen further in 2004, and the economy is expected to be growing at an 8 percent annual rate by the fourth quarter. Prices are expected to post small increases over the next year and one half, as the effects of some increases in commodity and food prices would more than offset downward pressures from supply-side factors, including lower tariffs and ongoing productivity gains. The external current account surplus would decline somewhat, as further WI-O-related trade liberalization boosts imports, while export growth would slow down from the very high rates recorded over the last year. Sizable net capital inflows, including FDI, are likely to continue, and the external position is expected to remain strong. With regard to structural reforms, in the banking sector, stricter prudential regulations and improving lending practices have contributed to a decline in the reported ratio of nonpet-forming loans to total loans, and asset management companies have made progress in recovering distressed assets. In the state-owned enterprise sector, the government has continued to introduce shareholding and modern management systems into large SOEs, while exiting from the smaller enterprises. Since 1997, more than 27 million workers have been laid off as a result of closing of loss-making SOEs and reduction of redundant employees. To mitigate the social impact of reforms, the authorities have taken steps to strengthen the social safety net, including by increasing pension payments and widening coverage of the unemployment insurance and urban minimum living allowance assurance schemes.
