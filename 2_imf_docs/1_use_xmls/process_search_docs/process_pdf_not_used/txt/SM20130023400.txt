Staff urged closer coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities to improve liquidity forecasts. It will also be important to complete the transition to a fully flexible exchange rate.  30. The CBR’s new 12-month refinancing facility may contribute to strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism, but should not be used for quantitative easing. The recently launched facility, combined with Finance Ministry purchases of FX for deposit into oil savings funds, should help facilitate liquidity management and the functioning of the interbank market, bringing market rates closer to the CBR’s main policy rate (repo). As far as the new refinancing instrument is intended to substitute bank funding via the existing repo facility, it may free up marketable collateral and strengthen monetary transmission. In staff’s view, it should not be used to expand the total volume of CBR funding support to banks, which would be tantamount to unwarranted quantitative easing. The CBR should ensure that: (1) eligible collateral is well-specified and appropriately discounted for risk; (2) recipient banks have adequate risk and liquidity management practices in place; and (3) there are no underlying solvency concerns with banks utilizing the facility.  31. The CBR should not change its inflation targets for 2014-15, but a point target with wider bands is justified. Staff cautioned that a weakening of already announced targets —such as that made last year for 2012/13—would be detrimental to credibility. However, the wider band (than the current 1 pp) proposed by the CBR would be appropriate in Russia due to still high inflation volatility, and the switch to a point target could facilitate communication. It will be important that the inflation targets announced for the 2016 to 2018 period do not exceed 4.5 percent, the center of the target band already announced for 2014 and 2015. The medium-term monetary policy guidelines should also clarify whether the inflation target for 2016 to 2018 will be another step in a disinflation path leading subsequently to a lower long-run target or whether it will be the long-run target itself. Authorities’ Views 32. The authorities shared staff’s concerns about inflation pressures and confirmed their commitment to formally adopt IT by end-2014. They specifically pointed to the potential negative impact on economic agents’ expectations should inflation remain above the target range for a prolonged period of time. However, the CBR maintained that the observed pace of inflation was mainly explained by food prices and regulated tariffs. It viewed the current monetary policy stance, combined with lower planned utility price hikes and the expected absence of adverse food prices shocks, as sufficient to bring the rate of inflation within the targeted range by September 2013 and later to within the 2014 target range. The authorities expect that this trajectory will provide scope for lower policy rates, although they noted that any policy rate decision will have to take into account other relevant indicators such as capacity utilization, unemployment, and credit growth. Regarding the CBR’s announced plan to move from an inflation target range to a point target with a wider tolerance band, some officials expressed concerns about potential adverse effects of a wider band on inflation expectations. Other officials argued that a target inflation Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicRUSSIAN FEDERATION     CORRECTED: 9/13/13 22 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND corridor of one percentage point was too narrow for Russia given its volatile headline inflation—with a high share of food and utility tariffs in the CPI basket—and susceptibility to real shocks. They stressed that frequently missing a narrow inflation corridor would be more damaging than switching to a point target with a wider tolerance band. The authorities reiterated their commitment to completing preparations for and adopting formal IT by end-2014, including greater exchange rate flexibility. The CBR stated that the main goal of the new one-year facility is to improve liquidity management and the functioning of the interbank market, and to strengthen the transmission mechanism. C.   Financial Sector: Contain Risks, Strengthen Intermediation 33. Additional measures may be needed to limit vulnerabilities from rapid retail credit growth. Credit growth has reduced capital and liquidity cushions; the quality of the retail loan portfolio is worsening; and the debt burden is increasing and high by international comparison. In this context, the CBR’s recent tightening of capitalization and provisioning requirements is welcome. Lending growth should be closely monitored, and further action taken as needed.  34. The recently adopted amendments to the Banking Law are welcome, and remaining FSAP recommendations should be adopted swiftly. The latter includes formally establishing the leading role of the CBR in macro prudential policy, introducing a unified administration regime for all banks, and restricting open bank assistance by the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) to systemic situations. In addition, staff recommended maintaining and enhancing the independence of the CBR, including through empowering it to issue regulations on nonbanks; and legislation facilitating the collection and dissemination of borrower information by credit bureaus. Staff also suggested considering further increasing risk weights and provisions for unsecured lending as needed and formally introducing ceilings on debt-service-to-income ratios for  household lending and loan-to-value ratios for housing and car loans to limit household debt burdens.  35. Basel III should be adopted without delay, while IRB should only be implemented only when both banks and supervisors are ready. The mission supported plans to introduce new capital requirements exceeding Basel III minimum requirements (e.g., 5.5 percent core capital vs. 4.5 percent under Basel III),  given: (i) GDP volatility; (ii) weak creditor rights; and (iii) difficulties in identifying nonperforming assets and provisioning practices. Staff urged the CBR to resist calls to advance implementation of the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach before appropriate supervisory and bank-level internal procedures and controls are in place—as this could result in an undue reduction of risk-weighted assets and undermine the solvency buffers and resilience of the banking sector to shocks. Staff recommended: (1) implementing the IRB framework with at least a 1214161820222412141618202224Jan-10Dec-10Nov-11Oct-12Ratio of Household Debt to Annual IncomeSources: Rosstat;and the Central Bank of Russia.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicCORRECTED: 9/13/13 RUSSIAN FEDERATION INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 35  Figure 8.
