Introduction The discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation with Malawi were held in Lilongwe, Blantyre, and Zomba during February 13.March 1, 1995. 1/ The Malawi representatives included Hon. Aleke K. Banda,, Minister of Finance and of Economic Planning and Development; Dr. M. Chikaonda, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM); Mr. R. Kavinya, Secretary to the Treasury; other senior officials; and representatives of the private sector. Some members of the mission were received by President Muluzi; they also met with the Economic Committee of the Cabinet, which comprises several ministers. The last Article IV consultation (SM/94/33) and Article XIV consulta- tion (EBS/94/207) with Malawi were concluded by the Executive Board on March 28, 1994 and November 16, 1994, respectively. Directors welcomed efforts by the authorities to strengthen their adjustment policies. They noted the authorities' intention, and urged expedited action, to use technical assis- tance from the Fund to address recent significant weakening in the revenue performance and the concurrent deterioration in expenditure control that had contributed to the Government's financial difficulties. Directors also wel- comed the introduction of a market-based exchange system, the sharp reduc- tion in exchange and trade restrictions, and the intention to eliminate the remaining restrictions on current transactions. It was noted that the sta- bility of the exchange rate under the new system would be critically depen- dent on the maintenance of appropriate macroeconomic policies. In this regard, Directors emphasized the importance of rapidly reducing inflationary pressures, which would, inter alia, permit a restrained wage policy. Direc- tors also urged the authorities to implement key structural reforms, which were considered critical to Malawi's future viability and social stability. Malawi has made extensive use of Fund resources and facilities, includ- ing the additional (fourth) annual ESAF arrangement, whose review (EBS/94/41 and Supplement 1) was completed by the Executive Board on March 28, 1994. On November 16, 1994, the Executive Board approved an eight-month (November 1994.June 1995) stand-by arrangement, in an amount equivalent to SDR 15 million (29.5 percent of quota). The first purchase of SDR 12.725 million under the arrangement was made on November 21, 1994. Because the program is off track owing to significant shortfalls in implementation, the authorities do not intend to make further purchases under the stand-by arrangement. As of end-March 1995, Malawi's outstanding use of Fund resources was SDR 74.11 million (145.6 percent of quota), of which SDR 61.38 million (120.6 percent of quota) was in respect of ESAF resources. 1/ The mission comprised Messrs. R.C. Williams (head), R. Kibuka, P. Wade (all AFR), R. Jayatissa (PDR), V. Santiprabhob (EP-AFR). and A. Mahar (assistant-AFR). Messrs. G. Tidrick, H. Schafer, and A. Ahsan of the World Bank also participated in the discussions.

Summaries of Malawi's relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are presented in Appendices II and III, respectively. On the political front, the parliamentary stalemate resulting from the democratic elections in May 1994 was resolved in September, when President Muluzi's minority United Democratic Front formed a coalition (holding a 65.vote parliamentary majority) with the Alliance for Democracy, whose leader, Mr. Chihana, was sworn in as second Vice President on December 23, 1994. II. BackEround Subsequent to the successful implementation of the three-year ESAF pro- gram through early 1991, Malawi suffered from a severe drought (1991/92), a cut-off of all nonhumanitarian balance of payments support in 1992/93 owing to donors' concern with governance, and a continued deterioration in the terms of trade. The resultant major economic downturn in 1992 was followed by a strong weather-related recovery in 1993 (Chart 1, and Appendix I, Table 1). Early in that year, the authorities formulated with staff assis- tance a strengthened macroeconomic framework for 1993/94, and on that basis the Fund's Executive Board granted the third extension of the commitment period for the additional annual arrangement under the ESAF to end-March 1994 (EBS/93/109). Under that framework, the fiscal deficit (including grants) was reduced from 12.1 percent of GDP in 1992/93 (April/March) to 5.4 percent. This contributed to a sharp decline in the growth of "et domestic assets, the halving of the rate of inflation to 18 percent at end- 1993, and achievement of a" overall balance of payments surplus of 2.2 per- cent of GDP (Table 1, and Appendix I. Tables 2 and 3). Gross reserves of the banking system reached the equivalent of 1.6 months of imports, while the debt service ratio increased only marginally to 25 percent (Chart 2, and Appendix I, Table 4). Malawi's new leaders assumed power in late May 1994 in a climate of sagging confidence, as they inherited a" economy faced with fragile internal and external balances, high and rising unemployment, and the effects of the severe drought during the 1993/94 crop season. Fiscal execution had weak- ened substantially in the first quarter of 1994/95 (April-June) as a result of massive election-related expenditure overruns (Chart 3). During that quarter, the stock of "et credit to the Government from the banking system more than doubled (reaching the equivalent of 42 percent of the beginning- period money stock), adding substantially to pre-existing excess liquidity, which, together with the emerging impact of the drought on food prices and the depreciation of the exchange rate, led to a" acceleration of inflation in September to about 32 percent on a" annual basis (Chart 4). The restive trade unions made strong wage demands, culminating in severe labor unrest, and eventually government salaries were raised from 5 percent to 25 percent effective October 1, 1994.

A market-based exchange system, largely free of current account re- strictions and official exchange surrender requirements, had been introduced in February 1994. In the initial period, the kwacha depreciated sharply, reflecting in part the realignment toward a rate closer to that dictated by market fundamentals. Although the depreciation was modest during the season for tobacco exports (accounting for 70 percent of total exports), the pres- sure on the kwacha continued as a result of the uncertainties associated with the new Government's policies, the growing fiscal imbalances, the wage concessions XI-ass the economy, and the accumulation of foreign exchange in deposit accounts by some large corporations that reduced the supply of foreign exchange to the market. From the floating of the kwacha in early February to end-August 1994, the currency depreciated (in domestic currency terms) by 66 percent against the U.S. dollar. With the winding down of the tobacco auction season, and with significant, if temporary, delays in the disbursement of some donor funds, the exchange rate came under heavy specu- lative attack in late September and October. HOWeVer, with strengthened monetary measures and an improving fiscal situation under the Fund-assisted program, and in anticipation of consequent stronger donor support, the exchange rate stabilized from early December. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 50 percent during the 12 months ended October 1994 (Chart 5). I/ III. Performance Under the 1994/95 Stand-By Arranvement Against this background, the program supported by the stand-by arrange- ment, for which discussions began in mid-1994, aimed to: (a) limit the decline in real GDP during 1994 to 9.3 percent; (b) reduce inflation to some 26 percent by end-1994/95; and (c) contain the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers and drought-related imports) in 1994 at about 13.7 percent of GDP. The program envisaged very substantial fiscal contraction in the second half of 1994/95 in order to hold the level of the deficit (including grants, but excluding drought operations) to 4.1 percent of GDP for the year as a whole. 2/ The resulting substantial planned net repayment by the Government to the banking system of MK 901 million (equiva- lent to 53 percent of the beginning-period money stock) in the period September 1994 to March 1995 was expected to contribute to a deceleration in the growth of broad money to 33 percent by March 1995 from an estimated 45 percent in September 1994, notwithstanding a strong increase in private 1/ For the 12-month period ending December 1994, the real effective ex- change rate had depreciated by 55 percent. Z?/ A major input in this regard, was a set of recommendations of the FAD technical assistance mission (October-November 1994) to introduce strict cash rationing and reduce the "umber of budget accounts held at the central bank.

Complementary reforms included, as structural benchmarks, elimination of a negative list of 11 items still subject to prior foreign exchange approval by the RBM, and introduction of a foreign exchange interbank market (both comprising per- formance criteria); completion of an action plan to restructure Air Malawi; and maintenance of positive real interest rates, inter alia, through improved open market operations. The program included several prior actions designed to strengthen fi- nancial adjustment comprising: (a) approval of a supplementary budget for 1994/95, in November 1994, incorporating inter alia an initial 67 percent increase in the domestic price of petrol. Petroleum product prices were to be raised to import parity levels before end-December 1994; 1/ (b) revenue measures yielding an estimated 1.1 percent of GDP; (c) a revised, cash- related expenditure control system introduced with effect from November 1, 1994; (d) an increase in the rediscount rate from 25 percent to 30 percent in October; (e) mopping up of excess liquidity by the RBM through treasury bill sales, which between August and November amounted to MK 512 million (25 percent of broad money stock); and (f) an increase in the cash and liquidity reserve requirements of commercial banks from 20 percent to 35 percent. 2/ The growth objective for 1994 was not achieved because of a much more severe drought than envisaged, 2/ and this was also one of the factors undermining attainment of the inflation objective. Real GDP is estimated to have declined by 12.4 percent. The greater-than-foreseen depreciation of the kwacha, with larger-than-expected price increase of petroleum products also contributed significantly to an acceleration of inflation to 66 percent at end-1994 compared with a target of 37 percent. As indicated below, the continued weakness in fiscal execution was another important factor in overshooting the inflation objective. The sharp increase (177 percent) in the minimum maize producer price announced in January 1995.-subsequently moderated--added significantly to inflation expectations early in 1995. $/ 1/ In the event, the second round of price increases, which eliminated all subsidies, became effective January 5, 1995, for petrol (27.5 percent), diesel (85.3 percent), and kerosene (131 percent). 2/ These additional 15 percentage points could be satisfied with holdings of treasury bills. 3/ In addition to the drought that- affected the 1993/94 growing season, rains that normally begin in November had largely failed by mid-December 1994. At the time, production estimates for the 1994/95 growing season indicated a maize (staple food) import requirement of 0.8-1.0 million metric tons ( and domestic prices for maize began a steep increase. In the event, Malawi has recorded good rains since late December, and maize import re- quirements have been reduced to about 300,000 metric tons. h/ The minimum producer price was increased from MK 0.81 per kilogram to MK 2.25 in early January 1995, but the increase was moderated in early April to a range of MK 1.25.MK 2.25 per kilogram.

The envisaged improvements in tax and customs administration and. in particular, expenditure monitoring and control, mainly the cash budget, did not fully materialize. 0" the revenue side, customs receipts for 1994/95 are now estimated at MK 222 million below the program target reflecting weaknesses in accounting fully for dutiable imports and their proper valuation, as well as lower-than-forecast imports. Expenditure overruns occurred across almost the entire range of ministries, but espe- cially in Education (associated with the free primary school education progr=*) , Health, Agriculture, and Water and Irrigation, notwithstanding the supplementary budget approved in November to regularize earlier overruns and provide for more realistic allocations. Sizable unbudgeted expenditures also continued to be charged to the budget under unclassified expenditure as controls remained ineffective, compounded by lack of timely reporting by spending units. The hiring of new teachers reached 22,000, well above the level incorporated in the supplementary budget, and for which the additional salaries, a110wa*ces, and other expenses amounted to upward of MK 100 mil- lion. For 1994/95 as a whole, recurrent expenditure (including unclassified items) is likely to exceed the level established in the supplementary budget by at least MK 850 million. With significant revenue shortfalls and massive expenditure overruns, the budget deficit (after grants, but excluding drought operations) is likely to reach 9.7 percent of GDP for 1994/95, more than double the program target of 4.1 percent. Thus, the December 1994 program performance crite- rion for net credit to the Government by the banking system was exceeded by about MK 550 million lJ (Appendix I, Table 5). The net increase in govern- ment debt to the banking system is projected to be about MK 260 million in 1994/95 against a program target of a net reduction of MK 195 million, this difference being equivalent to almost 30 percent of broad money at the beginning of the period. It should be noted nevertheless that in absolute terms, overall fiscal performance strengthened considerably in comparison with the first quarter of the fiscal year. For the nine months July 1994. March 1995, a reduction in government debt to the banking system of over MK 400 million, or about 3 percent of GDP is projected. Despite the aggressive efforts by the RBM to mop up excess liquidity and increase interest rates--the discount rate was increased in stages from 25 percent in September to 40 percent in December, and the go-day treasury bill rate rose to 41 percent--net domestic assets of the banking system exceeded the program target. Accordingly, money supply is expected to grow by over 48 percent in 1994/95 rather than 33 percent as targeted (Appendix I, Table 2).

The net foreign assets of the banking system increased by SDR 17 million, compared with a programmed increase of SDR 33 million. Existing bans on imports and exports (except on maize for food security reasons) were lifted, and the items under import licensing were reduced from 30 to 19 in October 1994. The remaining restrictions on payments for current international transactions were not removed by end-December 1994 because of temporary technical problems. Some delays occurred in payments for external obligations of the Government; in addition, private sector delays in external payments have continued, although they have been significantly reduced to modest amounts. Despite early concerns, Malawi has apparently received good rains through March 1995, and a recovery in agriculture should be a major factor in the estimated real GDP growth of 12 percent and a deceleration in inflation to under 20 percent by end-1995. IV. Reuort on the Discussions 1. Backeround The 1995 Article IV discussions were conducted within the context of en assessment of performance under the stand-by arrangement and against the background of major economic and political reforms within Malawi, the southern African region, and a changing global trade environment. Despite the progress made since 1988 in implementing structural reforms, Malawi's economy remains fragile. It continues to depend on a few agricultural products and to be adversely affected by high external transport costs. Furthermore, production and distribution in the modern sectors are still dominated by a few large conglomerates whose economic power has tended to discourage competition. In the face of recurrent droughts, growth in real GDP has been erratic in recent years and has not on average kept pace with population growth, so that per capita income and consumption have stagnated et low levels, un- employment has increased, and access to key social services continues to rank among the lowest of the poorest countries (Appendix IV). Further impetus for change has come from the need to remain competitive in the face of extensive reforms in neighboring countries and the global surge in efforts to attract foreign investment. In the short run, Malawi is faced with a significantly weakened budget control, in the aftermath of a politi- cal transition, and an unfinished reform agenda, particularly the overdue fiscal structural reforms to bring government finances under control. Thus, the discussions focused on the urgent need to substantially strengthen the adjustment effort to stabilize the economy and refocus on the structural reforms to set the stage for resumption of sustained growth.

Fiscal policies Given the difficulties in implementing the supplementary budget for 1994/95, the authorities resolved to strengthen the tax effort and regain control over expenditures in order to achieve a sustainable budgetary balance. They were concerned about the declining ratio of revenue to GDP end concurred with the mission's view that this outcome reflected not only the recent external shocks to the economy but also a rise in the level of discretionary exemptions from, end evasion of, customs duties; reform in the tariff structure entailing a gradual reduction in the highest rate from 65 percent in 1992/93 to the current 40 percent; and a significant increase in tax arrears. In light of this, the authorities are committed to signifi- cantly broadening the tax base end continuing to improve tax administration to reverse the overall trend in revenue performance. The Government intends to advance its efforts to overhaul the revenue departments, particularly Customs end Excise, whose performance in 1994/95 was considerably below expectations. With technical assistance provided by the Fund and the United Nations Development Program, a strategy and a plan of action for the reform of customs administration, including a role to be played by a long-term advisor, have been prepared. At the same time, ex- perts from the United Kingdom have carried out an investigation of customs fraud, and the World Bank is assisting with writing a tender for a new pre- shipment inspection (PSI) contract. The reform program should get under way in April 1995, and will benefit from the posting of a long-term resident advisor from the Fund (who arrived in Malawi in early April) end customs experts from the United Kingdom. The initial phase of the reform, expected to be completed in about six months, will center on: the intensification of training programs in the areas of auditing, collection, management, and tax analysis; the moderniza- tion of tax administration procedures; and the initial work on computeriza- tion of all tax operations. Customs duty exemptions will be reviewed end scaled beck, while measures will be implemented to curtail fraud and eli- minate tax arrears. Revenue collection will also benefit from improved valuation procedures: already a number of imports (including petroleum products since October 1994) are valued at international prices using daily market exchange rates. Greeter use of PSIs would also assist in this regard. With respect to the surtax reform, a Fund technical assistance mission on the tax system and expenditure control visited Malawi in April 1994 and recommended broadening the coverage of the tax and its eventual transformation into a value-added tax (VAT). The authorities indicated broad agreement with the mission's report and will attempt to expedite the implementation of recommendations. The authorities acknowledged serious problems with expenditure manage- ment. The budgetary process had been eroded, principally because inadequate information end analysis preclude the preparation of realistic expenditure allocations. Expenditure control, which has been deteriorating over the pest several years, had been subjected to considerable political pressures Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public14 - during the transition, and was now at a critical juncture that required urgent action. The authorities cited, for instance, the issuance by financial controllers of government checks for unauthorized and unfunded expenditures through commercial banks. The mission was informed of, and encouraged, several proposals to strengthen the budgetary process, including more realistic expenditure allocations based on improved expenditure returns by the spending units. Financial regulations, including sanctions, would be updated and streamlined, as necessary, to provide greater incentive to financial controllers to undertake and report expenditures in accordance with budgetary authorization. Expenditure controls would be enhanced also by improvements in the cash allocation system and by a strengthening of the offices of the Accountant General and Auditor General. Effective March 1, 1995, a pilot project had been launched whereby commercial banks were holding some government accounts as agents of the RBM 1/ in monitoring and stopping the issuance of govern- ment checks that exceeded deposit balances; the project was extended to all the major spending units of Government beginning April 1, 1995. The Fund will be providing a long-term budget advisor who should help consolidate and extend ongoing reforms in this area. To provide for a constructive future wage policy and improve efficiency, the mission encouraged the authorities to accelerate the planning for major reforms in the size and structure of government organization and in the civil service. In this regard, the mission urged the authorities to complete the civil service census now under way as soon as possible, and to formulate in 1995/96 a specific plan and timetable for a review of government functions and civil service rationalization. The budget for 1995/96, which was presented to Parliament on March 24. 1995, was broadly within the framework on which understandings were reached with the mission. It provides for substantial adjustment, with measures estimated at 6 percent of GDP, to bring the deficit (after grants, but ex- cluding drought operations), down sharply. to 3.6 percent of GDP, with significant net government repayment to the domestic banking system, Grants amount to 9.3 percent of GDP and revenue to 20.4 percent of GDP, up from 17.3 percent in 1994/95. Tax revenues incorporate the following: an increase in corporate income tax rates from 35 percent to 38 percent: a drought levy on persona.1 income ranging from 1 percent at MK 6,000 to 3 percent for income above HK 36,000; a 10 percent temporary export tax on tea, sugar, and tobacco; introduction of a 5 percent levy on the pump price of fuel; tax increases on various items, including cars, perfume, and cane spirits; and increases in fees and charges, notably the land rent which went up to MK 50 per hectare from MK 36.50. The customs duty on textiles was reduced from 65 percent to 35 percent. 1/ The government deposits will comprise special deposits with a 100 per- cent reserve requirement and will not generate liquidity for the commercial banks. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public15 Preliminary analysis of total expenditure indicates a level of 35.2 percent of GDP, comprising recurrent expenditures (22.5 percent of GDP) and development expenditure (8.5 percent), with the balance allocated to drought-related operations. The share of the social sector in recurrent expenditure would grow to 40 percent (31.1 percent in 1994/95), reflecting mainly substantial increases for education and health. Policy measures include a 25 percent public sector wage increase retroactive to January 1, 1995. The authorities have explained that the somewhat higher and retro- active wage increase in the budget than discussed earlier with the staff will be partly paid for through the freeze in hiring to fill vacancies, retrenchment of temporary employees, and the inclusion of civil servants' housing benefits in the tax net. Moreover, additional revenue measures estimated at MK 252 million over and above those discussed during the mission, would in fact more than offset the excess wage bill cost providing for a stronger fiscal outturn, by about 0.9 percent of GDP. Other recurrent expenditures will be compressed to 10.2 percent of GDP, compared with 15.0 percent in 1994/95, but more in line with the levels in 1993/94 before the expenditure over-fun crisis of the past fiscal year. In early April, a comprehensive directive was issued to all controlling offi- cers severely restricting or prohibiting filling of new vacancies. temporary employment of people, purchases of new vehicles and hiring of vehicles from the private sector, personal use of government vehicles and services, and the undertaking of workshops and seminars. external travel, and hosting of international conferences. It is expected that the more realistic budgetary allocations, especially for nonwage noninterest expenditures, will be more likely to be respected because of the improved cash budgeting and monitoring system and measures to stop the issuance of checks that exceed deposits. Development expenditures have been targeted mainly at social sectors, whose share will increase to 59.2 percent of the total (41.5 percent in 1994/95). Education will account for 20.6 percent of the total, reflecting the ongoing effort to provide free primary education in Malawi. 3. Monetarv and credit policies The monetary authorities concurred that unless government finances were brought under control as a priority, it would be impossible to conduct mone- tary policy consistent with the growth and inflation objectives. Never- theless, they were determined to maintain a tight rein on monetary policy. Some of the recent reforms and developments had made it difficult to es- tablish monetary targets. The foreign currency deposits, which were intro- duced in February 1994, had played a role in the speculative behavior of their holders and had proved volatile, making it difficult to target mone- tary aggregates. Under the circumstances, the authorities had focused on monetary targets that excluded the foreign currency deposits, an approach Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public16 the mission considered appropriate at the present time. I/ The substan- tial adjustments in administered prices, in the most recent period, had obscured the monetary policy objectives, even though the authorities be- lieved that with the underlying level of inflation, the interest rate levels had not been inappropriate through late 1994. They added that the hroaden- ing of the maturity structure of treasury bills since October, when 30.day, hl-day, and 182.day hills were introduced, and the greater frequency of treasury hill auctions had provided greater flexibility in open market opera- tions. While welcoming these changes, the mission noted that there had been some delay in adjusting the discount rate to reflect a premium over the interest rates emerging from the money market. Indeed, there was scope for further tightening of monetary policy, if credibility in policies was to be maintained. While expressing concern about the higher interest costs to the Treasury, the authorities concurred on the need to increase the discount rate, and to consider a reduction in the 15 percent commercial bank liqui- dity reserve ratio (in terms of holdings of treasury hills) and instead increase the 20 percent cash reserve requirement until inflation abates. They also shared the concerns expressed by the mission about the implica- tions of the substantial increase in the minimum maize producer price for the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation's (ADMARC) credit requirement, especially to fulfil1 its function as crop buyer of last resort. 2/ The mission, in collaboration with the Bank staff, urged a sizable rollback of the minimum maize producer price. Given the importance of maize in the economy. moderation in the minimum price would have a less pronounced effect on maize consumer prices and would dampen an escalation in wage demands, and accordingly diminish inflation expectations. Besides, a lower minimum maize price would also result in scaled-back financing re- quirements for ADMARC; the authorities were already exploring ways to 1/ Foreign currency accounts are mainly deposits of export proceeds by a few large corporate entities and are held abroad by commercial banks, which treat them as trustee accounts. The RBM, on the other hand, record these as foreign assets of the hanks and foreign liabilities to the deposi- tars. De facto, the proceeds of such deposits do not augment the banks' lending base. Speculative behavior led to an early buildup in deposits contributing to pressures on the kwacha. The resulting sharp depreciation of the kwacha, which added significantly to acceleration in inflation, also resulted in significant growth in the value of these deposits in terms of kwacha. z/ In the past, ADMARC made sizable profits at the expense of small- holders and used its considerable resources to finance its operations with minimal recourse to bank credit (Appendix I, Table 6). Under the new mar- keting arrangements (see Section III. 4.1, particularly with the recovery from recurrent droughts, ADMARC's operations are likely to result in n sizable demand for hank credit. The magnitude of the credit requirement. however, exceeds the prudential limits on the few banks that operate in Malawi. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public, 17 accommodate the latter, including temporary lifting of prudential limits as well as access to external lines of credit. They also indicated an inten- tion to explore possibilities for ADMARC to sell securities in the domestic market. In conjunction with the 1995/96 budget, and effective April 1, the authorities raised the discount rate to 45 percent and the cash reserve requirement from 20 percent to 25 percent, while reducing the liquidity re- serve requirement from 15 percent to 10 percent. Access to the discount window was reduced from 10 percent of total deposits in any given month to 5 percent. With the benefit of significant net government repayment to the banking system, the growth in broad money is expected to he limited to 31 percent in 1995/96, even after allowing for an average growth in the private sector credit of 17.8 percent of the beginning period money stock, consistent with the expected economic recovery in 1995 (Appendix I, Table 23). Fund technical assistance, including the provision of a long- term expert in hank supervision has been beneficial to overall monetary policy, and the extension of this technical assistance is under review. 4. Exchange and trade system. and exchange rate oolicy The authorities indicated that after initial disorderliness, the liberalized foreign exchange market was working reasonably well, with the rate relatively stable since early December 1994. They added that the market would continue to be characterized by limited competition, given the high level of concentration of exporters and foreign exchange dealer banks. The mopping up of excess liquidity and the increase in the discount rate had played an important role in calming the market, while confidence and greater transparency had resulted from enforcement of prudential guidelines and the improved monitoring by the RBM to obtain daily market information on traded volumes and rates. The aut,horities indicated that they had issued guide- lines for brokers whom they expected to relicense soon (brokers' licenses were suspended in November 1994). The abolition of the remaining exchange surrender requirements namely for tobacco, tea, and sugar during the last half of 1994, and the February 1995 abolition of the negative list of the items that required prior foreign exchange approval of the RBM, had expanded the scope of the market. This development would be extended with the modification and simplification in the rules for conversion of foreign exchange earnings by exporters. Malawi no longer maintains any restrictions under Article XIV or Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. The mission urged the authorities to now accept the obligations of Article VIII. While welcoming the steady effort to develop the foreign exchange mar- ket, the staff representatives noted that so far. the trading desk of the RBM had not been active in sales to the market during the lean export season, and that the few interventions had been made directly to end users. It was hoped that the RBM wouLd refine its foreign exchange cash fLow pro- jections as a tool to guide the implementation of an intervention policy to target reserves and smoothen the seasonal variability of foreign exchange supply over the year. The authorities indicated that this approach was Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public18 desirable, explaining that they had not had adequate reserves to intervene regularly in the market, citing the delays in donor disbursements. The recent agreement to extend the service of a Fund long-term advisor, together with the authorities' continued reforms, should now expedite the intro- duction of the foreign exchange interhank market. The mission concurred with the authorities that the present level of the exchange rate was broadly appropriate. It would be important, however, to moderate inflation quickly and to avoid continued wage pressures in Malawi to maintain relative ex- change rate stability at a level that will safeguard the country's external competitiveness. The authorities confirmed their intention to continue with the external tariff reform, involving a further reduction in the maximum rate in 1995/96 to no more than 35 percent and in the average statutory rate to about 15 percent, while the number of rates have been reduced to five. These would be further simplified and reduced under the Cross-Border Initiative (CBI). The authorities agreed with the staff's concern about the revenue implications of the tariff reform, but stressed that the revenue measures incorporated in the 1995/96 budget would provide safeguards to the overall tax effort. The authorities were of the view that the CBI, designed to promote intra-regional trade and investment in eastern and southern Africa and the Indian Ocean, was off to a good start, and they welcomed the World Bank's and the European Union's recent approval of lending support to it. Malawi had completed the drafting and signing of the letter of CBI policies outlining a course of action to implement measures under the Initiative, a move that was welcomed by the mission. The mission also noted the further progress made with the elimination of the export and import bans, and urged the authorities to remove the remaining import and export licenses. It emphasized that the adoption of export taxes to support the 1995/96 fiscal adjustment should be considered temporary, with a view to reducing reliance on such taxes over time. The mission urged the authorities to eliminate delays in meeting public external debt service obligations that had emerged in the recent past. The authorities felt confident that they could be current in meeting these obligations in the coming tobacco export season. They noted that any delays in settling private sector import bills by the banks were not a result of governmental limitations or intervention on availability of foreign exchange to make payments for current transactions. They reiterated their commitment to continue with the current policy on external borrowing, limiting new loans exclusively to highly concessional bilateral and multilateral sources. Consistent with this approach, the debt service ratio is projected to continue at about 22 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services during 1995-2000, while the stock of external debt is projected to average about 172 percent of GDP. Overall, the authorities indicated that the understandings reached with the staff on a package of measures, which has now been broadly imple- mented, provided a strong basis for the restoration of confidence and the return to an appropriate macroeconomic environment. They indicated that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public19 - continued donor support for their adjustment r,ftort was critical. They also rmphasized that cooperation with the Fund--ic:luding the joint monitoring of, and therefore staff access to, monthly expenditure data--should prove productive in terms of demonstrated control on government finances, leading to timely discussions on a possible ESAF program. The latter would provide a much-needed medium-term framework to enhance growth and address pressing social problems. 5. Structural policies Malawi's continued commitment to structural reforms to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy and improve private sector incentives is underpinned by the progress that has been made in some areas over the past decade. 1/ Recently, controls on wholesale and retail sugar prices have been eliminated. The system of wholesale quota allocations has also been replaced by an open wholesale outlet distribution system. Effective in 1998, all restrictions on domestic trading of agricultural commodities have been lifted. This measure should significantly benefit smallholders, whose tobacco.2/ can now be sold directly on the auction floor, and whose crops can now be purchased by private traders in competition with ADMARC, which lost its trading monopoly, but remains the crop buyer of last resort. The Gov\?rnment remains committed to the principle of full cost recovery in agricultural input markets, and phased out the subsidy on fertilizer during 1994/95. Before the 1995/96 crop season, the Government will review the role of the Smallholder Farmer Fertilizer Revolving Fund of Malawi with a view to promote private sector participation in wholesaling and retailing of all types of fertilizer. Some progress has been made in recovering past loans to farmers, and the Government. with assistance from the World Bank, has established the Malawi Rural Finance Company to take over the role of lending operations to farmers. While the envisaged action plan to restruc- ture Air Malawi has not materialized, the Government remains committed to restructuring the parastatal to ensure that it improves its long-term financial viability. In the meantime, management has been given the freedom to adjust fares; domestic tariffs were increased in December 1994 and February 1995 by a cumulative 69 percent, and international fares by 15 per- cent in October, and are henceforth being quoted in U.S. dollars, to elimi- nate operating losses. A corporate plan has been prepared for 1995. Malawi Railways has been extensively restructured with assistance from the World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Government has reviewed and approved major adjustments in electricity and water tariffs, and petroleum products are now priced (in kwacha terms) and valued (for customs duty purposes) at prevailing international prices. The authorities 1/ Details on progress made between 1984 and 1993 are contained in SM/94/66. 3/15/94. 2/ Production quotas of burley tobacco allocated to smallholders have been increased.

Article IV consultations Malawi is on the standard 12-month Article IV'consultation cycle. The staff report for the 1993 Article IV consultation (SM/94/33) was discussed by the Executive Board on March 28, 1994 On November 16, 1994, the Executive Board concluded the 1994 Article XIV consultation .(EBS/94/207;10/26/94)~, and adopted the following decision: 1. The Fund takes this decision in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with Malawi. 2. Malawi maintains restrictions on the making of'payments and transfers for current international transactions in the form of a negative list in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, as well as a multiple currency practice, which is subject to approval under Article VIII, as described in EBS/94/207.

Since the Bank's first operation in Malawi in 1966, the Bank Executive Board has approved 68 IDA credits (US$1,342 million after cancellations) and 10 Bank loans (totaling US$lOS million). Two of the Bank loans were on third window terms. The total assistance (US$1,447 million; US$309 million of said funds is undisbursed) is distributed as follows: 25 percent for agriculture; 18 percent for structural and sectoral adjustment; 11 percent for infrastructure and water; 12 percent for education; 10 percent for energy; 5 percent for health, and the balance for development finance, technical assistance, industry, urban housing, and institutional development. 2. In Fy93 and FY94, the following credits were approved: Rural Financial Services Project (US$25 million); Agricultural Services Project (USS45.8 million); and the Second Institutional Development Project (USS22.6 mil- lion). To date in FY95, the Bank's Board approved a supplement to the Entrepreneurship Development and Drought Recovery Program (US$40 million). 3. IFC's equity participation and lending commitments total US$33 million (gross) and includes these seven investments: textiles, sugar. tourism, ethanol, plywood, a development finance corporation, and a leasing finance corporation. All credits are fully disbursed. The Bank's assistance strategy supports policy reform in areas of concern to IFC, thus aiding IFC's active search for investment opportunities in Malawi. A possible area for future IFC involvement is the creation of a unit trust fund broadening the ownership base of the economy and enhancing domestic savings. 4. The activities of the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), under Bank supported operations (e.g., FSEDP and EDDRP), have been instrumental in developing the agenda for recent investment policy reforms. FIAS will continue to coordinate the expansion of opportunities for private sector development and investment with other arms of the Bank. In particular, FIAS' continued support will remain critical in consolidating the achieve- ments earned under the Investment Promotion Act and assisting the Malawi Investment Promotion Agency in becoming fully operational.

Real sector Real sector statistics covering the national accounts, prices and trade are in need of improvements. Priority areas include strengthening the national accounts on a production basis and in the quality and timeliness of detailed trade data. Work on the national accounts could focus not only on current GDP by economic activity (which is currently not available) but also on the development of quarterly national accounts and of investment data on a sectoral basis. Currently GDP by economic activity is calculated at 1978 prices and the total is then adjusted to derive GDP at current prices. GDP is being reported by expenditure category at current prices. The industrial production index could benefit from improvements in the coverage of and up- dating the weights (currently based on a 1984 survey) used in compiling the index. Although not comprehensive, the statistics for employment and wages are reasonably well covered but could be extended to include aggregate un- employment figures. With respect to prices, the compilation of the revised consumer price index based on a 1990 household survey, seems adequate, although it would be useful to elaborate on the methodology applied and the coverage of the index. Useful effort could be made to develop a producers' price index. Trade data are reported with a significant lag; e.g., imports by commodity groups are only given up to 1990 and direction of trade data up to 1989. Efforts could aim at improving the reliability, accuracy, and timeliness of the detailed trade data. b. Government finance Malawi has not reported new GFS data for the past two years, apparently because of the retirement in 1992 of both the official GFS correspondent and the GFS compiler. Revised data were reported in 1993 but much of it was not published because of inconsistencies. Both the new compiler and the person responsible for checking the work of the compiler recently participated in GFS methodology courses at headquarters. Discussions were held with the authorities in July 1994 to review the many inconsistencies in the revised data reported in 1993 and assurances were received that the outstanding problems would be addressed and that Malawi would recommence reporting in the near future. The authorities report revenue and expenditure aggregates every month to AFR. The revenue figures are relatively timely and accurate. On the other hand, the preliminary expenditure figures are typically subject to large revisions with a high share of unclassified expenditure. During the 1995 Article IV consultation mission, the authorities agreed to provide and have recently started submitting monthly detailed fiscal expenditure data by ministry to the Fund with one month's lag.

The latest available data for the accounts of the monetary authorities and the deposit money banks are for July 1994. Data for other banking institutions and nonbank financial institutions are through March 1994. The accuracy of the reported data needs to be assessed. There are negative asset and liability entries in the accounts of the Central Bank of Malawi. The movement in Other Items Net in the monetary survey has been erratic and needs to be explained. The separate reporting of new accounts arising from the recent implementation of financial sector reforms is also needed. The classification of individual financial institutions as deposit money banks, other banking institutions, and nonbank financial institutions needs to be reviewed, because of recent regulatory changes (adoption of wholesale banking) and the restructuring of the Post Office Savings Bank. The inclusion in the monetary statistics of data for the newly established banks needs to be confirmed. The authorities recently started submitting timely indicative estimates of net credit to Government from the banking system and treasury bill auc- tions on a biweekly basis. d. Interest rates The currentness of interest rate data reported for IFS needs improve- ment. The last interest rate data received by STA are for August 1994. With the major progress made in developing open market operations and the money market, the authorities have made considerable improvement in compil- ing timely data on interest rates and volume of traded government securi- ties. These data are now being submitted to AFR on a biweekly basis. e. Foreien Since the introduction of a market-based foreign exchange system, the Reserve Bank of Malawi has made considerable headway in collecting and compiling information on traded volumes and rates by various agents on a daily basis. This information is disseminated widely in Malawi and has been provided to the staff DR a fairly regular basis. 2. Technical assistance missions in statistics (1992-oresent) Since 1992 there has been no STA missions to Malawi. However, a multitopic STA mission covering the real sector, government finance, monetary and balance of payments statistics is scheduled to visit Malawi during the period April 26-May 11, 1995.
