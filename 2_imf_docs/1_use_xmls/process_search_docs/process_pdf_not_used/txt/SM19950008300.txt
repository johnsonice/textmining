Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Nepal were conducted in Kathmandu during January 17-31, 1995. The mission also held exploratory discussions with the new Government'on an economic program that could provide the basis for the resumption of Fund support under the current ESAF arrangement. L/ However, the mid-term review of the second year of the ESAF arrangement could not be completed. The Nepalese representatives included Finance Minister Adhikary; Governor Shrestha of the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB); Dr. Manandhar, Vice Chairman, and Dr. Khanal, Member, of the National Planning Commission; Mr. Bhattarai, Acting Finance Secretary; and other senior officials. 2/ The resignation of the Nepali Congress Government in July 1994 led to a long electoral campaign, which culminated in the formation of a minority government by the United Marxist-Leninist Party in early December. As a result of this hiatus, the implementation of most structural reforms envi- saged under the ESAF arrangement fell well behind schedule. The new Nepalese authorities have expressed their.desire to maintain close relations with the Fund and stressed their strong commitment to macroeconomic stabi- lity and structural reform. However, they are not yet in a position to spell out the specific elements of their policies in key areas, pending recommendations of especially constituted commissions expected around mid- year. Once specific policies are formulated, discussions on a program that could be supported by the Fund under the ESAF arrangement are tentatively scheduled to resume in Zune, in the context of preparations for the 1995/96 budget. I/ Nepal is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation with Nepal was concluded by the Executive Board on September 8, 1993, when Directors noted that the relatively comfortable foreign reserve position should permit the authorities to intensify their program of economic liberalization and structural reform. Nepal accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in June 1994, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. 1/ The Executive Board approved a three-year ESAF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 33.57 million (65 percent of quota) on October 5, 1992. The second annual arrangement (in an amount equivalent to SDR 11.19 million) was approved by the Board on April 15, 1994. 2/ The staff team consisted of Messrs. Collyns (head), Rajcoomar, and Leruth, Ms. Rose (all CTA), Mr. Oyama (PDR), Mr. Dunn (CTA-EP), and Ms. Frolia (AA-CTA). Ms. Cheong, Alternate Executive Director for Nepal, MS. HO (AsDB), and World Bank officials in Kathmandu also participated in some meetings. Mr. Pearson, resident representative, assisted the mission. J/ Nepal's fiscal year runs from July 16 to July 15.

Backeround Following the transition to democracy in mid-1991, the Nepalese Government launched a" ambitious adjustment and reform program. In the initial phases, major strides were made toward increasing the role of market forces in the economy: the pervasive system of industrial licensing requirements was dismantled; restrictions on private sector entry into areas reserved for the public sector were virtually eliminated; some public enterprises in the industrial sector were privatized; import tariffs were substantially lowered; exchange restrictions on current transactions were removed; and the foreign direct investment regime was liberalized. Progress was also made toward stabilizing the economy. Inflation was brought down from 21 percent in 1991/92 to 9 percent in 1992/93, in line with price developments in India during this period (Table 1). Interna- tional reserves remained comfortable, reflecting the strength of carpet and garment exports. There were, however, slippages in financial policies. The Government's domestic borrowing requirements rose to almost 3 percent of GDP, as a result of lower than expected revenues and external aid receipts (Chart 1). u The balance of payments surplus, together with heavy govern- ment borrowing, implied a significant acceleration of monetary growth. Economic performance in 1993/94 and the first half of 1994/95 was mixed. On the positive side, the authorities were able to re-establish control over financial policies, and inflation has remained in single digits. The domestic borrowing of the government was brought down to 1 percent of GDP in 1993/94, helped by a buoyant revenue performance. Broad money growth was lowered, reflecting the reduced government recourse to domestic bank credit and efforts by the NRB to sterilize the monetary impact of the continued buildup in international reserves, while credit to the private sector rose sharply. The quantitative performance criteria for July 1994 under the second annual ESAF arrangement were all met (Table 2). 2/ Preliminary indications are that fiscal and monetary policies remained broadly on track in the first six months of 1994/95 and that indicative benchmarks for January 1995 were observed except for the floor on "et international reserves. The fiscal situation continued to benefit from strong revenue growth, while the possible liquidity impact of a decline in international reserves was mitigated by banks' willingness to lower their holdings of excess reserves after the opening of a secondary market window for government securities at the NRB. 1/ Figures in relation to GDP have been revised substantially following the recent completion of a survey of Nepal's national accounts statistics, which indicates that GDP is approximately 15 percent higher in nominal terms than earlier estimated. 2/ The program ceiling on net domestic financing was adjusted upward to 1 l/2 percent of GDP, reflecting a shortfall in program aid (of NRs 490 million from the Asian Development Bank).

First, the external situation has looked less robust. While reierves continued to rise in 1993/94, the balance of payments registered a small deficit in the first half of 1994/95. Both the carpet and garment export industries have experienced serious structural difficulties. Carpet exports to Germany--the predominant market--have fallen sharply since early 1994 as a result of increasing market saturation, adverse publicity of child labor use, and increased competition from low-cost Chinese producers. Garment exports have been adversely affected by the raising of import quotas following completion of the Uruguay Round. Indian companies which had located part of their pro- duction in Nepal to take advantage of Nepalese quotas have already begun to shift back to lower cost Indian locations. At the same time, imports have increased rapidly, partly reflecting easier availability of private credit, pre-election stockpiling, and increased smuggling to India. lJ 2/ Second, recent developments in the real economy have underlined fundamental weaknesses in Nepal's economic structure: . Activity remains closely tied to an agricultural sector that is highly susceptible to climatic variation. GDP growth climbed to nearly 7 percent in 1993/94 as agriculture recovered from a poor monsoon in the previous year, despite extensive flood damage in July 1993. However, growth is expected to slow to less than 3 percent in 1994/95, mainly because of unfavorable climatic conditions. . The investment response to the reform program so far has been muted. There have been same new ventures in the service sectors recently opened to private activity--such as banking, telecommunications, and trans- portation--but little indication of significant new investments in the manufacturing sector. Foreign investors have shown some increased interest--as reflected in new approvals--but actual inflows remain minimal. . Notwithstanding heavy aid flows, Nepal's infrastructure and human capital remain poor. The lack of power continues to be a major constraint on industrial development. Commitment of multilateral and bilateral finance for the Arun III hydropower project continues to be delayed due to unresol- ved issues over the social and environmental impact of the project. Third, the pace of structural reform has slowed down considerably. To be sure, some advances were made, particularly in early 1994. Expenditure prioritization and fiscal management were improved; steps were taken toward strengthening tax administration; four enterprises were privatized; audits I/ A substantial share of the import increase in 1993/94 reflected the reclassification by the authorities of large amounts of gold and silver imports previously not identified separately. 2/ Increased smuggling activity would be consistent with the rise in "errors and omissions" observed in preliminary balance of payments data for the first half of 1994/95. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public6 - were started for the two large state-owned commercial banks; and a secondary market window for government securities was opened at the NRB. However, the reform program came to a virtual halt following the start of the long elec- toral campaign in July 1994. As a result, many of the structural benchmarks under the second annual ESAF arrangement for July 1994 and December 1994 were not observed (Table 3). Most importantly, progress in improving the institutional framework for fiscal management slowed, the privatization program fell far short of the target of privatizing 13 enterprises during 1994, and the sale of government shares in the Nepal Bank Limited was not effected. III. Policv Discussions The challenge facing the new Nepalese Government is to broaden and deepen the growth process while sustaining a stable macroeconomic environ- ment. The authorities have indicated that this objective will require a substantial reorientation of the reform agenda to give increased emphasis to employment generation, poverty alleviation, and rural development. Specially constituted commissions have been set up to conduct policy reviews in key areas--such as tax policy, trade policy, privatization and land reform. The reviews are expected to be completed by mid-1995. During the discussions, the authorities stressed their commitment to stabilization and market reform, although they were not in a position to spell out the details of the policies that will be pursued in many areas. However, a number of policy measures taken in the early months of office-- including higher spending allocations in the revised budget, increases in some import tariffs, and an across-the-board cost of living adjustment to wages--have raised concerns about whether financial discipline will be maintained and about the new Government's approach to structural reform. 1. Fiscal uolicy The revised budget for 1994/95, approved by Parliament in January 1995, added significantly to spending allocations in line with the new Govern- ment's priorities. In particular, a "grass roots" village development program was introduced, allocations for employment programs were raised, and civil servants' salaries were increased by a cost of living adjustment. Nevertheless, the revised budget retained the objective set in the July budget I/ of limiting net domestic financing of the deficit to NRs 1,050 million or about l/2 percent of GDP, slightly below the objective underlying the ESAF-supported program (Table 4). Revenue projections for the year were also raised substantially, although the budget did not introduce significant new tax measures. The authorities indicated that the higher budgeted reve- nues were justified by the buoyancy of collections in the first half of the L/ The July budget for 1994/95 was issued as an ordinance by the care- taker Government after Parliament had been dissolved.

Moreover, revenues would be bolstered by improved administration, including increased efforts to resolve tax disputes, and by higher contribu- tions to non-tax revenues from public enterprises. I/ The staff expressed concern that, unless corrective action were taken, the Government's net domestic borrowing could rise sharply in the second half of 1994/95, and the indicative ceiling for 1994/95 as a whole would be significantly exceeded. Although the revised revenue projections should be achievable in view of the strong performance in the first half of the year, the expenditures added in the December budget would quickly put pressure on the fiscal balance. Moreover, projected foreign cash disbursements appeared to be well in excess of realistic expectations. Increased domestic borrow- ing needs would have to be met mainly through the Government's overdraft from the NRB, given the budget limit on Treasury bill issues. This outcome would imply a more expansionary monetary program and put further pressure on the balance of payments position. The authorities responded that they were fully committed to meeting the net domestic borrowing target set in the budget. To this end, weekly moni- toring procedures were being established for major expenditure categories to ensure a more timely warning of potential fiscal slippage. A reformulation of the core expenditure program was being expedited to provide the basis for cuts in releases for non-priority expenditures should this prove necessary. It was also likely that actual spending on new initiatives would fall short of the budgeted amounts as funding would only be released in tranches and subject to satisfactory implementation. Finally, a "crash" program was being launched to accelerate donor reimbursements by focusing on the 25 largest projects (which account for about 95 percent of reimbursements due). For 1995/96, the authorities are planning new programs for improved education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation, which will raise public outlays further. If the Arun hydropower project proceeds, then additional domestic-financed spending of up to l/2 percent of GDP could arise depending on the pace of implementation, which should be fully covered by proceeds from higher electricity tariffs. 2/ The authorities recognize that the Government's domestic borrowing requirements would still need to be strictly contained to safeguard macroeconomic stability and ensure adequate resources for private investment. Thus, additional resource mobilization efforts would be needed. Tax policy changes would be based on the recommendations of a specially constituted commission that is now looking into all aspects of the tax system, with a mandate to report in advance of the preparations for the 1995/96 budget. Continued efforts are also planned to strengthen I/ An important source of higher contributions is expected to be the Nepal Electricity Authority, which has benefitted from a large increase in tariffs in early 1994 in anticipation of Arun-related expenditures that have yet to materialize.

(Policies on tax reform and budgetary management are reviewed in Section III.4 below.) 2. Monetary policy With a fixed exchange rate in place, domestic credit policy has been guided by targets set to be consistent with envisaged trends in money demand and movements in international reserves. I" 1993/94, the authorities used sales of securities to offset the expansionary impact of rising interna- tional reserves (Table 5). By contrast, during the first half of 1994/95, the balance of payments had a contractionary impact on the NRB balance sheet. Initially, the NRB sought to offset this effect by redeeming (rather than rolling over) its own securities as they matured and through purchases of Treasury bills at the new open market window: as a result, the indicative NDA ceiling for October 1994 was exceeded. However, it became apparent that banks were operating with much lower excess reserve holdings given their access to the new window. Against this background, and with government borrowing under control, the NRB was able to reduce NDA to a level signifi- cantly below the indicative benchmark for January 1995 while still leaving the banking system with adequate liquidity to support expansion of credit to the private sector. Short-term interest rates followed a rising trend over this period, broadly following rates in India. For the second half of 1994/95, the authorities have adopted a" indica- tive credit program aimed at stabilizing the external position. NDA expan- sion for the year as a whole would be held to the original increase envi- saged under the ESAF-supported program, implying significantly slower growth in broad money than initially projected. However, the program would still provide adequate room for expansion of private sector credit. Looking ahead to 1995/96, the authorities have formulated a preliminary monetary program on the assumptions that the balance of payments would be in modest surplus, while domestic financing of the fiscal deficit would remain strictly limited. NDA expansion would continue to be kept in line with the original macroeconomic framework under the ESAF-supported program. Given the uncertainties related to the external outlook and projections of mone- tary demand, this financial program will need to be re-evaluated in the context of preparations for the 1995/96 budget. In the discussions, the authorities observed that the opening of the secondary market window in July 1994 had increased the NRB's room for manewer in conducting monetary policy. The staff welcomed the increased use of indirect instruments of monetary control and emphasized that it would be important to monitor developments closely so as to avoid large and erratic swings in domestic credit conditions. A further step to strengthen the institutional framework for monetary policy would be to establish a formal limit on the Government's recourse to the NRB overdraft facility, with explicit authorizatio" for the NRB to issue additional Treasury bills should the limit be exceeded.

External policies After registering a deficit of $12 million in the first half of 1994/95. the balance of payments has begun to stabilize more recently. For the year as a whole, the payments position is expected to be broadly in balance (Table 6), implying end-year reserves equivalent to around four and a half months of next year's imports. This outcome would depend on finan- cial policies remaining generally on track and the performance of the export .sector being bolstered by efforts now underway to address its difficulties. Recent measures include lowering the export fee and providing Nepalese producers with greater flexibility to pay for imports of Indian inputs in dollars, thereby reducing their financing costs. Other steps, including introduction of certification requirements, are also being considered. The situation could. however, be adversely affected by rising wage costs. Shortly after the mission's departure, the Government announced that the cost of living adjustment provided in the budget to government employees would be extended to workers in the organized sector more generally, pending a full-scale review of the minimum wage. The authorities indicated that they remained committed to the objective of maintaining a fixed exchange rate vis-a-vis the Indian rupee, given the close economic and financial links between the two countries. i/ They noted that the present level of international reserves remained quite comfortable, and expressed concern that any shift in exchange rate policy could undermine confidence in economic stability and trigger inflationary pressures. If the external situation were to deteriorate further, they were prepared to tighten financial policies in order to defend the pegged rate. The staff agreed that the peg of the Nepalese currency against the Indian rupee had served the country well. Care would be needed not to undermine the sustainability of the peg by actions that would raise domestic costs. In particular, a substantial increase in the minimum wage at this time would lead to generalized cost pressures and erode export margins further at a critical time. For the longer term, continued efforts were needed to diversify the export base and encourage foreign investment. To a large extent, this process would depend on establishing an attractive environment for private activity, including adequate power and transporta- tion infrastructure and human resources. The authorities indicated that, while most restrictions on foreign investment had already been removed, consideration was now being given to elimination of the floor of NRs 20 million on the size of foreign investment, a restriction that may have impeded certain investments, particularly in the service sectors. In addition, L/ The Nepalese rupee has been effectively pegged to the Indian rupee since 1982. With India as the largest trading partner, the real effective exchange rate has remained virtually unchanged since unification of the exchange rate of the Nepalese rupee in February 1993 (Chart 2).

Structural reforms a. Tax reform Following substantial progress made in the previous two years in streamlining and simplifying the tax system, the budgets in 1994/95 did not introduce significant new initiatives. The authorities recognized that the positive impact of the earlier reforms on revenue collections had been amply demonstrated, notably for direct taxes, excise duties, and sales taxes. Nevertheless, further reforms have been delayed until the newly constituted Tax Commission has submitted its report. While not being in a position to discuss specific proposals, the authorities indicated that in principle they would like to increase the share of direct taxes, in particular by expanding the taxpayer base and improving tax administration. The mission emphasized the importance of continuing with plans to introduce a value-added tax (VAT) to replace the sales tax, given the benefits in terms of revenue elasticity and improved enforcement. Even though it was no longer technically feasible to introduce the VAT in the course of 1995/96, appropriate legislation should be included in the forthcoming budget and other preparatory work advanced to ensure its introduction at the beginning of 1996/97 at the latest, taking advantage of external technical assistance in this area. The authorities responded that they were looking into this option, but they wanted to be sure that concerns with possible distributional consequences and administrative difficulties would be adequately addressed. b. Expenditure management Some progress was made during 1993/94 to revamp the relatively weak fiscal management system in Nepal, particularly in the areas of public expenditure monitoring and control. These efforts were driven in part by the expected sizable increase in claims on public resources emanating from implementation of the Arun hydroelectric project, as well as the fiscal slippage in 1992/93. In particular, a "core" program of public expenditure was identified in the development budget: stricter procedures were intro- duced for releases for lower priority projects and for carry-over of expenditure from one year to the next; and a mid-year budget review was completed. In addition, a preliminary rolling three-year prioritized expenditure program was prepared and steps were taken toward more careful screening of projects financed fully by domestic resources. It was intended that these procedures would become regular features of the annual budgetary exercise. The staff noted that the absence of many of these procedures in 1994/95 was likely to undermine the efforts already made to strengthen the limited Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public15 institutional and administrative capacity related to the budgetary process. In particular, early corrective action to address possible fiscal overruns would be difficult without proper advance identification of lower priority projects. Accordingly, a thorough review of the three-year prioritized expenditure program should be undertaken before commencement of the budget- ary exercise for 1995/96. In addition, efforts currently being undertaken to accelerate donor reimbursements should be supplemented by the introduc- tion of an appropriate system to encourage timely submissions of reimburse- ment claims by project managers in the future, including appropriate sanctions for non-compliance. c. Public enterprise reform The discussions relating to public enterprise reform focused on the new Government's intentions regarding the privatization program and management of the remaining public enterprises. The previous Government had adopted an ambitious privatization program which targeted divestment of 51 out of 62 publicly owned units over the next few years. Privatization has already been completed for ten of these enterprises, albeit representing only about 3 percent of original government equity in non-financial public enterprises. Preparations for privatization of a number of others were already advanced. The authorities indicated that they were re-examining both the overall objectives of the privatization program and the detailed operational modali- ties. Although they were not opposed to privatization in principle and did not contemplate renationalization of already privatized enterprises, they believed that profitable and efficient enterprises owned by the Government should remain in the public sector. Decisions on unprofitable public units would be made only after completion of a rehabilitation program. A high- level privatization committee has been established to examir.e all aspects of the operations and activities of public enterprises and make recommendations relating to rehabilitation'and divestment. Many aspects of the privati- zation process were being reviewed, including how to ensure more transparent bidding procedures and how to provide adequate scope for participation by existing employees and Nepalese nationals. As a priority, the committee is currently examining the future of two large jute producing units with about 3,500 employees. A decision is anticipated within three months on the future of these two enterprises, which have registered chronic operating losses. The staff stressed that continuing with the privatization program was a key ingredient of the overall strategy of greater reliance on market mecha- nisms. The experience in other countries had amply demonstrated that companies tended to be more efficient and dynamic when under private rather than public ownership. The generally favorable experience of the Nepalese enterprises that had been privatized confirmed this point. While no doubt there was still room to improve the modalities of privatization, the Govern- ment should be careful not to reduce interest in the program by insisting on a high degree of dispersion of ownership. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public_ 16 - The authorities emphasized the importance of improving the operations of existing public enterprises. They were now in the process of seeking to place competent and professional managements in the 15 Largest enterprises. Pricing policy would also be reviewed to ensure the commercial orientation of several enterprises--notably the petroleum, food, and fertilizer enter- prises--where public subsidies were involved. The staff stressed the need to provide greater managerial autonomy to "core" enterprises remaining in the public sector, particularly in the areas of staffing, remuneration, and investment, in return for increased accountability and a hard budget constraint. d. Civil service reform Government employment in Nepal covers 92,000 approved positions for the civil service, about 100,000 teachers, and an undetermined number of per- sonnel in the police and armed forces. The administrative reforms under- taken in the past three years have aimed exclusively at civil service reform. Following some modest downsizing of the civil service in early 1993, the authorities are now focusing on the formulation of criteria for hiring, promotion, and performance assessment. A ceiling of 19,000 posi- tions has also been established on temporary employment which is mainly related to project implementation. The staff welcomed efforts to establish well-defined job descriptions for civil servants, and recommended that they be used as the basis for a new compensation policy aimed at improving incen- tives by Linking remuneration and performance more closely. e. Financial sector reform Following removal of several restrictions on their activities, private banks have succeeded in growing rapidly and account for an increasing share of financial intermediation. Nevertheless, the two large publicly owned commercial banks still account for over 70 percent of total deposits. The continued delays in the rehabilitation of these banks have contributed to high interest rate spreads and thus discouraged the investment response to the reform program. The weakness of these banks also has potentially damaging implications for the budgetary situation. The Government has initiated the audits of the accounts of the two banks, with the audit of the Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) completed for 1992/93 and that for the Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) scheduled to be completed shortly. The audits are expected to provide more up-to-date estimates of the budgetary implications of the restructuring and associated recapitalization program. Although special loan recovery committees have been established to address mainly the problem Loans of large borrowers, it appears that the stock of non- performing loans has continued to rise appreciably, particularly at the RBB. The strategy toward restructuring of these two banks is now being reviewed. The Privatization Committee will be considering divestment of government shares in NBL--in which the Government’s holding is 51 percent. Plans for restructuring the RBB--which has a considerably weaker balance sheet--were also being drawn up. but privatization was not being Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public_ 17 - contemplated. The staff again stressed that the long-standing structural problems of these banks--including significant overstaffing, an excessive wage bill, and failure to introduce modern banking techniques and widespread computerization--needed to be addressed on an urgent basis. f. Trade reform The far-reaching reforms introduced during the past four years have transformed Nepal's trade regime into a relatively open system characterized by a low average tariff, few rate bands, and moderate dispersion. The July 1994/95 budget advanced this process by eliminating the 60 percent tariff band. The current peak tariff rate of 110 percent is imposed on imports of only a few items (automobiles. tobacco, and alcoholic products). The normal maximum rate--applicable to most consumer goods--is now 40 percent. The revised L994/95 budget partially reqzarsed the process of trade liberalization by raising tariffs on a number of items, including soap, cotton goods, and bricks. The authorities explained that these adjustments were modest and limited in scope, and were aimed at protecting employment in sectors affected by rising imports. Particular problems had arisen because of undervaluation of imports, which had undermined the degree of effective protection provided. More generally, tariff policy was now being reviewed to determine whether further adjustments were warranted in order to support domestic industry and employment, to address distortions and anomalies which over time had Led to negative effective rates of protection for certain industries, and to ensure that rates on final goods were higher than those on imported intermediate goods and raw materials. The staff warned of the dangers of adopting a protectionist approach. Excessive protection would only help to raise domestic costs and undermine the competitiveness of exports, while increasing prices faced by consumers. Difficulties faced by local manufacturers related to deficiencies in the procedures for import valuation should be addressed directly, through full implementation of the ASYCUDA import valuation system. Further steps to improve the existing tariff system should include: lowering the maximum rate to 60 percent; elimination of the 30 percent band which applies to very few items; and removal of most exemptions which have increased the complexity of the current rate structure. g. Land reform Current Landholding and tenancy arrangements in Nepal contribute to Low investment and productivity growth in the agricultural sector. Factors dampening incentives to invest in iand include constraints imposed by effective "dual ownership" of Land by landholders and tenants, the nontrans- ferability of tenancy rights, fragmentation of landholdings, and underutili- zation of large holdings. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public18 - The Government has decided that major modifications in landholding and Land tenancy practices in Nepal are now essential in order to significantly improve agricultural productivity and increase equity in Land distribution. A Land Reform Commission was constituted in early 1995 to review current arrangements and make recommendations for achieving a higher sustainable growth rate in the agricultural sector. The Commission's mandate extends also to broader questions of appropriate input use and improving the rural infrastructure. The authorities plan to study carefully the programs under- take" elsewhere--in particular, South Korea and Taiwan Province of China--to identify successful approaches that could be applied in the Nepalese context, The staff agreed that land reform could make a significant contribution both to improving agricultural performance and making substantial inroads against poverty. Attention would need to be paid to the potential financial implications of compensating landholders whose land would be redistributed. While some external financial support could be available, substantial domestic resources would also be required. Accordingly, the design and scope of the program would need to take account of domestic funding constraints. IV. Medium-Term Outlook Nepal's medium-term prospects now Look somewhat less favorable than they did last year (EBS/94/65, 3/28/94). It is apparent that the earlier success of Nepal's export industries is not as solidly founded as was assumed. There has also been a considerable slowdown in market reforms, and further delays in the Arun hydro project. New initiatives to promote rural development and build up human capital are important for the long run but cannot be expected to yield quick returns. In this context, activity growth in Nepal over the next five years seems likely to be at the lower end of the expected range of 4.2-4.8 percent that was used in designing the ESAF- supported program. To assess the balance of payments outlook, a revised baseline scenario has been prepared assuming that fiscal and monetary policies continue to be tight and that the Government proceeds with a modified but still market- oriented reform program. It is also assumed that implementation of the Arun hydropower project commences in 1995/96. With continued growth of exports to India and efforts to diversify markets for carpets and garments, export growth is projected to be sustained at an average annual rate of around 7 l/2 percent in dollar terms over the next five years. Following the massive expansion in the past two years, non-aid import growth is expected to moderate to an average rate of around 9 l/2 percent per annum. Services receipts and net transfers are expected to perform favorably, reflecting more aggressive efforts to develop the country's vast tourism potential and liberalization of travel policy that will enable significantly more Nepalese nationals to work overseas. Official disbursements would be boosted by Arun-related inflows, while private capital and errors and omissions are Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - projected to increase moderately, partly reflecting continued unrecorded re- exports to India. Based on these assumptions, the external current account deficit would rise over the next two years to reach a peak of 11 percent of GDP in 1997/98 and then decline gradually over the rest of the decade, while the overall balance of payments would continue to register moderate surpluses (Table 7). Gross official foreign exchange re*erve* would decline gradually to the equivalent of about three months of next year's imports of goods and services by the end of the decade, compared with earlier projections of about three and a half months. Despite the scaling down of export prospects, the external debt service ratio is projected to remain low at about 6 l/2 percent of current account receipts, reflecting the highly concessional nature of Nepal's external debt. Two alternative scenarios have been prepared to illustrate the sensiti- vity to key assumptions. In the first scenario, it is assumed that the Arun project does not in fact proceed. As shown in Table 8, the direct impact on the overall balance of payments would be relatively small over the projec- tion period, which covers essentially the period of construction. 1/ Lower financing inflows would be broadly balanced by reduced payment* for imports of goods and services. However, over a longer time horizon, the difficult power situation that would endure in the absence of Arun would discourage investment and.hamper the development of Nepal's export base. The second scenario shows the implications of slower export growth, which could arise if the export sector takes longer than anticipated to recover from the present difficulties. To a degree, the impact of a weaker export performance on the balance of payments would be offset by slower import growth as real GDP growth would also be reduced. Nevertheless, international reserves could fall substantially below three months of imports, unless financial policies were tightened further. These projections confirm the staff's earlier assessment that Nepal remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks and that retaining a comfortable cushion of international reserves is essential. Nevertheless, with low-debt service indicators in all scenario*, the risks do look manageable, provided that the authorities persevere with prudent macroeconomic policies. In view of the country's excellent debt servicing record, and the relatively small share of total indebtedness accounted for by the Fund, the staff's assess- ment of Nepal's medium-term capacity to repay the Fund remains positive (Table 9). L/ Power generation from Arun would commence about eight years after start of construction.

Staff Appraisal Nepal has made important progress in recent years toward re- establishing macroeconomic stability and removing restrictions on the development of a market economy. A major achievement of the past year has been holding fiscal and monetary policies broadly in line with the ESAF- supported program. However, progress on the structural reform front has been slow, and important structural benchmarks have not been observed. Moreover, developments over the past year have also underlined fundamental weaknesses in the economic structure. The export base relies heavily on two products--carpets and garments--whose prospects are uncertain, while tourism has not yet fulfilled its potential. A large part of the population depends on agriculture, where productivity is low and output highly susceptible to climatic variations. Despite heavy aid flows, the physical infrastructure is weak while the 'human resource base suffers from low standards of education and healthcare. The new Government that took office in December 1994 thus faces formidable challenges. In its early months, it has launched wide-ranging reviews of economic policies, and announced important initiatives in areas such as land reform, health, and education. H0WWer, new spending programs included in the revised budget have generated uncertainties regarding whether the Government's domestic borrowing can be kept to the budgeted lWC?l. MOl-t?OVer, a number of initial steps--including increased tariffs on some products and a general cost of living adjustment--have raised concerns about the Government's commitment to structural reform. From the staff's perspective, a comprehensive program to lay the basis for Nepal to achieve sustained growth and progress toward poverty reduction should include four basic elements: (i) actions to ensure that fiscal and monetary policies are consistent with continued macroeconomic stability; (ii) steps to stabilize the external position; (iii) an intensification of the reform process to foster a more dynamic private sector: and (iv) concer- ted efforts to strengthen the efficiency of the public sector. Macroeconomic stability in Nepal depends fundamentally on sustained fiscal discipline. The immediate task should be implementation of a number of corrective measures--especially cutting back releases of non-core expen- ditures-to ensure that the Government's domestic borrowing ceiling for 1994/95 of l/2 percent of GDP is not exceeded. Determined efforts to accelerate donor reimbursement should also be pursued. In the context of preparations for the 1995/96 budget, it will be important to build on the efforts undertaken last year to improve expenditure control through reformu- lation of the rolling three-year expenditure program, improved mechanisms for monitoring developments and controlling expenditure releases, and ensuring timely submission of reimbursement claims by project manager*. On the revenue side, necessary legislative steps and the required administra- tive infrastructure should be completed to enable introduction of a full- fledged VAT at the beginning of 1996/97 at the latest.

The authorities will need to monitor developments closely and conduct operations in the primary and secondary markets to avoid large and erratic shifts in credit conditions. Mechanisms for monetary control would be further strengthened by formalizing regulations to limit central bank overdrafts to the Government, with automatic authorization for the NRB to issue additional Treasury bills should the limit be exceeded. The fixed peg against the Indian rupee has served Nepal well in provid- ing a framework for financial discipline that bolsters confidence and fos- ters close economic and financial links with India. The pegged exchange rate regime dictates, however, that tight financial conditions should be maintained in order to ensure a viable external position. Moreover, the authorities should be careful not to undermine the credibility of the exchange rate regime by actions that raise domestic co*t*. In this regard, the recent decision to require an across-the-board cost of living adjustment raises serious concern*. Fostering a strong private sector remains key for ensuring that Nepal can achieve dynamic economic growth. The benefits of liberalization are already being seen in new ventures, particularly in the services sector, and the benefits will multiply over time if properly nurtured. Three broad points deserve emphasis. First, it will be crucial to maintain, and indeed to extend, the progress toward an open tariff system with low rates. Further steps to provide protection for specific industries would introduce inefficiencies and undermine efforts to create a strong and competitive export sector. Second, it will be equally important to continue to encour- age a sound, competitive financial system, and to avoid placing additional constraints on private institution* that would reduce their incentives to mobilize savings and improve financial services. Third, land reform could provide a major impetus to rural development, bur. will need to be carefully designed to ensure a consensus for its implementation and to limit any resulting fiscal costs. It is also clear that a strong private sector needs to be supported by an efficient public sector focussed on its core objectives. The need to reduce costs of financial intermediation requires giving high priority to actions to restructure the major public sector banks, including through divestment of government shares in NBL. Land reform needs to be supported by more efficient provision of rural infrastructure. Industrial growth will depend on adequate power and a more educated, healthier labor force. Tourism can only meet its potential if appropriate efforts are made to improve the environment. Most public enterprises should be privatized, while the management of remaining units should be given autonomy to pursue well-specified social objectives. There is still room for further streamlining of the civil service, while the performance incentive structure needs to be improved.

It is understandable that the present Government needs time to review the issues and reach its own decisions. In certain areas. however, events are pressing: the Government must act quickly to sustain fiscal discipline and bolster the export sector. It will also be important that the next few months are used profitably to develop clear and well-formulated policies in areas such as tax reform, privatization, and trade policy that could provide the basis for swift and effective implemen- tation, thereby re-establishing the momentum of structural reform after the slippages that have occurred over the past year. Adequate progress in these areas would provide the necessary foundation for renewed Fund support under the current ESAF arrangement. Lack of timely and accurate data reporting in Nepal continues to hamper effective economic analysis and policy implementation. It is disappointing that only limited progress has been made over the past year to address specific problems in government finance statistics and in balance of pay- ments reporting. The authorities will need to intensify their efforts to improve the macroeconomic database. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Nepal be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchanee Rate Arraneement On June 1, 1983, Nepal introduced an arrangement under which its currency was pegged to e basket of currencies of major trading partners. On May 31, 1986. the authorities introduced a new currency basket. On July 2, 1991 the exchange rate was changed to NRs 1.65 per Indian rupee. On March 3, 1992, a dual exchange rate regime was introduced, with a market-determined rate for most current account transactions, and a more appreciated official rate for government transactions, a few selected imports, and some items that remained on the import license auction system. In February 1993, Nepal unified its exchange rate and eliminated the multiple currency practice associated with the dual exchange rate arrange- ment. At the same time, the exchange rate was changed to NRs 1.60 per Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - APPENDIX I Indian rupee. The import license auction was eliminated in July 1993. Currently, all merchandise imports (except for a few goods restricted for security or related reasons) are freely available through an open general license system, with foreign exchange provided through the banking system at the market exchange rate.

During FY 1994, three new operations (in higher education, population and family health, and road maintenance) were approved. No IBRD loans have been made .to Nepal, but the IFC has made four loan/equity investments totaling about $9 million. The bulk of IDA's project assistance has supported investments in agriculture and irrigation, as well as in infrastructure, including transport, energy, water supply, and telecommunications. The Bank's strategy is to help Nepal address its pervasive poverty through broad-based and sustainable economic .growth. including productive investments in agriculture, as well as physical and human infrastructure. Since poverty, population growth, and environmental degradation are integrally related in Nepal. poverty alleviation will also depend on a strong population program and improved access to social services. Thus, the Bank's assistance emphasizes population and human resources, including health and education, in addition to agriculture and infrastructure. The Bank will continue to take a leading role in the energy sector, but support for industry will be confined to fostering increased competition in the financial sector. In several key sectors, including the social sectors, transport, irrigation, and energy, the Bank is working with the Government and other donors on sectoral policy frameworks and investment plans which identify and support critical development activities. The Bank's dialogue with the, Government is currently focusingon public resource management issues. The Bank is complementing the Fund's work on fiscal reforms by assisting the Government in carrying out a public expenditure review. To further enhance the efficiency of public expenditures and improve service delivery, the Bank is also assisting the Government in its efforts to reform public administration. Technical assistance The World Bank has been providing technical assistance in energy planning, irrigation, industrial finance, cottage industry and municipal development, planning and program budgeting, and remote area access. principally through projects financed by the UNDP and executed by the Bank-- as well as through two technical assistance projects directly funded by IDA. Bank economic and sector missions visit Nepal regularly. A country memorandum is prepared every 18 months for distribution prior to the Paris Aid Group meeting chaired by the Bank. The last full report was distributed in March 1994. The next Aid Group Meeting is planned for late 1995/early 1996. The next economic report, which will focus on public expenditure reform issues, will be issued prior to this Meeting. 1/ Based on material provided by World Bank staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - APPENDIX II Structural Adiustment Credit (SAC1 The Bank has approved two SACS--L" FY 1987 and FY 1989.

Outstanding undisbursed funds are about 31 percent of the total net loan amount. The lending program for 1994 consisted of only the Irrigation Management Transfer Project in the amount of $12.9 million. The lending program for 1995 is projected at about $182 million (including $135 million for the Arun III Hydropower Project). For the period 1995-98, a total of $597 million has been tentatively programmed for about 18 projects.

This note identifies the major deficiencies in this respect. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all statistical problems. 1. Incomplete and conflicting data on external grants and loans make it difficult to anticipate trends in the availability of foreign financing. Data collected by the NRB monitor trends in cash disbursements and repay- ments, but exclude most commodity aid, while the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reporting is incomplete and often not timely. A comprehensive and consoli- dated system of reporting on disbursements (including commodity aid), pay- ments, and the stock of debt outstanding is needed. A fuller discussion of statistical issues relating to foreign aid reporting is presented in the accompanying background paper. 2. The balance of payments accounts consistently show large positive flows under errors and omissions, details of which are unavailable. Grants and loans figures provided by the authorities for the external accounts are not consistent with those provided for the fiscal accounts. 3. Data reported by the commercial banks and the NRB on commercial banks' reserve holdings with the NRB are subject to substantial discrepan- cies. Monetary data provided by the NRB are often revised with a substan- tial lag (up to 12 months), making timely program monitoring difficult. 4. While recent improvements have been made by correctly reclas- sifying some education and forestry expenditures as current expenditures, Nepal's budget data still do not provide an accurate division between current and capital spending. For example, substantial recurrent spending on wages, subsidies, and transfers continue to be included in the develop- ment budget and completed development projects are not systematically trans- ferred to the regular budget. As a result, the budget definitions of regular and development spending do not provide a good basis for analyzing trends in public savings and investment. 5. More timely data on revenue and expenditure developments are needed for effective fiscal control. A system of 'flash' reporting covering selected districts that account for the bulk of expenditure is being developed. At present, financial management information is provided only by the NRB, and this is at a very aggregated level. It is critical that finan- cial information currently collected by the Financial Comptroller General's Office be organized in a manner that will allow the MOF to monitor effec- tively actual expenditures and revenue collections and assessments during the course of a fiscal year. With release information that is readily available, this would allow the development of a cash management system. It would also be important for the authorities to continue to nominate suitable candidates to attend future GFS courses at the IMF Institute.

Consolidated accounts for the public enterprise sector are not compiled on a regular basis, and financial reporting by many individual enterprises is subject to long delays. Fund staff have been assisting the authorities in processing surveys of public enterprises; however, further assistance in survey design and processing may be needed. 7. A recently completed revision of national accounts statistics has resulted in a significant increase in GDP estimates. (by about 15 percent). However, there are still questions about the reliability of the new data. The revised figures are hampered by the lack of sufficient primary statis- tics in several areas. including the important agricultural sector. There is an urgent need for a survey of construction activities to be used as a benchmark for the estimates. Comprehensive surveys of modern sector output are conducted infrequently, with sample surveys used in intervening years. Updated surveys of agricultural land use also need to be incorporated in output estimates. 8. The current weights used for calculation of the CPI index are based on a household expenditure survey conducted in 1973/74. An updating of the weights based on a new survey should be undertaken as a matter of priority.
