Introduction The 1995 Article IV Consultation discussions were conducted in Bucharest during May 11-25, July 18-27, and October 25-31, 1995. u These discussions were combined with negotiations to complete the first program review under the 1994 stand-by arrangement (originally scheduled to be completed by February 1995). Against the background of the long delays in completing the review and the earlier policy slippages, the authorities are requesting that the stand-by arrangement be extended through March 1997. They are also requesting that the arrangement be augmented by 25 percent of quota, which is equivalent to the second drawing that could not be made under the Systemic Transformation Facility for lack of adequate safeguards for the use of Fund resources. A Letter of Intent requesting completion of the review and extension and augmentation of the stand-by arrangement has been circulated as EBS/95/216, 12/11/95. Meetings were held with the President, the Prime Minister, and the Ministers of State for Finance and for Reform, as well as the Governor of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) and senior officials. Discussions also took place with leading Parliamentarians; with the Ministers for Environment, Agriculture, Education, Health, Industry, Labor and Social Protection, and Trade; with the Chairman of the State Ownership Fund (SOF); with senior officials of the Agencies for Development, Privatization, and Restructuring, and of the Securities Exchange; with commercial bankers and operators of exchange bureaus; with academic economists; and with representatives of the labor unions. The Government comprises members of the Romanian Party of Social Democracy (PDSR), representatives of another minority party, and former officials. Until October 1995, the PDSR enjoyed a de facto majority in Parliament due to the support of three coalition partners. In October 1995, one of these parties left the coalition; the Government is now relying, as necessary, on informal understandings with other parties to secure passage of legislation ahead of the next elections. Local elections are due to be held by February 1996, and Presidential and Parliamentary elections by October 1996. On September 16, 1993, the Executive Board concluded the 1993 Article IV Consultation. Directors considered that an urgent and comprehensive attack on the underlying sources of inflation was required, combined with much stronger reliance on market forces to allocate resources I/ The teams included Messrs. Watson (head), Moghadam, and Liinnberg, Ms. Shoobridge and Ms. La Torre (Assistants) (all EUI), Mr. Chua and Ms. Weder (FAD), and Mr. Gajdeczka and Ms. Hyde (Assistant) (PDR). Mr. Greene and Mr. Hill (outgoing and incoming resident representatives in Bucharest) and Mr. Tardy (World Bank) assisted the mission. Mr. Wijnholds (Executive Director) and Mr. Mucibabici (OED) participated in certain discussions.

Directors stressed the importance'of assuring that interest rates were positive in real terms and that concessional credit programs were terminated. The maintenance of a tight monetary policy was considered to require much greater financial discipline among state-owned enterprises, which would also pave the way for a more differentiated incomes policy. Substantial fiscal retrenchment was strongly urged--including a pruning back of unproductive expenditures, such as remaining subsidies, and a retargeting of social support to the truly needy. On May 11, 1994, the Executive Board approved a 19-month stand-by arrangement for SDR 132.0 million (17.5 percent of quota), together with a first drawing of SDR 188.5 million (25.0 percent of quota) under the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF). On September 26, 1994, on a lapse- of-time basis, the Executive Board approved three waivers and a program modification to allow a second purchase under the SBA (SDR 18.9 million; 2.5 percent of quota). 1/ Failure to complete the first review under the stand-by arrangement prevented any further purchases under the stand-by arrangement as well as the second purchase originally envisaged under the STF. Over the past year, the Executive Board was regularly apprised of developments in Romania through the country matters briefings. Romania provides the Fund with relatively regular data covering the main macroeconomic areas (see Appendix IV) and publishes such data quite promptly. However, macroeconomic assessment is still hampered by the poor quality of data in some areas --particularly for the national accounts. Work is in hand to improve these data-- as also in the case of sectorization of the monetary accounts, and information on the quasi-fiscal deficit. Progress in this regard will be assessed integrally with the review of performance under program benchmarks. A short interim extension of the current stand-by arrangement, through January 24, 1996, was requested in EBS/95/202, 12/l/95. II. Background 1. Economic develonments Economic nerformance during 1994 was marked by a sharp improvement in confidence. There was a sustained increase in real money demand, reversing the accelerating decline of the previous four years (Chart 1). The exchange rate stabilized at a market-clearing level by the second quarter of 1994, following which substantial purchases were made to rebuild official reserves. Consumer price inflation declined from some 300 percent in 1993 to 62 percent during the 12 months to December 1994 (Chart 2 and Table 1). I-/ Waivers were granted for the nonobservance of the performance criteia on short-term external debt, the establishment of the direct dealing interbank foreign exchange market by June 30, 1994 and parliamentary passage of the Bankruptcy Law by August 15, 1994 (see EBS/94/181).

Thus, the progress in stabilization was accompanied by an acceleration of economic growth, which reached 4 percent in 1994. During 1994, recorded household savings grew rapidly (Chart 1). In the enterprise sector, inventory accumulation slowed and corporate savings benefitted from significant cost-cutting, particularly among medium and small firms. Productivity increased by some 10 percent in the industrial sector, while unemployment rose by 0.8 percentage points to 11 percent during the year. The shift in the savings/investment balance among households and enterp.rises was reflected in a narrowing of the external current account deficit from 4.7 percent of GDP in 1993 to 1.8 percent of GDP in 1994. The net international reserves (NIR) of the banking system increased from $288 million to $1,352 million, while gross foreign exchange reserves of the NBR rose from $44 million to US$596 million, or the equivalent of 1.1 months' imports, during the year. Romania also began the process of re-entry to international capital markets through a short-term bank credit. Developments in the first nine months of 1995, by contrast, present a more problematic picture, as the further acceleration in growth was accompanied by the reemergence of severe balance of payments pressures. GDP growth accelerated to some 5 percent, unemployment began to decline, and recorded consumer price inflation slowed to an annual rate of less than 30 percent (Chart 2 and Table 2). 1J Money demand increased, but at a more modest pace than in 1994. 2J The counterparts to monetary growth, however, became exclusively domestic, as bank credit expanded very rapidly and external reserves fell sharply. Real wages accelerated sharply in 1995, and by September were back to their 1992 level (Chart 2). While this boosted consumption, real household savings also continued to increase. By contrast, the financial position of the enterprise sector deteriorated significantly from early 1995. In some branches of industry--such as in textiles, furniture, and communications equipment- -this appears to have reflected a healthy recovery of investment, responding to higher exports and domestic sales; inventory levels in these branches remained well under control. More problematically, however, the negative shift in the financial position of the industrial sector also resulted from heavy stockpiling of oil and other imported raw materials, and a renewed increase of inventories in sectors such as chemicals and steel that are dominated by large state-owned enterprises. I/ These data somewhat understate underlying inflation, since during much of the period the exchange rate was too appreciated to clear the market. 2J The velocity of circulation of broad money remained substantially higher than in the central European economies. Velocity in the central European countries is in the 1 to 4 range (see background paper).

Policv oerformance The favorable initial results of the stabilization program reflected a forceful implementation of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. u The general government deficit in 1994 amounted to 1.0 percent of GDP--well below the initial target --as low-priority expenditures were blocked to offset revenue shortfalls and policy-related delays in external financing (Table 4). 3J Moreover, from late 1993, substantial interest and exchange rate distortions were eliminated: this triggered a recovery of real money demand, and sharply reduced quasi-fiscal transfers to state-owned enterprises through the financial system. The authorities ruled out any credit injection or "global compensation operation" to clear inter- enterprise arrears. Indeed, the creation of reserve money was kept under firm control until late in the year. However, already in the second half of 1994, serious slippage arose in structural policies under the SBA. In particular, the quasi-fiscal deficit in the enterprise sector was not addressed sufficiently forcefully to avoid excessive domestic pressures as the economy began to recover. By early 1995, very strong credit pressures emerged, and the authorities were unable to restrain the expansion of the NDA of the banking system to a pace consistent with a sustainable balance of payments position--leading to the run-down in reserves described above (Charts 3 and 4, and Table 5). It/ While the slippage in structural policies occurred across a broad front, from a macroeconomic standpoint the problems that directly jeopardized the stabilization program lay in three areas: 1/ Comparisons are with the same period a year previously. 2J Most quantitative performance criteria under the SBA were met at end- December, 1994 (Table 3). However, the performance criteria on short-term debt and government guarantees were breached: see Table 3 for details. 3J The original target was 2.5 percent of the then estimated GDP. k/ During the first nine months of 1995, NDA and domestic credit expanded at an average monthly rate of 5 percent, well above the average monthly inflation rate of 1.5 percent (Chart 3 and Table 5). Domestic leu- denominated credit increased at an average monthly rate of 4 percent, while the monthly growth in foreign currency credit was 7 percent (5 percent in dollar terms). These rates of growth substantially exceeded projections submitted by the authorities with a view to completing the program review.

From December 1994 until June 1995, and again from mid-October 1995, certain state-owned banks with a dominant market position, responding to official suasion, quoted the exchange rate at levels too appreciated to clear the interbank market. Shortages of exchange and the return of a sizable premium in the exchange bureau market (Chart 5), signalled the re- emergence of an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice, constituting a nonobservance of performance criteria under the SBA and posing a threat to the credibility of the adjustment program. u These developments in the exchange market tended to stimulate credit expansion. Enterprises with access to exchange and/or to foreign currency loans from banks appear to have stockpiled imported raw materials in anticipation of devaluation or worsening shortages of exchange. u 0 Lengthy delays with plans to slim down state-owned enterorises with large losses or arrears (a structural benchmark for the first program review), resulted in a partial reversal of the progress made in shrinking the quasi-fiscal deficit in 1994. The payments arrears of the core problem enterprises in steel and petrochemicals, which had declined slightly in real terms in 1994, resumed a dramatic pace of growth in early 1995--accompanying a renewed build-up in inventories (see background paper). 2/ 0 In late 1994, the Government launched a very large program of subsidized agricultural financing, involving directed credit by the NBR, which posed substantial dangers for the viability of the monetary control mechanism. Following discussions with staff, the net size of this credit package was, de facto, scaled back. However, by end-1994 more than two- thirds of NBR refinancing credit was directed to specific sectors--the bulk of it to agriculture (Chart 6 and Table 6). This seriously limited the NBR's room for manoeuver in tightening liquidity through the refinancing auction and, together with an unexpected drawdown of government balances, contributed to a temporary loss of control of reserve money at end-1994 (Chart 5). Again, in August 1995, strong pressures emerged for an expansion u During these episodes, rates between banks and enterprises were significantly more appreciated than interbank and bureau rates, and shortages of exchange emerged among private banks; there were sharp declines in interbank exchange dealings, and a very sharp rise in the bureau premium. In the second quarter of 1995, in particular, market reports and data indicate that the market among banks virtually ceased to function. u Moreover, the gradual and predictable depreciation of the exchange rate (a de facto "tablita") resulted in foreign currency lending rates becoming generally more attractive than domestic rates, undermining interest rate policy and encouraging credit expansion. w Plans were in hand to offset arrears of several thousand enterprises, but without an injection of reserve money; however, these proposals were shelved in early 1995 after discussions with Fund and Bank staff.

More generally, as regards the conduct of structural policy, there was slippage in implementing other institutional reforms covered by end-1994 structural benchmarks--measures that were designed to buttress at the systemic level the authorities' specific commitments to improve financial control among enterprises, and also to create conditions more hospitable to private sector development. u Thus, there were delays in privatization, in the establishment and entry into operation of the securities exchange and competition authority, and in the passage of the Competition and Bankruptcy Laws. 2J Purchases under the SBA were interrupted after September 1994 following slippages in structural benchmarks that were of crucial importance for sustained stabilization, nonobservance of performance criteria relating to the exchange system, and the need for policy adjustment to address the rapid expansion of credit and worsening of the balance of payments situation. The World Bank FESAL was also delayed. This was the setting in which policy discussions for the Article IV Consultation and program review took place during May-October, 1995. III. Policy Discussions The Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) of April 12, 1994 (EBS/94/87, Supplement 1) set out provisional macroeconomic objectives for 1995, together with a comprehensive program of structural reforms to underpin the sustainability of the stabilization program. This provided a framework for the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions as well as for negotiations on the first program review under the SBA. 1/ With a continuing deterioration of the current account, and declining exchange reserves, these discussions increasingly focused not only on regaining momentum in structural reforms but on the urgent need for macroeconomic policy measures to address the external imbalance. These discussions culminated in a 10 percent depreciation of the currency and the presentation of an appreciably more restrained budget for 1996 in late November 1995, which put the staff in a position to recommend completion of the review and the extension of the stand-by arrangement. The authorities' program for 1996 is designed to reduce consumer price inflation to less than 20 percent in the 12 months to December, to cut the A./ The private sector is estimated to account for 37 percent of GDP, but in manufacturing industry the share is only of the order of 12 percent. 2/' Passage of the Bankruptcy Law was originally covered by a performance criterion at end-July 1994, waived for the September 1994 purchase. 2/ References below (1) are to the letter of intent for the review, circulated in conjunction with this staff report as EBS/95/216,12/11/96.

The attainment of these objectives should prove compatible with economic growth on the order of 4 percent in 1996, and with a further increase in living standards. 1. Fiscal ~olicv Discussions on fiscal policy for 1995 and 1996 focused on four main issues: the level of budgetary revenues that could realistically be projected in light of experience in Romania and other countries; the scale and nature of restructuring expenditures that should be reflected in the budget; the extent to which expenditure blocking should credibly be relied upon as a technique to limit spending; and the credibility ex ante of policies to reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit. On this last point, there was agreement between the authorities and the staff that the key medium-term policy goal should be to cut back the quasi-fiscal deficit among state-owned enterprises, rather than to reduce priority budget expenditures. However, differences of view remained as to how far to assume success in advance in reducing the quasi-fiscal deficit when framing fiscal targets consistent with objectives for inflation and the balance of payments. The budeet for 1995, approved by Parliament in March, sought to limit the general government deficit to 2 percent of GDP, in conformity with the commitment in the April 1994 MEP. However, the budget did not allow for the fiscal impact of enterprise and financial reforms and, in the view of the staff, revenue were seriously overestimated. 1/ Subsequently, staff worked with the authorities toward agreement on a mid-year budget adjustment that would remedy these problems. With World Bank assistance, the impact of employee severance payments and tax losses from loan-loss provisioning was estimated at some 0.6 percent of GDP. 2J It was also agreed that agricultural subsidies on the order of 0.2 percent of GDP, previously furnished by the NBR, should be incorporated explicitly within the budget. On this basis, it was provisionally agreed that the 1995 deficit could amount to 2.5-3.2 percent of GDP depending on foreign financing. However, the governing coalition did not fully support this approach, and a revised I-J The authorities proposed heavy reliance on expenditure blocking powers to contain the deficit in the event of revenue shortfalls. While expenditure blocking was forcefully implemented in 1993 and 1994, the staff was critical of this practice as weakening the credibility--and ultimately the effectiveness--of fiscal restraint. 2J In addition, the staff concurred in a World Bank initiative to include in th.e budget conditional transfers to selected loss-making enterprises that are heavy energy consumers and have traditionally run arrears to the state- owned power companies: these transfers--amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP-- would be contingent on adjustment measures to be implemented by the energy consuming enterprises.

As regards the budpet for 1996, the authorities initially proposed a fiscal deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP. Staff took the position that a much smaller deficit was required to counter the risk of domestic imbalances de- railing the program--but indicated readiness to review the scope for an increase in the deficit if, by mid-1996, developments in the balance of payments were favorable and active structural reforms appeared to be reducing the quasi-fiscal deficit. In late October 1995, the authorities sent to Parliament a budget for 1996, which, in the staff's assessment, would still have resulted in a deficit of some 3.5 percent of GDP. This budget incorporated reform costs of about 1.1 percent of GDP. u Staff indicated that, given the excessive pressures on the balance of payments mainly resulting from the quasi-fiscal activites of large state enterprises, these fiscal projections for 1995 and 1996 did not provide a basis for completing the program review. Subsequently, however, as rapid credit expansion continued, and balance of payments pressures worsened, the authorities indicated that they were prepared to rein back spending within the framework of the 1995 budget, and to withdraw and resubmit the 1996 budget to Parliament, with a view to restoring their drawing rights under the stand-by arrangement. Thus, agreement was reached in November 1995 to limit the 1995 budget deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP (Table 4 and q 6), mainly through curtailing the potentially very substantial spending authorizations for the final quarter of the year. The authorities also re-submitted the 1996 budget to Parliament. Further expenditure cuts were made, amounting to 0.7 percent of GDP at the level of the consolidated general government (bearing mainly on net lending and capital spending by the special funds outside the central Government). Blocking provisions equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP were included in the revised budget to cover revenue and external financing risks. Provided these expenditure measures are fully implemented, the deficit of the consolidated general government in 1996 would be cut to about 2.2 percent of GDP (Table 4 and JI 7). u The staff considers that the fiscal effort implied by the full implementation of the 1996 budget, coupled with the recent depreciation of the currency, should underpin a significant strengthening in the external accounts. Moreover the staff judges that the manner in which the fiscal deficit is to be reduced, will not impair budgetary support for the reform process. The size of the deficit in 1996 would be re-examined at the time of the second program review (1 7) u Principally revenue losses from further commercial bank provisioning, and severance payments for employees laid off. 2J The authorities reiterated their commitment to take additional contingency measures, if necessary, to safeguard the deficit (9 7).

However, a countervailing concern lay in the projected deterioration of the social security funds in the coming years. The situation of the social security funds is therefore to be discussed in the context of the second program review (9 7). Staff also urged that, over the medium term, subsidies and transfers be cut back, both to reduce the deficit and to ease the tight constraints on non-wage spending on health and education (see background paper). The authorities agreed that these are desirable priorities, while noting that substantial indirect or implicit subsidies have already been eliminated--particularly through the shift to positive real interest rates. 2. Monetarv and'exchanee rate policy The authorities agreed that monetary policy should be the main nominal anchor of the stabilization program, with reserve money as the principal operating target of the NBR. IJ A tax-based incomes policy has played a supportive role as an anchor. However, it is intended that this, supportive role be increasingly taken over by actions to limit directly deficits in large state enterprises, allowing incomes in the rest of the economy to become more differentiated in response to market forces. 2J In light of the Government's concerns about rapid exchange rate depreciation, the authorities and the staff discussed under what circumstances it could be desirable to give greater explicit emphasis to the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. There was agreement that this could be advisable after a period of sound policy performance and further reserve accumulation--when also it should be clearer at what level the exchange rate could reasonably settle. In this context, the staff emphasized that the recent balance of payments performance suggested the need to ensure an adequate degree of international competitiveness, in which regard the appropriate functioning of the exchange market would have a most important role to play. Moreover, the staff noted that the critical problem with an exchange rate anchor at the present time is that the public credibility of fixing the rate has been repeatedly undermined by episodes in which its immobility signalled interference with the functioning of the market rather than the impact of tight financial policies. L/ In addition to indicative targets for reserve money, performance criteria continue to be set under the stand-by arrangement for the net domestic assets and the net international reserves of the banking system in order to protect the balance of payments, see 1 8. 2J The tax-based incomes policy has been moderately effective, in the staff's assessment; but it has been less successful, relatively, in some sectors of large state-owned enterprises (see background paper). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - Concerning objectives for monetary Dow, the authorities indicated that the MEP goal of cutting consumer price inflation to below 29 percent in 1995 remained realistic, and should be followed by a further reduction in inflation to below 20 percent in 1996 (9 4). Moreover, there was basic agreement between the authorities and the staff on conservative projections for the demand for money. Thus the rate of expansion of broad money is projected to decelerate to 30 percent in 1996 (from 52 percent in 1995) and the velocity of circulation of broad money to decrease by some 4.5 percent over the year. The central issue in discussions on monetary policy--given the slippage in structural reforms --was not the objective but the risks: the concern that strong credit demands from state-owned industry and the agricultural sector might again undermine the inflation and/or external targets of the program. As discussions continued, these concerns became a reality. In response, in October, the NBR substantially increased reserve requirements (see below) and began to increase interest rates (Table 7). The NBR auction interest rate was progressively raised from 45 percent per annum at end-September to 75 percent by end-November, and is beginning to affect market rates (Chart 5 and Table 7). Staff emphasized that interest rate policy would need to be conducted flexibly to help ensure effective monetary control. However, given the likely incidence of moral hazard and adverse selection, and the continuing high level of real interest rates (Table 7), a key issue for discussion during the consultation concerned additional reforms that could directly support monetary policy. lJ2J Measures in three areas were agreed to be essential to safeguard directly the conduct of monetary policy. First, the exchange system needed to be credible, implying an end to moral suasion, and measures to increase, competition in the exchange market. 3J Second, the NBR's ability to manage reserve money should be protected ex ante against future political pressures to extend agricultural financing. Third, in light of the rapid and potentially imprudent run-down in banks' liquid foreign exchange assets from early 1995, a market-related ratio should be introduced to ensure adequate prudential cover of banks' liquid foreign exchange liabilities. Between May and November 1995, actions were initiated by the authorities in each of these areas: IJ The strong demand for leu credit despite higher real interest rates suggests that many recipients were not sensitive to interest rates (i.e., that there was adverse credit selection in favor of problem enterprises), although there may also have been borrowing by fast growing sectors of the economy with high rates of return. u‘ As indicated above, analysis of monetary developments as an input to policy will be greatly strengthened by the development of sectoral monetary accounts. 3J Thus limiting the scope for a few state-owned banks to rig the market. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - l Measures were adopted to increase competition in the exchange market: licensing foreign banks as dealers; enforcing banks' observance of market-making commitments and exposure limits; permitting enterprises to open foreign exchange accounts at more than one bank; and, increasing disclosure of dealing rates. Moreover, following renewed segmentation in the exchange market in October 1995, the NBR intervened in the inter-bank market in mid-November, buying about US$lO million over two days; the main state-owned banks adjusted the rate at which they deal with their clients, resulting in a 10 percent depreciation of the reference rate in mid-November (9 16). lJ These developments brought the reference rate in line with the rates quoted on the dealing screens between the banks, and closer to bureau rates. It was agreed that a consultation under the arrangement would be triggered urgently by prima facie evidence of renewed problems (J[ 17). 2J a As regards agricultural financing, the authorities set limits on directed credit at the NBR (9 8); shifted all subsidies from the NBR to the budget (1 6); and sought to forestall an expansion of quasi-fiscal financing from banks by agreeing restructuring plans covering key loss-making livestock and cereal enterprises, in consultation with the World Bank (see below). 0 To arrest the drawdown in banks' liauid foreien exchanPe assets, which was resulting in a rapid expansion of credit, in October 1995 the NBR more than doubled reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits. 3J The NBR also committed to introducing, by December 1995, a binding prudential foreign exchange liquidity ratio (9 13). More broadly, to support the effectiveness of monetary policy and avoid the growth of quasi-fiscal liabilities in the banking system, it was agreed that measures were needed urgently to limit credit to state-owned enterprises with large losses or arrears, followed by actions to deal with the balance sheet problems in affected banks. 4J 3. Structural reforms Following a number of joint discussions with staff of the World Bank and the Fund, the authorities have put in place a program of actions to address the continuing problems in the enterprise sector, and in September 1995 they reached agreement with Bank staff on enterprise and lJ From end-December 1994 to end-November 1995 the exchange rate depreciated by 13.8 percent in real terms (Chart 5). u Also, the energy price adjustment formula under World Bank conditionality was amended to avoid the immediate triggering of a rise in heating costs in the winter by depreciation of the exchange rate. 3J‘ From 16 to 40 percent if paid in foreign currency and from 7.5 to 20 percent if paid in leu. 4J Two banks have been the main users of NBR credit, raising concerns about adverse selection in the refinancing auction.

From the point of view of macroeconomic policy, the key elements of this reform program are as follows: l Financial recovery clans were requested from the major problem enterprises, and these plans were approved by the World Bank by October 1995 in the context of the proposed FESAL. The macroeconomic "cap" on support for these enterprises was agreed jointly with Bank and Fund staff (9 11). 0 On the basis of these plans, negotiations were initiated between debtor enterprises and their creditors for a rescheduling or reduction of debt service oblizations--a negotiated and case-by-case approach to resolving the financial blockage caused by mounting arrears ((II 12). 1/ a As regards loan problems in the bankina sector, an approach was developed in joint discussions with World Bank and Fund staff, which involves establishing work-out units in banks to handle smaller debtors; strengthening of supervision; increasing collateralization of access to the NBR refinancing auction; and abstaining from recapitalization until banks are ready for privatization (see 9 13 and background paper). In addition, the now very large stock of foreign currency loans may be a source of concern, and recent problems in the private banking sector underscore the need for firm supervision. (Emergency loans to one bank are now a significant component of NBR refinancing). 0 It was agreed that, as a performance criterion, the Government would, by May 15, 1996, split up ROMCEREAL, a key state-owned agricultural "integrator", closely involved in the provision of subsidies and the tying together of subsidized and unsubsidized services including crop financing (I 1x1. (ROMCEREAL falls formally outside the scope of the FESAL.) Staff agreed that the measures, fully implemented, should achieve a substantial improvement in resource allocation, and buttress financial discipline in the economy. In particular, successful implementation of the financial recovery plans and debt negotiations would make a major contribution to slowing the rapid expansion of arrears and credit among problem enterprises that re-emerged in early 1995--cutting back the quasi- fiscal deficit and allowing room for financing healthy elements in the economic recovery. Timely and adequate data provision--a considerable problem in the past --was a major point of emphasis in the discussions (9 7). JJ Based on restructuring plans to be approved by the World Bank, a cap has been placed on the access of some 150 problem enterprises to bank credit; enterprise performance will be monitored on a monthly basis (99 7 and 11). To add credibility, actions are to be taken up-front to cut the losses of a group of some 20 core enterprises with large losses and/or arrears (see background paper). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - Staff also stressed that measures to encourage larger inflows of foreign direct investment-- including an acceleration of privatization, one- stop shopping for investment approvals, and a more favorable environment for private sector development --should be a high priority. In this connection, a number of other structural reforms that were benchmarks under the first program review have been advanced in the third and fourth quarters of 1995. A Mass Privatization Act was passed by Parliament in June 1995; under other mechanisms by end-October 1995 a cumulative total of 1,532 firms had been privatized (World Bank definition). u The Bucharest Securities Exchange was formally opened in July 1995 and trading, on a small scale, began in November 1995. u The Bankruptcy Law 1/ was promulgated in June 1995; it compares favorably with bankruptcy laws in other transition economies in its legal provisions, but state utilities (regies autonomes), and large loss-making enterprises covered by the Ordinance 13/95 on enterprise restructuring, are excluded. Finally, in November 1995, the Competition Law was passed by both chambers of the Parliament, and the competition authority is to be set up in the near future (JI 3 and Appendix II). 4. External outlook and canacitv to repay A central concern of the discussions was to address the very serious weakening of Romania's external position during the first nine months of 1995, and to put in place policies that would achieve a sustainable medium- term pattern of growth. In light of the measures taken by November 1995 to increase savings and shift resources to the external sector, and provided firm policies are held in place over the next few years, staff concurred with the authorities' view that the outlook for Romania in 1996 and over the medium term could be favorable. The recent developments in the exchange market have improved the external competitiveness of the economy, which is judged by the staff to be sufficient to support the projected strengthening of the external current account in 1996 (see background paper). In 1996, however, staff underscored that the financing of the projected current account deficit (1 18), is dependent on policy performance that will unlock substantial official bilateral and multilateral flows and catalyze a continuing expansion of Romania's incipient access to private capital markets. External financing already identified for 1996 includes, in addition to trade-related commercial borrowing, and already committed financing from G-24/EU, accelerated project-related disbursements from the IBRD, EBRD and EIB (US$450 million), three tranches of World Bank FESAL L/ The Mass Privatization Act contains provisions that are interpreted to require passage of a specific Bank Privatization Act for the sale of existing shares in banks (not envisaged when the SBA was approved); however, it is thought that early privatization of one bank--the Romanian Development Bank--may proceed through issuance of new shares. A Bank Privatization Law has now been submitted to Parliament. u Arrangements for initial trading of Mass Privatization shares, however, remain.to established. u Prepared with extensive assistance from the Fund's Legal Department.

Over the medium term, on the basis of the policies described above, growth could be maintained at 4-5 percent, and a further significant reduction in inflation attained, setting the stage for a shift to inflation levels compatible with joining the European Union in due course. 1/ A significant narrowing of the current account deficit would appear plausible, allowing debt ratios to remain within prudent limits, and sizable debt maturities to be met (Tables 8 and 9). 2/ Further liberalization could and should be achieved, including the removal of export restrictions, an easing of remaining current account restrictions, and acceptance of Article VIII status by the time of the 1997 Article IV Consultation (9 19). Projections along these lines show obligations to the Fund as a proportion of Romania's total external debt progressively declining from some 18 percent in 1995 to some 6 percent by the year 2000 (Tables 9 and 10). Fund debt service, as a proportion of total debt service, would decline from a peak of some 40 percent in 1995 to some 7 percent in the year 2000. In this connection, it is encouraging that the World Bank has markedly increased its commitment to Romania, that access to private capital markets is beginning to be built up, and that there are now some early signs of a strengthening in non-debt creating capital inflows (Table 8). Staff emphasized, however, that considerable risks attach to this benign scenario. Romania's medium-term prospects and capacity to repay the Fund need to be assessed against the background of a problematic track record, coupled with gross financing requirements that are expected to remain large throughout the period over which the bulk of repurchase obligations under the previous and current Fund arrangements fall due. A weakening of the macroeconomic policies now being put in place, renewed slippage in enterprise reforms, or a reversion to manipulation of the exchange rate would trigger a recurrence of severe balance of payments pressures, damage financial confidence, and undermine the prospects for growth. Accordingly, a strong and sustained commitment to stabilization and structural reform policies, accompanied by adequate access to external financing on appropriate terms, is imperative to avoid balance of payments risks to Romania's capacity to meet further obligations to the Fund. 1/ Romania applied to join the European Union in June 1995. 2/ Data on external debt do not include claims amounting to USS3.2 billion recently communicated to the staff by the Government of Sweden. These claims relate to nationalized investments, closed franchises, and publicly issued Romanian securitieis held by Swedish residents. The Romanian authorities have confirmed to the staff that are available for discussions concerning the amount of this debt and means of achieving a settlement of the claims that is acceptable to both parties.

Program Design The Letter of Intent circulated as EBS/95/216, sets forth details of the authorities' economic program for late 1995 and 1996. Given that the authorities are not making a second purchase under the STF (9 5), it is proposed that the stand-by arrangement approved on May 11, 1994, be extended until March 1997 and that it be augmented by SDR 188.525 million (25 percent of quota) and be rephased (Table 11). The authorities would make a purchase of SDR 37.705 million (5 percent of quota) upon completion of the first review and five equal purchases in the aggregate amount of SDR 226.23 million (30 percent of quota) over the period to February 1997. The authorities prefer an extension of the current stand-by rather than seeking a new arrangement because this minimizes the domestic procedural delays involved, including extensive Parliamentary consultation on a new arrangement. In this connection, however, the authorities have indicated that Parliament remains supportive of the policies under the existing stand- by arrangement and of the projected budget for 1996. . The appendices to the Letter of Intent set out performance criteria on the NDA and NIR of the banking system, net bank credit to the consolidated general government, enterprise debt assumptions and guarantees, medium- and long-term debt (contracted and guaranteed), and short-term debt outstanding, for December 31, 1995, and March 31 and June 30, 1996, nonaccumulation of external payments arrears, together with the customary clauses on avoidance of new exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices. A structural performance criterion has been set on the break-up of ROMCEREAL by May 15, 1996. Indicative tarzets have been set for reserve money and the NIR of the NBR. Quantitative benchmarks govern directed NBR credit, payments arrears, and net bank credit to "problem" enterprises under the FESAL (Table 12). The proposed program extension also includes two further reviews (summarized in Appendix II of the Letter of Intent). In addition to the performance criteria and indicative targets mentioned above, benchmarks have been set in the following areas for the next DroPram review, which is to take place in May 1996: passage by Parliament of a satisfactory budget for 1996 (a condition for completion of the review), understandings with Fund staff on any adjustment to the 1996 fiscal targets after mid-year, and assessment of medium-term outlook for the financing of the major social security funds; establishment of a competition authority and modernized payments system for large-value transfers; significant progress with commercial bank and enterprise restructuring; significant progress toward the goals for enterprise restructuring and privatization; and promulgation of a law establishing mutual funds and investment funds. For the third program review, which is expected to take place in November 1996, the follqwing structural benchmarks have been set: agreement on the 1997 budget, and significant progress toward widening the income tax base; a review of progress in the NBR's shift toward market-based refinancing techniques, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Publicfurther significant progress in implementing plans for commercial bank and enterprise restructuring and privatization. JJ V. Staff Annraisal The strong macroeconomic policies implemented from late 1993 resulted in a striking turnaround in economic performance in 1994. Inflation was reduced very sharply and external reserves were rebuilt. GDP growth accelerated to 4 percent, while real consumption also increased significantly for the first time since 1990. There was a rapid rise in real household savings, and substantial inventory adjustment in the enterprise sector. The crucial ingredient of this performance was a change in expectations, reflecting the sharp correction of interest and exchange rate distortions against a background of monetary and fiscal restraint. The free availability of foreign exchange also encouraged strong export growth, which was a key to the recovery and remains crucial for sustained expansion of the economy. From late 1994 onward, however, there was renewed interference with the functioning of the exchange market, accommodation of pressures for NBR directed credit to agriculture, and significant delay in implementing enterprise reforms. These factors contributed to a very rapid expansion of credit and a widening balance of payments deficit--placing in jeopardy the economic recovery. The macroeconomic measures recently taken by the authorities-- particularly the introduction of a more restrictive budget for 1996, a tightening of refinancing policy and minimum reserves by the National Bank of Romania, and action to restore a market-clearing exchange rate including a 10 percent depreciation in the official reference rate--should result in a strengthening of the external accounts ,while making further progress in reducing inflation. Fully sustained, these policies would contribute to an early shift of resources to the external sector, provide domestic and foreign agents with a clear signal of renewed policy resolve, and make it possible for the authorities to achieve the objectives set out in the Letter of Intent for the first program review. However, against the background of l-J As with the policy understandings underlying the MEP of April 1994, the structural policies set forth in the December 1995 Letter of Intent have been discussed with the World Bank as well as with the authorities, both to avoid conflicts of conditionality and to ensure that Bank staff are prepared to give policy and monitoring assistance in areas where structural progress is agreed to be essential for the attainment of the authorities' macroeconomic objectives. Specifically, in interpreting the term "significant progress", in the context of the program reviews due consideration will be given to the implementation of the structural measures envisaged under the FESAL. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - earlier policy slippages, the success of the program will require the strictest implementation of policies. A core source of instability in the Romanian economy remains, for the medium-term, the quasi-fiscal deficit in the enterprise sector rather than the budget. Encouraging steps have recently been taken to address this problem, including notably the conclusion of negotiations with the World Bank on the FESAL. The priority now should be to implement the agreed measures, and to proceed in 1996 with an intensification and deepening of structural reforms. This implies further, strong actions to slim down problem state-owned enterprises in industry and agriculture, reducing the quasi-fiscal deficit and helping to strengthen the balance of payments. The key is the implementation of up-front actions, cushioned by adequate social safety net provisions, that credibly signal a resolve to cut costs and increase revenues in a core group of state-owned enterprises with large losses or arrears: Beyond this, sustainable growth and a continuing rise in living standards depend critically on a policy framework that will promote the expansion of the private sector. Further institutional deepening is needed to reinforce market mechanisms in the Romanian economy, and to support higher levels of saving and investment. Increasingly, the legal framework is being put in place, and policy support is available through the proposed FESAL. The issue now is to move swiftly to the stage of effective implementation--fostering a more rapid rise in exports, inward direct investment, and domestic savings; shifting the economy to a faster growth path; and underpinning Romania's capacity to meet heavy impending financial obligations to external creditors- -including notably the Fund. Given Romania's problematic track record, the risks to the program should not be minimized. Renewed slippage in key areas--including the exchange rate, monetary policy, and enterprise reform--would undermine the confidence of domestic and foreign investors, cut short the present recovery, and leave the economy in a very fragile external financial position. In this connection, it is particularly important that the authorities avoid direct or indirect interference with the exchange market, and that the exchange rate be allowed to clear the market--which may, of course, entail further depreciation. The staff expects to be in close touch with the authorities concerning the implementation of policies over the next few months. Romania continues to maintain an exchange restriction in accordance with the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2 arising under a bilateral payments arrangement with Ghana. The outstanding balances under this arrangement have been repaid in October 1995 and the arrangement will be terminated in the near future. Romania also maintains the following exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3: (i) a restriction arising from limits on the availability of foreign exchange for individuals for the making of current payments; (ii) restrictions arising from undue delays, due to official Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - action, in the availability of foreign exchange for the making of current payments; and (iii) a multiple currency practice arising from a market segmentation due to official action. Ac:tion has been taken by the authorities that is designed to to eliminate the measures described in (ii) and (iii). Substantial improvements have been made in the last four years in the gathering, publication, and provision to the Fund of information on economic developments in Romania. Nonetheless, policy analysis and effective surveillance is still hampered by inadequacies in the statistical system. Key areas where improvemen,ts are underway with the benefit of technical assistance from the Fund and other sources include national income data, the monetary accounts, and information on the operations of the major state- owned enterprises with large losses or arrears. Improvements in these areas will be monitored integrally with the related benchmarks on performance under the program. In the judgment of the staff, the actions initiated by the authorities in recent months, if forcefully carried through, should correct the now very serious balance of payments situation, and thereby avoid aborting the economic recovery. Given the re-phasing of access to Fund resources embodied in the authorities' request, the staff believes that use of the Fund's resources will be adequately safeguarded; the staff thus recommends completion of the review, accompanied by extension and augmentation of the stand-by arrangement. It is expected that the second review of the program will be completed in May 1996 and that the next Article IV Consultation will take place on the regular 12-month cycle.

From June 1992, the exchange rate was determined daily through an auction organized by the National Bank of Romania in which bids and offers must be channelled through the commercial banks; however, the price determination rule employed did not ensure that the price set in the auction was a market-clearing price. In April 1994, the auction mechanism was modified to ensure to ensure clearing of the market. From August, 1994, a decentralized direct dealing interbank market has been in operation. The official reference rate published by the National Bank of Romania is an average Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX I of rates reported for interbank and client transactions. The reference exchange rate as of December 6, 1995 was lei 2,535 per dollar. The remaining restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions include (i) those arising under a bilateral payments agreement with a Fund member (maintained under Article XIV, Section 2); (ii) restrictions arising from limits on the availability of foreign exchange for individuals for the making of current payments; (iii) restrictions arising from undue delays due to official action in the availability of foreign exchange for the making of certain current payments; and (iv) a multiple currency practice arising from a market segmentation due to official action. VIII. Article IV consultation (a) 12-month consultation cycle. Last consultation concluded on September 16, 1993. (b) The following decision was taken by the Board on September 16, 1993. 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Romania's exchange measures subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3 and in concluding the 1993 Article XIV consultation with Romania, in light of the 1993 Article IV consultation with Romania conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Romania's restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, described in SM/93/182 are maintained under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2 as described in EBS/93/182, except that the restriction on the availability of foreign exchange to enterprises and physical persons, and the multiple currency practice arising from the dual exchange market system are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3. The staff urges the authorities to eliminate the measures subject to approval under Article VIII and also encourages the authorities to remove the remaining restrictions maintained under Article XIV as soon as circumstances permit.

Lending was discontinued in 1982, and economic and sector work stopped in 1986. In 1987, Romania initiated discussions that led to prepayment of its USS1.8 billion indebtedness to the World Bank in 1989. Lendinv ooerations. The Romanian authorities resumed contacts with the Bank in January 1990, and began discussing sectoral priorities for lending. The Bank has nine loans outstanding in Romania. The Technical Assistance and Critical Imports Loan (US$lSO million) was approved in June 1991, and a Health Sector Rehabilitation Loan (US$lSO million) was approved in October, 1991. Agreement was reached in mid-1992 on a Structural Adjustment Loan in the amount of USS.400 million, accompanied by US$lOO million equivalent in yen cofinancing from the Japanese Export Import Bank. The SAL was fully disbursed by end-1994. The SAL was followed by loans to agriculture (US$lOO million) and transport (US$120 million). Loans were approved in April 1994 for Education Reform (US$50 million) and Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation (USS175.6 million) and the Industrial Development Project in May 1994 (US$175 million); in March 1995 the Board approved an Employment and Social Protection Loan for USS55.4 million. A lending program has been developed consisting of 2-4 projects per year, amounting to about USS1.6 billion for the four-year period FY94-97. The level and composition of proposed lending and the nature of lending instruments will depend on the scope and speed of implementation of market reforms. The immediate thrust of the Bank's proposed lending program is support to financial sector reform and enterprise restructuring, including privatization. Government reforms in these areas will be supported by a proposed Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL). Also, investment and credit operations are being prepared in industry, agriculture, power, human resources and telecommunications. Operations in the social sectors will support human investment and the strengthening of the social safety net. Economic and Sector Work. The Bank's economic and sector work program is designed to underpin lending activities, assist the Government in developing sound policies, and inform the international community about Romania's development prospects and priorities. An Economic Review was prepared 1994 to provide an overview of reform and stabilization efforts and served as a principal vehicle for discussion with the Government and the Consultative Group held in June 1994. A fiscal policy sector report, completed in November 1993 (Report No. 11878-RO), dealt with the determination of a sustainable fiscal stance for the medium-term and, toward this end, recommended reforms in the critical areas of state enterprise and financial sector, and in the tax regime. An agricultural strategy paper has been prepared by a team of Romanian policy makers with the help of the World Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIX II Bank and other donors. A poverty assessment is in progress, and a Country Economic Report will be produced in the coming months, and an environmental strategy update is planned. A substantial amount of sector analysis is also undertaken as part of project preparation; this has been particularly true in the energy and enterprise sectors.

These data are also published quite promptly. However, analysis of economic developments is seriously hampered by weak data on sectoral developments in the real economy, and very unreliable information on the savings and investment position of households and firms. The authorities have been receiving technical assistance from EUROSTAT and INSEE. From a program perspective, the long delays in preparing data on enterprise arrears, and the failure to produce a sectoral analysis of bank credit, seriously impair an accurate assessment of financial developments. The authorities have agreed to improve data collection and reporting on credit developments and to institute a flash reporting system on the financial position of key state-owned enterprises. These improvements in data reporting will be required to comply with certain program performance criteria and structural benchmarks. 1. Outstanding statistical issues a. Real sector A significant amount of data published in IFS are taken from official publications. However, these publications need further clarification and improvement. Producer prices and trade price indices have not yet been provided to the Fund. An industrial production index has been provided through November 1994. National accounts aggregates are available at current prices through 1993 and at constant prices through 1992. b. Government finance Romania is a regular respondent to the GFS questionnaire. Data for 1994 for the consolidated central government (including social security and extrabudgetary funds) are about to be published in the 1995 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Romania also reports quarterly data on the operations of the budget for the IFS page, with a lag of approximately nine months. The quality of the data is reasonably good, and the relatively minor outstanding issues are expected to be dealt with by the authorities in the coming months. C. Monetary Further improvements in the reporting of monetary data are expected following the money and banking statistics mission in October-November 1995. Improvements include reporting of revised data on government deposits and additional interest rates.

Balance of uavments Data collection and compilation have improved significantly following technical assistance provided by an expert under the JAA for one year in 1993-94. Reporting of a more detailed balance of payments than that currently provided to the Fund is being considered by the authorities.
