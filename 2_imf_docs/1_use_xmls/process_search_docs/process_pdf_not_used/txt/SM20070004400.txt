DOCUMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY                      SM/07/44 Correction 2   March 12, 2007  To: Members of the Executive Board  From: The Acting Secretary  Subject: Malaysia—Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation   The attached correction to SM/07/44 (2/1/07) has been provided by the staff:  Mischaracterizations of the Views of the Authorities  Page 11, line 4: for “phasing out fuel subsidies” read “reassessing fuel subsidies”  Comment: The authorities have requested this correction to reflect their views more accurately. The correction does not affect the staff appraisal, which notes that phasing out fuel subsidies accompanied by adequate social safety nets is central to improving expenditure efficiency and quality.  Questions may be referred to Mr. Ishii (ext. 37355) and Ms. Papi (ext. 36894) in APD.  This document will shortly be posted on the extranet, a secure website for Executive Directors and member country authorities.

They cautioned, however, that the timing would depend on political factors and on putting in place social safety nets.  10.      Further improvements in consolidated public sector statistics are desirable. Staff welcomed progress in this area in line with previous recommendations. However, gaps in the NFPE data, notably with regard to balance sheet information, still hamper a full assessment of fiscal policy, in particular its implications for public sector debt sustainability. Staff called for an upgrade in the monitoring and forecasting of NFPEs’ performance.4  C.   How to Broaden and Strengthen Domestic Sources of Growth 11.      Addressing this issue is key to the success of the Ninth Plan. There was broad agreement on the plan’s emphasis on upgrading Malaysia’s human capital, promoting growth in high-value added sectors, and strengthening public institutions and service delivery. The discussions centered on: (i) financial sector stability and growth against the background of further financial liberalization and international integration; (ii) the consistency of GLC-led initiatives under the Ninth Plan with efforts to strengthen their performance and improve the business environment; and (iii) the role of exchange rate and monetary policies to support broader-based growth.  Financial Sector Stability and International Integration 12.      The banking system appears sound, although the rising exposure to the household sector warrants continued vigilance.  • Banks are well capitalized and highly liquid, asset quality is improving, provision coverage rising, and profitability satisfactory (Table 7). Market risks appear low and relate mainly to interest rate risk. Although the dispersion of financial soundness indicators across banking institutions is significant, the BNM’s most recent stress tests suggest that only two small institutions accounting for less than 5 percent of                                                 3 Even after the planned reduction to 26 percent by 2008, corporate tax rates would remain significantly above rates in key economies in the regions.  4 Currently, NFPEs report their performance to the MOF only on an annual basis and with a significant delay.

Household indebtedness at 61 percent of GDP is high by cross-country comparison, and an estimated debt service ratio of 40 percent of personal disposable income exceeds what banks generally consider prudent. However, mitigating factors include: (i) banks’ greater use of information from the credit bureau and minimum income requirements for credit card lending; (ii) strengthened risk management systems aided by BNM’s guidance; and (iii) a high ratio of financial assets to liabilities (estimated at about 2 by the authorities).  13.      The authorities confirmed that household sector surveillance is a priority. After abandoning the household survey project due to a low response rate, the BNM is exploring other sources of information on households’ financial situation. Staff encouraged a more systematic approach to collecting micro data and analyzing households’ financial situation by income group and debt service on an obligatory basis, as well as refining information on the balance sheet components of the household sector (including assets held abroad).  14.      Enhancing creditors’ rights would strengthen the health of the banking system further. Market participants reported the slow resolution of non-performing loans (NPLs). The authorities have already introduced measures aimed at encouraging banks to write off or sell NPLs, including imposing stricter provisioning requirements. But, they agreed that improving the enforcement of creditors’ rights and reducing the time required for asset foreclosure should also be considered.                                                  5 One of them has been recapitalized and is addressing its problems (especially the high level of nonperforming assets) under new management. 010203040506070PhilippinesIndonesiaIndiaChinaThailandKoreaTaiwanMalaysiaIn percent of GDPIn percent of private creditHousehold DebtSource: GFSR.Bank Default Probabilities and Asset Distribution0102030405060708090100051015202530354045Default ProbabilityCumulative Share of Assets1998200020052006Sources: Bloomberg, BankScope, and Fund staff estimates.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
