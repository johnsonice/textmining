Reflecting the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar, inflation remained low at an estimated 1 percent for 200 1. As measured for Antigua and Barbuda, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 1% percent, in line with appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The external current account deficit declined by 1% percent of GDP in 2001 to 13% percent, in part, because of a decline in imports after expiration of a special exemption from duties in 2000. a The overall deficit of the public sector is estimated to have increased by 1% percent of GDP to 7% percent in 200 1, due mainly to increased government wage payments and capital spending. The deficit was mainly covered by external financing and the accumulation of external arrears. The central government’s demand for funds tapped the finances of statutory bodies and posed problems for the banking system. Government arrears to the social security system constitute a threat to its solvency. 0 The authorities implemented measures in the latter part of 2001 that will improve fiscal performance in 2002 and announced their intention to implement a fiscal adjustment program prepared in collaboration with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and Caribbean Development Bank. This program calls for reduction of discretionary tax concessions and steps to control expenditure in 2002. The adjustment under consideration by the authorities could shift the public sector from dissaving to saving and reduce the overall deficit to 5% percent of GDP in 2002. However, financing gaps would remain over the medium term, likely resulting in further accumulation of arrears. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that the authorities’ real growth target of 5 percent a year would be achieved. 0 The staff maintained that the scope and magnitude of Antigua and Barbuda’s public finance problems called for substantially larger upfront fiscal adjustment. It recommended additional adjustment to raise public saving to 23/4 percent and reduce the public sector deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2002. This would enable the central government to reduce its external arrears and stop accumulating domestic arrears in 2002. The strengthening of public savings over the medium term would permit the steady reduction of arrears and support the capital investment needed to achieve the authorities’ growth target. Structural reforms covering the civil service, tax system, and privatization would be necessary to strengthen public finances further and increase economic efficiency over the medium term. 0 The authorities took action to comply with international best practices in the offshore financial sector, including the closure of some banks, improving the money laundering prevention act, and strengthening enforcement. As a result, the United Kingdom and United States lifted their financial advisories. On December 6,2001, Antigua and Barbuda signed an agreement with the United States Treasury on sharing tax information.

The 200 1 Article IV consultation discussions with Antigua and Barbuda were conducted in St. Johns during November 28-December 11,200l .l The representatives of Antigua and Barbuda included the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the Governor of the central bank, other senior government officials, and representatives of labor and business. 2. Antigua and Barbuda has a tourism-based economy with a population of 75,000. It is one of eight eastern Caribbean islands with a common central bank, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1976 at EC$2.7 equals US$l .2 Fund surveillance in Antigua and Barbuda is impeded by the country’s poor statistical database, especially in the areas of national income, price, and trade statistics, and offshore business activity, with regard to the coverage, quality, and timeliness of reporting. Also, the finances of statutory bodies are not systematically reported, hampering assessment of public sector operations. Relations with the Fund are summarized in Attachment I. 3. At the conclusion of the 2000 Article IV consultation on March 7,2001, Executive Directors noted the modest growth in the economy in spite of the damages due to hurricanes, but expressed concern about the deterioration in public finances. They saw strengthening of public savings as key to supporting investment needed to expand and diversify the economy. Directors commended the authorities for their measures to control expenditure, but urged the government to become current on their obligations to the social security system and encouraged further adjustments of public utility tariffs to help recover cost. They considered tax reform to be crucial, and urged the authorities to take steps to improve the budgetary process and reexamine the rationale for tax waivers, with a view to establishing clearly defined criteria for their use. Directors also welcomed improvements in the legal and enforcement regime in the area of money laundering and encouraged the authorities to participate in collaboration with the ECCB in the FSAP exercise for the subregion. ’ The mission team comprised Messrs. Pellechio (Head), Pearson, Salehizadeh, Samuel (all WHD), Mr. Kar (STA), and Miss Barbosa (Assistant, WHD). The team was assisted by Ms. K. Williams of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and Mr. Murphy of the Caribbean Development Bank. Mr. Yadav (WHD), Mr. Bennett, Executive Director for Antigua and Barbuda, and his advisor, Mr. Vermaeten, participated in the final meetings. 2 Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Antigua and Barbuda has had uneven economic performance for several years, largely because of recurrent large fiscal deficits that resulted in a build-up of arrears and continuing loss of access to external financing. Following a 5 percent decline in real GDP in 1995 due to two hurricanes, real growth averaged 5 percent annually in 1996-99 as tourism recovered and post-hurricane reconstruction was brisk. 5. Real GDP growth slowed to 2% percent in 2000 as post-hurricane reconstruction winded down and tourism weakened (Table 1). Growth prospects were already weak by mid- 2001 as tourist arrivals dropped by 2% percent in the year to June reflecting the global economic slowdown. The September 11 terrorist attack in the United States exacerbated the situation, with the result that real GDP is estimated to have stagnated in 2001. Inflation has been low and was 1 percent in 200 1, reflecting the openness of the economy and the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar. As measured for Antigua and Barbuda, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 1% percent in 200 1, in line with appreciation of the U.S. dollar. 6. The fiscal position continued to deteriorate in 2001. The overall deficit of the consolidated public sector rose by 11% percentage points in 200 1 to an estimated 73/4 percent as increased government wage payments and capital spending more than offset improvements in collection of the corporate income tax and the effect of doubling the customs service charge to 10 percent in the second half of the year (Tables 2 and 3). Additional efforts to boost revenue were constrained by delays in the implementation of revenue measures proposed in the 2001 budget (Box 1). In addition, revenue losses associated with discretionary tax waivers, which reached an estimated 12% percent of GDP in 2000, are reported to have continued to expand in 2001. 7. The public sector deficit in 2001 was mainly financed from external sources and accumulation of external debt service arrears. Notwithstanding some payments mentioned below, these arrears increased, including on recently rescheduled debts, by US$l5% million (2 percent of GDP) in 200 1 to an estimated US$135 million (20% percent of GDP). 8. The increase in the central government’s overall deficit from 8 percent in 2000 to 9% percent in 2001 was the cause of the deterioration in public finances. To help finance its deficit, the government received disbursements of about one-third of a US$40 million (6 percent of GDP) loan from an offshore financial institution in the latter part of 2001.3 These disbursements enabled the government to clear its debt service arrears to the Caribbean 3 Although funds were disbursed, loan documents had not been signed as the terms were reportedly not finalized at the time of the mission. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- Development Bank (CDB) and European Investment Bank, which allowed disbursements from these institutions to support capital projects. The government’s demand for funds also tapped the finances of statutory bodies and posed problems for the banking system. Statutory bodies were called on to purchase treasury bills and bonds, drawing on available cash flow and bank deposits, tightening liquidity in the banking sector. Government arrears to the social security and medical benefits schemes continued to accumulate, threatening their solvency. The government accumulated arrears in payments to other statutory bodies and private businesses, which resulted in some businesses falling behind in tax and debt service payments, and, in turn, caused an increase in banks’ nonperforming loans. In addition, the government requested a go-day moratorium on its debt service to domestic banks in November 200 1. 9. Structural weaknesses adversely affect public finances. The central government and many statutory bodies are substantially overstaffed, with the government’s wage payments amounting to almost 70 percent of current revenue. In addition, revenue earmarked for debt service and off-budget operations amounts to 45 percent of current revenue.4 10. Broad money growth slowed to 2% percent in 2001 from 5% percent in 2000 and commercial bank credit stagnated, reflecting the economic slowdown (Table 4). As noted, the government’s high financing requirement contributed to tight liquidity and high real interest rates. In addition, banks’ asset quality has declined with nonperforming loans increasing to 10% percent of total loans at end-September 2001 from 7% percent a year earlier. 11. The absence of reliable import data for over ten years has hampered estimation of the balance of payments. Based on limited available data, the external current account deficit is estimated to have increased by 13/4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 15l% percent and decreased to 13% percent of GDP in 2001, in part, because of a decline in imports after expiration of a special exemption from duties in 2000 (Table 5). Tourism receipts declined in 2001 as arrivals dropped by 4 percent, reflecting the global economic slowdown and impact of the September 11 attack. The current account deficit was partly covered by official financing, mainly loans and grants for construction of a hospital and a fisheries complex, and road rehabilitation, as well as disbursements from the US$40 million loan from an offshore financial institution (noted earlier). The overall balance of payments deficit was 2% percent of GDP in 2001 and was financed mainly by the accumulation of arrears. 4 Government’s heavy reliance on domestic commercial bank financing has required deposit of certain government revenue collections in commercial bank accounts that are debited for debt service.

In the area of external policies, import licensing was scaled back but import monopolies for vegetable and petroleum products remained. The trade regime allows importation of goods subject to tariff rates ranging from 0 to 35 percent, and averaging 10 percent.5 Goods from OECS member countries and imports of capital goods and raw materials for construction are duty free. The final phase of CARICOM’s common external tariff, which would reduce the top tariff rate to 20 percent, was not implemented as planned in early 2001. 13. In May 2000 the Financial Stability Forum listed Antigua and Barbuda among the offshore financial centers whose quality of supervision and cooperation was perceived to be low (Group III). In June 2000 the OECD listed Antigua and Barbuda as one of 35 tax havens. The government took remedial action to comply with international best practices, including closure of some banks, improving the money laundering prevention act, and strengthening enforcement. These efforts were recognized by the international community, with the United States and United Kingdom lifting their financial advisories in mid-2001. A Fund-assisted self-assessment of its offshore financial services sector (Module I) in September 2001 recommended legislative changes to improve the regulatory framework for international businesses and strengthen the enforcement powers of the regulatory agency, and recruitment and training of additional staff in the regulatory agency. 14. In the area of structural reform, the authorities announced plans to privatize the management of the international airport. A major study of the civil service financed by the CDB was submitted to the government in November 200 1. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 15. The consultation discussions centered around an adjustment program for Antigua and Barbuda which was being formulated in collaboration with the ECCB and CDB. The authorities expressed interest in technical assistance from the Fund in implementing the adjustment program. The program under consideration envisaged measures that could shift the public sector from dissaving to savings of 54 percent of GDP, notwithstanding an increase in resources to stimulate the depressed tourism sector. Even with this program, the central government would still have a financing gap, creating pressure for continued accumulation of domestic arrears with implications for further deterioration in the health of the banking system. 5 Tariff rates are multiples of 5 percent, with two higher rates of 45 percent for some alcoholic beverages and 70 percent for firearms. The Fund’s index of aggregate trade restrictiveness for Antigua and Barbuda is 6 on a scale up to 10, the rating for greatest restrictiveness.

While fully accepting the need to address the weakened tourism sector, the staff maintained that the scope and magnitude of Antigua and Barbuda’s public finance problems called for substantially larger upfront fiscal adjustment than contemplated by the authorities. The staff projected that the authorities’ program would not ease crowding out of the private sector and would fail to provide support for capital expenditure needed over the medium term to achieve the targeted real growth of 5 percent. More adjustment was needed to restore the credibility of macroeconomic policy and expand access to external financing. The staffs recommended adjustment path would increase public sector savings by an additional 2% percent of GDP in 2002 and reduce the overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP, which would be financed by official long-term external finance. The proposed fiscal adjustment would enable the central government to stop accumulating domestic arrears in 2002 and begin the process of reducing external arrears. The strengthening of public savings over the medium term would help fund needed investment in economic and social infrastructure. The staff also argued for the implementation of structural reforms, covering the civil service, tax system, and privatization, to improve fiscal performance and economic efficiency over the medium term. 17. The authorities expressed willingness to consider additional measures. However, they indicated that they would likely face public resistance to substantial adjustment measures in the 2002 budget. The authorities projected that real GDP would decline by about 2 percent in 2002, mostly because of the weaker performance of the tourism sector expected after the September 11 terrorist attacks. However, preliminary information received more recently suggests that the negative effect of these attacks, although still serious, may not have been as severe as initially estimated. The authorities are in the process of making a complete assessment of the near and medium-term prospects for the tourism sector and economic activity. A. Fiscal Policy Fiscal adjustment 18. The authorities attributed the current central government’s fiscal weakness primarily to delays in implementing fiscal measures proposed in the 2001 budget. The original revenue proposals were modified to meet objections from the business community, significantly reducing their yield in 200 1. By end-2001 the government succeeded in increasing the customs service tax from 5 to 10 percent, broadening the environmental tax on selected imports and introducing a levy on petroleum imports and a 3 percent tax on offshore businesses. The authorities viewed the latter as responding to the OECD’s position on harmful tax competition. Postal rates, fees for bank and nonbank licenses, and other levies were raised. 19. On the expenditure side, the authorities described how their objective of reducing wage payments by EC$23 million in the 2001 budget (11% percent of GDP) went unfulfilled. Plans to reduce excess staff were not implemented and an agreement between the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- government and union for salary cuts of 1 O-20 percent effective on July 1,200 1 was dropped in the face of public resistance. Also, retrenchment of workers that was to be implemented in November, when employment in the tourism sector was expected to expand, was abandoned after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 20. Despite the setbacks in 200 1, the authorities maintained their resolve to improve the fiscal situation. On the revenue side, they planned to curtail discretionary tax concessions by EC$40 million, about 2 percent of GDP in 2002, and improve corporate income tax and property tax collections. On the expenditure side, the authorities intended to adopt measures to make the government’s use of goods and services more efficient, entailing curtailment of overseas travel expenditure and use of vehicles and other perquisites by senior government officials. The authorities reiterated their commitment, as stated in the 2001 budget speech, to reducing the wage bill over time and stated their intention to freeze government wages. Further, they hoped to reduce staff through attrition and by releasing persons who had reached 60 years of age. Taking into account increased spending on tourism promotion and interest payments, and assuming the authorities are able to contain the wage bill, their intended adjustment, could increase public savings by 13/4 percent of GDP in 2002. 21. The staff indicated that the authorities’ plans were a good initial step. However, even assuming full implementation of planned measures, staff projections indicate that public finances would remain weak, as indicated above. The staff called for significant further adjustment to raise public saving by an additional 2% percent of GDP in 2002. The staff believed that this was feasible mainly by intensifying the reduction in discretionary tax concessions intended by the authorities to double the yield to EC$80 million, approximately 4 percent of GDP. This would amount to a little over half of the 7% percent of GDP granted in 2000 in discretionary concessions to households and others for imports of consumer goods, including luxury goods such as imports on small cargo boats and yachts. The staff argued that such reduction also would be justified on equity grounds. The staff recommended that tax concessions be reduced by limiting access based on clearly defined, strict statutory criteria designed to minimize or remove their discretionary element. 22. The staff proposed additional adjustment on the expenditure side amounting to no more than ‘Yz percent of GDP in 2002, taking into consideration the difficulty of the measures that the authorities already intended to implement. The staff projected very modest additional retrenchment, as employment opportunities in the private sector increased. While this would not yield significant savings in the 2002 budget after taking into account severance costs, savings could come later, with projected government payroll costs beginning to decline in 2003. The staff stressed that retrenchment of government employment was necessary and argued further that it must be part of a well-designed civil service reform carried out over the medium term. 23. To support the authorities’ medium-term growth objective and achieve a sustainable level of public debt, the staff recommended that medium-term fiscal policy aim for central government savings of 3 percent of GDP by 2006. This strengthening of the government’s Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- fiscal position over the medium term would contribute to the elimination of external arrears and facilitate access to additional external financing on improved terms to fund growth- oriented investment. 24. The authorities reiterated their intention to introduce a VAT over the medium term, with a view to improving the efficiency of the indirect tax system in a regional context and also because it has become increasingly complex as a result of the government’s efforts to raise revenue over the last decade. The staff strongly supported this in the context of the FAD mission’s recommended timetable of policy and administrative reforms. In this regard, the authorities expressed interest in technical assistance from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC). 25. The staff expressed concerns about the US$40 million loan from an offshore facility, including the disbursement of funds before loan terms were settled. The staff indicated that this loan, and the government’s borrowing from an offshore bank earlier in the year to pay salaries, may conflict with its role in regulating the offshore sector and raises questions about transparency and governance. These types of operations could tarnish Antigua and Barbuda’s overall attractiveness as an offshore center. The authorities emphasized that the regulatory agencies were independent from the central government. Other fiscal issues 26. The government’s stock of arrears to the social security and medical benefits schemes rose to an estimated 11 XI percent and 8 percent of GDP in 200 1, respectively.’ The latest actuarial study of social security’s long-term finances shows that government arrears pose a serious threat to its solvency. There was broad agreement that these arrears had to be reduced, but the authorities had no specific plans. The staff noted that, as it was applied currently, the social security, medical benefits, and education levies constituted a regressive tax on incomes. It supported FAD’s recommendation for consolidating these levies into a single “social services levy” by aligning their bases and increasing the rates for higher earnings. The authorities were urged to consider other reforms in the structure of the social security scheme to ensure its long-term solvency. 27. The staff urged that the central government cease running arrears to statutory bodies and private businesses as this causes countervailing tax arrears and lack of transparency in public accounts. Domestic arrears are contributing to create a number of distortions in public sector accounting, including the earmarking of revenue for debt service as a means of 6 Financial records for the medical benefits scheme have been sequestered since the establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate mismanagement of the scheme. The commission began public hearings during the mission’s visit.

The authorities agreed that these practices diminish accountability for expenditure decisions and the flexibility to reallocate budgetary resources to meet new priorities. B. Structural Reform 28. The authorities are receiving technical assistance from the Government of India for improving tax collection procedures at the Internal Revenue Department (IRD). So far the program has identified some EC$70 million in uncollected taxes from large corporate tax payers, part of which was collected in the latter part of 2001. The staff strongly urged implementation of key FAD recommendations, especially reforms in customs administration.7 29. The 2001 budget speech acknowledged overstaffing in the public sector. The training institute attached to the free trade zone continued to train civil servants in information technology, with a view to providing skills for employment in call centers that are to begin operations in 2002. In addition, the authorities have started to shift the focus of the vocational training scheme and apprenticeship program from granting wage subsidies to selected employers to providing individuals with training suitable for employment in the private sector, which the staff supported. Further, the staff urged that the recently submitted report on a comprehensive review of the civil service serve as a catalyst for reform and actions that would support the authorities’ objective of reducing the government’s payroll over the medium term. 30. The Antigua Public Utilities Authority (APUA) reported that revenue from the water tariff fell short of production costs, with losses covered implicitly by revenue from its electricity and telephone operations. The authorities outlined plans to improve the metering and distribution system for water and other utilities. The staff encouraged these improvements to enable the APUA to provide services more efficiently and to continue to improve its finances. The APUA was urged to avoid cross-subsidization and operate on a cost recovery basis for each type of service. 31. The authorities stated their intention to privatize management of the airport, except in the areas of security and safety. They emphasized that security requirements following the September 11 terrorist attack increase costs for which they hoped external assistance would be provided. The staff recommended that statutory bodies in commercial enterprises, such as 7A FAD technical assistance mission in April-May 2001 identified numerous problems in the organization and operations of the tax administration, which contributed to a lack of buoyancy of the tax system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- hotels and telecommunication services, be privatized. Privatization proceeds represent a potential source of funding for normalizing relations with external creditors and reducing public sector debt. C. Financial Sector Policies 32. While the ECCB has determined that the banking system in Antigua and Barbuda is sound and its supervision, adequate, the staff expressed concern about the effect of the central government’s deteriorating fiscal position on the domestic financial sector. * The government’s heavy demand for credit was the main cause for the banking system’s tight liquidity. Commercial banks have drawn down their foreign assets to meet this demand. The proportion of public sector credit in banks’ portfolios rose from 15 percent in 1996 to 20 percent in 2000, but declined slightly in 2001 as banks acted to limit their exposure, and earmarked revenue ensured payment of debt service. Nonetheless, the rapid increase in the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans reflected the pressure on the banking system generated by the government’s domestic arrears. The banks did not agree to the government’s request for a 90-day moratorium on debt service payment. Instead, nonbank financial institutions provided additional financing. The authorities saw the government’s heavy demand for financing from banks being reduced in the near future by their fiscal adjustment program. The staff highlighted the urgency of fiscal adjustment to reduce the risk to domestic financial intermediation. 33. In the offshore financial sector, the authorities attributed the lifting of financial advisories by the United Kingdom and United States to the introduction of new legislation designed to meet international standards and to improved financial supervision (Box 2). Antigua and Barbuda’s regulatory and enforcement agencies were devoting sufficient staff, with training from the ECCB and U.S., to carrying out their responsibilities, which included the establishment of a financial intelligence unit in the enforcement agency. The authorities indicated that the Fund-assisted self-assessment of the offshore financial sector provided needed focus on the actions needed to improve prudential standards and powers of the regulatory agencies. In a regional context, the authorities considered that common legislation, reporting requirements, and implementation standards relating to money laundering across countries would significantly improve the region’s ability to implement effectively FATF recommendations. * The ECCB is the regulatory and supervisory authority for banks in member countries and is constrained by law from disclosing indicators of individual bank soundness, which prevents a full assessment of compliance with the Basle core principles. Recognizing this limitation, the ECCB has agreed to seek legislative changes to permit such disclosure. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - D. External Policies 34. Trade reform is proceeding, albeit with delays. The authorities described detailed preparations for implementing, after long delays, the final phase of the CARICOM’s Common External Tariff (CET) in early 2002. The new tariff schedule reduces the top rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. To compensate for the revenue loss, only a few consumption taxes need to be raised given the increase in the customs service tax. The authorities assured the staff that unanticipated problems with introducing the CET had been overcome. The new tariff schedule and consumption tax rates were delayed to an expected effective date of March 1,2002 to synchronize their application with the introduction of the automated system for customs administration (ASYCUDA). Import licensing was reduced from applying to about half of import value to 15 percent. Import monopolies for vegetable and petroleum products remained. The staff reiterated that these monopolies should be eliminated. 35. The authorities acknowledged problems with underreporting and underinvoicing of imports, and said that this was being addressed through collaboration between the Customs and Excise Department and the revenue intelligence section of the IRD and Tax Compliance Unit.’ The staff welcomed these efforts and strongly urged implementation of FAD’s recommendations for dealing with the underinvoicing of imports, in particular, the establishment of a control unit in the customs administration. 36. The staff emphasized that in the context of the fixed exchange rate, external competitiveness depends crucially on fiscal discipline, wage moderation, and increased factor productivity. Data limitations precluded a full assessment of Antigua and Barbuda’s external competitiveness and trends in productivity. Information on tourist arrivals and their composition and origin shows a declining share of stayover arrivals in Antigua and Barbuda as well as a downward trend in the country’s share in the Caribbean tourism market, both for stayover and cruiseship visitors, during 1990-2001 (Box 3). These trends, along with appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, suggest possible slippage in external competitiveness. Notwithstanding exchange rate appreciation, the authorities defended the fixed peg given the strong link between import prices and wage demands in an open economy dependent on tourism. The staff cautioned the authorities about the need to preserve Antigua and Barbuda’s competitive position and argued that wage restraint in the public sector, especially after the September 11 attack, will help moderate wage cost in the private sector. It urged improvement of health, education, and physical infrastructure to raise productivity. 9 The staff presented preliminary analysis showing that Antigua and Barbuda’s imports derived from the direction of trade statistics greatly exceeded imports reported by the country, although an exact determination was complicated by the transshipment of goods.

The staff discussed shortcomings in statistical reporting, especially regarding the coverage, quality, and timeliness of price, trade, and balance of payments statistics. Fiscal information is limited to the estimates and outcome for the central government budget, which are reported with considerable delay. A consolidated account for the public sector is lacking and had to be constructed by the mission from its discussions with statutory bodies. The authorities reported progress in rectifying deficiencies in reporting of import data, citing recent compilation of imports for 1999 by the statistics department of the Ministry of Planning using customs invoices. The staff discussed steps for further improving the reporting of import data and strengthening the compilation of national and fiscal accounts. A detailed note summarizing the staffs observations and recommendations for improving statistical reporting was left with the authorities who expressed interest in technical assistance in this area. IV. MEDIUM-TERMOUTLOOK 38. The fiscal adjustment measures put forward by the authorities during the mission’s discussions-encompassing tax changes implemented by end-2001, intended reductions in discretionary tax concessions, and expenditure control measures-were incorporated in a baseline projection of medium-term economic performance through 2006 (Table 8). In this scenario, the consolidated public sector would show an overall deficit declining to % percent of GDP by 2006 and weak savings and investment throughout the medium term. It would also show continuing financing gaps, resulting in further accumulation of arrears. In this context, access to long-term external financing of growth-oriented investment projects would be limited and it is unlikely that the authorities’ medium-term growth objective would be achieved. Total public debt would not decline significantly relative to GDP. 39. The mission’s recommended additional fiscal adjustment was the basis for an alternative medium-term adjustment scenario through 2006 (Table 9). In this scenario, public sector saving would increase to 2% percent of GDP in 2002 and 7 percent of GDP in 2006, driven mainly by the improvement in the current balance of the central government. This would expand access to official long-term financing and allow more capital expenditure by the public sector over the medium term. Total public debt as a ratio to GDP would decline more sharply than in the baseline as payment of arrears reduce their nominal stock. The external current account deficit would narrow slightly during the medium term as higher tourist receipts and exports compensate for more imports from higher capital spending. The overall external account would show modest accumulation of reserves rather than the sustained losses throughout the medium term in the baseline.

The global economic slowdown and September 11 terrorist attack brought Antigua and Barbuda’s economic growth to a halt in 2001. After several years of deteriorating fiscal performance, the authorities proposed adjustment measures in the 2001 budget. Implementation fell short of intentions because of public resistance and the impact on tourism of the September 11 events. By the end of 2001, the government managed to implement measures that would improve fiscal performance somewhat in 2002. 41. The staff is concerned about the scope and magnitude of Antigua and Barbuda’s fiscal problems. In 2001 the central government’s substantial financing requirement tapped the finances of statutory bodies, crowded out the private sector by maintaining pressure for high interest rates, and led to further accumulation of external arrears, as well as arrears to the social security and medical benefits schemes, threatening their solvency. The exceptional means for financing the public sector by offshore financial institutions in 2001 raises concerns about transparency and governance. 42. The authorities, therefore, are urged to act promptly and with determination to address the fiscal problems, which would help set the basis for economic recovery. Achieving the authorities’ objective of raising annual real growth to 5 percent over the medium term requires increasing significantly public sector savings to support growth-oriented investment, alleviate crowding out of private investment, reduce steadily both domestic and external arrears of the government, and contain public sector debt. Ceasing arrears to businesses would help eliminate countervailing tax arrears and enhance transparency in the public accounts. 43. The authorities are collaborating with the ECCB and CDB to design an adjustment program to address the fiscal imbalances. The program calls for further improvement in tax administration, reduction of discretionary tax concessions, and cuts in current spending that include a wage freeze and reduction of government employment. However, the adjustment being considered by the authorities to bring the public sector’s overall deficit down to around 5K percent of GDP in 2002 would not be sufficient to improve public savings and investment enough to achieve their medium-term growth objective. 44. The staff is of the view that a substantially larger upfront fiscal adjustment than contemplated by the authorities would be needed. The staff recommends the implementation of measures to widen the tax base and reduce the public sector’s overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2002. This would reduce financial sector vulnerability and ease crowding out of the private sector, as well as support the capital expenditure needed over the medium term to achieve the authorities’ growth objective. It would also facilitate normalization of relations with external creditors and bring down domestic arrears. Over the medium term, policies should aim to raise public savings further and improve access to external financing to fund growth-oriented projects.

Statutory bodies should take measures to reduce operating costs and overstaffing, and link their tariff structures more closely to cost recovery. Water and electricity tariffs need to be examined with a view to reducing cross-subsidization. In addition, the efficiency of government and statutory bodies needs to be improved through structural reforms, including civil service reform, privatization of public enterprises, and tax reform. 46. The staff strongly supports the authorities’ intention to make the tax system more efficient over the medium term. In particular, the VAT should be introduced in the context of strengthened tax administration, based on FAD’s recommended timetable for reforms through 2004. The authorities are also encouraged to implement FAD’s recommendation for rationalizing the social security, medical benefits, and education levies by aligning their bases and increasing the rates for higher earnings. This could be part of a comprehensive reform of the social security scheme to ensure its long-term solvency. 47. The authorities are to be commended for implementing legislative and regulatory changes in the offshore financial sector and taking administrative actions that have led to the lifting of financial advisories by the United Kingdom and United States. The introduction of a tax on offshore banks and gaming businesses is an important response to the taxation issues raised by the OECD. The staff welcomes the authorities’ heightened focus on prudential standards and regulation of the offshore financial sector following the Fund- assisted self assessment. 48. Implementation of the final phase of the CARICOM’s common external tariff and the automated system for customs administration will be important. The customs administration would be strengthened by establishing a control unit to fight underinvoicing of imports and verify use of concessions. The reduction of import licensing is a positive step. The staff recommends elimination of remaining import monopolies. The authorities are urged to pursue sound fiscal and wage policies to enhance Antigua and Barbuda’s external competitiveness. 49. The staff strongly urges improvement in the collection of data on the financial operations of the central government and statutory bodies so as to provide the authorities with the information needed to conduct fiscal policy, monitor their adjustment efforts, and implement a public sector investment program. In addition, deficiencies in many other areas of statistical reporting, especially data on national income, prices, external statistics, and offshore business activity, need to be overcome. 50. It is recommended that Antigua and Barbuda remain on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

Antigua and Barbuda: Recent Developments in Financial Sector Regulation and Anti-Money Laundering Legislation The International Business Company Act (IBCA) p rovides the legal framework for offshore financial operations in Antigua and Barbuda. The supervisory and regulatory bodies are the International Financial Sector Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) and the Office of National Drug and Money Laundering Control Policy (ONDCP). In 2000-O 1 the government enacted several amendments to the legislation and strengthened aspects of the supervisory and regulatory framework.” On May 1,200 1, the Money Laundering Prevention Act (MLPA) was amended to: (i) expand the definition of money laundering to include specified offences, other than drug trafficking, that give rise to money laundering under Antigua and Barbuda law; (ii) allow the freezing of property belonging to offenders which had been given to third parties or the ownership of which has been obscured using corporate or trust structures; and (iii) simplify the conditions governing the use in local courts by Antiguan prosecution authorities of statements and official documents from other countries. On May 22,2001, the IFSRA assumed supervisory responsibility for intemet gaming companies licensed in Antigua and Barbuda. On August 1,200 1, the IBCA was amended to: (i) require all licensed banks to have a physical presence in Antigua and Barbuda, and (ii) require resident agents to keep records of the names of the owners of bearer shares in international business companies. The strengthening of the supervisory and regulatory framework has been implemented in various aspects. Guidance notes have been issued to both domestic and international banks requiring the implementation of adequate know-your-customer procedures and stipulating requirements for reporting suspicious transactions to the ONDCP. Bank staff have received training from international advisors in the implementation requirements under the MLPA. ONDCP officers have received training from international agencies, including the United Nations Drug Control Program and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Reflecting these actions, by end-200 1, the number of licensed international banks declined to 22 from 52 in 1998 and active international business companies to 8,000 from 11,000 in 1998. “For modifications made in 2000 see SM/01/58, February 20,2001, page 8.

Antigua and Barbuda: Developments in the Tourism Sector Tourism provides significant income, employment, and economic growth in the Caribbean region. In Antigua and Barbuda, it contributes about one-third of GDP and 70 percent of foreign exchange earnings. The global tourist market is getting more competitive with increasing number of destinations and price cutting by tour operators, major air carriers, and cruiselines. The total number of tourist visitors has increased steadily from 1990 through 200 1, except for a significant decline in 1995 as a result of Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn and a slight decline in 1999 due to two hurricanes that year (Box Figure). During 200 1, air stay-over visitors declined by about 3.5 percent but cruiseship visitors actually increased leading to a small increase of 3.9 percent in total visitors to the island. Thus, early indications are that the September 11 attack on the United States did not have a major negative impact on the tourist arrivals in Antigua and Barbuda; in fact, the impact was much smaller than that following the 1995 hurricanes. Most of the increase in tourist visitors has come from to cruiseship arrivals which have doubled in the Caribbean region since the 1980s. In contrast, air stay-over visitors to Antigua and Barbuda have declined from 40 percent of total visitors in 1990 to about 30 percent in 200 1. The origin of stayover visitors has changed significantly over the years. In 1990 nearly 44 percent of stayover visitors to the islands were from the United States, while today they account for just about 30 percent of the total. Air stayover visitors from the Caribbean region and other regions (including from Canada) have also declined over this period, although not as dramatically, whereas those from Europe have increased from 27 percent of the total in 1990 to nearly 44 percent in 200 1. The increasing share of European visitors, mainly from the United Kingdom, is attributable to “all- inclusive” vacation packages for Antigua and Barbuda that are cheaper relative to comparable packages to European destinations--even after taking into account the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to European currencies over much of this period. The overall appreciation of the dollar over this period made Caribbean destinations less attractive for U.S. visitors compared to alternative destinations. The increasing number of European stayover visitors on “all-inclusive” vacation packages have tended to contribute less to tourism expenditures than North American visitors on shorter vacations. Antigua and Barbuda’s share in the Caribbean tourism market has trended down over the period 1990-2001, both for stayover and cruiseship visitors. At the same time, tourism capacity, as measured by the number of available rooms and beds, has been rising and at least stable through 2000, which may have created a problem of overcapacity. Preliminary information shows declining capacity in 200 1. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - Box Figure.

The national accounts, fiscal and balance of payments data present significant problems. 1. Real sector National accounts compilation has been plagued by the continued absence of trade data since 1991. This has had a serious impact on the estimation of value added in some sectors, especially construction and wholesale and retail trade. For construction, alternative data sources include building applications approved annually and the government’s public sector investment projects. Wholesale and retail trade estimates are inflated based on movements in the CPI and patterns of consumer spending where there is not enough data derived from Annual Surveys. The consumer price index is not reported in a timely manner and has weights that are over 30 years old. An income and expenditure survey for 1998/99 has been completed with assistance from the ECCB and a revised CPI should be available later this year. Foreign trade data have not been compiled for over five years. Data on production have not been reported in recent times to STA. STA reports data received from bulletins produced by the ECCB. There is little coverage of labor market developments, as no official data for wages or unemployment are available. The Labor Department does produce annual estimates of employment based on information from the Social Security Board, but these are suspect. 2. Government finance Annual and quarterly data on central government finances published in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank are broadly in line with the methodology set up in the GFS Manual 1986. However, Antigua and Barbuda has not been reporting statistical information in recent years to STA for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook and IFS publications. To report government finance data to STA is highly recommended. 3. Monetary statistics Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag of six weeks. The data are reported to the Fund regularly. The monetary survey, however, does not include the accounts of credit unions that accept demand and other deposits. The ECCB is aware of the need to improve coverage of the monetary statistics and is taking steps to collect reliable data on credit unions. 4. Balance of payments Balance of payments statistics are provided to STA by the ECCB. These data are reported on an annual basis only and are not reported in the format recommended in the fifth (1993) edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. The latest data published in the International Financial Statistics are for 2000.” Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - APPENDIX II Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - ATTACHMENT III Public Information Notice (PIN) No. --/02/-- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE International Monetary Fund 700 lgth Street, NW Washington, D. C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with Antigua and Barbuda On March 15, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.’ Background Antigua and Barbuda has had uneven economic performance for several years, largely because of recurrent large fiscal deficits that resulted in a build-up of arrears and continuing loss of access to external financing. Following a 5 percent decline in real GDP in 1995 due to two hurricanes, real growth averaged 5 percent annually in 1996-99 as tourism recovered and post- hurricane reconstruction was brisk. Real GDP growth slowed to 2% percent in 2000 as this reconstruction winded down and tourism weakened. Real GDP is estimated to have stagnated in 2001 reflecting the global economic slowdown and September 11 attack on the United States. The overall deficit of the consolidated public sector rose by 1% percentage points in 2001 to an estimated 73/4 percent as increased government wage payments and capital spending more than offset improvements in collection of the corporate income tax and the effect of doubling the customs service charge to 10 percent in the second half of the year The public sector deficit in 2001 was mainly financed from external sources and accumulation of external debt service arrears. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [Month, dd, yyyy] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The government’s demand for funds drained the finances of statutory bodies and posed problems for the banking system. Government arrears to the social security and medical benefits schemes continued to accumulate, threatening their solvency. Broad money growth slowed to 2% percent in 2001 from 5% percent in 2000 and commercial bank credit stagnated, reflecting the economic slowdown (Table 4). As noted, the government’s high financing requirement contributed to tight liquidity conditions and high real interest rates. In addition, banks’ asset quality has declined with nonperforming loans increasing to IO’/2 percent of total loans at end-September 2001 from 7’/4 percent a year earlier. The external current account deficit is estimated to have decreased from 15% percent of GDP in 2000 to 13% percent of GDP in 2001, in part, because of a decline in imports after expiration of a special exemption from duties in 2000. Tourism receipts declined as arrivals dropped by 4 percent, reflecting the global economic slowdown and impact of the September 11 attack. The current account deficit was covered by an expansion of official financing, as well as disbursements from a US$40 million loan from an offshore financial institution. The overall deficit was 2% percent of GDP in 2001 and was financed mainly by the accumulation of arrears. The government took action to comply with international best practices in the offshore sector, including the closure of some banks, improving the money laundering prevention act, and strengthening enforcement. As a result, the United Kingdom and United States lifted their financial advisories in mid-2001.
