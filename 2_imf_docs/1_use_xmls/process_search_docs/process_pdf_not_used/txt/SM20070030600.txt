Saudi Arabia’s economic policies have been consistent with its commitments in the context of the Multilateral Consultations (Box 2). The authorities stressed that their investment policies were driven by domestic needs to meet the objectives of sustaining and diversifying economic growth, and increasing living standards of the population. Implementation of these home-grown policies would, as a byproduct, contribute to the reduction of global imbalances through higher imports of good and services. Investments to be implemented under PPP during 2007–12 outside the oil and gas sectors are expected to reach $220 billion.   C.   Fiscal Policy 14.      The authorities intend to continue with their expansionary fiscal policy stance, in support of private sector growth and poverty alleviation, since recent oil market developments implied a lasting improvement in the oil price outlook. Scope for discretionary spending has increased with the reduction of interest payments and the quality of spending has improved with much higher allocations for social sector program and capital spending. Going forward, the authorities noted that they would continue to balance the use of the additional oil revenue between higher spending (capital and social) and maintaining a fiscal surplus. Regionally balanced economic development (paragraph 27) through infrastructure development and poverty alleviation are also important objectives. While still relatively slow, the authorities noted a pick up in implementation of projects funded by surpluses set aside from 2004 and 2005 budgets, and indicated that the pace of implementation would accelerate in the coming years. The government’s Poverty Alleviation Strategy targets: a 10-percent increase in welfare payments to the poor; higher allowances for families with disabilities; elimination of absolute poverty (currently estimated at 1.3 percent of the population) by 2009; reduction of the relative poverty rate (currently estimated to be 18.5 percent) to 6–7 percent; and subsidized loans for low-income housing. 15.      Recent fiscal surpluses have enhanced fiscal flexibility and long-term fiscal sustainability significantly. Using a part of the surplus for retiring domestic debt has contributed to a large interest cost savings. This, together with higher investment income from deposits held with SAMA, which are placed abroad as part of SAMA’s foreign investments, will help sustain the higher spending on social and infrastructure programs over the longer term. The authorities observed that their investments through the Public Investment Fund (PIF) have been successful in broadening the industrial base and providing revenue for the Gross domestic debt(LHS)Interest(RHS)02040608010012020012002200320042005200620070.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.55.0Saudi Arabia: Central Government Debt and Interest Cost, 2000–07(In percent of GDP)Sources: Saudi Arabian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.

Progress in Implementing the Multilateral Consultations (MC) Policy  and Plans In the context of the MC discussions, the Saudi authorities stated their plans to increase public social and capital expenditures to meet pressing developmental needs (paragraphs 14 and 15) and implement oil sector projects to support the stability of the global oil market. They also stated their intention to maintain the pegtothe U.S. dollar, in line with the GCC agreement to establish the monetary union by 2010.  Progress in policy implementation: Expenditure. Total government expenditure increased by around 14 percent in 2006, 20 percent above the original budget. As envisaged, public spending accelerated in social and infrastructure areas, increasing by 19 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Out of the accumulated fiscal surpluses during 2004–06, the government has set aside $32 billion to finance social and infrastructure projects aimed at poverty alleviation over the medium term. Spending on these projects averaged $2 billion during 2004–06. Social and capital expenditures are expected to grow in 2007 by 10 percent and 46 percent, respectively.  Investments in the oil and gas sector. Implementation of the $80 billion investment plan for expansion of crude oil and gas production and refining capacity is progressing as scheduled despite a relatively weak short-term demand outlook for Saudi oil. Implementation of all previously announced upstream oil projects is on track, including development of the Khurais and Manifa oil fields.  Investments outside the oil and gas sector. Investment plans outside the oil and gas sectors have now increased to around $300 billion from the $200 billion estimated at the time of MC discussions. These projects, to be implemented mostly under PPP arrangements, are at different stages of implementation. Exchange rate policy. The authorities’ position in this regard remains unchanged (paragraphs 19–20 and Box 3).  Impact on the external current account balance. The above investments will contribute to the international efforts to help resolve global imbalances through increased imports of goods and services, which have already grown by 27 percent per year on average during 2005–06, and are expected to grow annually by 14 percent over 2007–12. If the authorities’ investment plans continue as envisaged, imports of goods and services will increase by $138 billion to 49 percent of GDP by 2012, entailing a significant reduction in the current account surplus.

The Saudi Labor Strategy (SLS) designed by the Ministry of Labor (MOL), lays down policy measures to comprehensively address labor-related issues in the Kingdom and has been submitted to the Supreme Economic Council. Current labor policies under the SLS aim at (i) applying the Saudiization of employment without hurting economic growth; (ii) implementing labor policies in a flexible manner to accommodate development needs; and (iii) increasing the competitiveness of the Saudi labor force by improving the education system. The government supports the Saudiization policy through training provided by the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF). The recent relaxation of the Saudiization targets for various sectors is consistent with this approach. As a result, the number of foreign employees in the private sector increased by 20 percent during 2004–06, reaching 5.6 million. In particular, the MOL has issued 1.22 million working visas in 2006, a 60 percent increase over the 2005 level.  F.   Statistical and Other Issues 30.      Progress has been made in improving the coverage and quality of statistical data. The Central Department of Statistics and Information completed the work on samples based on 2003 survey for private sector activities and is planning to use them for national accounts starting next year. SAMA is in the process of producing balance of payments statistics in line with the BOP5 manual. These improvements notwithstanding, further strengthening the statistical framework, particularly in the areas of national accounts, balances of payments, and fiscal operations, is needed to enhance transparency and improve policy formulation. Data are nonetheless sufficient for surveillance purposes. 31.      The target date for the planned monetary union continues to be 2010 (Box 4). The authorities noted that important progress was made at the GCC summit on May 15, 2007, in which the GCC heads of states reached agreements on the convergence criteria, the GCC customs union, and the common market. They are aware that major efforts will be needed to implement the remaining agenda by 2010, and particularly to reach agreement on the nature and scope of the union’s monetary authority.  32.      The authorities estimate total external development assistance to exceed one percent of GDP annually over the past decades. The Kingdom has provided full debt relief to some HIPC countries that have reached completion point, and partial relief to some others. Considerable assistance has been allocated to the region, including to Lebanon, West Bank and Gaza, and Iraq. In addition to ODA, Saudi Arabia employs a large number of foreign laborers, mainly from the low-income countries in the region and beyond, who sent home remittances amounting to $14.6 billion in 2006.

The GCC was established in 1981 to foster political, security, and economic cooperation among Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The economies of the six members have many similarities and some important differences. While they are largely dependent on hydrocarbon revenue, the degree of this dependence varies. Per capita income and, more recently, inflation rates also vary considerably. The GCC authorities decided in 2001 to establish a monetary union by 2010, although Oman recently announced that it would join the union later. While establishing the GCC monetary union is mainly a political decision, it can have significant economic benefits, including improving efficiency, lowering transaction costs, supporting intra-regional investment and diversification efforts, and acting as a catalyst for broader reforms (Occasional Paper No. 223, 2003).  Progress achieved. GCC countries have achieved virtually free intra-regional mobility of goods, national labor, and capital. All members have pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar since 2003, except for Kuwait which moved in May 2007 to a peg to an undisclosed currency basket. A common external customs tariff was also introduced in 2003, and five convergence criteria (on inflation, interest rates, reserves, fiscal balance, and public debt) have been agreed in principle. The Fund has provided advice on the required financial and fiscal statistical infrastructure, as well as on a common value-added tax (VAT). The European Central Bank has provided technical assistance on the supervisory framework, payments system, and the legal and regulatory framework for the planned GCC monetary authority. The GCC secretariat recently distributed a draft agreement for the monetary union for comments by country authorities.  Remaining challenges. With the 2010 target date approaching, there is an urgent need to reach agreement on the nature and scope of the GCC monetary authority and to amend national legislations to provide for the establishment of that authority and the introduction of a common currency. Higher inflation rates in some of the members (United Arab Emirates and Qatar) would need to converge toward the GCC’s low average. Furthermore, establishing a full-fledged customs union and a common market by the target date of 2008 would contribute to fostering the credibility of the integration time table. Reaching agreement on the customs union has been complicated by the bilateral free trade agreements concluded by some GCC countries and the issues outstanding with regard to the sharing of customs revenue. Finally, it is essential to expedite the harmonization of key regulatory and supervisory frameworks, especially for the financial sector, and of statistical methodologies for key financial and economic indicators.    01234567Jan-03Jun-03Nov-03Apr-04Sep-04Feb-05Jul-05Dec-05May-06Oct-06Higest GCC Discount RateFED Funds RateLowest GCC Discount RateGCC Countries: Reference Rates and the U.S. Federal Funds Rate, 2003–06(In percent at the end of the period)Sources: Country authorities; and Federal Reserve Bank New York.Highest GCC inflation rateLowest GCC inflation rateU.S. inflation rate024681012142003200420052006GCC Countries: CPI Inflation Trend, 2003–06(In percent)Source: National authorities.GDP per capita (in U.S. dollar)21,44731,00013,84662,91414,73338,613Percentage share of the oil sector in GDP 1/26.059.849.461.954.137.3Total hydrocarbon reserves 2/0.7111.611.9177.5307.7135.6Oil exports (millions of barrels per day)0.12.30.70.78.32.7CPI (period average; percent change)3.03.53.211.62.29.3Current account balance (percent of GDP)17.244.18.427.827.422.0Interest rates (interbank rates) 3/5.305.353.405.094.865.32   Sources: Country authorities; and Fund staff estimates.1/ For Bahrain and Qatar, the share indicated is for the hydrocarbon sector.2/ Oil and natural gas, in billions of oil equivalent barrels at end-2005.3/ Shortest maturity available interbank deposit rates (overnight to three months).GCC Countries: Selected Economic Indicators, 2006 BHRKWTOMNQATSAUU.A.E.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
