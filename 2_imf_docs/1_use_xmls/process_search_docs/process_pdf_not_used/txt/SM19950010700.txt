Introduction A deterioration in the fiscal situation over the last years has increased pressure on the balance of payments and led to a drawdown of official foreign assets. The hydrocarbon sector of the economy remained depressed because of low crude oil prices. The economy has been diversifying, with growth in the non-oil sector benefitting from government expenditure, a free exchange and trade system, and an outward-oriented economic strategy. Despite progress in certain areas, serious data deficiencies and nondisclosure of certain information continue to hamper a comprehensive assessment of economic developments and prospects. 2. Develonments in 1993 and 1994 Reflecting the decline in oil export receipts and the strong domestic demand in 1993-94, the U.A.E. economy experienced a weakening of its fiscal and external positions. After widening to 10 percent of GDP in 1993, the overall fiscal deficit, excluding investment income from official foreign assets, rose to 12 percent in 1994. At the same time there was an acceleration in the expansion of net domestic assets of the banking system reflecting higher net claims on government, as well as credit to official entities and the private sector. Further progress was made in strengthening the capital base of the banks and improving the quality of their assets. With the strong domestic demand, import growth remained high, contributing to a sharp reduction in the current account surplus, which declined from the equivalent of 10.4 percent of GDP in 1992 to 2.7 percent in 1993 and 1.3 percent in 1994. Real GDP declined by 1.4 percent in 1993, before expanding by 1.1 percent in 1994, as buoyant activity in the non-oil sector offset the negative growth of the oil sector. 3. Renort on the discussions The central issue of the discussions was the medium-term unsustainability of the large budget deficits and the need for fiscal consolidation, given the authorities' objectives of fostering economic growth and maintaining financial stability. Although, with new revenue measures, the budget deficit in 1995 would narrow slightly, projections indicate that in the absence of additional policy adjustments, large deficits would persist over the medium term. The discussion therefore focussed on the need to adopt a comprehensive medium-term program of fiscal consolidation, with clearly defined targets and precise measures of revenue enhancements and expenditure cuts. While possible measures were under consideration, the authorities were not in a position to provide details. However, they remained opposed to introducing new taxes which, in their view, would undermine private confidence and entail high administrative costs.

The staff welcomed the authorities' intention to privatize two major public enterprises and urged the authorities to formulate a comprehensive program of privatization. Information and macroeconomic management systems have not kept pace with the increasing complexity of the economy. The authorities agreed with a proposed action plan to remedy data deficiencies and intended to enhance coordination of economic policy decisions between the emirate and federal governments. 4. Staff appraisal The open economic system has contributed to the diversification of the U.A.E. economy. However, with declining world oil prices and a continued high level of expenditure, the fiscal situation has deteriorated significantly. If policies were to remain unchanged, large fiscal deficits would persist over the medium term, entailing a further drawdown of official foreign assets and undermining confidence in economic management. A forceful fiscal consolidation program at the emirate and federal government levels is required, which would support monetary policy in achieving its price and exchange rate objectives. With a view to strengthening the private non-oil sector and reducing its dependence on government support, the authorities will need to cut subsidies and implement a comprehensive plan of privatization. There is an urgent need to strengthen the statistical base and correct data deficiencies. In addition, economic policy decision-making would greatly benefit from a better coordination between the emirate and federal governments and the formulation of a medium- term macroeconomic framework.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) were held in Abu Dhabi during March 6-22, 1995. u The U.A.E. is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 25, 1994 (SM/94/1 and correction 1, and SM/94/23 and correction 1). On that occasion, Executive Directors observed that the U.A.E.'s highly open economy, its pegged exchange rate arrangement, and prudent economic and financial policies had contributed to price stability and had fostered non- oil sector development. Directors emphasized, however, the need for medium- term adjustment efforts aimed at ensuring a sustainable fiscal and balance of payments position. They cautioned that if allowed to persist, the weakening in the fiscal position could undermine exchange rate stability and medium-term balance of payments viability. Directors urged the authorities to take early action to improve the quality and coverage of economic data. The U.A.E. accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement in February 1974. The U.A.E.'s relations with the Fund and data issues are presented in Appendices I and II, respectively. Appendix III contains the main assumptions of the medium-term scenario. Appendix IV provides social and demographic indicators. Despite significant progress in the area of money and banking statistics, deficiencies in data remain in other areas, including national accounts, prices, public finances, and the balance of payments. Data regarding the petroleum sector and official foreign assets other than those of the Central Bank have not been disclosed to Fund missions. These factors have hampered a comprehensive analysis of economic developments and medium- term prospects. A detailed assessment of the data problems in the U.A.E., together with a proposed plan of action to remedy the serious deficiencies, are provided in Appendix II. u The U.A.E. representatives included H-E. Ahmed Humaid Al-Tayer, Minister of State for Finance and Industry, H.E. Saeed Bin Ghubash, Minister of Economy and Trade, H.E. Sultan Bin Nasser Al-Suwaidi, Governor of the Central Bank of the U.A.E., and other senior officials of various federal ministries, the Central Bank, and emirates' departments and agencies. The staff representatives were Messrs. Jbili (head), Duran, Enger, Rizavi, Darbar (EP), all MED, Mr. Wasfy (STA), and Ms. Nguyen (Administrative Assistant, MED). Mr. Shaalan, Executive Director, attended the concluding policy meetings.

Although its share in GDP has been declining, tjhe oil sector continues to dominate the economy, providing on average 80 plercent of fiscal revenue and about 60 percent of export earnings in 1990-94. The U.A.E. is also a significant exporter of liquefied natural gas, which accounts for about 5 percent of total export earnings. Over time, the U.A.E. has been successful in developing the energy sector, expanding non-oil activities, building a modem infrastructure, improving education and social services, and accumulating a large stock of official assets. The diversification of the economy has been supported by prudent financial policies, a free exchange and a liberal trade system, an outward-oriented economic strategy supportive of private sector initiative, and increased confidence in financial institutions. The sustained growth of the non-oil sector in recent years, owing in part to high levels of government spending, has cushioned the impact of the depressed oil sector. This, together with substantial use of accumulated foreign assets, has helped1 the economy weather the adverse impact of the regional crisis in 1990-91. However, a. marked deterioration in the fiscal accounts in recent years has led to increased pressure on the balance of payments and a drawdown of official foreign assets. III. DeveloDments and Policies in 1993 and 1994 Reflecting a lower OPEC quota allocation and lower prices, oil production and exports fell in 1993 (Tables 1 and 2). Despite negative growth in the oil sector, the decline in total real GDP is estimated to have been limited to 1.4 percent, as the non-oil sector continued its strong performance and recorded a growth rate of 5.6 percent; construction activity and financial services exp.anded markedly, supported by increased government spending and private secto'r investment (Chart 1). The continued growth of agriculture reflected the provision of substantial government subsidies and incentives. The consolidated budget deficit, including grants extended but excluding investment income from official foreign assets, widened to 10 percent of GDP in 1993, reflecting a decline of 13.5 percent in total revenue while total expenditure rose by 5.5 percent (Table 3). The decline in revenue was mainly on account of lower oil prices. Non-oil revenue was l-J The emirates are: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al-Khaimah, Ajman, Fujeirah, and Umm-Al-Qawain.

While the growth of current expenditure was limited to 2 percent, capital expenditure and lending rose by 17 percent, due to a sharp increase in outlays for electricity and water projects. The overall fiscal deficit was financed by the use of income from foreign official assets, the proceeds of liquidation of part of these assets, and a drawdown of government deposits with the banking system. IJ Fueled by a strong expansion in net domestic assets, and notwithstanding a slight decline in net foreign assets, the overall liquidity growth in 1993 accelerated to 7 percent (Table 4). The growth of net domestic assets reflected higher net claims on government and credit to official entities (mainly gas companies) and the private sector. The external current account registered a surplus equivalent to 2.7 percent of GDP in 1993 compared to 10.4 percent of GDP in the previous year (Table 5). This sharp deterioration was due mainly to a decline of nearly 14 percent in oil export earnings and continued high growth of imports on account of strong domestic d.emand, stimulated by large government capital expenditure and net lending. The overall balance registered a surplus of lJSSO.4 billion, notwithstanding a deficit of the capital account of USSO. billion. 2J In 1994, oil export earnings fell further, while domestic demand pressures remained strong. Activity in the non-oil sector remained buoyant with value added increasing by an estimated 5 percent, reflecting a substantial increase in government development expenditure and lending as well as rising demand for re-exports. As a result, total GDP is estimated to have reverted to a modest positive growth of 1.1 percent in real terms. Inflation remained moderate, with the consumer price index rising by 4.6 percent, or slightly lower than in 1993. The fiscal situation deteriorated further, despite the introduction of new revenue measures. The consolidated fiscal deficit, including grants extended but excluding income from official foreign assets, widened to an lJ The size of the official foreign assets and related income, which are managed by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), have not been disclosed to Fund missions. Data published in IFS show a total of bank- intermediated gross foreign assets of the U.A.E. of about US$42 billion at end-1994. No breakdown between official and private holdings is available. Because of lack of information on the income from official foreign assets, the overall fiscal deficit is higher than it would be if such income were included.

The latter included increases in electricity and water tariffs, introduction of various new fees and increases of existing ones, and an increase in the import duty rate to 4 percent. While current outlays were reduced by 6 percent, development expenditure and net lending rose by about 20 percent on account of projects for urban development and housing. As in 1993, most of the financing of the overall deficit was provided by income from, and drawdown of, official foreign assets. In addition, there was a Dh 2.8 billion deterioration in the government's net creditor position with the banking system. Reflecting the substantially higher rates of growth of credit to the private sector and public entities, net domestic assets rose by 15.5 percent of beginning money stock. The growth of broad money was much lower as the liquidity created by domestic credit operations spilled over into the balance of payments and there was a sharp decline in the net foreign assets of the banking system. This decline was concentrated at the commercial banks, reflecting in particular an increase in their foreign liabilities by Dh 6.5 billion, while the net foreign assets position of the Central Bank improved by Dh 2.2 billion. The recourse by commercial banks to increased borrowings from branches abroad to finance the domestic credit expansion was facilitated by the easy liquidity position of several of those branches, which in the past had often attracted deposits from customers of the domestic banks. Faced with the rapid increase in domestic credit, and in an effort to absorb commercial bank liquidity, the Central Bank increased sales of certificates of deposit. lJ As a result, bank holdings of certificates of deposits rose by Dh 2.8 billion in 1994. The absorption of commercial bank liquidity, together with the rise in interest rates by about 3 percentage points in 1994, in line with increases in interest rates on U.S. dollar-denominated assets, helped contain the growth of private sector credit to 9 percent of beginning money stock. 2J Further progress was made in strengthening the financial position of the banking system. Because of the increases in capital of several banks, which continued in early 1995, all banks were in compliance with the required minimum capital/asset ratio of 10 percent and with the regulation limiting exposure to a single borrower or group of related borrowers to 7 percent of capital. In view of the substantial increase of consumer loans extended in 1994 and in order to prevent defaults, the commercial banks have been instructed to strengthen the assessment of creditworthiness of borrowers. 3/ lJ Starting in 1994, the certificates of deposits denominated in dirhams could be purchased either in dirhams or in U.S. dollars. 2J Interest rates are fully market-determined and track closely the rates on U.S. dollar-denominated assets (Table 39 of the Statistical Annex). 3J The share of consumer loans in total bank credit has remained relatively small.

The continued strong, albeit slowing, growth of imports was generated by the sharp rise in government investment expenditure and net lending, as well as the expansion in bank credit. Accordingly, the external current account surplus narrowed to 1.3 percent of GDP in 1994. However, reflecting the combined effect of large short-term capital inflows in the form of increases in commercial banks' foreign liabilities and estimated public sector ca.pital inflows to finance the budget deficit, the capital account recorded a surplus of IJSSO.2 billion and the overall balance of payments was again in surplus of USSO. 'billion. Gross official reserves of the Central Bank stood at USS6.7 billion at end-1994, equivalent to 3.7 months of imports of g,oods. The U.A.E. dirham, although officially pegged to the SDR, has effectively been linked to the U.S. dollar at a central rate of Dh 3.686 per dollar since November 1980 (Chart 2). The :real effective exchange rate of the dirham is estimated to have appreciated by about 5 percent in 1993 and remained largely unchanged in 1994. However, during the first quarter of 1995, there was a 9.0 percent depreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The U.A.E. maintains a liberal trade regime and an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions as well as capital transactions. u IV. ReDort on the Discussions The policy discussions focused on prospects and policies for 1995 and the medium term. The central issue was the sustainability of the large fiscal deficits over the medium term and the need for fiscal consolidation, as detailed below. The discussions als'o covered progress achieved in banking regulation and supervision, policies to promote the development of the private sector while reducing its dependence on government support, and the need to improve economic and financial data and strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination. u The U.A.E. has notified the Fund, in accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144 of restrictions imposed in respect of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and M:ontenegro) pursuant to U.N.

Key elements of these policies are the open and liberal economic system characterized by free movements of capital, the provision of adequate infrastructure and social services, and the pursuit of macroeconomic policies that promote financial stability and enhance the credibility o.f the exchange rate peg. The discussion was hampered by data deficiencies and a lack of disclosure of information regarding the oil sector, investment income, and the sale of official foreign assets. This precluded an ademquate assessment of medium-term fiscal sustainability. 1. Real sector develonments. nolicies. and nroiections a. Oil and gas The U.A.E. representatives reiterated their policy to adhere to OPEC decisions on output quotas and to maintain moderation in petroleum pricing in order to promote stability in the world oil market. According to industry sources, the U.A.E. plans to increase its crude oil production capacity from the present 2.4 mbd to about 3.0 mbd over the medium term. Offshore production capacity would be raised by developing new wells and increasing the productivity of existing ones. However, most of the expansion in capacity would come from onshore wells, given the U.A.E.'s well established expertise in the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques. To increase the output of refined products for export, the authorities recently approved the expansion and modernization of the Al-Ruwais oil refinery, which will allow a shift of its production toward lighter petroleum products that are more in demand in the U.A.E.'o export markets. Assuming that oil production would. rise from the present 2.2 mbd to 2.5 mbd in the year 2000, and on the basis of the World Economic Outlook projections for crude oil prices, the U.A.E.'s oil export receipts are projected to rise from USS11.7 billion in 1994 to USS12.6 billion in 1995, and to USS15.3 billion by the year 2,000. lJ With the startup of an additional gas train in Das Island, the production capacity of liquified natural gas (LNG), which increased from about 3 million tons per year (mty) in 1993 to some 4 mty in 1994, is projected to reach 5 mty by the end of 1995. The development of a new onshore natural gas field will allow production of more gas for power generation, and increase substantially the production of condensates. Consequently, the U.A.E. would become an important supplier of butane and l.J Staff medium-term oil projections are based on the assumption that U.A.E.'s oil production would increase in line with the growth of world demand outside Russia. If OPEC production and the share of the U.A.E. were to remain unchanged, total export receipts would be lower by about US$l billion per year on average in 1996-2000.

Export earnings from gas are expected to increase from an estimated USS1.4 billion in 1994 to USS1.8 billion in 1995, and then to rise gradually to USS2.3 billion by the year 2000. b. Non-oil sector The U.A.E. representatives explained that several factors had contributed to the sustained growth of the non-oil sector in recent years. These included large investments in electricity, water, urban development and other infrastructure, a rapid development of financial and other services, as well as a strong demand for re-exports. More importantly, an open economic system, free movement of capital, and financial stability had provided a supporting environment for non-oil activities. The representatives acknowledged that government support through the provision of incentives and subsidies, as well as the high level of government expenditure, had also played an important role. They realized that it was essential to enhance the regulatory framework in order to keep up with the needs of a modern and dynamic economy. The staff representatives welcomed the authorities' decision to reform the commerce and company laws, upgrade accounting and auditing regulations, and strengthen the legislative framework governing professional occupations. They also welcomed the preparations for the establishment of a stock exchange and encouraged the authorities to put in place the necessary regulatory framework. The U.A.E. representatives agreed on the need to reduce the private sector's dependence on government subsidies and enable it to engage in activities from which the government could withdraw. lJ With a view to fostering a climate of competition, increase productivity, and improve resource allocation, implicit subsidies provided by the federal and emirate governments would need to be eliminated gradually. The mission commended the authorities for the steps already taken in this respect, including increasing electricity and water tariffs, and raising the fees and user charges for health services. It encouraged the authorities to consider a further rationalization and reduction of government subsidies and reiterated the need for a study of explicit and implicit subsidies, including an estimate of their size and an assessment of their distortive effects. To enhance private sector involvement in the economy, the authorities are planning to privatize the Emirates General Petroleum Corporation (a petroleum distribution company) and the Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade (an investment company). While welcoming the envisaged action, the mission encouraged the authorities to expand the scope of privatization within the framework of a comprehensive plan of action with well-defined priorities, clearly delineated sectors, and a timetable. The U.A.E. representatives indicated that the privatization could be extended to lJ Explicit subsidies and transfers are estimated at 3.3 percent of GDP in 1994 (see Table 18 in the Statistical Annex). No estimate of implicit subsidization is available.

However, they precluded the possibility of privatization of the oil industry. With regard to labor market policies, the U.A.E. representatives indicated that unemployment was very low and was mainly of frictional nature. Wages in the private sector a're determined by market forces, while wage rates in the public sector have not changed for many years. There is no pension and social security system in the private sector; however, extensive health care services are provided by the public sector at low fees. The authorities intend to strengthen vocational training programs and increase the participation of nationals in the labor force. 2. Financial policies and orosnects a. Fiscal nolicv The staff representatives underscored that a forceful fiscal adjustment had been unduly delayed at the cost of running down part of the government's foreign assets. Medium-term fiscal projections prepared by the mission under the assumption of unchanged policies, and based on current WE0 projections of oil export prices, indicate that large overall fiscal deficits would persist during the period up to the year 2000, averaging close to 10 percent of GDP' (Table 6). Although the absence of information on sources of financing precluded a complete assessment of the economic implications of these deficits, the miosion cautioned that they would be unsustainable. It pointed out that bank financing would aggravate financial imbalances and erode private sector confidence. Even if the deficits could be fully financed from nonbank sources, through a further drawdown of official foreign assets, this would, over time, undermine confidence in economic management and financial stability. The staff representatives, therefore, urged the authorities to formulate a comprehensive medium-term program of fiscal consolidation with clearly defined targets and precise revenue and expenditure measures. They reiterated the suggestions made by previous Fund missions regarding specific measures, including introducing significant cuts in subsidies to the private and public sectors, containing the wage bill by reducing excess staff in the civil service, rationalizing public investment expenditure, eliminating unproductive expenditure, and introducing a broad-based #consumption tax as well as corporate and personal income taxes. l-J lJ Given the lack of information on medium-term investment plans and on the authorities' fiscal pollicy stance, a medium-term fiscal consolidation scenario was not discussed.

Total revenue is likely to rise by 9 percent, reflecting an increase in oil revenue by 6 percent and in other revenue by 21 percent. The latter would be on account of the full-year impact of higher customs duties and fees, which were introduced in 1994, and of additional increases in fees and charges which became effective in early 1995. Total government expenditure is expected to grow by 3 percent only, owing to a moderate expansion of capital expenditure, as a number of infrastructure projects are expected to come to near completion in 1995. Under these assumptions, the overall consolidated fiscal deficit would narrow slightly to about 10 percent of GDP, entailing an additional drawdown of official foreign assets, possibly in combination with a further deterioration in the net position of the government with the banking system. The U.A.E. representatives indicated that the authorities were examining the possibility of introducing expenditure cuts at the federal and emirate levels and, if warranted, would introduce additional revenue measures. Because these revenue and expenditure measures were still under discussion, the representatives were not in a position to provide details about them, including their timing or the likely budgetary savings. However, they indicated that possible budgetary savings on current expenditure could be achieved through a streamlining of the civil service, cuts in subsidies, and a reduction in defense spending. lJ With regard to development expenditure, the U.A.E. representatives pointed to a possible decline in investment expenditure over the medium term owing to the completion of certain maj0.r infrrastructure projects. However, precise information on the programming of public sector development projects was not available. While they remained open to further increases in nontax revenue, the U.A.E. representatives reiterated their long-held position against introducing taxes, which, in their view, would undermine private sector confidence and entail high administrative costs. The staff representatives underlined the benefits of early rather than delayed actions, so as to ensure an orderly adjustment and avoid disruptive economic and social effects. b. Monetarv policv and exchange rate management The U.A.E. representatives expected the rate of credit expansion to decelerate in 1995, reflecting the nonrecurrence of the substantial bank borrowing by the energy sector that took place in 1993 and 1994 and the relatively stringent prudential requirements. Overall, monetary policy would be directed at maintaining stabili.ty and confidence in the domestic IJ Military expenditure is estimated at 4.6 percent of GDP on average during the period 1990-94.

The central bank would stand ready to take appropriate measures to reduce excess liquidity, if the need arises, including through further issuance of certificates of deposit. Domestic interest rates would continue to track closely those of corresponding assets denominated in U.S. dollars, thereby supporting the exchange rate system. The representatives agreed with the staff on the need to contain the deterioration of the government's position with the banking system, so as to avoid the risk of crowding out private sector credit. The U.A.E. representatives noted that the commercial banks' profitability was strong in 1994, reflecting business conditions and improved management. The authorities intend to further strengthen and modernize the operations and management of banking institutions through the upgrading of accounting standards, internal control procedures and regulations. The Central Bank also intends to continue to strengthen its supervision and control of commercial banks and establish a credit reporting system that would facilitate the monitoring of credit to individuals and enhance the commercial banks' ability to assess their creditworthiness. 3. External sector. exchange and trade svstem. and regional issues Medium-term balance of payments projections (1996-2000) prepared by the mission under the assumption of unchanged policies show a gradual- deterioration in the external current account, resulting in deficits equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP on average for the rest of the decade (Tables 6 and 7). Despite the significant increase in exports of oil, gas, and other non-oil items, the projected deterioration would essentially reflect a somewhat strong domestic demand sustained by large fiscal deficits under the assumption of unchanged policies. The growth of the non-oil sector is projected to decline, as confidence in macroeconomic management would be undermined by persistent large fiscal deficits. The mission underscored the illustrative nature of the balance of payments projections, and highlighted the limitations stemming from the lack of information on potential sources of financing of the fiscal deficits. lJ Estimates of the 1995 balance of payments indicate a further reduction in the external current account surplus to about 0.1 percent of GDP in 1995, down from the equivalent of 1.3 percent in 1994. Total export receipts are projected to increase by about 10 percent, owing to higher oil prices, an increase in the growth of gas export earnings by nearly 30 percent due to additional export capacity, and a continued growth of non-oil exports. However, this will be more than offset by a projected increase in import payments of about 10 percent, reflecting the continued strong growth in domestic demand, and by a projected increase in the outflow of private transfers. lJ The main assumptions underlying the projections for the medium-term balance of payments scenario are given in Appendix III.

The de facto peg to the U.S. dollar had helped maintain a low inflation rate and fostered private sector confidence. The representatives expressed concern regarding the impact on the U.A.E. economy of the recent sharp depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, given that U.A.E. exports of crude oil are denominated in U.S. dollars, and imports from Japan represent on average about 15 percent of total imports. They emphasized, however, that the authorities remain strongly committed to the current exchange rate arrangement. The representatives pointed to the low inflation rate in the U.A.E. and the continued growth of non-oil exports as indications of the appropriateness of the current exchange rate level. The U.A.E. authorities reiterated their strong commitment to fostering regional economic cooperation in the context of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). u During the last GCC summmit held in Bahrain in December 1994, member countries agreed to give priority to strengthening further regional trade in goods and services, and greater access to financial markets in member countries. In a step toward establishing a common external tariff, the U.A.E. in 1994 took the decision to raise its import duties from 1 to 4 percent. The U.A.E. representatives, however, expressed reservation regarding introducing further increases in import duties while the current global trend was to reduce them. As a result of the last GCC summit, six ministerial committees were set up to examine region-wide coordination regarding a number of issues, including employment generation, industrial growth, utilization of advanced technology and expansion of research, and development of project-related support services. In March 1994, the U.A.E. became a member of GATT. Ratification of the final act of the Uruguay Round is awaiting the conclusion of discussions underway regarding the time schedule allowed for the removal of subsidies to domestic sectors such as agriculture, the opening up of the domestic market for financial services, and the ownership of telecommunication facilities. u The U.A.E. representatives stated that discussions were also continuing with the European Union (E.U.) regarding the establishment of a free trade arrangement between the GCC and the E.U. Traditionally, the U.A.E. has been an important source of development assistance --to Arab countries in particular and developing countries in general. The authorities indicated that in the face of rising budget deficits, the country may not be able to maintain its foreign assistance at u Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC); other members of the GCC are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. u Among the GCC countries, Bahrain and Kuwait have become members of the World Trade Organization.

Information and economic manazemel& The staff representatives underscored that the information and macroeconomic management systems in the U.A.E. have not kept pace with the development and the increasing complexity of the economy. These systems consist of adequate collection of reliable data, dissemination of economic and financial information in a timely manner, coordination of macroeconomic policy decisions at the emirate and federal levels, and close follow-up of implementation. In reviewing with the authorities the status of economic and financial information in the U.A.E., the staff representatives indicated that while significant progress has been achieved in the area of money and banking, serious deficiencies and gaps remained in the areas of balance of payments, national accounts, prices, and public finances. The mission stressed that these data deficiencies hamper economic and financial analysis and undermine macroeconomic management, and it proposed an action plan to address the weaknesses in key areas. It also emphasizeld the need to give high priority and devote sufficient human and financial resources to this task (see Appendix II). The U.A.E. representatives highlighted the difficulties related to the federal structure of the government, in which the individual emirates retain a large degree of autonomy in economic affairs. Nonetheless, they committed themselves to addressing data issues along the lines of the staff proposed action plan. In this regard, recourse to further technical assistance from the Fund may be required. The U.A.E. representatives also shared the staff's views that better coordination of policy decisions and follow-up of implementation at the emirate and federal levels would strengthen economic management, avoid duplication of efforts, and help improve resource allocation. This would be particularly helpful in the areas of fiscal policy and management, in connection with the requir'ed efforts to bring down the fiscal deficit. The U.A.E. representatives indicated that they had set up an inter-ministerial committee to examine this issue, including the recommendations of the Fund technical assistance mission in the area of financial management. u Beyond the required coordination in the fiscal area, the staff representatives highlighted the usefulness of formulating a medium-term macroeconomic framework that would serve to guide future economic policy decisions. 3;/ The U.A.E. development assistance amounted to the equivalent of about 2.1 percent of GDP over the period 1990-91. u These recommendations are contained in the FAD technical assistance report: "United Arab Emirates: The Government Financial Management System," June 1994.

Staff Appraisal The authorities of the United Arab Emirates have maintained a commendably open economic system characterized by free movements of capital and labor. Inflation has been low, the exchange rate stable, and the private sector has flourished. However, the fiscal situation has deteriorated significantly in recent years owing to the decline in world market prices of oil while government expenditure has remained relatively high. Despite efforts at increasing nontax revenues and containing the growth of current expenditure, large fiscal deficits were recorded in 1993-94 and the prospects for 1995 and the medium-term are similar. So far, the authorities have been able to finance these deficits by drawing down part of their official foreign assets, but this cannot be sustained over an extended period. The lack of fiscal adjustment could seriously undermine confidence in economic and financial management. The authorities should formulate and implement a medium-term fiscal consolidation program at the emirate and federal levels with clear targets and precise revenue and expenditure measures. Efforts in this area should focus on cutting subsidies, reducing the growth of wages and salaries, rationalizing public sector investment expenditure, eliminating waste, and reducing unproductive expenditure. On the revenue side, the authorities should consider a wide range of revenue-raising measures, including a broad- based consumption tax and corporate and income taxes. Close coordination with other GCC member countries in the area of direct and indirect taxation would be useful. The authorities' generally prudent monetary policy and the pegged exchange rate arrangement, together with an open trade and financial system, have contributed to relatively stable domestic prices and the maintenance of private sector confidence. A strengthening of the fiscal position would help underpin the price and exchange rate objectives that monetary policy alone cannot achieve. Thus, it is essential that the burden of adjustment fall on fiscal policy. The staff welcomes the progress in strengthening banking regulation and supervision and the intention of the authorities to upgrade accounting standards, internal control procedures, and the Central Bank supervision. In addition, the establishment of a credit reporting system would facilitate the monitoring of consumer loans and enhance the commercial banks' ability to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. Current efforts to promote non-oil activity should be complemented by actions to reduce private sector dependency on government subsidies and support. The staff encourages the authorities to reduce further subsidies, including through increases in electricity and water tariffs and in fees and charges for health services. The envisaged privatization of public enterprises is welcome and the authorities should formulate and implement a comprehensive plan of action in this area which would send strong signals regarding their commitment to promote private sector activity. Noting the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - steps envisaged to establish a stock exchange in the U.A.E., the staff encourages the authorities to put in place the necessary regulatory and supervisory framework. There is an urgent need to strengthen the statistical data base and remedy the serious data deficiencies along the lines of the action plan outlined by the staff. In particular, the authorities should give priority and devote sufficient human and financial resources to improving economic and financial statistics. This will help better channel accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date information to the authorities for policy assessment and formulation, and to the Fund for the conduct of its sunreillance. The staff regrets that information regarding the petroleum sector and official foreign assets and the related income has not been provided to the mission. This has hampered a comprehensive assessment of the overall economic situ,ation and the policies needed to maintain financial stability. In addition, there is a need for greater economic policy coordination at the emirate and federal levels, including the formulation of a medium- term macroeconomic framework that would guide future economic policy decisions. The staff believes that improved statistics and better coordination of economic policies are indispensable tools of macroeconomic management in an increasingly sophisticated economy. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

IX. Technical Assistance During the 198Os, the U.A.E. Central Bank received the services of several experts seconded by the Central Banking Department. These included a general policy adviser in 1982, an investment adviser in 1982-84, and a banking adviser in 1982-86. In addition, several staff missions from the Central Banking and Middle Eastern Departments visited the U.A.E. to study specific issues of interest to the authorities. Recent technical assistance missions in statistics included a balance of payments mission in February 1988, a general economic data mission in March 1988, and an international banking statistics mission in December 1988. More recently, a Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department's staff visit took place in January 1993 to assist the authorities in determining priorities in the area of banking supervision and regulation, and in identifying a resident expert.

In addition, the provision of information to the Fund between consultation missions has been mixed. While data on exchange rates, international reserves of the Central Bank, and monetary data are provided on a timely basis, other core statistics (consumer price index, fiscal, trade, balance of payments, and GDP) have not been provided on a regular basis. The multisector statistical mission that visited the U.A.E. in June 1993 examined the systems underpinning the compilation of statistics in national accounts, prices, balance of payments, and public finance statistics with a view to assessing their suitability for economic analysis and improving the authorities' ability to monitor developments in the economy. I/ The mission concluded that while a good institutional base existed for the collection and compilation of data, major enhancements were needed, including the development of additional data sources and the application of internationally accepted methodologies. In addition, the mission noted that the statistical system would benefit from a strengthening of coordination among data collection agencies. The mission made specific recommendations in the areas under its purview. The implementation of the recommendations of the 1993 mission has been slow due to the lack of resources and a shortage of trained staff. In order to assist the authorities in expediting the implementation of the mission's recommendations, a detailed assessment of data deficiencies and an action plan were discussed with the authorities on the occasion of the 1995 Article IV consultation mission. Under the action plan, further technical assistance from the Fund may be needed to provide on-the-job training of U.A.E. staff. 1. Data deficiencies a. Real sector The main weakness of the national accounts statistics is the lack of basic information for all sectors, except government, financial institutions, and agriculture. With regard to the nroduction account, there are inadequate basic data on manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade, and most of the service sectors. In the expenditure account, u United Arab Emirates: Aide-Memoire of the MultitoDic Statistics Mission, August 1993. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - APPENDIX II data are lacking on final consumption by households and on changes in stocks. In these areas, the national accounts compilers rely on ad hoc information which causes wide margins of error in the statistics. Moreover, because data are produced only on an annual basis, there are no short-run indicators for economic activity. Concerning price statistics, only a consumer price index (CPI) is produced, and is based on weights derived from household budget surveys in Qatar (1988) and Abu Dhabi (1982). b. Government finance The main deficiency in the government finance statistics is the absence of a consolidated presentation for general government operations, the latter being defined to include ,the federal government, the individual emirates, and municipalities. The absence of such a presentation hinders the ability to fully assess the impact of government operations on the economy. This stems from the fact that there is no c'entral unit in the government responsible for the compilation of data for the entire government sector. The role of the Ministry of Finance and Industry is confined to the provision of data for the Federal Government only, while individual emirates provide their own fiscal data. The compilation of the data is carried out on an ad hoc basis. Another major deficiency is the nondisclosure of information on income fronn official foreign assets and the proceeds of liquidation of such assets by individual emirate governments. In addition, official data on oil revenue for the emirate of Dubai are not provided, and are estimated by Fund missions. C. Balance of navmem The most serious problem affecting the compilation of the U.A.E.'s balance of payments statistics is the lack of primary data sources for many transactions. In the absence of actual information on oil and gas exports, of enterprise surveys and of records of foreign exchange transactions to gather balance of payments information on a regular basis, the estimates that the Central Bank prepares are clearly incomplete. Sources currently available and suitable for balance of payments compilation cover only a small range of transactions and exclude trade in crude oil and gas, financial statements of the banking sector, and available official records. As a result, many balance of payments transactions are estimates based on incomplete information, and some important transactions are not reported at all. The major gaps relate to workers' remittances, investment income, oil and gas exports, foreign direct investment transactions and other nonbank private sector investment income, and capital transactions. These are serious deficiencies which impede the understanding and analysis of balance of payments developments and deserve urgent attention. d. Monetarv accounts_ The monetary data are of good quality and are provided to the Fund in a timely fashion. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 29 - APPENDIX II 2. PrODOSed action Dlan u a. Real sector In order to remedy the above-mentioned deficiencies, the 1993 multisector statistical assessment mission recommended the establishment of a number of direct surveys to create the needed new information sources, and an intensification of the use of existing data sources in other areas. The highest priority was accorded to final consumption by households, the production of the nonfinancial private sector, including manufacturing, the free trade zone, and construction activities. With regard to price statistics, the most needed are constant price data on construction, and production prices. In the short run, it is expected that the authorities will use the existing official records to enhance the data reporting system and establish new data collection systems. In the long run, however, the authorities will need to conduct regular surveys for manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, land transportation, and construction; develop a plan for conducting a households expenditure survey immediately after the preliminary results of the population census are out (end of 1995); and compile short-term indicators. b. Government finance The 1993 mission proposed that the Federal Ministry of Finance and Industry undertake the establishment of a new database for the government sector on the basis of the methodology of the Fund's A Manual of Government Finance Statistics (m). In the short run, the new database would cover the operations of the Federal Government, and those of the governments of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah, as well as the Dubai municipality. 2J In the long run, however, the coverage should expand to include the operations of extrabudgetary accounts and of municipalities' accounts at the emirate level when data sources become available for those accounts. C. Balance of navments In view of the aforementioned deficiencies, there is an urgent need to establish a systematic approach to gathering relevant data on a regular and consistent basis. In the short run, the 1993 mission suggested specific improvements in the current classification and in the estimates of a few balance of payments items. Specifically, separate entries should be shown in the current account of the balance of payments statement for transportation, travel, and government services, investment income, and workers' remittances. In the financial account, separate entries should be I-J This section summarizes the more detailed proposals contained in an aide-memoire provided to the authorities by the mission. 2J Due to the lack of appropriate data sources, it was not suggested to include the other emirates.

For the long run, the 1993 multisector mission recommended the development of an international transactions reporting system (ITRS) for foreign exchange transactions through the banking system and money changers, supplemented with surveys of enterprises to broaden existing sources of information. Also, a few periodic surveys that collect primary data for transportation, government, and travel were recommended. Due to the recent changes in the staff of the Research and Statistics Department at the Central Bank, technical assistance will be needed to help new teams with the implementation of these recommendations.
