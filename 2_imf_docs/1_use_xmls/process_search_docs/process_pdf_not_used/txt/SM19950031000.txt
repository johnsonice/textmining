Introduction and Summary Poland is one of the most successful of the transition economies. One sign is the transformation in its relations with the Fund. Since the last Article IV consultation on March 25, 1994 (EBS/94/48), Poland has repurchased all its outstanding obligations and is not expected to request another Fund arrangement after the current one expires in March 1996 (Box 1). Another perhaps even more striking sign is the turnaround in output: Poland is about to become the first Central European country where real GDP has regained its pre-transition peak (Chart 1). These successes are testimony to Poland's hard-edged leadership of the transition in Central and Eastern Europe. However, these signs of success are also of a piece with some of the increasing difficulties faced by the authorities, notably as regards reducing inflation and coping with pressures for more accommo- dating fiscal and reform policies. These issues were at the center of the Article IV consultation discussions (see Sections II and III of this report, respectively). The main message is that prospects remain promising, but that policies will need to regain their forward-looking cast of the early transition years if Poland is to have as much success in dealing with success as it has had in dealing with adversity. Discussions for the Article IV consultation were held in Warsaw during July 6-21, 1995 and in Washington during October 7-12, 1995. u The staff met with Mr. Kolodko, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister; Mrs. Gronkiewicz-Waltz, President of the National Bank of Poland; the Ministers of Agriculture and Privatization and the Head of Office of the Council of Ministers; senior officials of Government ministries and the National Bank of Poland; and representatives of research and financial institutions. Mr. Kaeser, Executive Director for Poland, and Mrs. Gotz-Kozierkiewicz, Alternate Executive Director for Poland, attended some of the meetings. u The staff team for the July mission comprised Messrs. Deppler, KZhkijnen, Griffiths (all EUl), Everaert (PDR), and Mates (FAD). Mr. Krelove (FAD) replaced Mr. Mates for the October discussions. The missions were assisted by Mr. Rodlauer, the Senior Resident Representative.

Fund Relations l On March 25,1994, at the couch&m of the 1994 Article IV amsuItation, Executive Diirs commended the authorities for their pursuit over the previous four years of poIi&s to secure macroeconomic stabiition and to further the trausformation process. At the same time, Directors noted that the inflation performance remained mixed aud that trends pointed to continued f-1 pressures. Speakers caBed for a signifiit strengthening of Poland’s saving performanc e and stressed that monetary policy should ensure a competitive return on zbtg-denominated assets. Directors aIso urged the authorities to devebp a plan for reforming the social security system and to reinvigorate privatization efforts. In addition, the envisaged elimination of the import surcharge was seeu as very d&rabIe. l On August 5,1994, the Executive Board approved a U-month staud-by arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 545 miUion or 55 percent of quota (EBS/94/145, 7/15/94; and Supplement 1,8/4/94). l On October 12,1994, the Executive Board approved a purchase of SDR 283.3 miUion to support the f- of PoIand’s debt and debt-servh reduction (DDSR) operation with commercial crediirs (EBS/94/195). l Subsequentlg, the authorities indited that they did not intend to make additional purchases, and on February 28,1995 they made advanced repurchases equivalent to SDR 225 million. l On May 10,1995, the fast review under the SBA was completed @BSf95/65,4/11/95; Supplement 1, 4/28/95; and Supplement 2, S/4/95). In concluding the review, Executive Dirs expressed concern over the persistence of inhtion, urging the authorities to be prepared to tighten policies if the expechl decline in inflation failed to materialize. Directors aIso noted the sbw progress in structuraI reform and tbe tendency toward increasing index&ion. l Effective June 1,1995, PoIand accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, and maintains au exchange system free of resfrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions (EBD/95/99, 7/19/95). l AB performance criterh for end-June 1995 under the !%A were observed (Table 1). l Subsequently, the authorities requested a reduction of access under the SBA to SDR 50 mUion or about 5 percent of quota, with ef’fect from August 5,1995 (EBSl95165, Supplement 3,9/21195). Combined with Poland’s advanced repurchase of aB its outstaudiug obligations to the Fund (SDR 640.3 milhn) on July 17, 1995, the request transformed the SBA into a fti credit trancbe arrangement. As a resuIt, purchases are no huger subject to the formal phasii, performance, and review chses set forth in the SBA. l The authorities have requested informal staff monitoring under Art& V, SectIon 2(b) foBowing the expiration of the SBA on March 4,1996.

Following a dispute with President Walesa, Mr. Oleksy of the majority SLD party replaced PSL's Mr. Pawlak as Prime Minister in March 1995. On November 19, 1995, Mr. Kwasniewski, the leader of SLD, was elected President for a five-year term. The periodicity, timeliness, coverage, and quality of Poland's economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. However, there are weaknesses in some areas, including the real sector and, in particular, the balance of payments (Appendix I and Box 2 below). II. Macro DeveloDments: The Inflation Issue 1. Background The turnaround in the real economv has been pronounced (Chart 2). GDP growth is estimated to have averaged over 6 percent per annum in 1994-95, led by exports and investment. While remaining at high levels, and despite considerable regional disparities, the unemployment rate has fallen from its peak of 17 percent to just under 15 percent. The growth in GDP represents an impressive supply response, rooted in very rapid, competitiveness-enhancing gains in productivity. Industrial production growth rates are in double digits, with manufacturing activity particularly strong (Chart 3). With favorable weather conditions, agricultural production rebounded strongly this summer. Profitability has also increased and, despite recent pressures on competitiveness, remains highest in the traded goods sector. However, the expansion of activity has been somewhat unbalanced. The bulk of the increase in output stems from exports which, including unrecorded cross-border trade, increased in real terms at annual rates of more than 30 percent through 1994 and into fall 1995. Domestic demand, on the other hand, has been relatively weak. While investment is increasingly buoyant-- it is estimated to grow by more than 10 percent this year-- consumption has been subdued, owing to slow growth in real incomes and an unexpected increase in the propensity to save. However, there are now signs of a pick up in real wages and in consumer confidence. Consequently, the external current account (including staff estimates of unrecorded net exports) has swung from approximate balance in 1993 to a surplus averaging 2 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994-95.

Net international reserves (NIR) increased by USS2.5 billion in 1994, despite the USS1.4 billion net cost of the DDSR operation, and are estimated to rise by USS8.3 billion this year (7 percent of GDP and over one quarter of the end-1994 money supply, Table 2). With the sterilization operations of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) only partially successful, broad money growth has been much higher than targeted, seemingly stuck in the 35-40 percent per annum range (Table 3). Not surprisingly, inflation has proved increasingly hard to bring down (Chart 2). After declining sharply from over 600 percent during 1989 to 38 percent during 1993, CPI inflation became stuck in the 30-35 percent range until mid-1995. A good harvest and the lagged effects of earlier exchange rate measures helped the 12-month inflation rate to ease to the mid-20s by end-year --high compared with the program target of 17 percent, but possibly unsustainably low in light of the stickiness of nonfood inflation (Chart 5) and contemporaneous increases in money supply. In sum, with the surge in international reserves overwhelming the NBP's sterilization capacity, the money supply has been out of control, preventing inflation from declining as rapidly as planned. This seemingly straight- forward problem is, however, complicated by several factors: 0 Continuing uncertainty, fostered by deficiencies in the data, as to whether the increases in NIR are owing to current account surpluses or capital inflows-- an uncertainty that in turn has fostered continuing controversy as to the proper role of interest and exchange rates in addressing the problem. In the staff's view, the weight of the evidence is that the mainspring was the emergence of a large current account surplus in 1994 that carried over into 1995. Beginning in the first half of 1995, the situation was exacerbated by capital inflows--instigated initially by prospects of currency appreciation rather than interest differentials--that gradually came to dominate as the current account surplus began to recede in the second half of 1995 (Box 2 and Chapter 1 in the forthcoming background paper).

Does Poland Have a Current Account Surplus or Deficit? DetmGiq Poland’s current acamnt position is fpr from straightforward. Although offEal balance of payments data show the current account deficit more than doubling to USS2.4 billion in 1995, there is considerable, if imprecise, evidence of unrecorded cross-border trade and tourism receipts. For example, in 1995 foreigners wiU make almost 100 million vi&s to Poland, many of them lured by the numerous informal and formal markets in text&s, food, gasoline, and light consumer goods that have sprung up on Poland’s borders. Transac&ns in these markets are generally not recorded in the offtcial current account. IncJudii reasonable estimates of nonresidents’ unrecorded purchases of Polish goods and sewices, Poland’s “true” current account is in fact in a &able surplus (Chart 6). Offii balance of payments data do not provide an accurate picture of Poland’s underlying current account position, for at least two reasons: l They classify sales of foreign currency for zioty in the kantor (small foreign exchange bureau) market as shorty capital infbws. Si these transactions are wholly in bank&es, they more likely refIect payments for unrecorded Polish exports as well as tourism receipts, whiih should therefore appear in the current account. l Of&id data estimate private transfers (whiih are part of the current account) primarily by the change in households’ foreign exchange deposits, even though no intitional Qansa&m need be involved. Thus part of this year’s signifhmt worsening in net private transfers and improvement in short-term capital may simply be ~ residents’ sales of dollars for ulotys, refMing .hcxvmed confidence in Poland’s fd stabiition and the favorable interest differential on zloty assets. The amounts in the diffiiuMo&ssify items are huge: combined, net private transfers and kantor pur&ases rose from UsS2.5 biin iu 1993 to US4.2 bin iu 1994, and are expe&d to exceed USS6 bin in l!M-more than enough to turn the offi current account d&it into substantial surplus. The key question is to determine how much of net private transfers and kantor purchases is current account, and how much is caphaL A reasonable starting point is to assume that in 1994-a time of greater fmancial market uncertainty with fewer opportnnit% for arbiiage-the US4.2 bin net inflows were wholly current account. For 1995, the staff assumes that the current account portion of these inflows grows with the increase in net border crossings, leaving roughly 20 percent of these US6 biin plus net inflows as capital account. On this basis, Poland has a “true” current account surplus, which widened from USS2 bin in 1994 to more than US3 bin or 2.6 percent of GDP in 1995 (see Chapter 1 in the background paper).

Specifically, the system has contributed to slowing inflation, to increasing confidence in the zloty and to providing a measure of assurance that competitiveness was not being undermined. On the other hand, mainly out of concerns for competitiveness, the authorities have proven reluctant to reduce the rate of crawl (which sets a floor on inflation) and to appreciate even in the face of a marked strengthening of the balance of payments. At the same time, the authorities have also resisted the implications for interest rates implied by the fixed exchange rate regime, i.e., they have been unwilling to let interest rates adjust in step with the ebb and flow of the balance of payments, partly because of concerns on inflation. With capital mobility increasing, the issue is whether the fixed exchange rate remains an appropriate anchor or whether more exchange rate flexibility should be allowed. l A final set of constraints is the high degree of inflation inertia in Poland (resulting from widespread and increasing indexation) and the need to effect further relative price changes (to bring domestic prices closer to world market levels). 8/ Hence, barring measures to suspend the indexa- tion, the scope for reducing inflation quickly and sharply without signifi- cant risks for competitiveness and the export-led growth strategy is limited. As a result, since 1992-93 the authorities' basic strategy-- endorsed by the staff--has been to achieve and sustain high rates of growth together with gradual reductions in inflation, as opposed to a strategy of immediate stabilization. 2. A range of views Given these uncertainties and concerns, a variety of views with potentially conflicting policy implications have been expressed on the roots of the inflation/NIR problem. a. Monetarv oolicv is too loose The view is straightforward: both inflation and money are growing too rapidly and the answer is therefore to curb both by raising interest rates. With an unchanged exchange rate policy, however, this further enhances the attractiveness of the zloty (and capital inflows) and exacerbates the shift of resources toward the external sector (by curbing domestic demand). Proponents of this view therefore tend to favor shifts toward more flexible exchange rate arrangements and/or appreciation of the exchange rate. l-J A detailed discussion of this and other aspects of the inflation process in Poland is provided in Chapter 2 of the background paper. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - b. Monetarv nolicv is too tizht The opposite view is that the answer lies in reducing interest rates. This will both strengthen domestic demand (and thereby lessen the current account surplus) and reduce the uncovered interest differential (and thereby the incentive for capital inflows). As a result, the accumulation of reserves and, ceteris paribus, the growth of money will lessen. It is less clear, however, why inflation should slow in this scenario wherein domestic credit demand strengthens and money demand weakens. C. Fiscal and monetarv nolicies need to be rebalanced A third view argues that inconsistent macroeconomic policies lie at the heart of Poland's problems. In this view, which is grounded in a capital rather than current account view of the problem, the inconsistency between interest rate and exchange rate policy under the present exchange rate regime can be resolved by moving the policy mix toward a tighter fiscal policy. (As discussed below, this year's fiscal stance ends up being expansionary, after some tightening in 1994). If such policies are beyond reach, moving to a floating exchange rate system would be preferable. Such a move would restore control over domestic interest rates and money supply, preventing an excessive accumulation of international reserves. d. Strone comnetitiveness A fourth view maintains that the root of the NIR problem has been an undervalued real exchange rate that has ceased to act as an anchor and instead induced a current account surplus that has proved difficult to sterilize. According to this view, the disequilibrium in the real exchange rate has been caused by rapid productivity growth, based on fundamental supply-side changes during the economic transformation. This interpretation is supported by data indicating an excess of productivity growth over real wage increases, strong export performance (even for recorded trade), and evidence that the "true" current account is in surplus. In this view, the answer is a step appreciation of the zloty to correct the misalignment and allow the anchor to bite again. Reducing the rate of crawl would be helpful but less advisable, as such a move would correct the disequilibrium only slowly and could encourage capital inflows. Of course, external balance would be reached even in the absence of exchange rate action, but gradually through higher inflation. e. High rates of return on Polish capital A similarly benign (as regards the role of policies) explanation of NIR increases (but one that is based on a capital rather than current account view) is that Poland is becoming an increasingly attractive emerging market. Indeed, following the normalization of relations with external creditors, Poland regained access to international capital markets and issued its first Eurobond in June 1995. This year has also seen the new phenomenon of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - portfolio investment, and foreign direct investment is expected to double. J.J In this interpretation, the challenge is to harness increasing capital inflows to productive investment without overheating the economy; inflows should not finance a consumption boom or excessive reserve accumulation. The appropriate policy response is by now standard: a combination of nominal appreciation, sterilization, and fiscal tightening. Capital controls may help to contain temporary surges but not sustained large-scale capital inflows. Despite the diversity of diagnoses of Poland's economic condition, some common policy prescriptions emerge. 2J If inflation reduction is the main g-1, relative sizes of the capital and current account are less important than the desirability of containing aggregate demand. Both fiscal adjustment and exchange rate appreciation lower inflationary pressure and, by allowing lower interest rates, can offset the pressure toward capital account surplus. The choice between appreciation and fiscal adjustment should depend on the relative strengths of the traded and nontraded sectors. The extent of any demand reduction should depend on the progress made toward reducing inflation indexation and inertia in the Polish economy. 3. Policv discussions In policy discussions of these matters since the last Article IV consultation, the staff has generally been a proponent of the strong competitiveness explanation. It has also emphasized the inertial elements in Polish inflation and, more recently, noted that the mix of current and capital inflows may be changing in favor of capital flows. Consistent with the real exchange rate misalignment view, staff advice has focused on the need for nominal exchange rate changes, initially in the form of reductions in the rate of crawl, and later, with increasing evidence that NIR was getting out of control, in the form of a step appreciation. The staff has also emphasized the importance of sticking to the fiscal targets as part of the inflation reduction strategy. Although agreed on the need to reduce inflation, the authorities held a diversity of views on how to do so. One point of agreement, however, was that this not be done at the expense of the goose that was laying the golden eggs of export-led growth. In this regard, the concern that changes in nominal exchange rates might provoke rather than simply pre-empt (inflation- induced) changes in the real exchange rate was widespread and deep-seated. lJ There have also been speculative inflows during 1995, most notably in April-May, prompted by the widely expected (and repeatedly delayed) appreciation of the zloty, and in August-September, again fueled by expectations of appreciation. 2J Chapter 3 of the background paper provides an analytical presentation of the various views on the NIR problem, with policy implications. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - It was thus only in the face of rapid and continuing NIR increases that the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the National Bank of Poland (NBP) could agree on the need for some exchange rate action. On other matters, however, the policy views of the MoF and the NBP have differed, at times sharply. MoF officials have argued that monetary policy has been too tight and domestic absorption depressed. Hence, in their view, lower interest rates were the key to solving the inflation problem. The NBP, by contrast, has been against interest rate cuts without the support of other policies. Instead, NBP officials have viewed inflation as driven in large part by structural factors, such as a high degree of monopolization, insufficient privatization, extensive intervention in agriculture, and high import protection. Accordingly, the NBP has advocated combining a moderate appreciation with liberalization of exchange regulations and imports. The NBP has also been in favor of capital controls, a measure that the MoF opposes. The actual policy response has thus been an uneasy (and often delayed) compromise. The authorities' main response has been a combination of exchanee rate action and sterilized and unsterilized intervention (Box 3 discusses the efforts to sterilize). The exchange rate action initially focussed on slowing down the rate of crawl of the exchange rate. However, a series of three cuts in the monthly rate of crawl between September 1994 and February 1995 (from 1.6 to the present 1.2 percent) failed to make a significant dent in the flood of NIR. Consequently, in mid-May 1995 the authorities introduced an element of flexibility in the form of a crawling band of + 7 percent around the central parity; the zloty quickly appreciated to 5 percent (later 6 percent) above the old central rate. As a result, the real effective exchange rate (measured by relative unit labor costs) has appreciated by more than 10 percent during the first nine months of this year, reversing some but not all of the real depreciation since early 1993 (Chart 7). The exchange rate now puts moderate downward pressure on traded goods inflation. For import prices, this pressure has been reinforced by a 4 percentage point drop in the average tariff rate at the beginning of 1995, following a reduction in the import surcharge and adjustments in import duties in line with international commitments.

St&i&ion has had mixed success. While base money growth in 1995 has been held to about half of the incmase in NIR, it has accommodated signifiintly higher than targeted broad money growth and intlation (see chart bebw). In fact, the excess of broad money over program targets in both 1994 and 1995 broadly corresponds to the sum of program deviations in NlR and credit to the government, suggesting limited overall scope for steriRmtion. Why h8s kitdkatbn not been used even mure aggressively ? There are no nphysicaln or legal limits to tbe NRP’s errparity to effect OMOs. However, the scope of st&lizatiun is in part determined by the NRP’s operatbnal goal of maintaining short-term money market rates at a desired level.

With sterilization operations only partially successful, market interest rates in 1994 declined by more than inflation and dropped below administered headline interest rates, which are a particular concern of the MoF. Following a sharp rise in the CPI in January 1995, the NBP raised the headline and intervention rates by 2-3 percentage points, with the MoF protesting. Interest rates have since declined considerably (the headline rates by a total of 6 percentage points between May and September), but not as far as the MoF would like. Market rates remain slightly positive in real terms. Fiscal nolicy, which was programmed in mid-1994 to be less restrictive than in the event would have been judicious, ended up being expansionary (Table 4). Following a moderate tightening in 1994 (when the general government deficit fell to 2 percent of GDP, a post-transformation low), this year's outcome is likely to be 3 l/2 percent of GDP, against a program target of about 3 percent. The slippage can be attributed to delays in tax increases, some weakness in VAT administration, a generous public sector wage award (following years of real wage decline), and an accumulation of domestic arrears (reflecting weak expenditure control in certain budgetary units as well as systemic problems in health care and housing subsidies). The fiscal slippage notwithstanding, public debt as a ratio to GDP is firmly on a downward path, owing to rapid growth and primary surpluses that have been accumulating since 1993. Incomes nolicv has also been less restrictive than originally envisaged. The excess wage tax (popiwek), which in various forms had been in effect since the beginning of Poland's transformation, lapsed at end- 1994. It was immediately replaced by a new incomes policy based on social partnership. The new system of collective bargaining is guided by indicative norms (set by a tripartite commission on the basis of a set of indicators, including projected growth and inflation), with sanctions applied to managers of state-owned enterprises who allow above-norm wage awards to damage the financial position of their enterprise. The new policy is likely to promote much-needed relative wage flexibility (see Chapter 4 of the background paper for a discussion of the role of labor market rigidities during Poland's transformation). Also, under the new policy real wages have continued to lag behind productivity gains. However, the margin has narrowed lately (Chart 5). Moreover, by allowing the wage norm to be renegotiated based on actual price and other developments--a possibility which has already been used during 1995 --the new policy implies increased indexation and makes it harder to reduce inflation. The drift to ex post indexation has been even more evident in the government sector, where the budget stipulated wage increases 6 percentage points above actual inflation during 1995.

Prosnects and Policies: 1996 and Beyond With elections off the immediate agenda and the 1996 budget having seemingly weathered its most vulnerable stage, prospects remain good. The risks are considerable, however, and the authorities need to prepare for upside risks on inflation and downside risks on fiscal sustainability. 1. Prosnects For 1996, the Government's objectives are 5 l/2 percent GDP growth (with unemployment declining to 14 percent) and inflation of 17 percent during the year. In the authorities' framework, these targets go hand in hand with a marked slowing in the rate of reserve accumulation owing to a marked deterioration in the current account and to capital inflows remaining at moderate levels. As regards the external accounts, the authorities were particularly concerned by a deceleration in the growth of official exports, which they feared might be a harbinger of more adverse developments to come if the slowdown in Western Europe were to spread. The staff agreed that recent exchange rate and inflation-induced deteriorations in the real exchange rate together with some slowing of activity in the West should lead to some desirable lessening of export growth and in the current account surplus. Given suitable policies, the purely speculative aspect of capital inflows might also diminish next year. On this basis, the authorities and the staff agreed that reserve accumulation next year might be halved. The staff thought that the risks on NIR were on the upside, however, particularly in the medium term when Poland is likely to move from a current to a capital account surplus economy (as illustrated in the baseline medium- term scenario in Table 5). Underlying the scenario is a macroeconomic framework that assumes GDP growth of 5 percent, in line with the Government's Strategv for Poland. The continued high GDP growth rate assumes implementation of further structural reforms (see below) and needs to be supported by rapid growth of investment, especially by the private sector. The higher investment can be partly financed through increased recourse to foreign saving. With export growth returning to sustainable levels and import growth remaining strong owing to investment demand, the 1' true '1 current account progressively weakens into a normal-sized deficit. However, in order to avoid excessive reliance on foreign saving, a steady increase in national savings is also needed. Given uncertainty about the determinants of private savings, continued fiscal consolidation would be the surest way to raise national savings over the medium term. 2. Fiscal nolicv The 1996 draft budget seeks to put fiscal policy back on a consolidation track. It aims at a state government cash deficit of Zl 9.7 billion or 2 3/4 percent of GDP, implying a moderate tightening of the fiscal stance (from 3 l/2 percent in 1995) and some increase in the public saving rate. The fiscal consolidation is to be achieved by widening the VAT base and, most important, by changing the indexation formula for one Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - year so as to restrict real pensions growth to 2 l/2 percent (compared with an increase of over 12 percent implied by the present system). The 1996 pension bill is a major achievement, as it prevents a budgetary gap of some 1 l/4 percent of GDP. It was approved only following a hard-fought battle; after having been approved by Parliament and survived a Presidential veto, the bill was referred to the Constitutional Tribunal which in late November ruled in favor of the bill. However, being a one-time measure, the 1996 pension bill does little to improve Poland's unsustainable expenditure structure, which is heavily weighed toward social transfers, especially pensions. While commending the authorities on their fiscal plans for 1996, the staff stressed the importance of avoiding a repeat of the domestic expenditure arrears problem experienced in 1995. Specifically, the key would be to formulate and implement a strategy to forestall new arrears-- essentially an expenditure control issue --before initiating steps to clear the existing stock of arrears (as was done at end-1994). The need to find sustainable ways to reduce the fiscal deficit is underscored by the risk of large-scale capital inflows. While the staff's baseline medium-term scenario assumes only a moderate pick-up of debt- creating capital inflows, there is a risk that such inflows could assume major proportions (they have reached as high as 10 percent of GDP in some countries). This could overwhelm the entire macro framework. Absence of timely policy reaction would risk a surge of inflation, a massive real appreciation of the zloty, and, as a result, a large weakening of the current account, leaving the economy exposed to changes in market sentiment. The main defense against the disruptions associated with a sharp real appreciation would be major fiscal adjustment. In this context, the staff observed that fiscal tightening significantly exceeding the welcome consolidation envisaged for 1996 would be required in the face of a rising tide of capital inflows. Because of the increasing rigidity associated with their expenditure commitments, the authorities doubted whether there would be scope for such adjustments. 3. Monetarv and exchange rate oolicv Achieving the goals for 1996 requires the support of exchange rate/monetary policies, but with greater effective flexibility than experienced this year. The staff argued that some further nominal appre- ciation of the zloty is needed to reduce inflation to 17 percent during next year; this would both induce the real exchange rate adjustment without resorting to inflation and contain capital inflows, especially speculative ones. The authorities acknowledged these points, but as noted also expressed concern about a possible softening of export growth. The staff also stressed the need to impart flexibility to the exchange rate system by making more use of the exchange rate band. (The formal introduction of the crawling band had led to little change in practice, as the zloty was allowed to appreciate to close to the upper end of the range.) Steps in this direction appeared all the more advisable considering the controversies and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 21 - rigidities that had come to be associated with interest rate policy. More generally, greater readiness for prompt policy responses would be helpful in the face of the upside risks on external reserves. Sustained progress against inflation in the medium term also requires the preservation and strengthening of central bank indeoendence, a shared goal of the authorities and the staff. However, there is uncertainty about the specifics of new legislation under discussion that would define the responsibilities and activities of the central bank. A key issue is the role of a new Monetary Policy Council (a supervisory board to the NBP). While a draft prepared earlier this year by the NBP would impart substantial independence to this Council, another draft prepared recently by a group of Parliamentary deputies would subject the Council's guidelines for monetary policy (including details on the use of instruments such as interest rates) to Parliamentary approval. While appropriately tight financial policies and continued central bank independence are key to a credible plan to reduce inflation to single digits by 1998 (an important target of the StrategV for Poland), the costs of disinflation also need to be borne in mind. In this connection, the staff emphasized that the pace at which inflation can be reduced is closely linked to the degree of inflation inertia in the Polish economy. Hence, reducing the widespread indexation in the economy would bring major benefits. Such efforts could be usefully supplemented by other structural measures, especially those designed to increase competition. 4. Structural reform The problems in implementing the ad hoc 1996 pension plan underscore the importance of a comprehensive social security reform for fiscal viability. Indeed, with 15 percent of GDP, Poland already has one of the highest levels of public pensions expenditure in Europe, and further increases are projected if the pension system is not changed. u Against this background, the Government in June 1995 presented a draft proposal for a three-tier pension system consisting of (i) a basic pension available to all retirees, (ii) a compulsory earnings-related contribution system, and (iii) voluntary contributions to pension funds. In discussions with the staff, the authorities stressed that the proposal is likely to entail long- term savings (resulting in particular from partial replacement of wage indexation of benefits with price indexation and equalization of the statutory retirement age for men and women). However, the staff pointed out the potentially serious implementation and incentive problems of the plan (including the lack of effective means to reduce occupational privileges and a weakened link between contributions and pension benefits), and the likely 1/ See Chapter 5 of the background paper for an assessment of the present system and reform plans. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - significant budgetary costs of the plan in the short run. The Government is currently revising the proposal, taking into account the results of extensive consultations with social partners. Regarding other areas of structural reform, progress in some areas is being clouded by signs of slowing down in others. Marked progress has been made in mass privatization (where the governance of over 500 companies has already effectively been shifted to private hands) and trade and exchange reform (where import protection has been reduced and Article VIII status achieved). However, reform in other areas has become increasingly protracted and diluted, reflecting differing views within the governing coalition and considerations related to the Presidential elections. The new privatization law, which is needed to finally establish the rules of the g=e , is a case in point. The Government's original draft (which would have permitted rapid commercialization of public enterprises as a step toward eventual privatization, introduced a new track for privatization through domestic debt-equity conversions, and removed several legal obstacles to privatization) was a step in the right direction. However, this draft was weakened significantly during the Parliamentary discussion. Specifically, the law passed in July 1995 required Parliamentary approval in certain sectors and allowed commercialization without eventual privatization for some state-owned enterprises. In the end, the Constitutional Tribunal found the law unconstitutional. The Government now intends to submit a revised bill to Parliament. (A detailed discussion of developments and plans in various areas of structural reform is provided in Appendix II). IV. Staff Anoraisal First to embark on transition, and first to lead the way to recovery, Poland has set a standard of success to which most other transition economies aspire. After four years of improving economic growth, the prospect is for more to come. This impressive economic performance is fitting testimony to the merits of Poland's economic strategy, an approach that hardened budget constraints to restructure and reform what was once a centrally planned economy. In many respects, success has surpassed the hopes of even the most ardent reformers. Double digit growth of industrial production, falling unemployment rates, and booming exports have confounded the skeptics. However, such successes have also brought their own problems. The strength of the balance of payments has put monetary control--and inflation--at risk. Success creating economic growth has also given rise to new disputes, political and economic, as interest groups compete for the fruits of economic transition. To overcome these new problems, the first challenge is to ensure that policies are flexible enough to deal with the surprises of transition. The second challenge is to resist the temptation for complacency. If economic Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 23 - To overcome these new problems, the first challenge is to ensure that policies are flexible enough to deal with the surprises of transition. The second challenge is to resist the temptation for complacency. If economic growth is to be sustained, forward-looking reform policies need to be introduced now. These two challenges were evident in 1995. First, inflation proved considerably more resilient than anticipated. Instead of being set in a forward-looking manner, monetary and exchange rate policies often played catch-up with immediate inflationary developments. While inflation declined in the second half of the year, this was largely owing to one-off factors. Second, the budget was under strain throughout much of the year. Despite the authorities' significant efforts, it proved impossible to keep the general government deficit within target, and this exacerbated the inflation problem. In addition, notwithstanding significant steps forward in mass privatization and trade and exchange reform, overall progress in structural reform was lackluster, perhaps not surprising in an election year. Moreover, ex-post wage indexation became increasingly prevalent, adding to Poland's inflation inertia. In order to sustain Poland's growth performance, it is important that policies in 1996 and beyond regain a more forward-looking, reform-oriented cast. Four areas deserve special attention: l Inflation reduction In 1995, as in the past several years, the inflation target was exceeded by a significant margin. While the deeply entrenched inertia limits the pace at which inflation can be reduced, policies need to ensure that the momentum toward lower inflation is re- established. In the short term, the target of 17 percent inflation during 1996 must be achieved. This will likely require a further measured appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. While care needs to be taken to not over-correct given recent losses in competitiveness, the appreciation would be best effected through a step move rather than a slowing of the rate of crawl, which could give rise to increased capital inflows. In the medium term, the rate of crawl should be reduced in line with targeted inflation. Moreover, with an eye to effecting further reductions in inflation in 1997 and beyond, in the face of further increases in the relative prices of rents and utilities, the authorities should initiate measures now to weaken the degree of backward indexation that prevails in the economy. l Conduct of monetarv/exchange rate nolicies Controversies surrounding monetary policy-- especially interest rate policy--should not divert attention from two issues. The first is the need to preserve the independence of the central bank-- an aspect that is critical for the credibility of the medium-term strategy to reduce inflation. It is important in that regard that the new central bank law limit political guidance to the broad objectives, with the NBP given wide latitude as regards the implementation of policy. The second is that the controversies on interest rates reflect in part differences as regards the exchange rate regime. Given the risk of increased capital inflows, the de facto Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - constraints on interest rate policy, and the fiscal costs of sterilization, an evolution toward greater exchange rate flexibility (e.g., by making more use of the crawling band) would seem warranted. l Fiscal nolicy Fiscal prospects have improved. The 1996 draft budget aims at a deficit of 2 3/4 percent of GDP, and this on the basis of a measure containing pensions growth, a key requirement for fiscal sustain- ability and increased domestic savings. The budget implies a moderate tightening of the fiscal stance and is broadly consistent with the inflation target. However, strict implementation of the budgetary plans is important. In this regard, measures need to be taken to avoid a build-up of arrears, the main source of the fiscal slippage in 1995. Preparing contingency measures is also important, as a fiscal tightening far sharper than currently envisaged would be needed if capital inflows become massive. Finally, fiscal sustainability requires structural reform. In this regard, the 1996 pension bill is commendable, but it offers only a temporary solution. l Structural oolicies From a medium-term perspective, structural reform is key to continued rapid growth as well as fiscal sustainability. A high priority should be accorded to speedy approval and implementation of a broad reform of social security that secures significant increases in private savings and improved incentives, as well as budgetary savings. Another critical area is privatization, where the route toward continued hardening of budget constraints and better corporate governance needs to be firmly established for the sake both of enhancing growth and achieving low inflation. Poland's acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII (among the first Central European transition economies) is most welcome. This move toward greater openness could be enhanced by a faster-than-planned phasing out of the import surcharge. While Poland's economic data are generally adequate for surveillance, there is scope for improvement. In particular, more accurate estimates of unrecorded trade flows could improve economic policy making. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Poland be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The authorities cooperate fully in providing &ta to the Fund, mainly through the resident representative office. As shown in the attached data matrix, data on the core statistical indicators are available on a timely basis. In addition, data requests are handled promptly between consultations. Poland has a wealth of statistical publications, issued by the Central Statistical Office (GUS) and the Statistics Department of the National Bank of Poland, among others. 1. Real sector statistics Like other post-communist countries, Poland issues an extremely wide range of real sector statistics. The main problem is that few of these series extend back, in comparable form, for any great period of time. For example, in 1994, Poland changed its classification of sectors from the old Polish Classification of the National Economy (KGN) to the Polish version of NACE, a European system of classification. This means that comparable sectoral &ta series often extend back only as far as 1992. In addition, detailed national accounts data only extend back as far as 1991: before this, the accounting system was based on the concept of net material product rather than gross domestic product. Incomplete coverage is also a problem in some real sector statistics. For example, many series on enterprise activity exclude the small-scale private sector (firms with no more than five employees). National accounts data are not without problems. Data are available only on annual basis, and final estimates for 1994 are only expected to be ready next year. Within the accounts, staff estimates of net exports differ from those provided by the authorities, in part based on differences in the measurement of unrecorded cross-border trade. More disaggregation in the national accounts would be desirable, in particular in investment where the public and private components are not available separately. As in many other countries, there are difficulties in measuring stockbuilding. These difficulties may in part reflect the use of sold production when measuring Polish industrial production. 2. Government finance statistics The authorities provide detailed state budget &ta to the Fund on a regular basis. However, figures for general government are more problematic. First, data from gminas (local authorities) and extrabudgetary units are less readily available. Second, the definition of the general government sector appears incomplete: the operations of various quasi- governmental agencies and foundations are still to be included in general government statistics. A recent technical assistance mission from the Statistics Department reported considerable progress in overcoming these problems, sufficient to restore Poland's country page in the 1995 GFS Yearbook.

Monetary statistics High-frequency data (every ten days) on the central bank balance sheet and the monetary survey are available with minimal lags. There are differences with the International Financial Statistics (IFS) presentation. (One of these, a double counting of the use of Fund credit, was discovered in July 1995 and led to the revision of the foreign liabilities data published in IFS for the Monetary Authority, for December 1992-June 1995.) The analysis of longer-term monetary trends is hampered by the lack of com- parable data for an extended period. Specifically, there is a break in the data on monetary aggregates in December 1991, when a new system of accounts and an improved reporting system were introduced. Large variations in the interbank payments settlement float also occasionally make it difficult to interpret underlying trends. The National Bank of Poland plans to introduce a new reporting system for commercial banks by early 1997. A STA money and banking statistics mission is scheduled to visit Poland in the first quarter of 1996 to, inter alia, assist the NBP inbuilding a compilation program for the new reporting framework. 4. External sector statistics Foreign trade and balance of payments statistics are generally accurate and available with short delays. Foreign trade statistics, collected on the basis of customs clearance, are not integrated into the balance of payments, which is based on settlements data from the banking system. Work is underway to integrate the two sets of &ta, which will provide a better picture of transactions not involving payments, especially foreign direct investment in kind. Another weakness of the foreign trade statistics is the nonavailability of unit value indices with a fixed base. The balance of payments contains a large residual--classified as net purchases of foreign exchange in the short-term capital account--for which the nature of the underlying transactions is not known. Surveys of border trade and tourism are being conducted to identify these transactions, but they are not fully adequate yet to permit unambiguous identification of the transactions. Recently, inward portfolio flows have gained importance, but a comprehensive reporting system for such transactions is not yet available. While all transactions related to portfolio investments are currently registered in the balance of payments, some of them are not identified as such. The coverage of services and income transactions could also be improved. Government services, n.i.e., and compensation of employees are not identified. Workers' remittances under current transfers and capital transfers are also not identified.

Overview In the discussions of structural policies, the staff emphasized that continued reform was critical to ensuring a sustainable fiscal position (including quasi-fiscal activities) and high-quality growth. Against this background, the discussions reviewed recent progress and prospects for 1996 and beyond. The Strateev for Poland adopted by the Government in early 1994 set out an ambitious medium-term agenda for structural reform, focussing on the social security system, ownership changes, and the financial sector. Progress in implementing this agenda has been mixed, in part reflecting differing views within the governing coalition about the desirable pace and direction of change. Reforms have also been affected by political considerations ahead of the Presidential elections. Nevertheless, signi- ficant progress has been made in several important areas, and the Government's current plans are to reinvigorate reforms across the board after the elections. 2. Ownership transformation The most tangible progress is being made on the mass privatization program. Contracts with National Investment Fund (NIF) managers were signed in July, and lead shareholdings in companies were allocated to NIFs in August. This effectively transferred governance of the over 500 companies under the program-- representing about 4 percent of enterprise sector assets, or 12 percent of assets of manufacturing industries--into private hands. u NIF share certificates are being distributed to the population beginning in November, and they are to be converted into actual shares once the NIFs are listed on the Stock Exchange (expected within l-l l/2 years). Regarding other methods of ownership change, the authorities pointed to the significant increase of budgetary revenues from privatization (from Zl 0.8 billion in 1993 to Zl 1.6 billion in 1994, and Zl 2.5 billion in prospect for 1995) and the ongoing privatization of five tobacco firms as evidence of continued progress. However, they acknowledged that the number of firms being privatized had declined in both 1994 and 1995. In part, this decline reflected delays encountered in formulating and implementing a new approach to ownership reform under the Strategy for Poland, which was to emphasize mass commercialization (and the associated strengthening of state enterprise governance) as a step before privatization. After a long debate, I/ In addition to the 413 enterprises initially slated for mass privatization, the Government recently added another group of 101 enterprises to the program. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX II a new privatization law was passed by Parliament in July 1995. u This law embodies the emphasis on commercialization and provides several new arrangements that should facilitate privatization (including a new track for privatization through domestic debt-equity conversions, and free distri- bution to employees, upon privatization, of 15 percent of enterprise shares). At the same time, however, it would also require Parliamentary approval of privatization in certain sectors and strengthen the role of founding bodies in the commercialization/privatization process, provisions that could further complicate privatization. While the authorities recognized that risk, they noted that any major privatization initiative had required broad-based political support, and they reaffirmed their commitment to implement the new law in a way that would indeed strengthen corporate governance and accelerate ownership change. For 1996, the Government envisages privatization through "traditional" channels of about 250-300 firms, yielding some Zl 2.3 billion to the budget. Moreover, various ways of broadening the mass privatization program are being considered, in particular with a view to satisfying outstanding compensation claims on the budget (from previous Constitutional Tribunal rulings) and/or in connection with the creation of pension funds. The Government is also committed to compensating re-privatization claims (for real estate confiscated during the communist regime) in 1996, through the issue of vouchers covered by the so-called "privatization reserve" (5 percent of privatized companies is regularly set aside under this reserve). 3. Social securitv reform A major plank of the Strategy for Poland, social security reform advanced well in 1994 with reforms of family allowances and sickness benefits (see EBS/95/65, 4/11/95, page 14) and increasingly concrete plans for additional important changes. Subsequently, however, progress stalled in the run-up to the November 1995 elections. In particular, the new eligibility criteria for disability pensions have not yet been introduced, and the change of the system of pension adjustments from wage to price indexation (originally planned for as early as January 1, 1995) remains to be implemented. Nonetheless, the debate on a comprehensive reform of the pension system, although more protracted than expected, has made some headway toward the needed broad national consensus. In the meantime, the costs of the unreformed pension system have been rising rapidly, virtually forcing some corrective (if only short-term) action in the context of the 1996 budget. Under a law passed by Parliamexrt in September, pensions will be adjusted only once during 1996 (in September) I/ The law has not yet come into effect. First, a Presidential veto was overturned by Parliament. Then, in late November, 1995, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled the Law to be unconstitutional. The Government is now in the process of revising the bill for submission to Parliament. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - APPENDIX II by an amount that ensures real pension growth of 2 l/2 percent; in the absence of this change, pensions would be adjusted twice and increase by over 12 percent in real terms. u While this law will change the system only for one year, the authorities underscored the importance of this initiative both for the 1996 budget and in setting a precedent for the crucial long-term reform the system. In this regard, the Government in June 1995 presented a draft reform program consisting of a three-tier system: a basic state pension available to all citizens and equivalent to 30 percent of the average wage; a compulsory earnings-related contribution system (pay as you go); and voluntary contributions to funded pension funds. The program also foresaw partial replacement of wage indexation of benefits with price indexation; gradual equalization of the retirement age of women with that of men; as well as increased contribution rates for those who retire early. In discussing the program with the staff, the authorities underscored its many positive elements, in particular the long-term cost savings it would entail. They also recognized, however, the potentially serious incentive problems inherent in the proposed state pension, as well as its likely significant budgetary costs in the short run. The staff also noted the risks of a strategy that would yield savings only in the long term, while imposing immediate and substantial additional costs in the short run. 2/ The Government is currently revising the program, taking into account the results of extensive consultations with social partners and other parties to the political process. 4. Financial sector reform Following solid progress during the past few years, commercial bank privatization has entered a more difficult phase. In particular, the authorities explained that domestic demand for bank stock was low, suitable strategic investors were difficult to find, and some of the remaining banks had weak financial positions, complicating further bank privatization under the initial strategy and timetable. v Accordingly, while persevering with plans already under way to privatize individually a fourth bank (Bank Gdansk) in 1995 and another one (PBK) in 1996, the Government has adopted a revised strategy for the remaining banks. Specifically, the last four state-owned commercial banks would be consoli- dated around two large specialized banks (Bank Handlowy and PKO SA), u The passage of the 1996 pension law was not easy. Soon after Parliamentary approval the President vetoed the law, but the veto was immediately overturned by Parliament. The law was then referred to the Constitutional Tribunal, which in late November 1995 ruled in its favor. 2/ Chapter 5 of the background paper covers issues in pension reform. 2/ The original plan, formulated in 1991, foresaw the privatization of all nine state-owned commercial banks (carved out of the NBP in 1989) by end-1996, on an individual basis and with involvement of strategic investors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - APPENDIX II followed by their privatization. While privatization might thus take somewhat longer than the original deadline of end-1996, the authorities pointed to the many advantages of the new approach, including important synergies from consolidation, the inclusion of two large banks hitherto excluded from privatization, and new possibilities to link bank privatiza- tion with pension reform and to satisfy outstanding compensation claims against the budget. While welcoming these positive aspects, the staff noted that the new approach raised complex issues, such as the linkage with (and nature of) the social security reform, the role of strategic investors, and the specific timetable. The authorities were aware that much work remained to be done in fleshing out the new program, but expressed their firm commitment to press ahead with its implementation as quickly as possible. Regarding other specialized banks, restructuring of the Bank for Food Economy (BGZ) continues to face delays and obstacles that have so far precluded the adoption of a comprehensive reform plan with World Bank assistance. The authorities recognized the seriousness of the problems of this bank, but pointed to the significant actions that had already been implemented to assure against a further widening of the losses at this bank, including strengthened management systems and improved internal operating procedures. 5. Trade and exchange reforms Poland has continued to liberalize its trade system in line with agreements with the EU, EFTA, and CELIA, and in the context of the Uruguay Round and accession to the WTO. As a result, the average effective tariff rate was reduced from 11.8 percent at end-December 1994 to 9.8 percent from July 1, 1995, onward. The import surcharge was lowered from 6 percent to 5 percent on January 1, 1995. Parliament has approved legislation to reduce the surcharge to 3 percent, effective January 1, 1996, and the authorities intend to eliminate the surcharge by end-1996. In accordance with its international agreements, Poland is phasing out a few remaining quantitative restrictions on exports and imports. Effective June 1, 1995, Poland accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions (EBD/95/99, 7/19/95). The move to Article VIII status was facilitated by a new foreign exchange law, which came into force on January 1, 1995, and the subsequent implementation of related regulations. In October 1995, exchange regulations were relaxed further by allowing enterprises to hold foreign exchange in bank accounts rather than immediately sell them to banks.

Exchange Rate Arrangement The zloty is pegged to a currency composite made up of the U.S. dollar, deutsche mark, pound sterling, French franc, and the Swiss franc. On August 27, 1993 the zloty value of the basket was devalued by 8 percent (7.4 percent in foreign currency terms). The value of the zloty is depreciated by 1.2 percent per month since February 15, 1995. From January 1, 1995, the zloty was redenominated, with new Zl 1 equalling old Zl 10,000. On May 16, 1995, bands of +/- 7 percent were introduced around the central rate, which continued to crawl at the rate of 1.2 percent per month against a basket of currencies. Following the implementation of the new system, the zloty appreciated initially by about 5 percent. In early September, the exchange rate was allowed to appreciate a further 1 percent within the ban,d. On October 31, 1995 the official rate was Zl 2.4525 per US$l. VIII. Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation was concluded at EBM/94/25 (3/25/94). In concluding the 1994 Article IV Consultation with Poland, Executive Directors commended the authorities for pursuing over the past four years policies to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and economic transformation. The rebound in economic activity was evidence that such policies were finally reaping the benefits of past adjustment efforts, while the passage of the 1994 budget was seen as evidence of the Government's commitment to maintain fiscal discipline. Executive Directors emphasized, however, that substantial challenges lay ahead-- especially on the inflation front and in continued fiscal pressures. These challenges would furthermore have to be met in a context of continuing social costs. Thus, a significant medium-term improvement in private savings and a reduction in public sector dissavings would be needed. Such improvement would require continued structural reform, especially in the areas of the social security system and financial intermediation. Poland is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The following decision was taken by the Executive Board on March 25, 1994: A. 1994 Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Poland's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with Poland, in light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with Poland conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Poland maintains exchange restrictions under Article XIV as described in EBS/94/48, and the multiple currency practice that arises from the operation of the parallel exchange market is subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and (3). The Fund encourages Poland to eliminate, as soon as circumstances permit, the exchange restrictions Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 41 - APPENDIX V maintained under Article XIV, including those arising under the remaining bilateral payments arrangements. The Fund urges Poland to eliminate the multiple currency practice as soon as possible. B. Review Under Stand-By Arraneement 1. Poland has consulted with the Fund in accordance with paragraphs 4(d) and 4(e) of the stand-by arrangement for Poland (EBS/92/219, Supplement 3, 3/11/93) and the last paragraph of the letter &ted December 14, 1992 from the Minister of Finance and the President of the National Bank of Poland. 2. The letter from the Prime Minister of Poland &ted March 9, 1994, and the memorandum attached thereto, shall be attached to the stand-by arrangement. 3. The reviews contemplated in paragraphs 4(d) and 4(e) of the stand-by arrangement are completed. On May 10, 1995, at the conclusion of the first review of the stand- by arrangement approved on August 5, 1994, the Executive Board took the following decision: 1. Poland has consulted with the Fund in accordance with paragraph 3(c) of the stand-by arrangement for Poland (EBS/94/145, Supplement 2, 8/11/94), as amended, and the last paragraph of the letter of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and the President of the National Bank of Poland, dated July 14, 1994, as amended by the letter of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and the President of the National Bank of Poland dated October 5, 1994, in order to (1) review progress under the program, (2) reach understanding with regard to the circumstances in which purchases under the arrangement can be resumed, subject to partial rephasing of remaining purchases, and (3) establish performance criteria for end-June and end-September, 1995. 2. The letters of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and the President of the National Bank of Poland, dated March 31, 1995 and April 30, 1995, respectively, shall be attached to the stand-by arrangement, as amended, and the letter dated July 14, 1994 with annexed memorandum, as amended, shall be read as supplemented and modified by the letters dated March 31, 1995 and April 30, 1995, respectively. 3. Accordingly the following provisions of the stand-by arrangement for Poland, as amended, are amended to read as follows: (i) Paragraph 2(a) reads as follows: "Purchases under this stand-by arrangement shall not, without the consent of the Fund, exceed the equivalent of SDR 333.3 million until November 15, 1994, the equivalent of SDR 393.3 million until February 15, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIXV 1995, the equivalent of SDR 453.3 million until August 15, 1995, the equivalent of SDR 533.3 million until November 15, 1995, and the equivalent of SDR 613.3 million until February 15, 1996." (ii) Paragraph 3(a) reads as follows: "3 . Poland will not make purchases under this stand-by arrangement that would increase the Fund's holdings of Poland's currency subject to repurchase beyond 25 percent of quota: (a) during any period in which the &ta at the end of the preceding period indicate that (i> (ii) (iii) (iv> (VI the limits on the contracting and guaranteed of new nonconcessional external debt specified in Annex A, B, C, D, and E, respectively, of the letter &ted the limits on cumulative deficit of the general Government, or the limits on net credit of the banking system to the general government, or the limit on the net domestic assets of the banking system, or the targets for minimum levels of net international reserves in convertible currencies of the banking system, or March 31, 1995, as amended by the letter &ted April 30, 1995 are not observed; or" 4. The Fund decides that the first review contemplated in paragraph 3(c) of the stand-by arrangement for Poland, as amended, is completed and that, notwithstanding the nonobservance of the performance criterion set out in paragraph 3(e)(ii) of the stand-by arrangement, as amended, Poland may proceed to make purchases in accordance with the provisions of the stand-by arrangement, as amended.

World Bank lending; The World Bank initiated lending to Poland in FY90. As of September 30, 1995, loans totalling USS3.9 billion equivalent had been approved, the most recent being a US$45 million loan for the Katowice Heat Supply Project, approved on November 17, 1995. The total amount of commitments includes US$1,350 million in quick disbursing funds, consisting of a Structural Adjustment Loan, fully disbursed, three hybrid operations, and two major sector adjustment loans. The latter two operations, approved in late FY93, were designed to support banking sector capitalization, enterprise workouts, enterprise and bank privatization (Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan) and structural adjustment and privatization in agriculture (Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan). The World Bank's lending program aims at achieving five basic objectives: (i) to secure a stable macroeconomic framework, and to further strengthen Poland's underlying creditworthiness; (ii) to support enterprise reform and restructuring, privatization, and the growth of the private sector; (iii) to upgrade the country's infrastructure (including financial sector infrastructure) in ways that would support a market economy; (iv) to enhance environmental amelioration in all sectors of the economy; and (v) to support the strengthening of Poland's social safety net in order to help the country sustain the social impact of its systemic transformation. Due to the heavy reform agenda, adjustment lending has played a crucial role. Investment loans, often including important sector policy elements, have been designed to reinforce the implementation of structural reforms and provide funds for priority investments. Investment loans have been approved in a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, industry, energy, environment, infrastructure, housing, financial, and social sectors. Lending has been complemented by economic and sector work as well as technical assistance. A number of projects are at different stages of preparation for possible approval in FY96 and FY97: three water supply projects (Bielsko- Biala, Bydgoszcz and Wroclaw), two in power (power transmission, power generation), a port project, a municipal development project, and a registry reform project.
