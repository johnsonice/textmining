The mission met the Minister of Finance, of Employment and Social Security, the Governor of the Bank of Portugal, officials from a number of ministries and the Bank of Portugal, and representatives of banks, industry, and labor. Mr. Lanciotti and Ms. Bessone- Basto, Executive Director and Assistant to the Director for Portugal, attended as observers. At the conclusion of the last consultation on August 29, 1994, Directors called for faster fiscal consolidation to ease the burden on monetary policy. Most Directors agreed that exchange rate stability should continue to be the basis of an anti-inflationary monetary policy. The timeliness and quality of Portugal's economic data are adequate for effective surveillance, despite weaknesses in certain areas (see Appendix). Portugal has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4; it maintains exchange restrictions against Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). I. Background to the Discussions The discussions took place against the backdrop of political elections scheduled for October 1, 1995. The electoral campaign has not revealed any major differences on economic policies between the ruling Social Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party. In particular, both parties have affirmed their commitment to the Maastricht targets and a disinflationary monetary policy based on exchange rate stability in the ERM. This consensus is largely a fruit of the progress achieved since EU accession in 1986. The decade of Mr. Cavaco Silva's government saw a pivotal departure from the interventionist policies pursued for much of the period following the 1974 revolution, which had been marked by recurrent balance of payments crises and two stand-by arrangements from the Fund. Besides the opening up of the economy entailed by EU accession, the authorities set in I/ Messrs. Leipold (head) and Lane, Ms. Carkovic, Messrs.

Macroeconomic stabilization also progressed, although fiscal consolidation suffered a severe setback in 1993. The policies of the last decade brought positive results in terms of both real and nominal convergence, muting the debate about any perceived trade-off: per capita income levels increased from one-half to almost two-thirds of the European average; inflation declined to its lowest level in 25 years; and real wage flexibility curbed the increase in unemployment to well below that in the rest of Europe (Chart 1). Unemployment however rose rapidly in the latest cycle, with a sharp increase in youth and long-term unemployment (Chart 2). The present economic setting is propitious in a number of respects: 0 although, as is habitual, Portugal's cycle has lagged the rest of Europe--with the recovery from the recession starting only toward mid-1994-- GDP erowth is projected to strengthen to 2.8 percent in 1995 (Table 1) and to above its estimated potential of 3 percent in 1996; a the pattern of the recoverv--led by exports followed by investment-- has been sound; signs of a pickup in consumption remain mixed. 1/ The current account deficit is expected to remain under 1 percent of GDP in 1995, consistent with the current phase of the cycle (Table 2); l prospects for containing inflation to within the target range of 3%-4% percent for 1995 appear good, aided by continued wage moderation, sustained productivity growth, and scant evidence of capacity constraints. An output gap of some 2% percent is estimated to persist in 1995. The main policy deficiency in recent years has been laxity in the public finances. The recession and serious failings in tax administration led to a doubling of the general government deficit in 1993, to over 7 percent of GDP; the ratio of government debt to GDP--which had fallen to close to the Maastricht criterion by 1992--reversed its declining trend. This setback remains to be addressed, as the unambitious budgets presented in both 1994 and 1995 have perpetuated a primary deficit and a rising debt-to-GDP ratio. With monetary policy left to bear the brunt of the anti-inflation effort, markets have questioned the sustainability of the policy mix, demanding high interest rate premia and launching periodic attacks on the escudo. II. ReDort on the Discussions The progress of the past decade has allowed Portugal to approach the threshold of economic and monetary integration in consort with the most stable l./ Although individual indicators of private consumption provide contrasting signals, a composite coincident indicator constructed by the authorities indicates a moderate pickup (Chart 2).

The discussions focussed on the policies required to cross this threshold, in line with the targets of the convergence plan, notably: the adoption of a 1996 budget that would clearly resume the consolidation effort; the maintenance of exchange rate stability; an overhau of the social security system; and the extension of privatization to the remaining cases. The authorities agreed with the thrust of these priorities but--with elections pending- -were inclined to leave the specifics to the new government. There was nonetheless recognition of the importance of maintaining a stance that preserved confidence, and there were no signs of pre-electoral laxity in policies. 1. Fiscal policy The 1995 budget envisages an unchanged general government overall deficit (5.8 percent of GDP) and allows a slight deterioration in the primary deficit relative to the 1994 outcome; the debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to rise, to above 71 percent. The main revenue measures include a further harmonization of VAT rates and action to improve tax administration. The staff judged the 1995 budget to be singularly unambitious, especially given the opportunity for faster fiscal retrenchment offered by the economic upswing; it noted the cumulative 3% percent of GDP deterioration in the structural primary balance since 1992 implied by the budget targets. The authorities explained that the 1995 budget had been framed in the midst of what was still a tenuous recovery and when an even worse fiscal outcome was being projected for 1994; some further adjustment had been intended. They also felt that any assessment of the adjustment path should take into account Portugal's need to undertake significantly higher capital expenditures than the EU on average. They nonetheless concurred that execution of the 1995 budget could and should improve upon the targets. Developments in the first half of 1995 had been positive, with a moderate growth of current expenditure and tax revenues in excess of the budget targets, which had been consciously cautious. In sum, while refraining from officially revising the target, the authorities agreed on the feasibility of a general government deficit of 5% percent of GDP or less in 1995. The present government has decided to leave the revision of the converaence plan--last updated in late 1993--to its successor. That plan sought to achieve the Maastricht fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP in 1997 and a declining path for the debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995. Its other main goal was to reduce inflation to 3 percent, with growth projected at an average of 4 percent, a full percentage point above the assumed EU average during the period. While the authorities acknowledged that the growth projection will Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4 - likely need to be revised downward, IJ and the public debt-to-GDP ratio has yet to begin declining, there is a consensus on the desirability and feasibility of achieving the plan's fiscal deficit and inflation targets. Support for these objectives was based on the perception that Portugal is now well-placed to observe the Maastricht criteria and to aim for EMU participation by 1999. Views differed, however, as to whether Portugal would be well-advised to join EMU even in the absence of major trading partners, with the position of Spain being of course a central consideration; a judgment in this regard was seen to depend largely on the regime which would govern non-participants. But, over and beyond EMU participation, the convergence plan objectives of fiscal consolidation and disinflation were seen as worth pursuing in their own right. Concerns about their possible contractionary impact were allayed by three main considerations. First, there was the expectation that fiscal consolidation would help to lower high interest rate premia, with virtuous-circle effects on confidence and investment. Second, the economic recovery underway in Portugal and Europe--and the latter's favorable impact on Portugal's exports- -would dampen the aggregate demand effect of the planned fiscal adjustment. Third, structural reforms that would be an integral part of the fiscal consolidation effort--such as those affecting social security, tax administration, and privatization--would have positive efficiency effects and improve the environment for growth. The mission shared these views, and considered the magnitude of the fiscal adjustment envisaged in the convergence plan as adequate. It would make room for investment to approach the levels prevailing before the 1993 recession; it would help contain the current account deficit at modest levels, despite the likely adverse effect of an aging population on private savings; and it would serve to reverse the debt dynamics, entailing a primary surplus of close to 2% percent of GDP by 1997 (compared to a debt-stabilizing primary balance of approximately zi percent of GDP). The staff stressed, however, that significant additional measures would be needed to reduce the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 1997. An essential component of fiscal adjustment would be containment in current primary expenditures, which have risen by 5 percentage points of GDP since 1990. Policies presently in place --notably the operation of the social security system--have created a situation in which expenditure will continue to grow rapidly even in the absence of new commitments. The staff suggested setting a norm of no real increase in current primary spending, supported by l/ For 1996-97, the current WE0 projections show a gradual pickup in consumption and a continued good performance of exports and investment, raising output growth to between 3-3% percent. With the recovery established, the current account is expected to show small deficits. Assisted by exchange rate stability and an output level that would still be below potential, inflation is projected to continue its declining trend, although remaining slightly above the convergence plan objective. At present, the main downside risk to this outlook rests in the possibility of a close electoral outcome, which could protract political uncertainty and affect confidence.

Apart from social security reform, which would have an impact mainly in the medium-term, key measures would be (a) the pursuit of a program of public employment reduction, with the implementation of the long- pending reform of the civil service; (b) the containment of wage awards, keeping them at the lower end of the inflation target range; and (c) an increase in the efficiency of health and education expenditure. Achievement of the convergence plan targets would also demand an increased revenue effort. As improved tax administration shows results only gradually, the 1996 budget would need to include quicker-yielding revenue measures. Overall, the staff estimated that discretionary measures of 2 percent of GDP would be required to achieve the convergence plan's deficit and debt targets for 1997 (Chart 3 and Table 3). An illustrative staff scenario indicates that, starting from a better-than-budgeted outcome in 1995, the combination of-a 1 percentage point VAT increase in the 1996 budget, no real growth in current discretionary expenditures, and a larger share of privatization receipts devoted to debt reduction u would secure the convergence'plan's fiscal targets. The path recommended by the staff was front-loaded in 1996, so as to reverse the debt dynamics early and strengthen confidence on the attainment of the Maastricht criterion by 1997. While not having developed an updated quantitative program, 2J the authorities tended to have a more sanguine view than the staff about the impact on the fiscal accounts of the ongoing recovery and declining interest rates. The mission welcomed the progress made in the debt management strategy of the Treasury, with its emphasis on lowering funding costs on a medium-term horizon and protecting the public finances from short-term fluctuations in interest rates. It supported the creation of a specialized debt management unit to help these efforts. While concurring with the authorities that the share of external debt is still relatively small in Portugal, the staff noted its rapid increase in recent years (to a budgeted 12 percent of GDP in 1995), and advised caution in its further expansion. IJ In 1993, the share of privatization receipts used for debt reduction was reduced from a mandatory 80 percent to at least 40 percent; the remainder can be used to inject capital to restructure other public enterprises. In questioning this change, the staff stressed the importance of adequate control, monitoring, and transparency to ensure that the proceeds were used for effective restructuring in preparation for privatization. 2/ The 1993 convergence plan did not set a fiscal deficit target for 1996. However, on the request of the EU Commission, in late 1994 the government indicated a general government deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for 1996, derived as a linear interpolation of the budgeted deficit for 1995 and the target for 1997. In July 1995, the ECOFIN Council's recommendation to Portugal under the excessive deficit procedure made reference to this figure, linking it to the continued availability of Cohesion Fund financing (SM/95/187, 8/l/95).

Monetarv policy In the discussions on monetary policy, the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to exchange rate stability as the pillar of anti-inflationary policy; they were disinclined to consider alternative regimes, such as money or inflation targeting, owing to the lack of a stable money demand function or of reliable inflation forecasting models. IJ The exchange rate commitment was seen to have produced benefits in terms of inflation convergence since the escudo began shadowing the ERM in 1990. The approach had admittedly not been free of setbacks, notably in the period of ERM turbulence in 1992-93, marked by two devaluations of the escudo's central rate (Chart 4). The potential inflationary impact of the sharp depreciation of the escudo was at that time contained by the effects of the recession on cost developments, with a marked deceleration in wage settlements in 1993. Thereafter, the stability of the exchange rate within the ERM (notwithstanding a further realignment in March 1995) 2J and its appreciation in nominal effective terms, along with continued wage moderation and subdued consumption spending, have helped keep inflation in check--in particular, the authorities noted that the impact of the VAT increase in early 1995 had been contained and short-lived. Following the widening of the ERM bands in August 1993 and up to the March 1995 realignment, exchanve rate management sought to maintain the escudo within the old 6 percent margins. Since March, the escudo has fluctuated within a narrower range, % to 3 percent below its new central parity. The authorities stated that this should not be interpreted as a change in policy. They considered it preferable not to specify a target range of fluctuation for the escudo within the ERM bands: the possible advantages of greater transparency were seen to be outweighed by the creation of potential focal points for market pressures. The central bank's approach was to maintain the escudo around the middle of the ERM grid, keeping it from becoming the weakest currency in the system, so as to minimize exposure to possible attacks. It felt that the scope for an active use of the wider ERM bands was limited, especially on the part of currencies viewed as vulnerable by the markets. At the time of the discussions, official interest rates had remained unchanged since October 1994. The Bank of Portugal felt it would be advisable to maintain a clearly cautious stance in the period up to the elections and until an appropriately tight 1996 budget was approved. It was wary of lowering money market rates during this period lest this increase inflation expectations, with perverse effects on long-term yields. However, in late l-J Financial and capital account liberalization have generated strong fluctuations in money and credit aggregates. For example, L- (a broad measure of liquidity) grew sharply in 1994 partly as a result of portfolio shifts from bond mutual funds to bank deposits, while credit to the private sector was boosted by ongoing structural changes (e.g., the removal of restrictions on consumer credit and increased bank competition in the mortgage market). 2/ This realignment was viewed by the authorities as unavoidable due to the devaluation of the Spanish peseta; they noted the absence of market pressures on the escudo prior to the devaluation.

Long-term yields subsequently also declined, lending credence to the central bank's prudent approach. There was agreement that, once political uncertainties had been resolved and fiscal consolidation resumed, there would likely be scope for further interest rate reductions, while maintaining the commitment to exchange rate stability. In such an environment, there was also confidence that long-term interest rate differentials would narrow from their presently high levels (Box 1). Box 1. The Persistence of High Long-Term Interest Rate Differentials Despite a stronger fiscal position than in Italy and lower inflation than in both Italy and Spain since early 1995, Portugal’s long-term interest rate differentials against Germany (currently around 500 basis points) have remained above those in Spain and close to those in Italy (Chart 5). Same- currency yield spreads--that would reflect any country-specific credit risk--are, at 40 basis points, only about half those prevailing on Italian government issues, as might be expected in a country with a considerably lower level of public debt. Thus, current interest rate differentials appear to reflect primarily currency and inflation risk, with financial markets remaining skeptical about Portugal’s ability to deliver sustained price stability. Apart from the effect of the current political calendar, the discussions highlighted three main sources of such skepticism: 0 the weak fiscal performance of recent years and doubts about the sustainability of the policy mix; l Portugal’s relatively short history of low inflation: as recently as in 1991 inflation was in the double digits and markets may therefore remain unconvinced of the permanence of lower inflation; 0 the Bank of Portugal’s anti-inflationary credentials remain to be fully established, with public disagreements on monetary policy in the course of 1993-94 possibly also setting back the markets’ perception of scope for independent central bank action. In September 1995, the central bank’s statutes were changed so as to enhance its independence, inter alia endowing it formally with the mandate of price stability. The background document contains further analysis of this issue. Looking ahead, the authorities saw observance of the ERM commitment under the current central parity as consistent with further disinflation to the Maastricht requirements. This policy was regarded as sustainable based on the assessment that the current level of comnetitiveness was adequate, and that the external accounts could well absorb a further slight real appreciation while inflation convergence was completed. The escudo appreciated sharply in real effective terms in the late 1980s and through mid-1992 (Chart 6, upper panel). This process was examined in detail during last year's consultation, which concluded that the appreciation was to a large extent an equilibrium phenomenon associated with EU integration, and that the level of competitive- ness remained broadly appropriate. The subsequent ERM realignments of 1992-93 entailed some real effective depreciation, only partly offset by more recent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - movements. Indirect indicators of competitiveness continue to be reassuring: the sharp gains in market shares recorded following EU membership were maintained through 1994 (Chart 6, lower panel); export growth in 1995 remains strong, and significant new export capacity is coming on stream; the relative importance of the tradable sector has been increasing; and the current account is expected to hover around balance or a small deficit in the medium-term. Against this background, the staff concurred that there were no perceptible balance of payments problems that would indicate a need to deviate from the current exchange rate policy. 3. Structural volicies The discussions highlighted the need for structural action in four areas: social security, tax administration, privatization, and financial supervision; they also covered labor market issues. The finances of the social security system have been under increasing strain and threaten to derail fiscal convergence (Box 2). The mission found a consensus on the need for social security reform, but studies on possible avenues for change had only just begun. The staff indicated the general principles that should guide the reform, if the pay-as-you-go system is maintained: J/ containing pension cost increases while limiting the tax on labor; establishing a closer link between benefits and contributions; reducing and better targeting the current wide range of welfare benefits; and separating the provision and financing of pension and welfare benefits. The generous regime governing civil servants' pensions (whose budgetary cost was set to reach 3 percent of GDP in 1995) also needed to be aligned more closely with that prevailing for other workers. The mission welcomed recent action to strengthen tax administration, notably the shortening of collection lags, the recovery of tax arrears, and a start in the automation and unification of VAT and income tax information. It called for an intensification of these efforts, along the lines recommended by recent Fund technical assistance. A number of other tax issues would also need to be addressed in the near future, such as the reform of local taxes, notably on real estate, and a review of the taxation of financial activities. A commission was examining some of these issues and would report by end-year. The government's privatization program, initiated in 1989, has been ambitious and sizable. 2J With privatization in the financial sector largely completed, the process is proceeding in the industrial sector. Many of the companies remaining in public hands constitute the more complex cases, either because of their financial situation or of the regulatory issues posed I/ An alternative course would be a transition to fully-funded private pension funds, with the government's role limited to providing minimum pensions. 2/ The OECD estimates that the size of total privatization receipts, at some 9 percent of GDP between 1989-94, places Portugal as the third largest privatizer in the OECD, after the United Kingdom and New Zealand (OECD Economic Survey for Portugal, 1995); see also SM/94/217, Suppl. 1, 8/23/94.

The Social Security System 0 The social security system provides retirement and survivor pensions and a wide array of “cradle-to-grave” welfare benefits, most of which are granted on a universal basis. Expenditures are financed by contributions and residually by the state. The contribution rate--at 35 percent of wages-- is among the highest in Europe. 0 Social security expenditure has increased rapidly in recent years--to almost 10 percent of GDP in 1995-&e to the widening coverage of the social welfare net, the ageing of the population, real increases in benefits, and the effects of the recession. Consequently, financing from the state increased by almost 2 percentage points of GDP in 1990-94. Collection problems also plague the system: arrears to social security were 2% percent of GDP at end-1994. Moreover, the pension formula and collection deficiencies provide a weak link between benefits and contributions. 0 Absent policy reforms, social security expenditures will continue to rise. The dependency ratio is projected to double in the next 35 years. More immediately, the average pension paid will increase in real terms as people who retire accrue higher pensions, reflecting the real wage increase of the past decade; this factor alone increased average real pensions by over 3 percent per annum so far in the 1990s. The background document contains a further examination of these issues. by their privatization. The staff welcomed the government’s preparation of detailed plans which could be brought to completion by its successor, given the broad consensus on the benefits of privatization. It also called on the authorities to improve corporate governance in public enterprises so as to avoid future debt assumptions by the government. Portugal's financial system has been changing rapidly, with privatization of most banks, liberalization of financial activities, increased competition, the move to universal banking, and the formation of large heterogeneous financial groups. The authorities were keenly aware of the need for improvements in supervision and regulation commensurate with the changes occurring in the system; they agreed on the need for a consolidated approach to supervision by the Bank of Portugal and the other agencies involved. The staff and a number of studies have viewed Portugal's labor market as relatively flexible with, in particular, real wage flexibility leading to a better unemployment performance than in EU partner countries. However, the staff noted that the speed and size of the recent rise in unemployment was striking. It reviewed with the authorities whether changes in the institutional arrangements affecting the labor market (e.g., the easing of the requirements to establish eligibility for unemployment benefits, or the increasing coverage of labor regulations to previously informal sectors) may have contributed to a rise in structural unemployment. This issue was not at the forefront of the policy debate, and the authorities felt that the recent performance of unemployment was predominantly cyclical. There was nonetheless Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - agreement on the need to promote regional mobility by liberalizing the overregulated housing market, and employers saw scope for further reducing rigidities in dismissals. Finally, the mission reviewed the status of statistical data (Appendix). III. Staff Apnraisal Since EU accession almost a decade ago, Portugal has made great strides toward the living standards of the rest of Europe, while macroeconomic stabilization has proceeded apace, reducing inflation to a level that has not been seen for many years. These commendable achievements underlie the current consensus to strive toward full economic and monetary integration with the most stable economies of Europe. Achieving this goal will however require a notable strengthening of the effort that has already brought Portugal so far. The economic upswing provides a propitious setting for the incoming government to shoulder this effort. Although fiscal adjustment has gradually resumed after the severe deterioration of 1993, the ground lost has only begun to be recovered. The persistence of Portugal's high long-term interest rate premia reflects continued market skepticism rooted in the fiscal imbalance, as well as the recent history of high inflation. This situation renders Portugal vulnerable to swings in confidence, including those affecting Spain. The 1995 budget targets imply an inappropriate pause in fiscal adjustment. A general government deficit that is some % percent of GDP below the budget figure is within reach and should be aimed for. The likely better- than-budgeted revenue performance should be fully harnessed to this end. Looking beyond the current year, the new government will be faced with the demanding task of reducing the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 1997, in line with the convergence plan. Excessive reliance on the growth dividend or on optimistic interest rate assumptions to achieve this target would be misplaced, and difficult decisions in a number of areas will be required. Staff estimates indicate that the spending dynamics of present policies are such that discretionary measures amounting to some 2 percentage points of GDP will be needed. These measures, addressing both revenues and expenditures, should be significantly front-loaded in the 1996 budget and designed to have a permanent impact, so as to provide a credible signal of the resumption of the consolidation effort and a margin of safety for the attainment of the convergence plan targets in 1997. Action is first and foremost required to restrain the growth of current noninterest expenditure, also to ensure room for the desired level of public investment. Essential ingredients of such action will be the containment of wage costs and a program of public employment reduction. A lasting decline in the growth rate of current expenditure will, however, remain elusive unless the unsustainable dynamics of transfer payments are firmly reversed. In particular, there is a need for an early reform of the social security system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - The reform will need to reduce pension expenditures while limiting the tax on labor, and curtail the wide array of welfare benefits granted on a universal basis, targeting them to the truly needy. The achievement of the convergence plan targets will require that action on the expenditure side be joined with an increased revenue effort. Recent steps to strengthen tax administration are welcome and demonstrate the authorities' will to secure a more efficient and equitable tax system. This effort needs to be intensified, given a still unacceptably high degree of noncompliance with the major taxes. Improvements in tax administration, however, show revenue results only gradually. To place the fiscal balance clearly on the way to achieving the 1997 objective, a more immediate increase in revenues will need to be sought in the 1996 budget. VAT rates which are not unduly high by EU standards could provide the necessary scope to this end. The reduction in inflation is an important achievement. The authorities' commitment to exchange rate stability remains central to the continued pursuit of nominal convergence. The staff supports the Bank of Portugal's cautious stance in the pre-electoral period and until a rigorous 1996 budget has been approved. Indeed, the authorities will need to stand ready to raise interest rates should exchange market pressures reemerge. Looking ahead to when political uncertainties have been resolved and fiscal consolidation resumed, there will likely be scope for a gradual easing of interest rates, while maintaining the commitment to a stable exchange rate as the pillar of anti- inflationary policy. This commitment is consistent with preserving an adequate level of competitiveness. There has been noteworthy progress in structural reform in recent years: in particular, the privatization program has proceeded and financial market liberalization has been rapid and far-reaching. Privatization now has to extend to some of the more difficult cases, and the preparatory work underway is opportune. It is also essential to ensure that all privatization proceeds that are retained in state enterprises be used effectively to address their structural weaknesses and prepare them for early privatization. The banking and financial system has also experienced significant structural changes, rendering it more competitive and flexible. Experience in other countries has illustrated the importance of accompanying such a process of change with an appropriate strengthening of the supervisory framework. Economic data in Portugal are adequate for effective surveillance, although continued efforts to improve quality are required in some areas. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Portugal be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The authorities are fully cooperative in providing data to the Fund, and they provide the data regularly. The staff and the Bank of Portugal are preparing a system of electronic data transmission to the Fund on a monthly basis that will improve the timeliness of data provision and the monitoring of developments between consultations. Portugal's publication policy is characterized by a high degree of frequency and openness. The main recent methodological changes in the compilation of statistics have affected the national accounts and the balance of payments. National accounts data were revised in line with EU guidelines to harmonize accounting standards within Europe. The revised accounts include the autonomous regions of Acores and Madeiras and additional activities in the services sector, thus improving the coverage and quality of the series. Some weaknesses in the compilation of statistics in the services sector remain, and the National Statistics Office (INE) is working to resolve them. Moreover, yearly official data are available only up to 1991, while 1992-94 data are estimates. INE expects to provide official 1992 national accounts shortly. Quarterly national accounts are only estimates, and they extend to 1994. The analysis of current output trends is done through a range of quantitative indicators and opinion surveys, including the Bank of Portugal's and INE's coincident economic indicators. Remaining weaknesses in real sector statistics extend to the industrial production index, with : serious deficiencies in the processing of survey responses, and the lack of a comprehensive wholesale price index. As in other EU countries, the abolition of customs controls within the. EU in 1993 and the liberalization of capital movements obliged Portugal to adopt a new balance of navments compilation system. The new system is guided by the methodological recommendations of the Statistical Office of the European Community and it differs from the old system in two areas. First, the new system compiles international trade statistics using data obtained directly from companies, instead of customs data. Second, the new system uses data from financial institutions and from resident entities engaged in international transactions not intermediated by banks, thus generating more detailed and accurate information. Most recently, the capital account was affected by methodological revisions to include the off- shore center of Madeira in the domestic data. This change has improved the consistency between monetary and balance of payments statistics. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicTable 4.
