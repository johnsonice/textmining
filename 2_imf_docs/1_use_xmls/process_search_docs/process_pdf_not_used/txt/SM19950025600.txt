Introduction and Executive Summarv Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation with Myanmar were held in Yangon during August 11-23, 1995. The Myanma representatives included: the Deputy Prime Minister, Admiral Maung Maung Khin; the Minister of Finance, Brigadier-General Win Tin; the Minister of Planning, Brigadier- General Abel; and the Central Bank Governor, U Kyi Aye. 5/ Myanmar con- tinues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. Previous Board Discussion For the past several years, Article IV consultations with Myanmar have focused on the need for comprehensive economic reforms in order for the country to achieve its full economic potential. Executive Directors have noted the authorities' tentative moves toward a market economy, but concluded that without fundamental structural reforms and stronger stabilization policies, Myanmar's growth and balance of payments prospects over the medium term were not promising. Recent DeveloDments Growth has averaged 7 percent per year over the past three years with agriculture responding strongly to improved incentives. The external position has strengthened as a result of higher exports and foreign investment. However, the official exchange rate remains grossly overvalued, and fiscal and monetary policies have continued to be lax; inflation has remained in the 20-30 percent range. The following events on the political front are noteworthy: the military Government recently entered into ceasefire agreements with a number of rebel armies in the northern border regions; a convention to draft guidelines for a new national constitution is set to reconvene in late October 1995; and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest in July 1995. Policy Issues The policy discussions focused on the elements of a comprehensive reform program. Required immediate measures are a large devaluation of the official exchange rate and liberalization of the exchange and trade regime, accompanied by a tightening of fiscal and monetary policies to contain inflation. These actions would have to be followed by structural measures I/ The staff team comprised Messrs. Dodsworth (head), Braulke, Gunjal, and Heytens (all CTA), and Ms. Rosario (Administrative Assistant - CTA). The mission was joined by representatives of the World Bank (Mr. Shetty) and the Asian Development Bank (Mr. Prasad). Mrs. Cheong (Alternate Executive Director) attended the policy meetings.

Pronosal for a Program to be Monitored by the Staff The authorities indicated that political conditions were now more favorable for implementation of economic reforms along the lines recommended--including the necessary exchange rate action. At the conclusion of the discussions, the Finance Minister requested further discussions leading toward a program that could be monitored by Fund staff. The authorities viewed such a program as a means of addressing their economic problems and as a step toward a full Fund program once sufficient international support became available. Staff Assessment and Follow UP Addressing Myanmar's deep-rooted economic problems will require determined actions by the authorities as well as concessional assistance from the international community. Even in the absence of such assistance, implementation of critical upfront measures would have important economic benefits and would establish the authorities' commitment to reform. A follow-up mission is planned to help formulate the specifics 0;‘ an economic program to be monitored by the staff. Such a program will require technical assistance to help with needed structural reforms and to upgrade economic statistics. This latter task is urgent as weaknesses in the statistical base (particularly long reporting lags and limited coverage) severely impede the monitoring of recent developments and the formulation of appropriate policies (Annex V). II. Backvround and Recent DeveloDments The inefficiencies of central planning, compounded by political turbulence, led to economic stagnation and decline in the second half of the 1980s. Piecemeal market reforms, introduced during 1989-92, lifted restric- tions on agricultural production, reduced price controls, allowed the private sector a more important role (particularly in external trade), and encouraged foreign investment. Since then, modifications have been made to the exchange system--including the introduction of foreign exchange certificates --which have effectively legalized a range of parallel market activities and reduced the coverage of the fixed official exchange rate. While these reforms improved economic performance, they were partial and failed to tackle several major problems. In particular: 0 the grossly overvalued official exchange rate continues to be applied to most public sector foreign transactions; lJ l-J The official exchange rate--pegged at SDR 1 - K 8.5 in 1977--is estimated to apply to about 25 percent of imports and 35 percent of exports. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - 0 large budgetary imbalances persist as a result of weakness in the government revenue base; 0 the state enterprise sector remains sheltered with losses accommodated by bank credit and government subsidies; and 0 private sector development continues to be inhibited by complex regulations and licensing, an underdeveloped financial system, and general partiality to the state enterprise sector. Despite the various structural distortions, real GDP has grown on average by 7 percent per year over the past three years. Agricultural production has been at the heart of the recovery, with strong growth-- particularly in paddy output --in response to higher producer prices. The resurgence in growth needs to be seen in the context of preceding large declines. Thus, per capita output in 1994/95 was still less than the level reached in the mid-1980s (Chart 1). u Nonetheless, there have been real improvements, including a less stringent foreign exchange situation resulting from higher exports and growing foreign direct investment (mostly to extractive industries). In 1994/95, although concessional assistance continued to be negligible- -except for grants from Japan linked to debt service payments-- the overall external deficit narrowed to $50 million compared with deficits of well over $200 million in each of the preceding three years. Gross official reserves increased from $250 million to $340 million (the equivalent of 2 l/2 months of imports) and the free market exchange rate remained relatively stable in the range of K 105-K 115 per U.S. dollar (Chart 2). Despite a stronger balance of payments, however, external debt arrears continued to accumulate; at end-March 1995, arrears, mainly to bilateral official creditors, totaled about $1 l/2 billion from a total external debt of $5 l/2 billion (Table 1). 2/ Stabilization measures have generally been weak. Inflation has continued in the range of 20-30 percent per year over the past several years, primarily reflecting excessive liquidity growth. During 1994/95, inflation rose to 26 percent (end of period), while broad money expanded by almost 40 percent. The bulk of increased liquidity reflected a large public sector borrowing requirement, including credits to cover losses of state enterprises. Although loans to the private sector expanded rapidly, these still account for less than one fifth of total credit. u Interest rates u Myanmar's fiscal year begins April 1. u Japan is the largest creditor accounting for about one half of total external debt. The next largest bilateral creditor, Germany, accounts for 9 percent of the total. About one quarter of the debt is owed to multilateral institutions, primarily the International Development Association and the Asian Development Bank. 2/ The factors underlying the liquidity growth are not entirely clear as there was also a large unexplained expansionary movement of other items net.

The public sector deficit widened in 1994/95 reflecting higher expenditures and the continued failure of revenues to keep pace with GDP. The revenue-to-GDP ratio has consistently fallen from 9 l/2 percent in 1991/92 to just over 7 percent in 1994/95. The reasons for this decline include: the use of the official exchange rate for valuation of customs duties; weak tax administration; and widespread exemptions from customs duties, income taxes, and the commercial (sales) tax. In previous years, the authorities responded to deteriorating revenue performance by reductions in current and capital outlays. In 1994/95, however, government expendi- tures appear to have risen quite sharply. Although provisional estimates indicate that the expenditure-to-GDP ratio remained at about the same level as in 1993/94, the level of bank financing recorded in the monetary survey suggests that expenditures were substantially higher. u The staff thus estimates the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) to have increased from 4 l/2 percent of GDP in 1993/94 to about 6 l/2 percent of GDP in 1994/95, compared with the authorities' estimate of 5 percent of GDP. III. Policv Discussions With good growth performance over the past few years, the authorities expressed strong confidence in the country's medium-term prospects, citing recent oil, gas, and mineral discoveries which are expected to substantially expand foreign exchange earnings from 1998 onwards. They also stressed the strong development potential of agriculture, light manufacturing, and tourism, noting the increasing interest of foreign investors in these areas. Against this optimism, however, the authorities were candid about the .urgency of tackling structural problems- -including addressing the exchange rate issue-- as well as the need for a more stable macroeconomic environment. Specifically, the authorities wish to give priority to: (i) increasing incentives for exports and diversifying agricultural production; (ii) expanding foreign direct investment, particularly into areas with higher domestic value-added and greater potential for employment creation; and (iii) developing infrastructure--both physical and social--through a sharp expansion of public investment. While agreeing with these broad aims the mission reiterated that, despite the country's rich resources, the slow progress made so far toward market reforms, combined with loose financial policies and limited access to external assistance, meant that recent growth rates were unlikely to be sustained over the medium term unless comprehensive reform policies were adopted. The mission also noted that an expansion of public investment u The inconsistency between the fiscal and monetary accounts was treated by the staff as unidentified government expenditure. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - would require stronger efforts to mobilize domestic resources as well as access to concessional external financing. 1. Elements of a comprehensive reform program The mission recommended that a first phase of reform should include adjustment of the official exchange rate to a market clearing level, together with liberalization and simplification of the exchange and trade system, and measures to strengthen stabilization policies. The latter would include government revenue measures, a shift to monetary restraint, and a substantial increase in interest rates. These immediate actions would be followed by the phased introduction of various structural measures in the context of continued tight financial policies. As regards structural measures, further detailed staff work will be needed in order to fully understand the complexities of the present system and to formulate an operational policy program. 2. External oolicies While the official exchange rate has remained fixed over the past few years, a shift of transactions from the official to the parallel exchange market has resulted in an effective depreciation of the kyat. To this end, the authorities have phased out surrender requirements for the private sector, allowed foreign currency swaps between exporters and importers, issued foreign exchange certificates, and promoted barter deals and informal border trade. The approach has seriously complicated the exchange and trade system, but it has placed all private sector external transactions at the parallel market rate. There remains, however, a core of public sector transactions, including all budgetary transactions, where foreign exchange is valued at the official rate (about one seventeenth of the parallel market rate). The official rate is, in effect, an implicit tax on state enterprise exports used to subsidize state enterprise production and budgetary outlays that have a high import content. The authorities indicated that the long-standing resistance to change in the official exchange rate had eased and that action may be possible in the near future. The discussions hence focused on the modalities and implications of an exchange rate adjustment. The authorities agreed that realignment of the official rate should take the form of a one-shot adjust- ment to a market clearing level (close to the present parallel rate) rather than a phased move which could stimulate speculation. The initial devalua- tion would be followed by flexible adjustment of the rate so as not to allow a significant parallel market premium to re-emerge. The exchange market would be widened at the outset by the licensing of nonbank foreign exchange dealers; at a later date, a foreign exchange trading floor would be introduced. The official rate realignment would need to be accompanied by a liberalization and simplification of the exchange and trade system. The mission recommended that quantitative trade restrictions be replaced by Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - tariffs, that a 5 percent export tax on the private sector be eliminated, and that export and import licensing requirements be simplified and phased out. Exchange reform would be directed toward ensuring private sector access to foreign exchange for current account transactions. Such reforms would obviate the need for issuance of foreign exchange certificates and remove the multiple currency practice involved in foreign currency swaps between exporters and importers. u The first round impact of a devaluation of the official rate would be to substantially redistribute kyat-denominated incomes and expenditures among different state enterprises and government ministries and departments (see Annex I). For state enterprises that are currently being subsidized through the official exchange rate, it is expected that output prices would be adjusted to fully pass-through the exchange rate change. The mission estimated that with full pass-through, the prices of commodities produced by state enterprises would rise, on average by 33 percent, which would imply about a 10 percent rise in the consumer price index. However, there would be wide variations between commodities--for instance, there would be substantial increases in official prices of petroleum products. u The authorities indicated that they may wish to consider a phased pass-through for prices of a few sensitive commodities. They also observed that exchange reform would seriously affect civil servants who relied more heavily than other groups on goods sold at official prices. Given that civil servant's real incomes had been eroded over the past few years, the authorities felt that an exchange rate change would require a civil service wage adjustment. In its response, the mission indicated that any delay in pass-through should be minimal and strictly limited to a few commodities. The scope for a public sector wage adjustment would depend on the willingness of the authorities to mobilize additional budgetary resources through taxation. 3. Financial nolicies The mission emphasized that a devaluation of the official exchange rate would need to be accompanied by a significant tightening of fiscal and monetary policies in order to keep inflation under control. Fiscal policy would be the key instrument and the aim would be to reduce expected recourse 1/ While Myanmar continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, it has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. However, Myanmar continues to maintain exchange restrictions in the form of limits on certain invisible payments and multiple currency practices arising from the sale by private exporters of their export proceeds to private importers at negotiated exchange rates and the issuance of foreign exchange certificates that are subject to approval under Article VIII. 2/ For certain goods, including petroleum and edible oil, there is rationing at the current official price and an active parallel market. Actual price increases in these cases to the final consumer would be less than suggested by the projected change in the official price. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - to domestic bank financing. The mission observed, however, that the 1995/96 budget was quite weak. The revenue-to-GDP ratio was expected to decline further and, even if projected expenditure cutbacks were achieved, the overall public sector deficit was likely to remain above 6 percent of GDP. An official exchange rate realignment is estimated to increase the central government deficit by about 5 percent of GDP mainly due to the impact on government imports and debt service payments. At the same time, state enterprises would gain about an equal amount from the devaluation. Higher contributions and windfall profit taxes from these enterprises would be needed to cover the increase in the central government deficit. Although the first-round impact on overall public sector finances would thus be broadly neutral, the planned civil service wage adjustment and any subsidies that would arise from phased pass-through to prices of the exchange rate change would need to be covered by additional revenue measures. A main source would be higher tariff revenues that would result from the use of the new official exchange rate as the basis for valuation of imports for customs purposes. Given that tariff revenues presently constitute less than 3 percent of import value, there should be scope to increase revenues from this source. Movement to a new customs valuation base would necessitate a downward revision of present high nominal tariff rates (which range up to 500 percent) and would offer an opportunity for a first step toward tariff reform. To expand revenues significantly over the medium term, tax and tariff reform and a strengthening of tax and customs administration would be required. Technical assistance in this area was provided by the Fund in 1990. At that time, measures were suggested to widen the tax base, increase buoyancy, and make enforcement more effective. Little progress has been made in implementing the recommendations. Exemptions from the corporate income tax and the commercial (sales) tax have become more widespread, the commercial tax continues to have a complex multiple rate system, and agricultural incomes-- which have recently risen sharply--have remained virtually untaxed. Within a program monitored by the staff, further technical assistance in the area of tax policy and administration would be required. Expenditures in real terms have declined over the past few years. Projected government outlays for 1995/96--at 12 percent of GDP--are quite low and there would appear to be limited scope for further overall reduction. Future steps would need to focus on restructuring expenditures toward more productive uses. In this connection, the mission noted that current outlays for education and health had been reduced sharply from 3 percent of GDP in 1991/92 to a budgeted 1 l/2 percent of GDP in 1995/96. During this period, defense expenditures had been maintained at a minimum of 3 l/4 percent of GDP and had risen above that level in some years. The mission also recommended that in the context of a public sector wage adjustment, the authorities should begin to dismantle the system of subsidizing rice and other consumer goods for civil servants. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - In regard to monetary policy, the main supporting measure for the devaluation would be an increase in interest rates to positive real levels in order to promote the attractiveness of holding kyat. The mission emphasized the important role that strong interest rate policies had played in exchange rate unifications in south-east Asia, particularly in Vietnam. At the same time, credit to state enterprises and to the private sector would need to be held firmly under control. In this latter respect, the authorities indicated a reluctance to utilize bank-by-bank credit controls, believing that domestic lending could be adequately contained through the use of interest rates, the liquidity ratio, and reserve requirements. The mission agreed with this as an initial approach but noted that, however, as yet there were no suitable debt instruments for open market operations and that these should be developed. Looking further ahead, the authorities need to formulate a medium-term plan for development of the financial system, not least to allow greater private sector access to bank lending. The staff has still to identify in detail priorities for reform. Elements would include encouragement and development of private domestic and foreign banks and measures to restructure the inefficient and unprofitable state-owned banks which continue to dominate the banking system. Central Bank operations also need to be modernized. Since the last provision of Fund technical assistance in the monetary area in 1991, the Central Bank has been slowly improving its capacity for bank supervision; however, much remains to be done in this area as well as in developing monetary policy instruments, including the capacity to conduct open market operations. 4. State enterorise reform JJ A lack of incentives, combined with highly distorted pricing of inputs and outputs, has resulted in continued poor performance of the state enterprise sector over the past few years. Although the 1989 market reforms aimed to give greater autonomy to state enterprises, the changes made did not lead to this result. The organization and management of state enterprises remain in a central planning mode with most pricing, investment, and financing decisions made by higher authorities, typically in line ministries. Since 1989, when the interest burden of previous debts was removed, state enterprises have not been allowed to borrow from the banking system. Instead, enterprises receive annual budget allocations cost free from the State Fund Account. Enterprises follow official pricing for the bulk of their output (calculated on a cost plus formula), but are allowed to sell surplus production beyond a quota at free market prices. Losses are automatically covered from the State Fund Account, while surpluses are surrendered to the Government. lJ State enterprises remain dominant in key sectors (mining, energy, rice trading) and play a significant role in manufacturing and transport. They account for about 22 percent of GDP.

Given the depth of the problems, the mission emphasized that reform needed to be pursued on a broad front with measures taken to place state enterprises on a commercial basis and to accelerate divestiture. The mission recommended that the authorities clarify their policy on which enterprises are to be retained in the public sector and which are to be divested or liquidated. For those which were to remain in the public sector, it would be necessary to reinstate enterprise control over their finances, charge interest on their borrowing, allow them greater autonomy in output and pricing decisions, and make managers more accountable for performance. Also, directives would need to be given to the banking system to ensure that loss-making firms would be subject to harder budget constraints. Substantial technical assistance will be required in this area, possibly from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 5. Other structural reforms The mission also discussed regulations and controls that inhibit private sector development. In agriculture, the mission recommended ending informal controls over cropping choice, allowing private sector involvement in the provision of inputs, and reducing state procurement of paddy at below market prices. The authorities also need to clarify urban land ownership and lease rights, and streamline the regulations that govern the establish- ment and operation of private firms. 6. Medium-term nrosnects In discussing the medium-term outlook, the mission, as in previous consultations, stressed the economic costs of present policies, emphasizing the adverse impact of the current exchange rate policy on tradable goods production and the likelihood that a growing imbalance in the budget and state enterprise finances would be reflected in increased inflationary pressures. On the other hand, the adoption of economic reforms would allow present rates of output and export to be sustained, or even increased, over the next few years; foreign direct investment would be expected to expand more rapidly and become more diversified; and the benefits of development would be more equitably distributed with the restructuring of budgetary revenues and expenditures and the abatement of inflation. The mission's projections indicate, however, that even with a strong production response to the implementation of reform policies, external viability would not be achievable without concessional assistance and debt restructuring.

Over the past few years, the economy has been able to grow as inefficiencies were corrected and capacity utilization was increased. To continue such growth beyond the next few years, however, will require substantial external concessional resources to rehabilitate and expand basic physical infrastructure and to increase social sector expendi- tures that have become highly compressed in recent years. IV. Staff Annraisal During the past few years, there has been a recovery in Myanmar's economic performance reflecting moves toward a more open and market-oriented economy. Output and exports have grown at a healthy pace and foreign direct investment has begun to expand. The market reforms, however, have been quite limited and several longstanding structural problems have still to be tackled. Stabilization policies have also been weak with the result that high inflation has continued. Although Myanmar has a rich resource base, recent growth rates are not expected to be sustained on the basis of present policies. To keep pace with the strong growth of neighboring countries, the authorities need to undertake comprehensive economic reforms to move away from the legacy of central planning, and to strengthen financial policies so as to achieve a lasting reduction in inflation. The authorities' indication that they are prepared to embark on a program of reform and adjustment is highly welcome. Even in the absence of immediate international support, embarking on an ambitious reform program could have significant economic benefits. Upon the request of the authorities, the staff would be prepared to monitor such a program and provide technical assistance in several key areas. The effective implemen- tation of the reform program would demonstrate to potential donors the authorities' determination to address the country's economic problems. This strategy calls for the authorities to take some critical policy steps at the outset. These would consist of: (I) an exchange system reform involving unification of exchange rates combined with liberalization and a simplification of the exchange and trade system; (ii) a pass-through of the exchange rate action to prices, partly cushioned by a public sector wage adjustment; and (iii) a strengthening of stabilization policies to ensure that inflation is brought under control. The long-delayed action on the official exchange rate is a prerequisite for the entire reform process. Without full realignment of exchange rates, meaningful reforms of the exchange and trade system and the public sector finances are not possible. Following the devaluation, the exchange rate should be managed flexibly to ensure that no parallel market premium would Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - re-emerge. Liberalization and simplification of the exchange and trade system would be aimed at ensuring the private sector's right to import and export operations and its access to foreign exchange for current account transactions. The success of the exchange rate unification will depend on a tighten- ing of fiscal and monetary policies. Thus, concomitant changes in the budget would aim at significantly reducing recourse to domestic bank financing. To achieve this, contributions and profit tax payments will need to be increased from state enterprises that benefit from the exchange rate adjustment. Revenue from customs tariffs would also be raised in order to cover an expected civil service wage adjustment and any subsidies arising from phased pass-through of the devaluation. In regard to monetary policy, interest rates would be raised to positive real levels and bank liquidity tightened in order to restrain credit expansion. It is envisaged that these upfront actions would be followed by structural measures which would include: (I) a reform of state enterprise operations to decentralize decision making, subject enterprises to firmer financial discipline, and accelerate privatization; (ii) measures to develop the financial sector and capital markets; (iii) a comprehensive tax reform to reverse the long-term decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio; (iv) a restructuring of government outlays to increase social sector and infrastructure expenditures; and (v) a phasing out of controls and regulations that constrain private sector development. Adoption of such policies will help sustain output and export growth over the next few years and encourage foreign investors into areas beyond purely extractive industries. However, for Myanmar to regularize its relations with external creditors, upgrade its dilapidated infrastructural facilities, and move toward external viability, substantial concessional external assistance and generous debt rescheduling would be required. The implementation of the initial economic reform program will require substantial technical assistance. In the context of a staff-monitored program, Fund technical assistance would be proposed in the areas of tax policy and administration, and financial sector reform. It is vital also that assistance be provided urgently to improve the quality and timeliness of economic statistics not least to enable the staff to adequately monitor developments under the authorities' program. In view of the absence of a timetable for their elimination, the staff does not recommend approval of the restrictions and multiple currency practices (described in Section III.2 above) that are subject to approval under Article VIII. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Myanmar be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Imnact on state enternrises A realignment of the official exchange rate would significantly increase the kyat-denominated income of foreign exchange earning state enterprises, particularly those responsible for the export of crude oil, agricultural, and forestry products. Taking 1994/95 as an example, removal of the implicit tax on exports arising from use of the official rate is estimated to increase state enterprise revenues by about K 53 billion (12 percent of GDP). On the other hand, net kyat outlays would rise for import-dependent enterprises (mainly in energy, transport, and manufactur- ing) by about K 33 billion. Thus, for the state enterprise sector as a whole, a devaluation to the free market rate would at the initial stage increase net receipts by about K 20 billion (5 percent of GDP). For those enterprises faced with additional costs, prices would need to be increased. The mission's estimates of the price effects of a full pass- through of the exchange rate action were made on an industry-level basis. Substantial price increases are needed in the industrial, power, mining, and transport sectors. In these sectors, prices would rise on average by 70 percent. For state enterprises as a whole, however, the average required price. increase would be 33 percent. Further staff work has been requested by the authorities to project price increases for individual commodities. The authorities indicated that they wished to explore the phasing of pass- through for certain goods --either because of their importance in low income budgets or because, at the new prices, state enterprises would be unable to market their products. In these cases, the current implicit subsidy would need to become an explicit subsidy within the central government budget. 2. Impact on the budget The counterpart to the net gain by the state enterprise sector would be an increased deficit in the central government budget. Foreign exchange income in the budget is relatively small (mainly grants). The major impact would be on expenditures (primarily by the Ministries of Agriculture, Construction, and Defense which account for the bulk of government imports). The increase in outlays is estimated at K 50 billion, including increased payments for debt service. I/ The increase in the central government budget deficit (i.e., 5 percent of GDP) would need to be covered by higher contributions and taxation of those state enterprises which would have windfall gains from the exchange rate change. While for oil and mining enterprises the entire gain may be taxed away, there is a need for some additional revenues to be left with 1/ This is based on debt service paid in 1994/95; on an accrual basis, the amount would be K 63 billion.

The overall impact on the budget will depend on the amount of the increase in kyat incomes that is transferred to the central government budget, and the amount of increased costs that are covered through the pass-through to prices. Initial estimates suggest that, provided the phasing of pass-through is strictly limited to a few commodities, net bank financing of the government can be substantially reduced. Beyond this, however, a public sector wage increase would require further tax increases, which as indicated in the report are expected to be mainly in the form of increased customs duties.

Article IV Consultation: The Executive Board discussed the staff report for the 1994 Article IV consultation on September 16, 1994. It was proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month cycle. IX. Technical Assistance: A substantial program of technical assistance financed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) was initiated in 1989/90 in the expectation of comprehensive policy reforms. The program foresaw extensive technical assistance supported by training in the areas of bank accounting and supervision; monetary, fiscal, and price statistics; tax and customs administration; public finance; and government financial management. As the anticipated policy reforms did not materialize, the UNDP decided to scale back assistance to Myanmar. As a result, the project on government financial management was cancelled in September 1992 and the funding for the remaining projects was reduced. Following the tripartite review of the technical assistance program conducted during the 1993 Article IV consultation discussions, the authorities were informed that it would be difficult to justify an extension of the program and that the ongoing projects would come to an end by the scheduled closing date of December 31, 1993. By that time, 53 person-months of technical assistance and 172 weeks of training had been delivered. Since then technical assistance has continued only in the form of training and on a reduced scale.

During 1956-61, the Bank made three loans totaling $33.1 million, all for transportation projects. No lending was requested during 1962-72. Lending resumed in 1973, and 30 IDA credits totaling the equivalent of $804 million were committed of which $746.3 million equivalent was disbursed and $70.7 million was cancelled. There has been no new lending approved since July 1987. IFC has made no investments in Myanmar. The World Bank Group accounts for about 16.1 percent of Myanmar's total external long-term debt outstanding and for about 3.7 percent of its long-term debt service. About 26 percent of total IDA/IBRD disbursements have been in support of agricultural projects, including irrigation, rubber, livestock, seed development, and grain storage (Table). About 24 percent has been for energy sector projects, 16 percent for forestry projects, 17 percent for transportation projects, and the remaining 16 percent for projects in the mining, manufacturing, construction, and telecommunications sectors. In addition to providing financial assistance, the World Bank has provided advice on the formulation and implementation of development policies. Recent policy recommendations have emphasized the need for: fundamental and sustained macroeconomic policy reform, including measures to adjust the exchange rate, price liberalization, especially in agriculture, export promotion and private sector development, and steps to improve the efficiency of state enterprises. Possible future operations would aim at supporting policy reforms and providing technical assistance, particularly in the social sectors, within an agreed medium-term framework of stabilization and adjustment policies.

Myanmar joined the Bank in 1973 and operations started the same year. The Bank has so far provided 32 loans totaling $530.9 million for 28 projects. Of these, two loans amounting to $6.6 million were from the Bank's ordinary capital resources, and 30 loans amounting to $524.3 million were from its Special Fund's resources. All of the loans to Myanmar have been closed except one for an edible oil project. The Bank has so far provided technical assistance (TA) totaling $10.7 million for 38 projects. Of these 38 technical assistance projects, 28 were project preparatory and 10 were advisory. 2. The processing of new Bank loan and TA projects in Myanmar has been held in abeyance since 1988. However, the Bank sends periodic consultation missions to Myanmar. Furthermore, Myanmar continues to participate in Bank regional technical assistance projects. Close coordination is being main- tained with the IMF, the World Bank, and the UNDP with particular emphasis being given to the assessment of the Government's economic reform program and recommended policy actions. Liaison is being maintained with Myanmar's major bilateral donors regarding the status of their assistance program. 3. The sectoral distribution of cumulative Bank lending to Myanmar as of June 30, 1995, is shown below: Sector Loans Loans Percent (Number) ($ million) Agriculture 6 Agro-Industry 15 316.1 59.5 Health 2 63.1 11.9 Transport & Communications 2 42.5 8.0 Industry & Development Banks 4 41.4 7.8 Water Supply 4 36.0 6.8 Energy 5 31.8 6.0 Total 32 530.9 100.0 4. The majority of Bank assistance has been provided for the development of the agricultural sector. Bank assistance in sectors other than agricul- ture has stemmed from an attempt to achieve sectoral balance in lending and to avoid overextending the absorptive capacity of the country's agricultural executing agencies. To some extent, diversification has also resulted from the Government's own desire to proceed with particular projects in various sectors which had already cleared the Government approval process, and for which, therefore, priority has been established. u Prepared by staff of the Asian Development Bank.

This annex describes these problems in the key economic sectors. The Fund is routinely provided with all published data as well as additional statistics during missions, but reporting between missions has been irregular (Table l), making it difficult to monitor recent developments. 1. Real sector a. National accounts National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and revisions are typically not issued before a new fiscal year starts. The data are generally believed to under-represent the increasingly important private sector. In addition, they grossly undervalue exports and imports because the highly overvalued official exchange rate continues to be used for conversion purposes; a similar bias is also believed to affect certain expenditure categories, in particular public sector transactions with foreign exchange content. Furthermore, the deflator system of 1985/86 is becoming increasingly outdated since relative prices have changed dramatically in the past few years after price liberalization began. b. Price indices The present CPI, available without much delay on a monthly basis, is based primarily on the results of an expenditure survey conducted in Yangon in 1986. It is believed to underestimate price developments in the private sector and fails to properly represent the countryside, which has a substantially different expenditure pattern. In addition, the weights for consumption goods in the CPI basket are outdated. A household expenditure survey was conducted in 1989 to expand the geographical coverage and to provide a new weighting scheme to better reflect free market prices. However, the proposed new consumer price index based on these survey results would still cover only five urban centers. u In addition, the new index would also be largely confined to essential commodities and not adequately reflect the growing share of imported consumer goods. IJ The regular publications of the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) include a Statistical Yearbook that contains a large number of economic, socio-economic and demographic time series and the bi-monthly Selected Monthly Economic Indicators with monthly data on consumer prices, selected producer prices and output volumes, key monetary and revenue variables, exchange rates, and imports and exports. 2J These are Mandalay, Monywa, Taunggye, Pathein, and Mawlamyine.

Government finance While a fiscal flash reporting system was put in place in 1992 with the help of Fund technical assistance, fiscal data are available only on an annual basis. Since the approved budget typically allows for little if any inflation, revised estimates tend to differ from the budget estimates in years with high inflation by unacceptably wide margins. Also, available consolidated public sector data do not permit identification of the performance of the important state enterprises sector with a sufficient degree of accuracy because their operations are recorded partly on an accrual basis and partly on a cash basis. As a result of this and owing to delays in reporting, there are at times inconsistencies between budget and monetary survey data on the bank financing of the overall deficit. 3. Monetarv accounts Long reporting delays 1/ remain a serious problem, owing in part to the lack of a formal reporting system and limited computerization of the countryside branch offices of the major state banks, but essentially as a result of the Ministry of Finance and Revenue's insistence that government bank accounts be kept open after closing dates for inter-account adjustments. A joint Fund-Bank of Thailand mission in December 1992 made suggestions to streamline reporting procedures and to computerize data processing at the Central Bank, but measurable progress is not expected before an agreement is reached to close government accounts in a timely fashion. 4. Balance of navments statistics Although the coverage of merchandise trade statistics has improved since border trade was normalized in 1989, several important problems remain, including the exclusion of military and "special order" imports, and the under-reporting of rice, teak, and other exports in the data collected by the Customs Department. u Adjustments are made by the Planning Department and the Central Statistical Organization for rice and teak exports and for "special order" imports, but no adjustment is made for military imports. As already indicated, a further distortion arises with balance of payments data expressed in domestic currency as the official exchange rate is used in the conversion, while private sector transactions actually take place at the free market rate. Overall, data compilation continues to be slow and significant revisions are frequently made to provisional data up to two years after they are released. lJ Delays of four months in the submission of provisional data and of up to nine months in the submission of final data on banks' balance sheets are common. 2J The growing recorded border trade deficit also indicates incomplete coverage of exports.
