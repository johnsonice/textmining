The 2000 Article IV consultation discussions with the Dominican Republic were held in Santo Domingo during November 7-21.’ On August 16, Hip&to Mejia, leader of the center-left Partido Revolucionario Dominicano was inaugurated as president. The mission met with Vice-President Grtfz Bosch, other representatives of the government (including the central bank governor, the technical secretary of the presidency, the secretaries of finance, industry and commerce, and labor, and other senior officials), and representatives of the private sector and of international organizations. 2. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 6, 1999. At that time, Directors commended the authorities for having maintained strong growth and relatively low inflation, despite the damage to the economy inflicted by Hurricane Georges the previous September. Directors stressed the need to maintain monetary and fiscal discipline, particu- larly in the run-up to the presidential election in May 2000; to strengthen the foreign ex- change position; to increasingly rely on indirect monetary instruments; to foster the develop- ment of financial markets; and to accelerate the pace of structural reforms. In this regard, Directors welcomed the private capitahzation of the state-owned electricity corporation (CDE). Despite progress in reducing nontariff barriers, Directors observed that the effective rate of protection remained high in comparison with other countries in the Latin American/Caribbean region. The Dominican Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. Two multiple currency practices exist, subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. The Dominican Republic has not yet ratified the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement. 3. A summary of Fund relations with the Dominican Republic is provided in Appendix I. Relations with the World Bank and IDB are described in Appendices II and III, respectively. Certain statistical weaknesses have been hampering economic analysis and are described in detail in Appendix IV. II. BACKGROIJNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS 4. For most of the last decade the Dominican Republic experienced an extended period of robust economic growth, declining unemployment rates, modest consumer price inflation, and a generally manageable external position. Indeed, in recent years, the Dominican Republic ranked among the world’s fastest growing economies, with particularly strong performances in the construction, telecommunications, tourism, and free-trade sectors. In 2000, although economic growth continued at a brisk pace, higher oil imports costs and a ’ The staff team comprised Messrs. Young (Head), Giustiniani, Keller, Melhado, Ms. Sab (all WI-ID), Mrs. Sosa (MAE), and Mrs. Worthington (WHD-Assistant). Mr. Hemandez (MAE expert) provided advice to the mission on the financial sector. Messrs. Auffret (IBRD) and de 10s Santos (Advisor to the Executive Director) also participated in the discussions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- weakening of macroeconomic policies (associated with the electoral cycle) led to a widening of the external current account deficit and pressure on foreign exchange reserves. 5. In 1999, real GDP expanded by over 8 percent (Table 1 and Figure l), driven by domestic demand, while inflation remained subdued, helped by a fall in food prices as agricultural output recovered following Hurricane Georges. Greater-than-expected foreign direct investment (FDI) and an informal deferral of debt-service payments by the Paris Club, following Hurricane Georges, contributed to an accumulation of almost US$200 million of official net international reserves (NIR). At end-1999, gross reserves reached the equivalent of one month of projected 2000 imports, 14 percent of M2, and 71 percent of short-term external debt*-a modest improvement relative to end-1998. 6. Fiscal policy slippages emerged in the second half of 1999, putting upward pressure on demand and prices. Election-related expenditure overruns were compounded by delays in adjusting domestic fuel prices, resulting in dramatically reduced government proceeds from the oil differentiaL3 As a result, despite an increase in the foreign exchange commission,4 the central government deficit widened by one percentage point of GDP (Table 2). The overall consolidated public sector deficit widened marginally to 2.8 percent of GDP, compared with the authorities’ target of near balance. The quasi-fiscal deficit of the central bank remained broadly unchanged at % percent of GDP (Table 3). The fiscal slippage, large capital inflows, and rapid growth of credit to the private sector put upward pressure on domestic demand and inflation, while monetary policy continued to rely on direct measures, such as temporary ceilings on bank credit. 7. For 2000, the authorities’ original goals were to sustain economic growth at about 7 percent, contain end-year inflation to 4% percent, and accumulate net official reserves of US$lSO-190 million. Holding the consolidated public sector budget to near balance and not providing any net bank financing to the public sector were crucial to achieving these goals. However, higher-than-expected international oil prices and the lack of fiscal adjustment led the central bank in February 2000 to relax its inflation and NIR targets (the end-year inflation target was raised to 6 percent and the programmed NLR accumulation was lowered to US$50 million). ’ Residual maturity basis. 3 The difference between the administered retail price and the variable wholesale cost of domestic fuel products. 4 To compensate for the loss of revenues, in October 1999, the foreign exchange commission was raised from 1.75 percent to 5 percent. The first 1.75 percentage points go to the central bank, the remainder is transferred to the central government, and earmarked to cover external debt service.

With economic activity remaining buoyant in 2000, capacity constraints eventually became binding and inflationary pressures heightened. The annual rate of growth of real GDP accelerated to 11 Y2 percent in the first quarter of the year. Rising interest rates and less credit availability contributed to a deceleration of growth to 7 percent in the third quarter. Growth was concentrated in the wholesale, retail, tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Domestic demand expanded at an even brisker pace, sustained primarily by private consumption, in contrast to 1999, when investment was the driving force. For the year as a whole, real GDP is estimated to have expanded by 8lV’z percent. The rapid growth of domestic demand helped push the 12-month inflation rate to 9 percent by December-almost double the previous year’s rate.5 The unemployment rate declined, as output growth exceeded an increase in labor force participation rates. 9. The consolidated public sector deficit narrowed slightly to two percent of GDP in 2000. Based on preliminary estimates, central government revenue growth (13 percent) outpaced expenditure growth (10 percent), reflecting some tightening toward the end of the year.6 Net external financing (estimated to be 0.1 percent of GDP in 2000) was constrained by scarce counterpart funds as well as by congressional unwillingness to approve foreign loans. The overall deficit of the public enterprises (net of central government transfers) is estimated to have narrowed by one percentage point of GDP, primarily reflecting a lower net operating deficit. Quasi-fiscal losses are estimated to have remained at half a percent of GDP. 10. Brisk private sector demand, together with the persistent fiscal deficit in 2000, put pressure on official foreign exchange reserves. The stock of NIR fell to less than US$200 million in August (compared with US$547 million at end-1999). In response, beginning in September, the central bank increased exchange rate flexibility, adjusting the official exchange rate more frequently (weekly), and by year-end, NIB stood at US$442 million.7 Strong private sector credit demand (Table 4) combined with central bank credit controls, put upward pressure on interest rates-lending rates reached about 30 percent toward year-end, compared with 25 percent at the beginning of the year (Figure 2). 11. Reflecting strong domestic demand and the higher oil bill, the external current account deficit is estimated to have more than doubled, reaching 6.2 percent of GDP in 2000 (Table 5). Exports of goods and services continued to show robust growth, but the oil 5 Another important factor pushing the price level up was an average increase of about 30 percent in domestic fuel prices in August 2000. 6 The staff was able to gather only partial and preliminary information on domestic arrears. This is an area where the lack of information is preventing a thorough analysis of fiscal developments. 7 The outturn for 2000 would have been about US$87 million lower had not some external debt-service payments scheduled for December 2000 been delayed until January 2001 (still within the grace period).

Gross receipts from the three major sources of foreign exchange, free-trade-zone exports, tourism, and remittances from abroad, continued their strong expansion, growing by 1 O-l 6 percent, and representing a combined total equivalent to about half of GDP. Nonetheless, the non-oil current account surplus is estimated to have declined by about one percentage point of GDP in 2000, mainly reflecting the rapid expansion of domestic demand (Table 6). 12. Pressures in the foreign exchange market intensified in 2000. The exchange rate spread widened to two percent, before a devaluation of that amount on September 5. Since then, the central bank has been setting the official exchange rate equal to the previous week’s average of the commercial bank rate and the rate of depreciation has been approximately half of the inflation differential with partner countries (7 percent). At end-2000, gross reserves (US$637 million) remained at one month of projected 2001 imports (goods and services, net of free-trade-zone imports), and fell to 11 percent of M2, and 59 percent of short-term external debt. Figure 3 compares selected indicators of vulnerability with other countries in the region. 13. According to the authorities, banks are in compliance with capital adequacy norms. In June 2000, the risk-based capital adequacy ratio for the banking sector stood at 11.4 percent, compared with a minimum requirement of 10 percent.’ Provisions for loan losses were 2.9 percent of gross loans and investments.10 This ratio is lowe than the full normative provisions of 4.1 percent, because of an eight-year transitory period (ending in June 2001) allowing banks additional time to build up provisions to the stricter requirements that were put in place in 1992.” The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans in the banking system has been declining (from 3.9 percent at end-1994 to 2.0 percent at end-2000), but this ratio can be misleading as the definition of nonperforming loans includes only the unpaid portion and not the entire loan balance.‘* 8 The of&id exchange rate was held at RD$l6.05=US$l for virtually all of the first eight months of 2000. 9 This is the latest information available. This requirement is stricter than the risk-based capital rules of the Base1 Committee, in that (i) the Base1 requirement is 8 percent; and (ii) under Dominican regulations, the only form of capital that is allowed is equivalent to that in Tier 1 under Base1 rules. It may be less strict in that Dominican regulations contain more risk-weight categories (six) than recommended by Base1 (four), potentially allowing Dominican banks to take a lower capital charge than recommended under Base1 rules. lo Required provisions are calculated on the basis of the entire loan balance. l1 The state-owned Reserve Bank was granted a longer transition period (12 years) than other institutions. l2 Information on the full outstanding balance of nonperforming loans is not available at this time.

In the face of increasing operations in foreign currency, the authorities have strengthened regulations on this type of operation with the aim of preventing excessive foreign borrowing by banks and monitoring exchange rate risk. Thus, in October 1999, the supervisory authorities set a limit for external short-term borrowing of 30 percent of capital plus reserves and established a reserve requirement of 10 percent on foreign currency deposits. In March 2000, the supervisory authorities imposed a requirement that all financial bank guarantees for foreign currency operations be preapproved by the central bank. In addition, a “Guarantee Register” is kept at the Superintendency of Banks (SB), with the aim of assessing the credit risk of guarantees and eventually requiring banks to provision for such risks. According to the central bank, their analysis of banks’ foreign exchange operations indicated that banks did not face an imminent risk on account of foreign exchange operations (Table 7). Nevertheless, the authorities have started work on the design of additional regulations to control the risk of these operations. III. POLICY DIFKUSSIONS AND THE 2001 ECONOMIC PROGRAM 15. The Dominican economy is at a critical juncture. The political cycle led to fiscal slippages in 1999-2000, jeopardizing the sustainability of strong growth and low inflation. However, the removal of administrative discretion from the determination of domestic fuel prices, the authorities’ plan to tighten substantially fiscal policy, ana’ the central bank’s efsoorts to rebuild reserves have reduced the risks. In the short term, there remains a n’sk of slower-than-projected growth in the U.S. ana’ of higher-than-projected oil pn’ces. InsufJicient fiscal adjustment would hinder the ability of the monetary authorities to meet their objectives, including containing private sector credit growth with increasing reliance on indirect instruments. 16. The authorities’ 2001 economic program places top priority on stabilizing the macroeconomic situation by sharply reducing the foal deficit-the consolidated public sector deficit is programmed to turn from a deficit of 2 percent of GDP to a surplus of r/2 percent of GDP. Virtually two-thirds of the improvement stems from a decrease in central government expenditures. The expected robust economic growth (projected to be 6% percent) will help in this endeavor. The monetary authorities are targeting a reduction of end-period inflation to 7 percent, and a rebuilding of reserves to at least US$600 million (an increase of US$158 million). The external current account deficit is projected to halve to 3 percent of GDP, reflecting a sharp decline in the cost of oil imports (1 ‘/z percentage points of GDP), strong growth of exports of goods and services (especially from the free-trade zones) and a broad-based containment of import growth, in line with the foreseen slowdown in domestic demand growth and an expected modest real depreciation of the peso. 17. In the discussions, the staff welcomed the proposed fiscal adjustment, while stressing that successfully making such a large adjustment would require tight monitoring and control of expenditures. The authorities felt that such a fiscal adjustment was feasible, noting that this was a typical pattern in post-election years. They added that Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- administrative measures were being put in place to ensure that ministries did not commit to expenditures without first having identified the corresponding financing. This would prevent any further accumulation of domestic arrears. A. Fiscal Policy 18. The authorities saw a tightening of fiscal policy as key to restraining the growth of domestic demand, and they noted several revenue and expenditure measures that have already been, or soon would be, taken (Box 1). A new hydrocarbons law (in effect since December 2000), removes administrative discretion from the determination of domestic fuel prices and assures the government of a steady source of revenue (about 2 percent of GDP). The new law eliminates all fuel subsidies, except for propane gas purchased mainly by poor households. Staff observed that the current subsidy scheme, based upon the distribution of coupons (via gas stations) to subsidize propane purchased in small containers, has turned out to be ineffkient and subject to abuse, and suggested making it better targeted to low- income households. The authorities agreed with the staffs suggestion, but noted that it would take some time to establish the modalities for improved targeting. 19. The 2001 budget includes a number of other important revenue measures and expenditure cuts. The value-added tax (ITBIS) was raised from 8 percent to 12 percent (more in line with the rate prevailing in other Latin American countries) and its base was widened to include more services. However, a large number of exemptions still remain. Regarding expenditure, the wage bill, in particular, is budgeted to decline by 1% percentage points of GDP. The authorities noted that the decline in the wage bill largely reflects the elimination of some temporary employment programs that were instituted toward the end of the last administration as well as a reduction in the number of contractual employees hired to assist with a variety of specific programs. 20. The staff expressed concern that the government would continue to rely on revenues from the foreign exchange commission.‘3 The authorities agreed that this was a distortionary measure and that it constituted a multiple currency practice.r4 They expressed their intention to return the foreign exchange commission to its original level (from 5 percent to 1.75 percent) by early 2002. They explained that there was a need for the revenues this year to help pay external debt service and other priority expenditures. The staff advised against earmarking revenues in this manner, and suggested that tighter controls of subsidies l3 In the approved budget, this source of revenue is not included, since the Monetary Board determines the rate and it is collected by the central bank. Expenditures paid for out of these resources are also not registered in the budget. The staff advised that a more transparent procedure would be to register all revenues and expenditures in the budget. l4 Another existing multiple currency practice stems from the potential for the official exchange rate to differ from the commercial bank rate by more than two percent at any given point in time.

Fiscal Measures In order to address the ongoing deterioration in public finances, to compensate for foreseen revenue losses associated with the planned reduction in external tarifi, and, more generally, to achieve an adequate level of revenue, the new administration announced a package offiscal reforms, including a new domestic fuel (hydrocarbons) tax law, several important tax code reforms, and a tax amnesty. Hydrocarbons law-the new law establishes an array of specific excise taxes (indexed to the CPI). Previously, fuel tax receipts were based on the difference between the administered retail price (adjusted only periodically) and the wholesale cost. Now, domestic fuel prices are adjusted every week in line with wholesale costs. Administrative discretion has been removed from the determination of retail prices and the volatility of government fuel tax receipts has been sharply reduced. Tax code reforms-Several reforms to the tax code were made, including (i) an increase in the ITBIS (a value-added tax on goods and services) from 8 percent to 12 percent and the enlargement of its base to include a number of services, which previously had been subject to specific taxes; (ii) a tax rebate was introduced for capital goods purchased by enterprises; (iii) excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes were increased by 5-30 percentage points; (iv) a minimum tax of 1.5 percent on gross sales was introduced, with an exemption for companies with gross sales of less than RD!§2 million a year (US!§121,000); and (v) the minimum annual taxable income was raised to RD$120,000 (US!§7,300), while income tax brackets were also adjusted. In addition, a ban on public disclosure of tax payments was removed to foster transparency and equal treatment of taxpayers. Several measures were taken to streamline and reform the tax regime, including: (i) simplification of the inheritance tax system-reduction to only four rates, according to the degree of consaguinity; increase in the minimum exemption to RD$SOO,OOO (US$30,200); (ii) unification of the tax rate on grants to 25 percent; (iii) reduction and unification of the real estate tax rate at 3 percent; (iv) application of a single tax rate (4.5 percent) on horse racing bets; (v) elimination of 11 taxes with marginal proceeds; and (vi) conversion of the tax on luxury homes and undeveloped urban property into a real estate tax with a single rate of one percent on all properties worth more than RD$2 million. Tax amnesty-Individuals have until end-May 2001 to correct their declared net income in 1999. A concessionary rate of 0.5 percent will be applied to the difference between the original and the corrected declaration. If an undeclared violation is identified, a penalty rate of 25 percent will be applied and patient must be made within 20 days. For declared tax payments in arrears, the amnesty provides a relief on the penalty interest rate.

The authorities intend to cease accumulating domestic arrears and to begin making headway in reducing the outstanding stock of domestic debt. In this regard, the government recently established a domestic debt commission and important fiscal accounting reforms are contemplated under the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP) being financed by the IDB. The staff urged the authorities to use any higher-than-budgeted revenues to reverse the increase in the foreign exchange commission and to reduce the outstanding stock of domestic debt. The authorities agreed with these objectives, but also noted the pressing need to devote more resources to social needs. While recognizing the need to devote more resources to the social sector, the staff suggested that a reallocation of expenditures would be a more efftcient means of ensuring that social needs were met. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 22. The main objective of the authorities’ monetary program for 2001 is to reduce end-year inflation to 7 percent. The implementation of monetary policy will be pursued within the context of the existing managed float of the exchange rate regime. In the past, the central bank resorted periodically to direct controls, but the new monetary authorities informed the staff that they intend to increase reliance on indirect instruments to achieve their objectives, including, among others, containing the growth of private sector credit. Box 2 provides a brief overview of the conduct of monetary policy. 23. Banking system liquidity will be managed through open market operations. The authorities are considering the staff’s recommendation to place central bank paper (participation certificates) with commercial banks through competitive auctions rather than unilaterally fixing the interest rate. Over the medium term, the authorities intend to reduce the stock of participation certificates (consistent with the aim of lowering quasi-fiscal losses). They agreed that such a reduction would have to depend on meeting the inflation and NIP targets, which in turn will depend on the strength of fiscal policy. 24. In light of the low level of foreign exchange reserves, the authorities intend to increase NIR to at least US$600 million by end-2001 (from US$442 million at end-2000).15 The monetary authorities cautioned that their ability to rebuild reserves was dependent on the external environment, especially oil prices. Nonetheless, they viewed the reserve target as a minimum, noting that this would depend crucially on the stance of fiscal policy and meeting the inflation target. The staff supported the authorities’ intention to rebuild reserves, especially in light of the ever-present risk of exogenous shocks, and welcomed the recent move toward increased exchange rate flexibility. ” Adjusted for the additional debt service (US$87 million) that was shifted into 2001 (see above), this is equivalent to an increase of US$245 million.

The Conduct of Monetary Policy Monetary policy in the Dominican Republic has been conducted within an institutional framework characterized by limited central bank autonomy and a heavily managed exchange rate regime. In the past, the Banco Central de la Republica Dominicana (BCRD) has ofren relied upon the use of ad hoc direct instruments, such as freezing banks’ excess reserves and imposing credit ceilings. However, recently the BCRD has informed the stafSthat it will refrain from further use of direct instruments and will increase its reliance on indirect instruments. Policy formulation: Although the overriding objective of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, in practice the BCRD faces a consistency problem trying to reconcile multiple objectives (i.e., output growth, inflation, interest rates, offtcial reserve accumulation). The BCRD elaborates an annual monetary program based on an inflation target. After estimating real money demand, a path for the monetary base is formulated and, given a target for the change in net international reserves, limits are set on the growth of NDA. The annual program is then translated to a quarterly basis, taking into account seasonal@ factors. The BCRD sets the NIR target, taking into account expected inflation pressures that would arise from the nominal exchange rate path consistent with that NIR target. The BCRD monitors a variety of indicators. including the behavior of the main monetary aggregates, the exchange rate. and the inflation rate; it will make mid-course adjustments if it appears that the inflation target could be exceeded. Instruments: The BCRD controls its NDA through indirect and direct instruments. Often, the imposition of credit ceilings has been associated with the issue of central bank paper (participation certificates) in order to sterilize the excess liquidity in banks resulting from the ceilings. These certificates represent the main instrument available to the BCRD to conduct open market operations. Currently, the interest rate on participation certificates is set unilaterally by the central bank. The BCRD places its paper with commercial banks through bilateral negotiations. Operational issues: The recent electoral cycle and the lack of fiscal discipline has placed an undue burden on monetary policy, particularly since the fiscal deficit has been partly monetized. To some extent, this arises because the BCRD is responsible for making payments on the central government’s external debt-service obligations. Although the government earmarks domestic fuel taxes for this purpose, shortfalls in fuel taxes led to an expansion of net credit to the central government in 2000. In order to sterilize the resulting expansion of NDA, the BCRD issued participation certificates, leading to upward pressure on interest rates and quasi-fiscal losses.

They stressed that a tight fiscal policy was critical to achieving this objective. Box 3 describes the sources and magnitude of quasi-fiscal losses, and the measures the authorities intend to implement to reduce quasi-fiscal losses, such as eliminating the use of subsidized credit and ceasing to manage development funds and vocational institutions. 26. The authorities plan to unify the foreign exchange markets by securing congressional approval of the Monetary and Financial Code (MFC). A previous draft of the MFC was approved by congress in October 1999, but the executive branch had some objections, and it was returned to congress for reconsideration.‘6 In addition to unifying foreign exchange markets, the MFC would modernize the supervisory and regulatory framework for the financial system. The authorities expect approval of the MFC in the first half of 2001. C. Banking Sector 27. A variety of indicators of the health of the banking sector point to generally positive developments. l7 However, vulnerabilities remain as a result of regulatory forbearance (allowing an 8-12 year transition period for fully meeting provisioning requirements-the transition period for most banks ends in June 2001 and for one bank in June 2005). The definition of nonperforming loans records only the unpaid portion of the loan, not the entire balance, and therefore understates the true risk. The authorities have been addressing these vulnerabilities (see below). 28. Large bank spreads, at almost 11 percentage points, are one reason behind high interest rates. High bank operating costs have contributed to the large spreads-t8 Banks argue that such costs could be lowered if the scale of their business were larger. However, the existence of high profit margins (estimated at 30 percent for 2000), would suggest that further competition might help to reduce spreads. The staff suggested that competition would be fostered by introducing changes in the legal system to ensure the prompt exercise of creditor rights and increased transparency. The latter could be achieved by adopting clear prudential norms and by timely publishing of internationally comparable indicators of the situation of the financial institutions. I6 A key objection was that the MFC did not grant sufficient autonomy to the central bank. I7 Jn what follows, the staff’s analysis is based on the preliminary information provided to the Article IV mission. The FSAP missions are conducting a more complete analysis. The first FSAR mission visited Santo Domingo in early February 2001. A second mission is scheduled for March/April 2001. l8 Reserve requirements account for approximately three percentage points of the spread.

Quasi-Fiscal Losses of the Central Bank l Quasi-fiscal losses of the Banco Central de la Repirblica Dominicana (BCRD) averaged about half percent of GDP during 1994-2000. Over the years, the BCRD has taken on several functions, which fall outside the purview of a traditional central bank, including developing and funding tourism projects, promoting technology and research, and fostering rural development. These functions detract from the core mission of monetary policy and increase quasi-fiscal losses. l The main sources of revenue are: (i) interest earned on international reserves; (ii) proceeds from the foreign exchange commission; and (iii) interest earned from domestic assets, including loans provided by the central-bank-managed tourism fund (FIDE-INFRATUR). The main expenditure items are: (i) wages and salaries; (ii) interest paid on central bank certificates of participation; (iii) interest paid on the BCRD’s external debt; (iv) interest paid on the debt of the tourism fund; and (v) remuneration of commercial bank reserves. l The monetary authorities intend to implement measures to reduce, and eventually eliminate, quasi-fiscal losses. Such measures include: (i) eliminating the use of subsidized credit; (ii) eliminating exchange rate subsidies; (iii) ceasing to manage development funds and vocational institutions; (iv) reducing the number of contractual employees; and (v) selling or leasing nonfinancial assets such as Rosario Dominicana (a gold mine), Playa Grande (a tourist resort) and other real state owned by the BCRD.

Progress has been made in improving the supervision and regulation of the financial system.” The authorities’ program of financial reform, initiated in 199 1, has included liberalization of interest rates, rationalization of reserve requirements, adoption of regulations allowing the establishment of universal banks, restructuring the SB, and consolidation of the banking system.20 Notwithstanding the above progress, the staff cautioned that several years of rapid credit growth and high interest rates may have resulted in a deterioration of banks’ loan portfolios, underscoring the need to further strengthen prudential norms and their enforcement. The authorities stressed that during 1999-2000, they continued to improve the regulatory framework and financial supervision, with technical assistance from foreign experts. Based on the recommendations of these experts, and in consultation with banks, the authorities have been preparing new prudential norms that would result in stricter provisioning and supervision of credit risk, as well as requiring banks to measure and manage market risk (Box 4).2’ Most regulatory modifications are to be implemented in early 2001. Appendix V provides more detail on issues in the financial sector related to provisioning requirements, transparency, and banking supervision. D. External Issues 30. Following a marked depreciation in early to mid-1998, the real effective exchange rate (REER) index has been on an appreciating trend since then (Figure 4). Over the medium term, a modest real appreciation of the REER should not harm external competitiveness, as long as the pace of structural reform accelerates and productivity continues to improve. 31. Progress is being made in liberalizing the external trade regime. The Dominican Republic has a dual production structure-on the one hand, there are areas such as tourism, telecommunications, and the industrial free-trade zones (Box 5), which operate in a competitive environment and are closely linked to the world economy. On the other hand, there are the more traditional sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and some subsectors of industry (outside the free-trade zones), which continue to operate in the midst of strong state intervention, including relatively high effective protection. Congress recently approved legislation that reduces the number of tariff bands from nine to five and lowers I9 The financial system consists mainly of 16 universal banks (75 percent of total assets) and 18 savings and loan associations (16 percent of assets). The remaining assets are held by 18 development banks, 83 “financieras,” and a number of pension fund administrators. 2o Through mergers and liquidations, the number of financial institutions has declined from over 500 in 1990 to less than 170 at present, and further consolidation is underway. 21 Modifications to banking norms establishing stricter classification and provisioning rules for credit risk and new norms requiring banks to provision for market risks (liquidity, interest rate, and exchange rate risks) were approved by the Monetary Board in January 2001.

Financial Regulation and Supervision l In 1993, two major sets of norms were approved regarding the valuation of assets and prudential requirements. The norms are generally in line with Base1 recommendations, but some important differences remain (see below). l In the same year, the Superintendency of Banks (SB) was restructured. Staffing was reduced; the remaining staff was given intensive training, and salaries were raised. In 1997, monetary sanctions were instituted for banks that did not report timely information. l In January 2001, the Monetary Board approved new norms for the classification of loans according to credit risk and for their provisioning. Also, norms for the measurement and provisioning of market risk were approved. ongoing reform l Continuing restructuring of SB and intensification of training programs. l Improving financial sector transparency. Future reforms A summary of the key actions being considered by the authorities follows: Incorporate generic provisioning requirements on both, the “A” rated and unrated loans and investments. Additionally, ensure that those financial institutions that can make full provisions faster than required do so. Improve disclosure of past-due and nonperforming loans by publishing the total balance outstanding and not just the past-due installment and using the former value to calculate the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans. Cease publishing the credit risk index. Properly regulate and supervise financial groups, including banks’ offshore operations, regardless of whether these are part of a financial group. Coordinate, in advance, on-site inspections with the supervised financial institutions, unless circumstances warrant otherwise. Adopt the CAMELS rating system and assign responsibility to the on-site inspection staff to determine the ranking. Formalize a training and continuing education program for inspectors and regulators. Unify supervision and regulation of Savings and Loans under the SB. Supervision is now shared with the National Housing Bank. This recommendation is included in the draft MFC. Unify reserve requirements across currencies. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public135 130 125 120 115 110 Figure 4.

External Competitiveness of Free-Trade Zones and Tourism Sector Dual structure of export activities l The trade and tax regime has favored the emergence of high-growth, outward-oriented sectors, comprising mainly industrial production in free-trade zones (FIZ) and the tourism sector. These activities have benefited from explicit and implicit incentives, including many tax and tariff exemptions. l In contrast, traditional agricultural (e.g., sugar, coffee, cocoa, tobacco) and mining exports have suffered a decline in recent years, following years of export taxation and protectionist policies. External and internal competitiveness can be enhanced by pushing forward with trade liberalization (for all sectors) and structuraI reform. Competitiveness l During 1995-99, tourism receipts and value added from FIZ exports (in U.S. dollar terms) have grown by an average of 12-l 3 percent a year. The expansion of tourism receipts, estimated at 17 percent in 2000, might have been even higher had it not been for the depreciation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar (most tourists come from Europe) and higher airfares. High real interest rates have not slowed investment in the export sector, since a large share of such investment is either financed through FDI (50-70 percent for tourism and FTZ investment) or self-financed, partly through reinvestment of profits. l For 200 1, value added from FIZ exports is projected to increase by over 13 percent, mainly reflecting an expected boost in textile exports from receiving NAFTA parity. Over the medium term, efforts to diversify the export base are being encouraged; the most dynamic FIZ exports are expected to be electronics, pharmaceuticals, jewelry, and a variety of services (reflecting a growing trend toward vertical integration of production in FTZ). Outlook l A key challenge remains the high cost of electricity. l As production techniques become increasingly sophisticated, skill shortages could become a constraint. The government and the enterprises themselves are seeking to ensure (through intensified training programs) that an appropriately skilled workforce is available. l In tourism, efforts are being directed toward geographically diversifying the client base and attracting higher spending tourists. The recent tax reform may raise tourism taxes, but lower import tariffs should help to reduce costs.

The trade reform leaves the WTO approved two-tier tariff regime for eight basic food items untouched.23 Approval of the MFC will abolish a dual foreign exchange market, with continued surrender requirements for traditional exporters and privileged foreign exchange access for petroleum imports and public sector external debt service, which is distorting resource allocation and impeding trade. 32. Recently, the stock of external debt (in U.S. dollar terms) has stabilized at a relatively low level (US$3% billion or less than 18 percent of GDP). However, the average maturity is relatively short, giving rise to a large external debt-service burden in the coming years (some US$700 million in 2001-02) (Table 8). The authorities recognized that a coherent debt strategy is needed to make effective use of external financing. They intend to make a concerted effort to improve their rating in international financial markets and to borrow more from international financial institutions. 33. The authorities recognized that there are serious deficiencies in the control and monitoring of public external borrowing and the short-term external exposure of the economy. These deficiencies are partly responsible for the lumpiness of the debt-service profile and excessive use of relatively expensive bilateral tied credits. Modem debt management practices are needed to rationalize external borrowing and to smooth the debt- service profile. Data on short-term debt and private sector external exposure are still incomplete. The authorities agreed that legal obligations to report such exposure needed to be enforced more strictly and monitored more regularly. E. Structural Reforms 34. In order to create the conditions for sustainable growth, it is essential to deepen the reform process. Key pending reforms (Box 6) include (i) approval of a modem regulatory framework for the electricity sector; (ii) approval of an umbrella law that would form the basis for an integrated financial management system for the public sector; and (iii) modernization of the executive power, which includes a streamlining of public sector institutions, and more generally, improving governance (discussed below). In addition, the results of the FSAP could provide a blueprint for further reforms in the financial sector. 35. The energy sector still suffers from the lack of a well-established legal and regulatory framework, an insufficient degree of competition in the wholesale market (including, long-term, inflexible, and costly contracts between the CDE and the independent 22 Further reductions are planned for 2002 when the number of tariff bands should be reduced to four, and the maximum rate to 15 percent. 23 Imports beyond a specified amount are subject to a penalty rate.

The government has decided to absorb the higher electricity costs through the budget. Reflecting lower oil prices, the authorities expect to reduce the subsidy to the CDE from one percent of GDP in 2000 to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2001. There was broad agreement that subsidies to the power sector need to be reduced by improving efficiency as opposed to raising tariffs, which are already among the highest in the region. The World Bank is discussing a power sector loan with the government that could involve some form of private participation in transmission and a downsizing of the CDE in line with its diminished responsibilities. 36. The authorities agreed that further progress needs to be made in divesting public sector assets. The central bank intends to sell ‘or lease a number of its nonfinancial assets as quickly as possible. The government is considering further divestment of the state- owned sugar company’s extensive land holdings. Finally, the mission urged the authorities to consider privatizing the Reserves Bank. Privatization would help avoid excessive use of bank credit by the public sector, which hampers the efficient conduct of monetary policy. While not necessarily supporting full privatization, the authorities agreed that the role of the Reserves Bank needed to be modified to ensure compliance with sound banking practices and to correct past abuses. 37. The authorities agreed that comprehensive national strategies for the provision of health services and for the reduction of poverty needed to be developed. They continue to seek technical assistance from the World Bank and the IDB in these areasZ5 The authorities agreed with the staff that a World Bank public expenditure review (PER) would be a valuable exercise, but noted that it was necessary to first have firmer control of expenditures and improved accounting procedures. 38. The staff commended the authorities for their efforts to reform the state, make public accounts more transparent, fight corruption, and decentralize public services. In this context, the staff urged the authorities to eliminate the special presidential fund (Fund 14.01), where little information is available concerning how these resources are spent (Appendix Vl).26 Finally, the staff suggested that policy transparency would be improved by 24 The authorities noted that in light of the scarcity of budgetary resources, they are actively seeking private sector investment in the transmission sector. 25 The World Bank prepared a Social and Structural Policy Review in March 2000 (Report No. 20192), and is currently working on a Poverty Assessment Report. Key steps for implementation in 2001 could include (i) conducting a thorough review of social expenditures for rationalization so that expenditures are reallocated to a few, better-targeted, programs; (ii) developing a long-term poverty strategy; and (iii) developing an information system to monitor poverty. 26 Under the IFMP, this account will be eliminated.

The authorities noted that they were already considering publication of a IO-year development plan, to be designed in consultation with civil society. F. Statistical Issues 39. Some progress has been made in improving economic and financial statistics, particularly the balance of payments statistics and the national accounts. However, there is a pressing need to improve the reliability of the fiscal and external debt statistics, although progress has already been made in reducing the statistical discrepancy in the fiscal accounts. An action plan for dealing with the most serious data weaknesses is outlined in Appendix IV. 40. The Dominican Republic does not subscribe to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. International reserves reported to the Fund are not subject to any encumbrances. Gross international reserves reported to the Fund include only usable assets, with nonusable assets, such as Brady bond collateral and capital contributions to international organizations, excluded. The central bank does not engage in operations in futures markets for foreign exchange. Iv. MEDIUM-TERMchJTLOOK 41. The authorities were in broad agreement with the medium-term outlook depicted by the staff, which is based on achieving real GDP growth of 6-6% percent a year and reaching partner country inflation over the medium term, while gradually rebuilding foreign exchange reserves (Table 9). Fiscal rationalization is the linchpin of the macroeconomic policy framework, which will help the government to increase social spending while maintaining a small overall fiscal surplus, in line with foreseen financing constraints. This, together with some strengthening in the efftciency of the banking sector, would promote a reduction in domestic interest rates and support economic growth. 42. An external current account deficit of about 3 percent of GDP is seen as sustainable over the medium term. While tourism growth is projected to slow somewhat as regional competition increases, the granting of NAFTA-parity to the Dominican Republic is expected to provide a fresh impulse to textile exports and to promote further diversification of the export base (as nontextile exports will also benefit). However, there will be pressure on imports as a result of trade liberalization. Hence, a modest real depreciation of the peso is assumed to occur in 2001. FDI is expected to continue to grow over the medium term, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the past, as investment opportunities, including capitalization of public enterprises and further investment in the power sector remain strong. The ratio of public external debt to GDP is projected to almost halve from 16 percent in 2001 to less than 10 percent by 2005. Over the same period, the proposed reserve accumulation path (US$250-300 million a year) would almost double the ratios of gross reserves to imports, M2, and short-term debt (residual maturity basis) to two months, 18 percent, and 113 percent, respectively (Table 10).

The main risks to the medium-term outlook are that (i) oil prices rebound from their recent decline and (ii) that growth in the United States (an important export market) or in Europe (the major tourism market) slows substantially.27 On the positive side, these risks are diversified in various markets. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 44. Prior to 2000, the economy was experiencing robust growth with low innation and a sustainable external current account position. These favorable developments reflected monetary and fiscal discipline and adoption of key structural reforms. This performance demonstrated the growth potential of the Dominican economy. Strong growth continued in 2000, but there was a weakening of fiscal policy and, faced with a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade, a loss of foreign exchange reserves. The inflation rate rose to 9 percent-almost double the previous year’s rate. In response, the administration that came into power in August 2000 took significant actions to revert the previous weakening of policies, with a favorable impact on performance. 45. The authorities have proposed an ambitious fiscal adjustment. However, it is important to enact adequate expenditure monitoring and control mechanisms to ensure that the attainment of the expenditure targets is adequately protected. The approval, in December, of the new hydrocarbons law, allowing domestic fuel prices to adjust automatically to changes in costs, as well as eliminating the generalized subsidy on propane, were important steps toward strengthening government revenues and protecting the government’s ability to finance priority expenditures. It is also critical that unproductive expenditures be curtailed to provide sufficient resources for social sector investment. Firm expenditure control and stable revenues will also help reduce the stock of domestic arrears. 46. The staff welcomes the monetary authorities’ intention to increase their reliance on indirect instruments and to refrain from further use of direct controls. This will reduce distortions and uncertainty in the financial system and make monetary policy more transparent. The achievement of these objectives would be facilitated by approval of a new Monetary and Financial Code that gives full independence to the central bank. 47. The authorities’ have taken appropriate actions to strengthen the central bank’s reserve position. The current exchange rate regime is a managed float. In light of the relatively low level of reserves and the inherent vulnerability to shocks that could put severe pressure on those reserves, the staff welcomes the new monetary authorities’ movement toward greater exchange rate flexibility and the increased emphasis on rebuilding reserves. At the same time, however, the staff recommends early removal of existing multiple currency practices. It does not recommend approval of the practices, because of the lack of a definite timetable for their removal. *’ Table 11 presents a sensitivity analysis to selected variables.

Much progress has been made to bring prudential norms for the fmancial system closer to international standards. Nonetheless, several years of rapid credit growth and high interest rates may have weakened banks’ loan portfolios. The authorities’ modi- fications to further strengthen prudential norms include tightening classification and provi- sioning standards, and requiring banks to monitor and provision for market risks. In addition, it would be important to improve reporting transparency, particularly by requiring banks to report the full balance of nonperforming loans, not just the past-due installment. The autho- rities are participating in the Financial Sector Assessment Program to conduct a thorough review of the financial system. This will provide a solid framework to identify any financial system vulnerabilities and strengthen the analysis of domestic macroeconomic and financial stability issues, to prioritize development needs, and to develop appropriate policy responses. 49. Trade reform has contributed to improving openness and efficiency. A further consolidation and narrowing of the tariff structure is planned, as part of a continued integration with global markets that augurs well for sustainable growth. 50. The private capitalization of the state-owned electricity company (CDE) was an important step forward, but improvements in the power sector have been slower than expected. Given the substantial budgetary cost of electricity subsidies, the staff urges the authorities to establish an adequate legal and regulatory framework for the power sector as quickly as possible, to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market, to address the financial situation and debt of the CDE, and to complete the reorganization and financial restructuring of the CDE along the lines discussed with the World Bank. 51. Other key structural reforms include further divestment of public sector assets (including central bank assets and land holdings of the state-owned sugar company) and privatization of the Reserves Bank. Privatization would minimize the risk of excessive use of bank credit by the public sector, which, in the past, has impeded the efficient conduct of monetary policy. 52. The authorities are aware of the need to improve the timeliness and quality of economic and financial statistics. Efforts are underway to remedy the most serious data weaknesses in order to facilitate policymaking and effective surveillance. Improvements in fiscal accounting are essential if there is to be effective surveillance. Therefore, the staff urges the authorities to proceed as quickly as possible with the integrated financial management program being financed with support of the IDB. 53. Publishing full information on how tax revenues are spent is key to improving governance. In this context, elimination of the special presidential fund for discretionary spending would remove a major impediment to transparency. Publishing a three-year rolling plan outlining the government’s principal macroeconomic objectives and policies, would also reinforce transparency, and through the establishment of a sound track record, strengthen policy credibility.

The first priority should be to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and to rebuild reserves to reduce vulnerability to shocks. Assuming an acceleration of the pace of structural reform, the economy should be able to sustain solid growth, while reducing inflation to the rate of partner countries, and gradually building a more comfortable cushion of reserves over the medium term. This will require strong and sustained policy implementation, in line with the efforts shown so far by the authorities. 55. The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with the Dominican Republic take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

It is expected that these revisions will be officially implemented at the beginning of 2001. For the most part, data are reported to the IFS on a regular basis although not always with the required timeliness. Coverage of some major real sector indicators is limited, with untimely release of export and import volume and unit value indices, no information about the product breakdown of free-trade-zones imports and exports, and with no available series for producer prices, industrial production, and wages (except minimum wages). New indices for consumer prices based on updated and more accurate consumption baskets were published in April 1999 (with the new indices beginning in January 1999). Weights have been revised on the basis of the third national survey on household income and expenditure (October 1997- September 1998). Fiscal sector Data on fiscal revenues and expenditures lack consistency with data on public sector financing. The resulting statistical discrepancy is treated as an above-the-line item in the fiscal accounts, but given its extrabudgetary nature it is difficult to classify. Fiscal data are collected from various sources (National Budget Office, Treasury, Controller General, and the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD)), but with limited coordination and consistency in classification. Poor information on government expenditure contributes to the statistical discrepancy. Some progress has been made recently in reducing this statistical discrepancy, by identifying the use of external loans whose associated expenditures had not previously been registered in the budget. Furthermore, information on public enterprises is often incomplete and available only with long delays. Monetary accounts Reporting of monetary statistics to STA has been regularized, although with a recent change in the structure of reporting forms, some delays have arisen in the reporting of commercial bank data, but this is expected to be resolved shortly. Regarding the data of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD), all recommendations of the 1997 money and banking statistics mission have been implemented, and revised monthly data have been published in the IFS. The authorities have implemented most of the other recommendations made by a 1997 STA mission on money and banking statistics. There is still a disagreement regarding the accounting of revaluation gains and losses, with the authorities believing it would be inappropriate to include a separate revaluation account. The mission assisted BCRD officials in deriving analytical accounts for the banking institutions based on a new plan of accounts and the supplementary report forms submitted by the Reserves Bank. In addition, the mission assisted in establishing unified procedures for the regular reporting to the Fund of monetary data that meet the operational requirements of WHD and STA publication needs.

The solvency index will be published quarterly (rather than twice a year as at present), and banks will be required to report the index to the SB (currently, the SB calculates the solvency index only when it visits the banks). Balance of payments With technical assistance provided in 1996 by an expert consultant financed from the Japan Administered Account, the balance of payments statistics were thoroughly revised and, since February 1997, have been in conformance with the methodology presented in the fifth edition of the BaZance of Payments Manual. The balance of payments data in the IFS have been updated for this last data revision. The authorities have continued to revise the balance of payments statistics, most recently in February 1999, based on the advice of the expert who conducted follow-up technical assistance missions during February-March 1997 and February-March 1998. The latter mission was sent by STA in response to a request by the authorities and a report by the governor of the central bank of good progress in the implementation of the expert’s recommendations. During this mission, further progress was made in finalizing the compilation methodology and improvements were reported, particularly in the recording of exports and imports of the free-trade zones, foreign direct investment transactions, public external debt data recording, and current transfers. The expert recommended steps to achieve more complete coverage of foreign direct investment and services transactions and to validate data derived from surveys and questionnaires. Improvements in the compilation of foreign direct investment and transactions classified under other sources within the current account are still needed to improve the coverage and analytical usefulness of the statistics. The Dominican Republic does not produce statistics on the International Investment Position. External debt The authorities are working to strengthen their monitoring of external debt. In particular, they intend to (i) improve enforcement of legal obligations of the private sector to report new external loans (particularly of smaller companies); and (ii) strengthen the quality of data on public and private short-term debt (such data are not published on a residual maturity basis in the Dominican Republic). The authorities have outlined plans to address these shortcomings (see Action Plan at the end of this appendix). Further technical assistance may be necessary.

The reports contain timely preliminary data on real GDP, consumer prices, interest rates, exchange rates, balance of payments, exports and imports, and operations of the central government and the banking system. The QuarterZy Bulletin of the central bank contains more detailed information on sectoral developments, but the bulletin is published with delays of about four months. The central bank also maintains a website that presents selected data on a relatively timely basis. Adequacy of data for effective surveillance There remain weaknesses in the statistical database, particularly with regard to the lack of consistency in the fiscal data. Also, long lags in the reporting of data occasionally arise, most notably on government spending and operations of the public enterprises. The authorities have formulated an action plan to remedy the most serious data weaknesses. Improvements in fiscal accounting are essential if there is to be effective surveillance.

The new norms are being reviewed as part of the FSAP. Based on preliminary information provided by central bank staff, the new norms are much closer to international standards. Reporting transparency Reporting the full balance of nonperforming loans, instead of the existing practice of just reporting the past-due installment, would reduce uncertainty as to the true condition of the loan portfolio and make the ratio of loan provisions to nonperforming loans a more meaningful asset quality indicator. The absence of clear asset quality indicators creates unnecessary suspicion on the part of banking analysts and foreign correspondent banks. Additionally, the practice of referring to the ratio of required provisions to total loans as a “credit risk index” (Indice de Riesgo Crediticio) is counterproductive to the objective of strengthening provisions. Bankers will prefer to show a lower index, and thus be more inclined to assign less severe loan classifications, and consequently to underestimate the risk in their loan portfolio. Banking supervision On-site examinations should be coordinated with the supervised institutions to increase effectiveness, unless circumstances warrant otherwise. The SB should implement a mechanism (such as CAMELS’) to rank financial institutions’ managerial, operational, and financial performance, and thus determine the institutions’ overall soundness. Such a mechanism would facilitate assigning inspection resources not only to institutions that because of their size represent the largest risk to the system, but also because of their financial health and quality of risk management. Most importantly, financial groups, including banks’ offshore operations (regardless of whether these are part of a financial group), should be properly regulated and supervised as expeditiously as possible. ’ Capital, assets, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.

According to the International Country Risk Guide, government stability index in the Dominican Republic is 10 (the higher the value, the lower the risk), comparing favorably with the average of nine for selected Latin American countries (LAC) (see Table).’ The indices for corruption and “law and order” are both four, above the LAC average of three. Democratic accountability is four, the same as the LAC average. Bureaucracy quality is one, less than the LAC average of two. The total points for the five indices for the Dominican republic are 23, one point above the LAC average. Overall, these indices suggest that the Dominican Republic compares favorably with other Latin American countries. Public fund management. Approximately 10 percent of central government spending is executed by the Office of the Presidency through Fund 14.01 (down from 50-60 percent several years ago). This fund lacks transparency and is highly discretional. In addition, budgeting, treasury, accounting, internal control, and government procurement systems are not well coordinated. Information is often exchanged manually, double counted, and frequently unreliable. These weaknesses hinder efficient resource allocation and provision of public services. To address these problems, with technical assistance from the IDB, the government has approved an integrated financial management program, which will contribute to an efficient allocation and management of public funds and an increase in transparency. The authorities intend to complete the program in 2002. Modernization of the Executive Power. Efficient public administration is hampered by a lack of formal mechanisms that allow for policy coordination, thus leading to overlapping responsibilities among public sector institutions. Other factors impeding efficient public administration include low- skilled labor, excess public sector employment, and weak information systems. In its efforts to reform, the government has requested assistance from the IDB to support the modemization of the Executive Power by building institutional capacity, developing a more equitable distributional policy, and improving the efficiency of social spending. This reform is being considered by congress. Anti-corruption. Government restrictions can be sources of rent-seeking and corruption, High tariffs, poorly targeted subsidies, price controls on agricultural products, and multiple currency practices in the Dominican Republic need to be reduced or eliminated. The government, aware of these problems, is enacting tariff and tax reforms, pursuing the privatization of state-owned enterprises, revising the monetary and financial code, improving property rights, and working on a modem regulatory framework for the electricity sector. ’ The maximum point assigned to government stability is 12, corruption 6, law and order 6, democratic accountability 6, and bureaucracy quality 4.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Dominican Republic On February 23, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Dominican Republic.’ Background For most of the last decade the Dominican Republic experienced an extended period of robust economic growth, declining unemployment rates, modest consumer price inflation, and a generally manageable external position. Indeed, in recent years, the Dominican Republic ranked among the world’s fastest growing economies, with particularly strong performances in the construction, telecommunications, tourism, and free-trade sectors. In 2000, although economic growth continued at a brisk pace, higher oil import costs and a weakening of macroeconomic policies (associated with the electoral cycle) led to a widening of the external current account deficit and pressure on foreign exchange reserves. In 1999, real GDP expanded by over 8 percent, driven by domestic demand, especially investment. Despite the strong economic activity and a one-time adjustment in domestic fuel prices in October averaging about 20 percent, inflation remained subdued, helped by a fall in food prices as agricultural output recovered following Hurricane Georges. Greater-than- expected foreign direct investment (FDI) more than financed the external current account deficit, contributing to an accumulation of almost US$200 million of official net international reserves (NIR). At end-1999, gross reserves reached the equivalent of one month of projected 2000 imports, 14 percent of M2, and 71 percent of short-term external debt-a modest improvement relative to end-1998. ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the February 23,200l Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Election-related expenditure overruns were compounded by delays in adjusting domestic fuel prices, resulting in dramatically reduced government proceeds from the oil differential. As a result, the central government deficit widened by one percentage point of GDP. The overall consolidated public sector deficit widened marginally to 2.8 percent of GDP, compared with the authorities’ target of near balance. The quasi-fiscal deficit of the central bank remained broadly unchanged in relation to GDP at ‘/z percent of GDP. The central government fiscal slippage, large capital inflows, and rapid growth of credit to the private sector put upward pressure on domestic demand and inflation, while monetary policy continued to rely on direct measures, such as temporary ceilings on bank credit. With economic activity remaining buoyant in 2000, capacity constraints became binding and inflationary pressures heightened. The annual rate of growth of real GDP accelerated to 11% percent in the first quarter of the year. Rising interest rates and less credit availability contributed to a deceleration of growth to 7 percent in the third quarter. Growth was concentrated in the wholesale, retail, tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Domestic demand expanded at an even brisker pace, sustained primarily by private consumption, in contrast to 1999, when investment was the driving force. For the year as a whole, real GDP is estimated to have expanded by 8% percent. The rapid growth of domestic demand pushed the 12-month inflation rate to 9 percent by December. The unemployment rate declined, as output growth exceeded an increase in labor force participation rates. The consolidated public sector deficit narrowed somewhat in relation to GDP in 2000. Central government revenue growth (13 percent) is estimated to have outpaced expenditure growth (10 percent), reflecting some tightening toward the end of the year. The deficit of the public enterprises (net of central government transfers) is estimated to have narrowed by one percent of GDP. Quasi-fiscal losses are estimated to have remained at half a percent of GDP. Brisk private sector demand, together with the persistent fiscal deficit in 2000, put pressure on official foreign exchange reserves. The stock of NIR fell to less than US$200 million in August (compared with US$547 million at end-1999). In response, in September the central bank increased exchange rate flexibility, adjusting the official exchange rate more frequently (weekly), and by year-end, NIR stood at US$442 million. Strong private sector credit demand combined with central bank credit controls, put upward pressure on interest rates- lending rates reached about 30 percent toward year-end, compared with 25 percent at the beginning of the year. Reflecting strong domestic demand and the higher oil bill, the external current account deficit is estimated to have more than doubled, reaching 6.2 percent of GDP in 2000. Exports of goods and services continued to show robust growth, but the oil import bill increased by US$650 million (2% percentage points of GDP). Gross receipts from free-trade-zone exports, tourism, and remittances from abroad, continued their strong expansion, growing by lo-16 percent, and representing a combined total equivalent to almost half of GDP. Nonetheless, the non-oil current account surplus is estimated to have declined by about one percent of GDP in 2000, reflecting the rapid expansion of domestic demand.

The exchange rate spread widened to 2 percent, before a devaluation of that amount on September 5. At end-2000, gross reserves (US$637 million) were equivalent to only one month of projected 2001 imports (goods and services, net of free-trade-zone imports), 11 percent of estimated M2, and 59 percent of short-term external debt. Progress has been made in improving the supervision and regulation of the financial system. The authorities’ program of financial reform, initiated in 1991, has included liberalization of interest rates, rationalization of reserve requirements, adoption of regulations allowing the establishment of universal banks, restructuring the Superintendency of Banks, and consolidation of the banking system. According to the authorities, banks are in compliance with capital adequacy norms. In December 1999, the risk-based capital adequacy ratio for the banking sector stood at 10.7 percent, compared with a minimum requirement of 10 percent. In the face of increasing operations in foreign currency, the authorities have strengthened regulations on this type of operation with the aim of preventing excessive foreign borrowing by banks and monitoring exchange rate risk. In January 2001, the Monetary Board approved new prudential norms on loan classification, provisioning for credit risk, measurement of market risk, and provisioning for market risk. Executive Board Assessment Public Information Notices (PINS) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMP to the public. This action is intended to strengthen IMP surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMP’s assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
