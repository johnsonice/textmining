Most targets under the program were missed, and the review under the program could not be completed, primarily because fiscal policy was much more expansionary than envisaged. b Real GDP growth was slower in 1994 than in 1993. Although non-oil GDP grew faster, largely on the strength of a positive response of the forestry and agricultural sectors to the devaluation, oil output advanced by only 9 percent. Average inflation was 39 percent, slightly more than pro- jected in the aftermath of the devaluation. + Monetary developments in 1994 were characterized by a significant recovery of money demand, primarily owing to the boom in the forestry sector. Although credit expansion grexly exceeded targets, resources were sufficient to allow some growth in foreign reserves. . External performance was influenced by the strong response of timber exports to the gains in competitiveness and by a contraction of imports. As a result, Equatorial Guinea experienced its first trade surplus in many years. The overall bai.;:ic+ of payments deficit was financed mostly by arrears accumulation. Rewart on the discussions . The consultation discussions focused on ways to counteract the impact of the expansionary policies pursued since the devaluation, and to return Equatorial Guinea to a path of adjustment and reform. A central issue was how Equatorial Guinea could capitalize on the gains in competi- tiveness offered by the change in parity, and on the relaxation of the resource constraint made possible by rapidly rising oil production. l During the first half of 1995, fiscal management continued to deteriorate. The overall deficit on a commitment basis amounted to CFAF 123 million, instead of a projected surplus of CFAF 1 billion: it was financed by debt relief and the accumulation of arrears. Based on these trends, the fiscal outcome for 1995 would be markedly different from the budget approved by Parliament, and an exceptional financing need, equivalent to 13 percent of GDP, would emerge after debt relief. . The authorities were concerned about the prospect of a residual financing gap, but indicated that in the present political envi.ronment they found it difficult to take measures that would close it in ful?. They would, however, envisage implementing certain revenue and expenditure measure.s in an attempt to limit deviations from the budget. iii - Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- iv - l The staff developed a medium-term balance of payments scenario based on current policies, which pointed to residual financing gaps through 2001. Under this scenario, the current account. as well as the overall balance of payments, would be in surplus after 1996. Given these prospects, the authorities expressed interest in contracting debt guaranteed by future oil revenue. The mission reminded them of the risks that such arrangements posed for government finances. . The staff evaluated measures aimed at accelerating structural reform. It stressed that the Government should allow the private sector to play the main role in diversifying Equatorial Guinea's economy. Staff aDD?CaiSd l The staff is concerned that prospects of rising oil production and exports may have further weakened Equatorial Guinea's resolve to pursue appropriate fiscal policies, to ensure transparency and accountability in public sector financial management, and to push ahead with the needed structural reforms. In the view of the staff, absolute priority must be given during the remainder of 1995 and in 1996 to tightening fiscal management, complemented by rapid civil service retrenchment and public enterprise reform. Only then could Equatorial Guinea hope to marshal1 sufficient external support to cover the prospective financing gaps. To that end, the authorities need to regularize their relations with foreign creditors by eliminating outstanding arrears and servicing the debt as it falls due. b Equatorial Guinea's data base remains very weak, and the authorities need to make improvements in this area through requests for technical assistance, among other steps.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Equatorial Guinea were held in Malabo during the period July 9-25, 1995. 1,' On May 2, 1994, the Executive Board concluded the.1994 Article IV consultations and approved the second annual arrangement under the three-year ESAF arrangement, in an amount equivalent to SDR 3.68 million (15 percent of quota). On that occasion, Executive Directors pointed out that the coming on stream of oil production provided the Equatorial Guinea authorities with a unique oppor- tunity to improve public and private sector incomes and strengthen the country's external position. Directors noted that the pursuit of appro- priately tight demand management and incomes policies, coupled with supply- enhancing measures, was essential to meet the medium-term objectives of economic growth on a sustainable basis and balance of payments viability. Accordingly, the authorities needed to reform tax administrations, strengthen expenditure control, and quicken the pace of civil service and public enterprise reforms. Equatorial Guinea's adjustment program for 1994 soon went off track. Most targets under the program were missed, and the review under the program could not be completed (Table 1). During December 1994.January 1995, Equatorial Guinea incurred arrears to the Fund for a cumulative total of SDR 401,800; they were settled on January 30, 1995. 2/ Equatorial Guinea again incurred arrears from June 12, 1995, which were fully settled only in early July. Relations with donors remain difficult. Irregularities during the legislative elections of November 1993 led to a dramatic fall in financial support from the international community, but some donor support resumed in the course of 1994 after the Government announced municipal elections. These elections, first called for September 1994, have been postponed twice; they were eventually held on September 17, 1995. If the elections are seen to have been held freely, donor financial support could increase during the remainder of 1995 and beyond. II. Economic and Financial DeVeloDments in 1994 Real GDP growth amounted to 7 percent in 1994, down from 12 percent in 1993 (Table 2 and Chart 1). Non-oil GDP grew by 6% percent, largely on the strength of a positive response of the forestry and agricultural sectors to 1,' The Equatorial Guinea" representatives included Mr. Anatolio Ndong Mba, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance; Mr. Guillermo Nguema Ela, head of the Oversight Committee; and other senior officials. The staff representatives were Mr. Harnack (head), Mr. Dow, and Ms. Brunschwig (all AFR). Mr. Ingram, resident representative of the World Bank in Cameroon, participated in some of the meetings, The mission had been initially scheduled for March 1995, but it was postponed because of domestic political developments at the time. 2/ A notification to the Executive Board regarding these arrears was issued on January 20, 1995 (EBS/95/8).

Oil out- put, however, advanced by only 9 percent, considerably less than expected, because of a blocked pipeline during the first half of 1994 (oil production had grown by over 70 percent in 1993, albeit from a low level). Average inflation was 39 percent, slightly more than projected in the aftermath of the devaluation. Box 1. Equatorial Guinea: Background After independence in 1968, Equatorial Guinea embarked on expansionary financial policies, which led to high inflation, a growing overvaluation of the currency and, as a consequence, large internal and external imbalances. Real GDP growth was low, the debt service ratio rose to very high levels, and social indicators progressively worsened. In 1985, the Government took a number of measures to open the economy and reduce distortions. The country became a member of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) and adopted the CFA franc as its currency (Chart 2). Equatorial Guinea also joined the Central African Economic and Customs Union (UDEAC). Since 1988, the Government has attempted to reduce financial imbalances and to diversify the productive base in the context of annual structural adjustment programs supported by the IMF and the World Bank. In 1992, the country began producing crude petroleum, and real GDP growth and the external current account have been improving. However, the strengthening of the. fiscal position has remained elusive, owing to limited administrative capacity and lackluster efforts by the Government in reducing tax w&on, contmlling extrabudgetary expenditures, and restructuring public enterprises. Equatorial Guinea’s statistical base remains very weak. Some progress has been made in compiling national income accounts and reinforcing fiscal management, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and France, respectively. However, important defciencies remain in the fiscal accounts, where extrabudgetary and compensation operations obscure the true extent of the Government’s activities; in the consumer price index, which suffers from outdated weights and inadequate coverage; and in the balance of payments, which is compiled only irregularly. Regarding the monetary sector, there seems to be a break in the money supply series after 1993, which makes it difficult to interpret the growth of broad money, and there is a general absence of proper analysis and monitoring of monetary data. The lack of timely and regular reporting of core. data and their uncertain quality are complicating the surveillance of macroeconomic performance (see also Appendix III). Fiscal policy remained expansionary and budgetary management weakened markedly during 1994. Whereas the program had called for a surplus equiv- alent to 1% percent of GDP, the overall fiscal deficit, excluding foreign- financed capital expenditure, merely narrowed to 2% percent of GDP, from 8 percent in 1993. Domestic revenue fell 4 percentage points of GDP below its 1993 level, primarily because increasing tax evasion and fraud reduced Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- !

Noninterest domestically financed expenditure was "ear the originally programmed levels, but foreign-financed capital outlays were sharply lower in response to the virtual suspension of donor assistance. Domestic arrears decreased by CFAF 1.6 billion, ten times more than programmed, reflecting the practice of compensation operations, that is, offsetting current liabilities of taxpayers with overdue government obli- gations to them. This further reduced the cash income of the Treasury and, with limited capital inflows, the bulk of the deficit and of amortization obligations was financed by the accumulation of external arrears. Monetary developments in 1994 were characterized by a very strong recovery of money demand. Broad money grew by 140 percent, far in excess of the 39 percent that had been projected, as the demand for cash balances increased, primarily owing to a boom in the forestry .secfor following the devaluation. 1/ The profits generated by the sector remained for the most part as deposits in the domestic banking system. Net credit to the Govern- ment increased by 36 percent of beginning-of-period broad money, compared with the 22 percent contraction that had been projected. Since Equatorial Guinea was at the limit of its statutory advances, this increase reflected, in addition to the domestic counterpart of the use of Fund credit, the accumulation of government payments arrears to the BEAC as well as, at the end of 1994, to the Fund. Credit to the private sector grew by only 21 percent, one third the rate of growth of nominal GDP, as credit demand was dampened by the large income gains and return to profitability in the small formal traded goods sector (excluding the oil sector, which finances itself abroad), Other items (net) augmented notably in the wake of the devaluation, reflecting an increasing lag in classifying transactions properly, particularly those related to foreign trade. Overall, net domestic assets increased by 89 percent of beginning-of-period broad money, considerably more than programmed. But, given that bank loanable resources increased even more rapidly, there was some improvement in the "et foreign asset position of Equatorial Guinea's sole commercial bank (which also was able to reduce its long-term foreign liabilities) and in the contribution of Equatorial Guinea to the "et foreign asset position of the BEAC. (This contribution remains substantially negative, however, reflecting the large outstanding use of Fund credit). Z?/ External performance was influenced importantly by the devaluation, with timber exports responding strongly to the gains in competitiveness and imports unrelated to the oil sector or to foreign-financed investment contracting more than envisaged. These developments, together with a strong fall in project-related imports, led to a large trade surplus (24 percent of GDP), the first such surplus in many years. The current account balance I/ As noted in Box 1, it is difficult to interpret the growth of broad money, owing to an apparent break in the series after 1993. 2/ Given the monetary and exchange arrangements of the CFA franc zone, use of Fund resources is treated as direct domestic financing of the budget through the common central bank.

The overall balance of payments deficit narrowed to US$17 million, from US$24 million a year earlier; it was financed mostly by arrear.s accumulation. 1/ Debt service obligations remained high in 1994, at 34 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services, or 110 percent of government domestic revenue. Actual payments, however, were only about a fifth of the amounts due. In the context of the reforms decided at the level of the regional customs union (UDEAC), a major simplification and reduction of import tariffs was implemented in mid-1994. Import tariffs (as well as the broad range for indirect tax rates) for the UDEAC countries were set at the regional level, thus limiting Equatorial Guinea's ability to modify these rates unilaterally. Nonetheless, import surcharges were raised signif- icantly following the introduction of the new UDFAC rate structure, thereby contributing to tax evasion. III. Report on the Discussions The consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of the continuing slippage in performance since the start of the ESAF arrangement in February 1993. They focused, in particular, on ways to counteract the impact of the expansionary policies pursued since the devaluation and to return Equatorial Guinea to a path of adjustment and reform. To that end, the staff emphasized the immediate need for a meaningful tightening of fiscal policies, especially in view of the large residual financing gap that is in prospect for the 1995 budget. Another issue was how Equatorial Guinea could capitalize on the gains in competitiveness offered by the change in parity, and on the relaxation of the resource constraint made possible by rapidly rising oil production, to diversify the economy, alleviate poverty, and restore external viability. In this connection, the staff appraised medium-term prospects, incorporating a likely tripling of oil production between 1995 and 1997 (see Appendix IV), and underscored the importance of transparent management of this large incremental income. The staff will evaluate Equatorial Guinea's performance by mid-1996, with a view to putting into place a staff-monitored program and allowing the country to re- establish its track record. 1. Fiscal uolicies The budget for 1995 aimed at making up for the weaknesses experienced during 1994 regarding import tax collections and control of expenditure on wages and salaries, as well as on goods and services (Table 3). The budget envisaged a primary surplus of CFAF 1.5 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, and an overall deficit on a commitment basis of CFAF 2 billion (2% percent of GDP). It called for a reduction in net recourse to domestic bank credit and was to &' Notably to Spain, Italy, and multilateral creditors Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - be fully financed after debt relief. The budget included specific measures to return the effective import tax yield to a level "ear that of 1993, when it exceeded 20 percent, and to improve the collection of administrative fees. Expenditure ceilings on wages and salaries and on goods and services were set at CFAF 2.7 billion, that is, lower than had been programmed for 1994. These budget plans notwithstanding, the slippage in fiscal management of 1994 continued during the first half of 1995. The overall deficit on a commitment basis, excluding grants and foreign-financed capital expenditure, amounted to CFAF 123 million, as against a budgeted surplus of CFAF 1.0 billion (Table 4). Domestic revenue, at CFAF 6 billion, was 7 percent below budget, owing to continuing fraud and evasion, as well as unplanned ad hoc exemptions, of taxes on international trade. Meanwhile, current expenditure was 13 percent higher than budgeted, primarily because of excesses in the wage bill and on goods and services. The overall deficit, together with some reduction in net indebtedness to the banking system, was financed by debt relief and the accumulation of external arrears, the latter amounting to CFAF 1 billion (mostly involving multilateral creditors and non-Paris Club official creditors). The staff observed that. based on these trends, the fiscal outcome for 1995 would be markedly different from the budget approved by Parliament. Domestic revenue would hover marginally under the target of CFAF 13.5 billion (16 percent of GDP), but only because of higher oil royalties and revenue from the sale of petroleum products, whereas the import tax yield would remain unchanged at its very low 1994 level. The growth in non- interest domestically financed expenditure, meanwhile, would exceed the increase in nominal GDP because of a prospective 23 percent rise in the wage bill and a 50 percent jump in transfers, owing to higher outlays primarily in the health and education sectors related to a shortfall in foreign grants and loan disbursements. As a result of this shortfall in foreign aid, capital expenditure would be half as much as budgeted, though still increasing faster than nominal GDP. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit on a commitment basis would likely approach CFAF 3.9 billion, or 4ti percent of GDP and almost twice as much as budgeted. Given scheduled external amor- tization and repayments to the banking system, this deficit would result in an exceptional financing need for the budget, after debt relief from the Paris Club (covering the period through May 1, 1995), of some CFAF 11 billion (13 percent of GDP). The authorities were concerned about the size of the financing gap, but indicated that, in the present political environment, they would find it difficult to take measures that would fully finance the budget. They would, however, envisage implementing tax measures that could raise domestic revenue to CFAF 14 billion in 1995 (through efforts to increase the import tax yield by 4 percentage points, to 16 percent of taxable imports, and to step up the collection of arrears). They would also centralize all revenue collected by ministries and other government agencies at the Treasury. They stated that, given their expenditure priorities, noninterest domestically financed expenditure would still be likely to exceed the budget by some Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 Chmt3:DomerlimUyFinanced NoninterertPublic~endihrrr~/ (I,, billionr o$ ffAfmc>) 0 1 2 3 4 5 h I h, 6 percent.

Furthermore, the authorities felt that, given developments in the first half of the year, in particular with respect to travel and "other" goods 0,995 on c”rrmtpolicicr 0,995 Budgcl and services (which include expenditure by the Ll Erc~f~nigl-f-~dcrpi~rl*xp~~~. Presidency), it would be difficult to keep budget overruns on total goods and services below 23 percent, although actual spending would still be 11 percent lower than in 1994. The authorities said they would work with all levels of Government to ensure adherence to revised targets in an attempt to limit the deviations from the budget. The staff expressed concern that the draft 1996 budget (see Box 2) did not depart significantly from the recent expansionary stance. Furthermore, in light of the deviations already apparent under the 1995 budget, the staff cautioned the authorities that many of the targets envisaged for 1996 would not be attained in the absence of specific measures. Thus, the staff felt that the effective import and export tax yields would remain at their 1994 levels, and that noninterest domestically financed expenditure would be much higher. Under such a scenario, domestic revenue would only reach 14% percent of GDP, "oninterest domestically financed expenditure would be 3 percentage points of GDP higher than budgeted, and the overall deficit would remain "ear 4 percent of GDP. The residual financing gap could be as much as 6 percent of GDP, or CFAF 6 billion. In these conditions, the staff underscored that absolute priority should be given to a major tightening of fiscal management during the second half of 1995 and in 1996 if new arrears were to be avoided, notably as regards nonreschedulable external debt arrears. It stressed that control had to be regained over the collection of import taxes as a matter of urgency and that proper payment of export taxes by the forestry companies also had to be ensured. In that context, the staff emphasized that the authorities needed to ensure transparency and record the production i" the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - oil and forestry sectors properly for budgetary revenue purposes. The authorities also needed to develop alternate revenue .sources to reduce dependence on international trade taxes. Furthermore, expenditure would need to be tightened significantly and immediately. To that end, a treasury cash flow plan would have to be put into place, compensation operations to cease, and control over expenditure authorizations to be returned to the sole authority of the Ministry of Finance in order to prevent abuses and arbitrariness. These short-term actions should be complemented by reforms to streamline the civil service and public enterprise sector. Overall, the staff expressed concern that fiscal efforts fell well short of what was needed to finance the 1995 budget fully, with revenue plummeting to its lowest level relative to GDP in five years. Box 2. The Draft 1996 Budget The authorities’ 1996 draft budget is based upon expectations of increased oil revenue and contains only a limited number of corrective measures. It still shows a residual gap of CFAF 2 billion, with the following features: Reduction in overall dejicif aJ?er gratis. The budget aims at reducing the overall deficit after grants lo 0.3 percent of GDP from 2.7 percent of GDP budgeted in 1995. Revenues lower with respect to GDP. Although progress is to be made toward raising the effective import tax rate over 1995 (to 19 percent), these gains are expected to be offset by a weaker collection of tax arrears and other nontax revenue, and domestic revenue would fall to 16% percent of GDP, from 18% percent budgeted in 1995. Noninterest domestically~nanced expenditure lower relative to GDP. Total expenditure, excluding interest payments and foreign-financed capital expenditure, is slated to fall to 8.3 percent of GDP from 10 percent of GDP budgeted in 1995. Measures include reductions in the wage bill and in “other” goods and services. Reduction in net domestic bank credit. The budget envisages inter alia a decrease in current advances of CFAF 85 million, as well as full settlement of the scheduled debt service to the BEAC, for a total reduction in net bank credit of CFAF 1.2 billion. 2. Monetarv and credit oolicies Monetary policy is conducted at the regional level by the BEAC and, given the monetary and exchange arrangements of the CFA zone, is directed at protecting the peg to the French franc by maintaining, through appropriate interest rates, an adequate level of foreign reserves at the regional level (Table 5). Given this nominal anchor, inflation is expected to decline rapidly, approaching the rate prevailing in France, In fact, during the first half of 1995, inflation was virtually nil. The main contribution that Equatorial Guinea can make to regional objectives is to reduce outstanding use of central bank credit by the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 Government. Accordingly, the authorities indicated that their current plans entailed a net repayment of some CFAF 1.9 billion to the BEAC (Table 6). I/ This repayment includes overdue payments on an exceptional loan extended by the BEAC in 1991 in order to allow the Government to meet certain obligations to the Fund. Credit to the economy, over which the monetary authorities have very limited control at the individual country level, is expected to continue to grow modestly (6 percent)--it declined through the first five months of the year--for lack of bankable paper and slack demand from the booming timber and oil industries (Table 7). Broad money is expected to continue to advance at the strong clip of the first five months of the year, reflecting continued demand for cash balances, notably by the forestry sector. Should this be the case, a significant improvement in the external position of the banking system is in store. Ongoing monetary policy reforms at the regional level are expected to enhance the effectiveness of monetary management through increased recourse to indirect market-based instruments of monetary control. The system, introduced in July 1994, features an interbank market, where banks and other eligible financial institutions trade funds at freely determined interest rates; an auction system for central bank advances, complemented by a repurchase system (prise en pension): and a refinancing window for medium- term bank credits. The system remains flawed, however, as the BEAC sets both interest rates (8.75 percent at end-June 1995) and quantities at the weekly auctions of liquidity injections. It is also asymmetrical, as a liquidity absorption mechanism does not yet exist, other than through the acceptance of the voluntary "special" bank deposits with the central bank at below-market interest rates. Nonetheless, the new system represents an improvement over the previous one. 2/ The staff, in its discussions with the Equatorial Guinean authorities and in its six-monthly meetings with the BEAC, has argued for an early remedying of these weaknesses. The authorities observed, however, that the current imperfections in the regional money market and frailties in certain national banking systems made it inevitable that progress was only gradual. The authorities intend to monitor the activities of commercial banks closely. They will directly supervise the operations of the Meridien-BIAO bank--which has a generally sound loan portfolio, but whose foreign owner's main shareholder (MIBL-Bahamas) was recently placed in receivership--through the administrator appointed by the regional banking commission (COBAC). The authorities have initiated discussions with foreign banks in an attempt to find a new foreign partner quickly. Meanwhile, a new financial institution--the Caisse Commune d'Epargne et Investissement (CCEI), head- quartered in Cameroon--began operations in May 1995, introducing an element of competition in domestic financial intermediation. The authorities will IJ Such a projection takes into account the drawdown of government deposits accumulated during the first half of 1995 with the commercial bank, which in turn increased its reserves at the BEAC. 2/ For a description of that system see SM/94/74 (3/23/94).

The CCEI took over the buildings of two closed banks, but the proceeds from the sale were minimal, owing to the deteriorated state of the structures. As a consequence, the authorities did not raise the funds needed to eliminate their obligations vis-h-vis the depositors of the closed banks as had been envisaged under the program. In discussing this issue with the authorities, the staff stressed that if they wished to compensate the depositors, there should be limitations on such compensation--and in particular, that a maximum amount per depositor should be fixed and any compensation should be financed out of the budget. 3. External policies Equatorial Guinea continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although there are no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The trade system is aIso free of restrictions, except for a list of goods prohibited for security or health reasons. The mission emphasized that acceptance of Article VIII obligatio"s would demonstrate Equatorial Guinea's commitment to a liberal exchange system. The authorities agreed in principle with this view, but preferred that such a move be made in the context of a joint decision by the member countries of the BEAC. Equatorial Guinea's balance of payments outlook is largely dominated by the rise in oil production since 1992, to an average of 6,000 barrels a day in 1995, or more than double the level of 1992. The contribution of this sector to the balance of payments is projected to increase to US$38 million in 1995, or 42 percent of export earnings (Tables 8 and 9). Although a surge in service payments on account of the leasing of oil rigs for the exploitation of a newly discovered oil field is expected to bear heavily on the sector's external current account (which should move into a deficit equivalent to one fifth of GDP), these costs are expected to be offset by further inflows of capital (Table 10). Overall, the oil sector is expected to continue making a small but positive contribution to the balance of payments. Whereas oil sector developments have been little influenced by the devaluation, the non-oil balance of payments, dominated as it is by the forestry sector, is expected to continue to respond positively to the exchange rate action. Timber exports are projected to reach an all-time high of US$37 million this year, which, together with the continued effect of the devaluation on absorption, is expected to reduce the current account deficit (after official transfers) to 4 percent of GDP. On present indica- tions, the withholding of a large part of donors' assistance should trans- late into relatively high net official capital outflows, and therefore a continued large deficit in the non-oil balance of payments, reflecting in turn the imbalances in the public finances. Unless the deficit is narrowed by strengthened adjustment policies and covered by a resumption of excep- tional external assistance, there would be a further accumulation of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - external payments arrears--in practice a continued default by the Government on its external debt service obligations. Equatorial Guinea's stock of external debt amounted to 203 percent of GDP at end-1994 (Table 11). The debt service ratio, before debt relief, is projected to decline from 34 percent to 25 percent in 1995, but debt service due would be equivalent to 93 percent of government domestic revenue. On December 15, 1994, Paris Club creditors (France, Italy, and Spain) agreed on a comprehensive terms of reference rescheduling for Equatorial Guinea, covering both pre-cutoff-date debt arrears at end-November 1994 and eligible debt service during the period December 1, 1994-May 31, 1995. 1/ The terms of the agreement yielded debt relief of US$36 million on enhanced Toronto terms, and entailed debt reduction in present value terms of 39 percent (US$14 million). 2/ Assuming terms comparable to those granted by Paris Club creditors, a further US$24 million would be obtained from other official bilateral creditors. In March 1995, France concluded its bilateral implementing agreement and on that occasion forgave an additional US$14% million of concessional, post-cutoff-date debt. Bilateral agreements with Italy, Spain and non-Paris bilateral creditors have not yet been concluded; Italy has outstanding debt in litigation. No payments under the agreement with France have yet been made. As indicated in Appendix IV, e comprehensive assessment of Equatorial Guinea's external debt situation is made difficult by the uncertainties regarding the current macroeconomic policy stance and political develop- ments. In addition, the impact on the country's debt service capacity of the expected significant increase in oil production is far from clear. On the basis of the medium-term scenarios developed by the staff, debt service ratios would improve significantly over the next ten years, reflecting the projected growth in oil exports. In terms of exports of goods and nonfactor services, the ratios would average 9 percent per annum during the period 1996-2006. Nonetheless, residual financing gaps would remain through 2001, and the debt service ratios, in terms of government domestic revenue, would still average 47 percent per annum. Two alternative scenarios (lower oil exports and lower inflows of foreign aid) broadly validate these results. However, in the latter case, the low level of foreign aid would constrain economic growth. The staff stressed the seriousness of the balance of payments and debt situation. It urged the authorities to complement domestic policy u The agreement provided for a possible extension of the consolidation period through February 28, 1996, if, inter alia, a third annual ESAF arrangement was in place before August 31, 1995. 2/ Obligations corresponding to the previous concessional reschedul.ings of 1989 and 1992 were rescheduled over 10 years, with a five-year grace period, entailing no further present value reduction. This explains the overall present value reduction of only 39 percent, which is below the 50 percent level associated with treatment under the enhanced Toronto term framework.

It emphasized the need to remain current in debt service obligations, including those to the World Bank and other multilateral institutions, and to conclude bilateral accords with creditors on all eligible debt, including non-Paris Club bilateral debt. This would involve cash settlement of US$lS million during 1995, equivalent to 67 percent of government domestic revenue (Table 12). However, on present trends, it is unlikely that all these payments will take place, and the stock of arrears at end-1995 could amount to some US$23 million (13ti percent of GDP). The impact of these obligations on the fiscal position underscored the need not only for a major tightening of the public finances but also for renewed efforts on the part of Equatorial Guinea in the area of financial management and governance, which would allow for an early resumption of donor support. The staff discussed steps to strengthen Equatorial Guinea's debt servicing capacity. It encouraged the authorities to improve the timeliness and accuracy of the debt data prepared by the Debt Servicing Unit in the Ministry of Finance, and stressed that the Treasury should build up deposits in order to be ready to service the debt when payments fall due. In the particular case of the Fund, the staff urged the authorities to reconstitute their SDR holdings at the Fund on a regular basis and to keep them at a level sufficient to cover upcoming payments. Given the prospects of rapidly growing oil production and exports in the next few years, the authorities expressed interest in prefinancing operations, that is, contracting debt that would be guaranteed by future oil revenue. The mission cautioned them of the risks to government finances from such arrangements, which tend to involve ill-chosen projects with low rates of return and compromise the ability to make future debt service payments. It also stressed that the prospect of rising income gains on account of the exploitation of oil operations would likely fail to improve welfare levels on a lasting basis if squandered on consumption expenditure or poorly chosen investment projects; and that in no way did these prospects lessen the need for re-establishing appropriate fiscal policies. .Rather, borrowing should be undertaken in the context of a coherent and compre- hensive public investment program supported by donors, notably the World Bank. 1/ 4. Structural policies The staff reviewed with the authorities the measures that are being taken to accelerate structural reform, especially in the areas of public enterprises, foreign investment, rehabilitation of the cocoa sector, and i:he pricing mechanisms. I/ The World Bank has not been involved recently in reviewing the current public investment program owing in part to delays in agreeing on a work program with the authorities.

Even though an action plan had been draw" up under the ESAF arrangement, the authorities have not implemented it. In particular, no progress had been made in the privatization of public enterprises. The authorities explained that this was due inter alia to the lack of interest on the part of foreign investors. In order to revitalize the process, a" inventory of enterprises' assets had just been compiled, and the extent of the State's participation had been clarified. lJ The authorities hoped that this information would elicit investor interest, especially as regards three priority enterprises to be privatized. The staff urged the author- ities to initiate contact with investors in order to begin streamlining the public enterprise sector and to proceed with the liquidation of enterprises that were unproductive. I" general, the authorities needed to reduce their participation in the economy in order to allow the private sector to play its role and raise efficiency. In this context, the staff advised the authorities to make sure that price setting by the public enterprises kept these enterprises on a sound financial footing. The authorities recognized that, in order to attract foreign invest- ment, they needed a transparent legal framework that guaranteed private property rights. Accordingly, they intend to contact donors to help them review the relevant laws, taking into account the initiatives now under way at the regional level to harmonize business, insurance, and social security legislation. The staff encouraged the authorities to initiate these contacts without delay, so that the private sector could expand into new areas that would help in the diversification of Equatorial Guinea's economy. The current slump in donor support has significantly slowed the restructuring of the agricultural sector. In particular, delays in receiving STABEX funds have led to a shortage of inputs for the cocoa sector. As a result, some farmers have abandoned their cocoa plantations eve" though cocoa producer prices were increased by 70 percent for the 1994/95 crop year, that is, double the inflation during 1994. While taking note of these problems, the staff felt that the exit of marginal producers was a positive development. In that context, it encouraged the authorities to accelerate the redistribution of land for cultivation of crops other than cocoa ( with the aim of diversifying agricultural production and increasing yields. The staff urged the authorities to work with donors in rehabili- tating the agricultural sector. Equatorial Guinea has no price controls other than on the services provided by the state monopolies. Public utilities, however, as well as the fuel distribution enterprise (GE-TOTAL), are ensuring that tariffs fully cover costs. GE-TOTAL has been providing the authorities with documented import prices in the context of the simplified petroleum products price structure adopted in 1994. The electricity company (SEGESA) has recently 1/ The inventory covers 29 enterprises, of which six are wholly state owned.

The mission encouraged the authorities to ensure the early completion of SEGESA's project, so that the company would be in a position to ensure full cost recovery and remain financially sound. 5. Social and environmental issues The authorities' plan for alleviating poverty includes job creation and the maintenance of social expenditures in real terms. The staff urged the authorities to adhere to their targets for these expenditures in 1995 and beyond. The authorities also were eager to create the conditions that would allow a resumption of disbursements under the poverty alleviation project financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB). 1/ The staff encouraged the authorities to work with donors on the country's environmental action plan, which focuses on strengthening the overall management of forestry re.sources and preventing air pollution. In particular, excess logging along the coast has the potential for increased land erosion, while the flaring of unutilized natural gas from the exploitation of petroleum contributes to air pollution. IV. Staff Aopraisal Equatorial Guinea's financial performance during the first two years of the ESAF arrangement was disappointing. The economy has responded generally well to the devaluation. with a strong increase in timber exports and a reduction of absorption; and these improvements have received a further boost from rising oil output and exports. But domestic financial policies have left much to be desired. The fiscal stance in particular remained very expansionary during 1994 and the first half of 1995, contributing to a much- larger-than-programmed increase in net domestic bank credit and a sizable accumulation of external payments arrears. As a result, both the first-year and the second-year programs supported by the ESAF arrangements approved in February 1993 and May 1994, respectively, went off track soon after approval of these arrangements by the Executive Board. The deterioration in fiscal performance was all the more disturbing in that it took place against the announced intention of the authorities to undertake strong corrective action following the slippage during the first half of 1994. Yet collections of government domestic revenue fell by 4 percentage points of GDP in 1994 and are expected to decline further in 1995. Fiscal control has continued to deteriorate, notably regarding extrabudgetary and compensation operations, and noninterest domestically financed expenditure during 1994 was virtually unchanged from original plans despite plummeting revenue. 1/ The project is on hold, pending the settlement of arrears to that institution. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 The staff is concerned that prospects of rising oil production and exports may have further weakened Equatorial Guinea's effort to pursue appropriate fiscal policies, to ensure transparency and accountability in public sector financial management, and to push ahead with the needed structural reforms. In the view of the staff, absolute priority must be given during the remainder of 1995 and in 1996 to tightening fiscal management. Control needs to be re-established over the collection of import taxes, the tax base restored to its historical level, and expenditure targets should be set consistent with prospective revenue collections. A treasury cash flow plan must be put into place as a matter of urgency, compensation operations must cease, and control over expenditure author- izations must revert to the Ministry of Finance in order to help prevent abuses and arbitrary spending decisions. According to current projections, the wage bill in 1995 will be 47 percent higher than in 1993, a development that the staff sees as inconsistent with the preservation of competitiveness and a return to fiscal viability. Measures to improve fiscal management should therefore be complemented by rapid civil service retrenchment and p-ablic enterprise reform. Only then could Equatorial Guinea hope to marshal1 sufficient external support to clear the financing gaps that are likely to emerge at least until 2001. The authorities should not delay corrective action and, in the light of their discussions with the staff, they should reassess the policies that would be needed to bring about the required adjustment. The seriousness of the debt situation, and the dependence of Equatorial Guinea on a resumption of donor support. makes it the more urgent for the authorities to regularize external payments relations, especially to multi- lateral institutions, by eliminating outstanding arrears and servicing the debt as it falls due. The impact of these obligations on the fiscal posi- tion underscores the need for renewed efforts on the part of Equatorial Guinea in the area of financial management and governance, in order to allow an early resumption of donor support. In addition, the bilateral agreements resulting from the December 1994 terms of reference rescheduling under Paris Club auspices should be concluded as a matter of priority and fully observed. Equatorial Guinea's external position is likely to improve signif- icantly over the medium term if the increase in oil production materializes as expected and provided forceful policy reforms are implemented. While the increase in oil production, if properly harnessed, would help relax the financing constraints over the medium term, the overall fiscal position would remain weak and the authorities will need to restore fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability. It would be incumbent on the Government to create the conditions under which an important income gain can be translated into improved welfare for the population at large. Accordingly, the staff would caution the authorities against borrowing secured by future oil revenue, which would mortgage future revenue and complicate the task of macroeconomic stabilization and progress toward sustainable growth. Rather, borrowing should be undertaken in the context of a coherent and compre- hensive public investment program supported by donors, notably the World Bank.

A basic constraint has been the Government's limited capability in assembling and maintaining a consistent data base. In order to overcome this bottleneck, technical assistance would be needed, notably regarding the consumer price index, to update weights and coverage; the balance of payments, to ensure regular and consistent compi- lation; and the monetary sector, where doubt exists concerning the quality of money supply data, and where analysis and monitoring need to be improved. In this context, the authorities need to ensure that technical assistance obtained will be employed efficiently. With respect to the fiscal sector, the authorities need to restore discipline to the expenditure decisions, which also involves fully integrating all government transactions into the budget and thereby improving its coverage. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea be held on the standard H-month cycle.

A project to assist the primary education subsector was signed in June 1987 for SDR 4.1 million to expand and improve physical facilities in rural areas, provide instructional materials. and strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education. A crop diversification and agricultural services project for SDR 4.5 million was approved by the Board on October 30, 1990, and became effective in July 1991, focusing on marketing, extension, applied research, and institutional development. In November 1994. the project was closed and the credit balance of approximately USS2.5 million equivalent was canceled. A Health Improvement Project for SDR 3.9 million was approved in March 1992 to strengthen basic health services, focusing on improving human and financial resources use and combating endemic diseases. In June 1992, a second Petroleum Technical Assistance Credit of SDR 1.8 million was approved to define the most efficient methods for developing the Alba oil field, especially to monitor exploration activities and the optimal use of gas at the Alba field, reorganising the energy sector, and assessing the environmental impact of production. As part of this project, the authorities redesigned their pricing structure for petroleum products.

Technical assistance efforts have resulted in some progress, although consolidation of these gains continues to elude the authorities. Urgent attention needs to be given to lasting improvements in the quality and availability of statistics. a. Real sector and prices Real sector and price data suffer from significant weaknesses and are complicated by poor centralisation of information from the island and continental regions. GDP at factor cost by productive sector, although supplied at current and constant prices, contains significant inconsis- tencies. Sectors1 deflators and GDP by category of expenditure must be estimated by missions. The compilation of the official consumer price index has benefited from French technical assistance, but increasing lags in its production, stemming in large part to data delays from the mainland, are a source of concern. b. Government finance The assistance of French technicians has resulted in some improvement in fiscal accounting, such as the availability of monthly data and the recording of expenditures on a commitment basis. Significant improvements still need to be made, particularly in procuring timely and accurate data from the Debt Service Unit (Caja Autonoma de la Deuda Publics). Regarding budget coverage and implementation. serious efforts need to be made to eliminate compensation operations, incorporate off-budget expenditure, and record foreign-financed capital outlays. In the context of technical assistance, attention should be paid to ensuring that Equatorial Guinean officials are actively trained to carry out these responsibilities. The authorities have never reported GFS data to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics or the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. c. Monetarv accounts Although coverage of monetary statistics for Equatorial Guinea is adequate, some doubts have arisen regarding their quality, especially as regards the money supply. Data are available DR a monthly basis, but production lags of varying lengths occur both at the BEAC's National Directorate in Malabo and at its headquarters in Cameroon. There is insufficient analysis of the data by the authorities, thereby reducing the scope for monitoring developments and taking corrective action. The authorities should develop an analysis unit, if necessary with foreign technical assistance, that regularly and frequently interprets monetary sector developments. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 35 - APPENDIX III d. External debt Data on the outstanding stock of external debt and projections of debt service are hampered by serious inconsistencies. The debt service paid, reported by the Debt Service Unit, is often significantly different from that reported by the budget, as the Debt Service Unit usually lacks precise information on payments made. Also, details regarding scheduled debt service obligations are not incorporated into the budget in a systematic and timely manner. Debt service projections beyond the next calendar year are only provided in a highly aggregated form. Finally, debt service of certain credits takes place outside the Debt Service Unit. e. Balance of tmvments Though the BFAC produces balance of payments data for Equatorial Guinea, delays are long and the data suffer from significant inconsistencies with other sources. No staff is assigned to compile statistics on a regular and consistent basis, nor to cross-check information between sectors. Sub- sequent to assigning staff for compiling these data on a regular basis, the authorities may envisage requesting technical assistance in order to improve balance of payments statistics.

In addition, the impact on the country's debt service capacity of the expected significant increase in oil production is far from clear. u Equatorial Guinea's debt service ratio before debt relief fell from e peak of 56 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services in 1991 to 34 percent in 1994, reflecting the coming on stream of oil exports during that period (Table 2). The stock of debt (including the Fund) amounted to 371 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services in 1994, while the present value of the debt amounted to 290 percent, reflecting a grant element of 21 percent (Appendix IV, Table 1). The present value of the debt would decline further in future years, given the export projections (see below). At end-1994, ?.c.me 47 percent of the total debt outstanding was owed to multilateral creditors (of which 3 percent in arrears), 34 percent to Paris Club creditors (of which 13 percent in arrears), and 18 percent to non-Paris Club official creditors (of which 8 percent in arrears) (Table 11). In terms of GDP, debt to multilateral creditors amounted to 96 percent, with total outstanding debt amounting to 203 percent. Nonres- chedulable arrears at end-1994 were equal to some 6 percent of GDP and 35 percent of government domestic revenue u estimated for 1995. 2/ In assessing debt sustainability in Equatorial Guinea, the staff developed a medium-term balance of payments scenario based on current policies--that is, without sufficient corrective measures--which points to residual financing gaps through 2001 (Appendix IV, Table 2). No debt relief or debt restructuring has been assumed in the projections; the financing gaps could be filled by debt relief and/or further exceptional financing. &/ The scenario is based on a real GDP growth rate averaging 15 percent per annum during the three-year period 1996-98, driven by strong gains in the oil sector, and reflecting the impact of the devaluation on the forestry sector as well as increased world demand; the growth is projected to decelerate to 4b percent per annum during the period 1999-2006: Produc- tion in the oil sector is projected to initially increase rapidly, with growth averaging 53 percent during the period 1996-98, and to decline to an average growth rate of 5ti percent during the period 1999-2006. Consistent with the above, non-oil exports and imports are projected to grow by an 1/ The staff has assumed that oil revenue will continue to accrue to the budget at the current rate of 10 percent of exports, and that the remaining production will be used by the private oil companies to amortize their investment for the development and exploitation of the oil fields. 2/ Including oil revenue but excluding project-related grants (no nonproject grants have been assumed). I/ Arrears amounting to some US$53 million (38 percent of GDP) were rescheduled under the terms of the December 1994 Paris Club agreement (assuming comparable treatment from non-Paris Club bilateral creditors). &/ After a track record of adjustment has been re-established, the staff will update this analysis, and, if appropriate, will make a detailed assessment of the effect of a stock-of-debt operation on Naples terms, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicAPPENDIX IV average 4 percent during the period 1996-2006; project-related official transfers (and loans) are also expected to increase by 4 percent per annum during this period. Under this baseline scenario, the current account after grants would be in surplus after 1996, while the overall balance of payments would be in surplus after 1999. In the context of this medium-term scenario, projected debt service ratios improve significantly over the next ten years. The debt service ratio before debt relief (including to the Fund) is projected to decline from 25 percent of exports 1/ in 1995 to 6 percent in 2006. This primar- ily reflects the projected growth in oil exports, a drop-off in scheduled amortization resulting from the 1985 Paris Club rescheduling, the relatively low level of new disbursements assumed in the scenario, and the growing degree of concessionality of Equatorial Guinea's debt as multilateral debt is projected to increase relative to bilateral debt. In terms of government domestic revenue, the debt service ratio is envisaged to decline from 93 percent in 1995 to 32 percent in 2006. Debt service to multilateral creditors, however, is projected to decline more moderately, from 22 percent of government domestic revenue in 1995 to 18 percent in the year 2000; in U.S. dollar terms, the annual payments are projected to increase from an average of US$6 million in 1995-96 to an average of US$8 million in 1997- 2000 (Appendix IV, Table 3). Two alternative scenarios investigated the sensitivity of the above analysis to lower oil exports and lower inflows of project grants and loans. A reduction in the value of oil exports by 10 percent in each year relative to the baseline scenario does not yield markedly different results, as oil exports would still increase at a rapid pace. The current account surpluses during 1997.2006 would be about 27 percent of GDP, some 4 percentage points of GDP lower than in the baseline scenario. The overall balance of payments would record a small deficit for virtually the whole period under review. The debt service ratios would be marginally higher than in the baseline scenario, and the residual financing gaps would increase by some USS1.5 million per annum over the baseline scenario gaps. A shortfall in project grants and loans of 10 percent in each year relative to the baseline scenario would have almost no impact on the overall balance of payments, as imports and project-related services would be reduced pari passu. However, given the low level to which donor support has fallen since 1993, such a shortfall would represent a constraint on economic growth. This further highlights the urgency of re-establishing normal rela- tions with donors, which should include the regularization of external payment relations. In the absence of a strengthening in financial management, the risk exists that the authorities resort to prefinancing operations, that is, contracting debt that would be guaranteed by future oil revenue. Since such action would reallocate future oil resources to finance current expenditures that are not contemplated in the staff's baseline scenario, the resulting higher debt service burden in the outer years would increase the projected financing gaps. Such prefinancing operations would most likely entail I/ Exports of goods and nonfactor services.

Equatorial Guinea's obligations to the Fund will peak in 1998 at SDR 2.4 million, from SDR 1 million in 1995, and remain near that level until 2002; repayments are scheduled to be completed in 2004 (Appendix IV, Table 4). In percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services, obliga- tions to the Fund will peak at 2 percent in 1997-98, while in terms of government domestic revenue they will peak at 10 percent in the same years.
