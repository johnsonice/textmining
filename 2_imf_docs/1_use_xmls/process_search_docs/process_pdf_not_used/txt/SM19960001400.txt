Edo January 23, 1996 Discussions for the 1995 Article IV consultation with Switzerland were held in Bern, Zurich, and Lausanne during November 17 to 27, 1995. The staff team met with Mr. Villiger, Minister of Finance and then also President of the Swiss Confederation; Mr. Delamuraz, Minister of the Economy; Mr. Zwahlen, member of the Board of the Swiss National Bank; senior officials of the federal administration, the National Bank and the canton of Bern; and representatives of research institutes and the NGOs. h/ Messrs. Kaeser and Cippa, Executive Director and Advisor, respectively, for Switzerland, participated in the discussions. Switzerland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. At the conclusion of the previous consultation with Switzerland on January 29, 1995, Executive Directors welcomed the serious effort that the authorities had undertaken to consolidate the public finances. They noted with satisfaction that the rate of inflation, which had surged in the early 1990s in response to an unintended relaxation of monetary policy, had been brought under control. Directors encouraged the authorities to tackle the widespread economic distortions afflicting Swiss markets in order to improve prospects for sustained growth and job creation over the medium term. I. Background After a prolonged but rather shallow recession, the Swiss economy began growing again in mid-1993. The recovery has been unusually weak, however, and, in contrast to the sanguine expectations shared by the authorities and ,the staff a year ago, it has tended to lose rather than gain momentum during 1995 (Chart 1). An important reason for this has been a further substantial (7 percent) real effective appreciation of the Swiss franc over the past year (Chart 2), which has dampened the expansionary impulses stemming from foreign demand, depressed activity in the tourism sector, and encouraged producers to switch from domestic to foreign suppliers of intermediate inputs. Thus, although exports of goods have increased at a satisfactory u The staff team (all EUl) included Messrs. Vittas (Head), Huybrechts, Lund, and Thimann (EP), and Ms. Rodic (Assistant).

At first sight, domestic demand has expanded at a rate comparable to that in previous cyclical upturns. However, much of this growth has been accounted for by buoyant investment in machinery and equipment, which is import-intensive and has reflected attempts by firms to rationalize (rather than expand) capacity. Excluding such investment, domestic demand has remained subdued, due in part to the impact of fiscal consolidation. In particular, consumer spending has been held back both by weak growth in nominal wage earnings and by increased taxes and contributions to the unemployment fund. At the same time, an excess supply of commercial properties has discouraged investment in construction. All in all, real GDP is unlikely to have grown by more than 1 percent in 1995, compared with 1.2 percent in 1994, and the sizable output gap which had emerged during the recession has increased further (to an estimated 3 percent in 1995). Notwithstanding the weakness of the recovery, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of over 5 percent in early 1994 to about 4 percent by late 1995 (Chart 3). This fall, however, has reflected mainly the withdrawal from the labor force of people whose entitlement to benefit has expired. Employment has barely stabilized during 1995, after having shrunk noticeably during the preceding 3 years. In the meantime, the headline rate of inflation (CPI) has accelerated from just under 1 percent in 1994 to about 2 percent during 1995. However, the acceleration has been considerably less pronounced than expected on account of the introduction in January 1995 of a 6% percent value-added tax. u Import prices have been on a downward trend, while the increase in wage earnings (at about 1% per- cent) has remained moderate, belying concerns that the rise in indirect taxation might ignite a wage-price spiral. Despite the sizable losses in market shares which Swiss producers experienced, both at home and abroad, as a result of the appreciation of the franc, and a steep fall in the surplus of tourism, the external current account surplus has narrowed only a little. At some 6% percent of GDP in 1995, it has remained exceptionally large by both international and historical standards. The terms of trade (especially for services) have continued to improve (Chart 4) and Switzerland's huge net investment income from abroad has risen during 1995, following a slight fall in 1994. Monetary policy has continued to be guided by the setting of multi-year targets for the growth of the monetary base. These targets, which now apply to the S-year period to the last quarter of 1999, are chosen so as to be consistent with virtual price stability over the medium term and envisage growth in the monetary base at an average annual rate of 1 percent. In practice, the policy approach has been quite eclectic. For most of the period to the end of 1994, the authorities maintained a somewhat restrictive u The VAT replaced a turnover tax. This change was estimated to raise the CPI during 1995 by about 1% percent.

Thus, despite substantial undershooting of the targeted monetary path and firming of the exchange rate, short-term interest rates during 1994 were held broadly constant (Chart 5). However, during 1995 the monetary stance was eased progressively as it became clear that inflation remained under control, while concerns about economic activity and competitiveness mounted. Consequently, money market interest rates were allowed to fall from about 4 percent in 1994 to below 2 percent by late 1995. Bond yields also declined during 1995, rather more steeply than in other major European financial markets. In response to the fall in interest rates, the growth of the broader monetary aggregates revived gradually during 1995 but the monetary base did not display any clear trend and remained well below its targeted path (Chart 6). The deteriorating trend in the public finances, which was particularly pronounced in the early 199Os, was broken decisively in 1994 when both the federal cash deficit and the general government net borrowing requirement fell by about 1 percentage point to 1.4 percent and 3 percent of GDP, respectively. Despite the unexpected weakening of growth, both the federal and the local authorities are likely to have met their fiscal targets in 1995, with the general government deficit falling further to an estimated 2% percent of GDP. However, the public debt continued to rise in 1995, reaching nearly SO percent of GDP, compared with 32 percent of GDP only five years ago (Chart 7). As for some other industrial countries, short-term projections of economic growth have been revised down repeatedly in recent months, but the revisions have been especially steep for Switzerland in reflection of the large unanticipated appreciation of the currency in 1995. IJ Even so, both the authorities and the staff forecast real GDP growth to accelerate somewhat in 1996 to about 121 percent. The acceleration is predicated in part on the assumption that the mid-1995 pause in economic growth in important trade partners will prove short-lived. In addition, it is expected that the recent easing of monetary conditions, in conjunction with the projected more favorable evolution of real disposable income, will contribute to a gradual recovery in consumer spending and residential investment. However, with growth still below potential (1% percent), little, if any, improvement in labor market conditions is likely in 1996. With the output gap remaining large and import prices not yet fully adjusted to the increase in the value of the franc, inflation is expected to fall, perhaps to below 1 percent, once the effect of the VAT is absorbed, while the current account surplus is projected to decline slightly to about 6% percent of GDP. The forecasts remain subject to downside risks. The resumption of growth abroad may prove less vigorous than has been assumed; lJ For instance, the so-called "consensus" forecast for economic growth in 1996 has been revised down from 2.7 percent in February 1995 to 1.7 per- cent in December 1995.

On the other hand, there are also some upside risks. In particular, part of the recent appreciation of the franc may be reversed if markets come to share the authorities' view that it has gone beyond what is warranted by underlying fundamentals. The staff currently projects economic growth to accelerate further in 1997 and beyond but would not expect the output gap to be closed until the end of the decade. On this basis, there would be little risk of a rekindling of inflation which is projected to average 1 percent per year. The external current account surplus is expected to shrink further, mainly in response to the lagged effects of past losses in competitiveness, before stabilizing at about 4 percent of GDP. However, these projections depend critically on the technical assumption of an unchanged real exchange rate, and are therefore subject to similar risks and uncertainties as are the short-term forecasts. II. Report on the Discussions The discussions focused mainly on the causes and implications of the steep appreciation of the Swiss franc and on the policies that could be followed to either contain it to manageable proportions or counterbalance its impact on economic activity. In addition, the progress the authorities were making in consolidating the public finances and in implementing their program of revitalizing the economy was reviewed. In general, the staff agreed with the authorities that, while the Swiss economy was going through a difficult period due to the exchange rate shock and the legacy of past policy slippages (notably in the fiscal area), the outlook was not so bleak as to call for short-termism in economic policy with likely detrimental effects on medium-term economic performance. 1. Monetarv nolicv The authorities recalled that in 1994 they had intended to allow the monetary base (MO) to grow by more than 1 percent in order to narrow its gap relative to the targeted medium-term path. After rising fairly rapidly initially, the monetary base slowed down in mid-year as the strong appreciation of the franc led to lower inflation, and hence weaker money demand, than had been anticipated. Since accepting this inflation-induced slowdown in money demand would have risked pursuit of an excessively restrictive policy course, the authorities decided--albeit somewhat belatedly-- to take corrective action and allowed call money rates to ease toward the end of 1994. Nevertheless, for the year MO grew by only 0.6 percent. For the new target period, the authorities decided to set the starting point considerably above the level of MO at the end of 1994 and announced that they would aim, once again, to expand the monetary base during 1995 more rapidly than envisaged under the medium-term target (i.e., by 2 percent rather than 1 percent). In this way, they expected not only to accommodate the permanent one-shot increase in the price level associated Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 4a - CHART5 Switzerland Interest Rates 10- 10 9- -9 8- -C l- -1 6- -6 5- 4- 3- Z- LLI‘ 17. -.. ,- 1990 ~1 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 10 Long-term Interest Rates .?/ 10 9- ,‘.. - *- =---._____. 9 : -_.- ..; 8.::: ,---._ A-.-.__.._* ---.-__.* *. .__._____--------.~ 18 ,*--‘-.-.A** l- : ,A.,” -a.. ‘. -7 ,/’ =__--___ -. --.. 6- ‘. **._ ,a,- -0 . . *. --. ,* -6 _ n Switzerland 5- -- 4- Y5 4 - 37 1990 1991 1992 ~3 1993 1994 1995 4 nterest Rate Differentials (Gemnany - Switzerland) 4 3- -3 - -1 -2F 1990 1991 1992 J-2 1993 1994 1995 Sources: Swiss Institute for Business Cycle Research, Data tape.

The authorities added that the evolution of MO during the first three quarters of 1995 was largely in accord with their forecast, even though both inflation and real GDP growth turned out to be well below projections. In order to keep money growth above 1 percent, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) had to accept a sharp fall in interest rates. Thus, through its efforts to stick to its monetary target, the SNB had facilitated the fall in interest rates that was needed to soften the impact of the strong Swiss franc on the domestic economy. The staff agreed that, in contrast perhaps to 1994, monetary policy in 1995 had been conducted in a manner that was in keeping with the (built-in) countercyclical properties of the monetary targeting framework. It was, nevertheless, unclear whether the room for lowering interest rates, without jeopardizing long-term price stability, had already been fully utilized. In this context, the staff recognized that many of the conventional indicators of monetary conditions, such as the level of real short-term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, did not suggest that the policy stance was at present unduly restrictive. lJ On the other hand, the monetary base was still well below target and appeared recently to have stopped growing. Also, a monetary conditions index constructed by the staff indicated that the fall in interest rates so far had compensated only partially for the effects of the large real appreciation of the franc (Chart 8). The authorities concurred that it was still difficult to judge if domestic monetary conditions had been eased sufficiently, as the signals emitted by various indicators were rather mixed. On balance though, they were leaning to the view that there might be some room left for lowering interest rates further. Cognizant of the lags with which policy operates, officials considered it important to allow some additional time to assess the effects of the relaxation in policy already implemented. They indicated, however, that the SNB would not hesitate to cut interest rates further if early signs of renewed weakness in the evolution of MO were to be confirmed and other indicators continued to point to the absence of any inflationary risks and subdued economic activity. 2J The authorities reiterated their belief that medium-term monetary targeting was still a useful anchor for monetary policy and would remain so as long as there is no significant deterioration in the stability of the lJ A more detailed assessment of monetary conditions as well as of the monetary policy framework and of the exchange rate of the franc is provided in the accompanying Selected Background Issues paper. 2J Shortly after the conclusion of the discussions, the SNB announced that it would cut the discount rate by 0.5 percentage points (for the fourth time during 1995) to 1.5 percent as of December 15, 1995.

In particular, it served as a reminder that inflation was essentially a monetary phenomenon and that monetary policy affected output and prices with considerable lags. Nevertheless, since the behavior of MO was not entirely predictable, the National Bank continued to monitor several other indicators, including the broader aggregates and the exchange rate. It had also undertaken some exploratory work to assess whether a monetary conditions index could serve as an additional supplementary indicator. The authorities added that the SNB retained the option to deviate from its stability-oriented course if circumstances warranted it (e.g., in the event of extreme currency movements). They did not, however, view the alternative of targeting the exchange rate to be attractive for Switzerland mainly for three reasons. First, pegging the exchange rate would entail a loss of monetary independence. This could be costly in the event of shocks affecting the anchor currency and could increase the risk of speculative capital flows. Second, under an exchange rate peg, interest rates would have to adjust to international levels. In contrast to other European countries, this would imply for Switzerland an upward shift of the entire yield curve. 2J Third, there was the difficulty of fixing the exchange rate at an appropriate level. This was not a trivial task as the experience of some other European countries had demonstrated. The authorities also expressed reservations about explicit inflation targeting, even though achieving and maintaining price stability remains the primary goal of monetary policy. They saw targeting inflation more as a last resort when other policies had failed or were not feasible as a true alternative. They noted that, under an inflation target, central banks must have great trust in their forecasting abilities. In addition, since indicators usually do not point in the same direction, there is a risk that unpleasant warnings are dismissed and wishful thinking prevails. 2. The exchange rate and the balance of navments The Swiss franc rose during 1995 by an estimated 7 percent in real (CPI-adjusted) effective terms, bringing its cumulative real appreciation since mid-1992 to about 20 percent. As illustrated in Chart 9, this massive increase in the external value of the franc is still not quite as dramatic (in terms of either size or speed) as that experienced in 1977-78 when the authorities eventually decided to suspend monetary targeting and adopt temporarily an exchange rate rule. Moreover, in contrast to the 1977-78 lJ The Swiss National Bank reviews and updates frequently its estimates of the demand for MO and the other monetary aggregates. These estimates suggest that the slow growth of MO in 1994-95 was largely a reflection of weak economic growth and subdued inflation. However, the growing trend toward cashless payments may also have played a role. 2J In this respect, however, it may be noted that the negative differential between Swiss and foreign interest rates was at least as large during the Bretton Woods era as it is today.

While not denying that the large persistent current account surplus was contributing to the strength of the currency, the authorities believed that most of the appreciation could be ascribed to recurrent capital inflows attracted to Switzerland by safe-haven considerations. In support of this view, they noted that the rise in the value of the franc had occurred mainly in spurts concentrated during periods of instability in international currency markets (and tended at times to be reversed, albeit only partially, when stability was restored). The authorities considered the franc to be clearly overvalued at present, noting that its real effective exchange rate was lying well above its gently upward-sloping long-term trend line (Chart 10). The staff was somewhat more agnostic on this issue. It observed that even when the effects of the recent appreciation had been fully absorbed and the output gap had been fully eliminated, the external current account surplus (at a projected 4 percent of GDP) would probably remain sufficiently high to sustain, if not raise further, Switzerland's extremely comfortable net foreign asset position. u Nevertheless, the staff shared the view that the speed with which the exchange rate had risen was cause for concern as it risked aborting the incipient economic recovery and, in the short run, overstretched the economy's capacity to switch resources out of the tradables sector. The staff recognized in this regard that the ongoing relaxation of monetary conditions might help to discourage capital inflows and thus to moderate the exchange rate appreciation. It wondered, however, whether the time might not be opportune to also reconsider the justification for maintaining distortionary policies that discouraged consumption and imports (thereby swelling the current account surplus), or that constrained the ability of financial institutions to acquire assets abroad and/or attracted funds from the rest of the world (thereby adding to the overall strength of the balance of payments). The authorities noted that there were indeed some restrictions on the portfolio choices of pension funds but these were maintained for prudential reasons and were not in any case binding. Similarly, capital adequacy requirements had until recently discriminated against some types of foreign lending (e.g., mortgage financing) by domestic banks but the discrimination, which was meant to reflect the comparatively high risk associated with such lending, was unlikely to have had much of an impact on capital flows. In any case, it had been discontinued in early 1995. The authorities saw more merit in relaxing policies that tended to restrain consumption, even though the potential benefits in terms of lowering the current account surplus 1/ At an estimated 106 percent of GDP in 1993, the net foreign asset ratio was nearly 7 times as high as that of Japan and 8 times larger than that of Germany.

They were hopeful in this context that recent legislative initiatives to increase competition in domestic markets and to liberalize technical barriers to trade, as well as the reduction of protectionist policies in agriculture, would in time produce significant results. They also agreed that there was a case for re- examining whether it was still desirable to maintain generous tax incentives for noncontractual saving, even though they entertained some doubts as to whether these incentives had much of an impact in raising the overall level of national saving. IJ Finally, officials hoped that the implementation of the new tougher legislation against money laundering would deter unwanted capital inflows. They added that there were no plans to revise current legal provisions concerning tax evasion (which is not a criminal offense in Switzerland) although in the framework of double taxation agreements there was increased cooperation with the tax authorities of other countries to combat this practice. 3. Fiscal policy The authorities were pleased with the improvement in the public finances that had taken place in 1995, noting that it was likely to prove more pronounced than envisaged when the 1995 budgets were introduced. While quasi-cyclical factors, such as the fall in unemployment and the decline in interest rates, had been helpful, efforts by governments to achieve lasting reductions in expenditure programs had also proved more successful than expected. In addition, revenues from the switch-over to VAT had turned out to be significantly higher than estimated. Officials observed that the federal budget for 1996 targets a further reduction in the federal cash deficit. They agreed with the staff, however, that this reduction would come about mainly as a result of incidental factors (including the buoyancy of income tax revenue in even years and loan repayments by the unemployment insurance fund) and that, on a structural basis, the deficit would probably widen in 1996. Moreover, the budgeted deficit significantly understated the true imbalance in the federal finances because the cash surplus of the civil servants' occupational pension fund was improperly treated as government revenue, while interest-free loans granted to the federal railways were not included on the expenditure side even though they had little chance of being repaid. On proper accounting, the structural deficit was estimated to be as high as the budgeted deficit notwithstanding the persistence of a large output gap. The authorities also conceded that the budget was based on assumptions about growth and inflation that were likely to prove too high. They added, however, that the sensitivity of the budget to cyclical shortfalls in nominal GDP growth was low and tended to be partially offset by the effects on debt-interest payments of procyclical changes in interest rates.

Officials noted that, in contrast to the federal finances, the finances of the lower levels of government would show a further substantial structural improvement in 1996. Overall, the general government deficit was expected to remain unchanged, at about 2% percent of GDP, but the debt to GDP ratio would rise further. lJ Despite the undershooting of the deficit target in 1995, medium-term prospects for the federal finances have become less favorable than indicated in last year's staff report. One reason for this is the worsened outlook for economic growth. In addition, Parliament has rejected all the revenue measures that the government had proposed, under its so-called third Consolidation Program; these accounted for almost half of the adjustment it had aimed to achieve. Officials now projected that, on present policies, the federal budget deficit would reach some SW F 8% billion (2 percent of GDP) by 1999, including loan transfers to the railways and excluding any pension fund surpluses (Appendix III). The government's new target was to lower the deficit to about 1 percent of GDP by 1999. To this end, it intended to contain the average annual rate of increase in federal outlays over 1996-99 period to 2 percent. Although the new deficit target is somewhat less ambitious than the previous target of eliminating the structural deficit by 1998, it would be sufficient to halt the upward trend in the public debt ratio within the next few years. The staff agreed that stabilization of the debt ratio was desirable for demographic and other reasons, including the possibility that a tighter fiscal stance might help alleviate undue upward pressure on the exchange rate of the franc. However, in view of the absence of any financing constraints, the staff stressed that the means by which debt stabilization was achieved were probably more important than the precise timetable. The staff was also of the opinion that addressing the substantial structural weaknesses in expenditure and taxation policies deserved as much attention as meeting the consolidation objective. The authorities broadly concurred with these views. They stated that their intention was to achieve significant savings mainly through the pursuit of more efficient management policies and practices in the public l-J The decomposition of the general government deficit into its cyclical and structural components is complicated by various deficiencies in the availability of statistics on general government finances and by the fact that there exist long and irregular lags between tax accruals and collections. In addition, estimates of potential growth and the output gap are subject to large margins of uncertainty. Official estimates put the structural budget deficit in 1995 at 2.5 percent of GDP, almost entirely accounted for by the federal government.

Also, no increase in the tax burden was contemplated for the sake of reducing the deficit, However, the VAT rate was likely to be raised (by up to 1 percentage point) at some point in the future to finance prospective demographics-related deficits in the old-age pension scheme. Similarly, road-usage or fuel taxes would probably have to be increased to finance construction of one or two new tunnels in the Alps. As regards the structure of taxation, the authorities stressed that the recent switch from the turnover to a value-added tax constituted a major improvement. They readily accepted, however, that the tax system still displayed many antiquated features. For example, personal income tax was not collected at source, but was levied on a 2-year income basis, and was subject to significant (up to 3 years) collection lags. This tended to impart a procyclical bias in tax receipts and reduced the transparency of fiscal policy. Other weaknesses included: the high proportion (about 25 percent) of tax revenue still deriving from specific (as opposed to ad valorem) duties, which tended to depress revenue elasticity; the significant reliance on earmarked taxes, which constrained the room for maneuver; and the generosity of tax exemptions which eroded the tax base and, in combination with the absence of a capital gains tax, distorted saving- investment decisions. 2J Th e authorities said that significant tax reforms were not envisaged for the next few years, given that public opinion was not yet favorably inclined to such reforms and the Federal Council had to focus attention on consolidation. However, some cantons had begun to shift to an annual income tax cycle and the largest of them (Zurich) was planning to do so in the near future. This should facilitate reform at the federal level. Other reforms required further study and careful planning and would take longer to implement. 4. Structural policies and other issues The authorities noted that the legal steps needed to implement the first stage of their revitalization program had been successfully completed. In particular, legislation was passed during 1995 to strengthen the existing competition law; dismantle legal restrictions on sales and technical barriers to parallel imports; discourage the regional fragmentation of lJ The scope for, and potential benefits from, more efficient management practices in the public sector are a central theme of the last OECD Survey of the Swiss economy. 2J The subsidization of saving and investment implicit in these features of the tax system may have been warranted when Switzerland was experiencing chronic shortages of labor. It is somewhat doubtful if it is still justified now that unemployment has emerged as a serious policy concern and when a more flexible immigration policy may be needed to facilitate further economic integration with the EU.

In addition, provisions determining access to unemployment compensation were tightened in 1995 to strengthen work incentives, and steps were taken to improve prospects for the re-integration of the long-term unemployed. A broad aim of the reforms was to increase competition and efficiency in the domestic markets, in order to contain costs and avert the risk that export-oriented and import-competing industries might be forced to relocate production facilities abroad in order to survive in an increasingly competitive international environment. Officials said that it was still much too early to assess how well these reforms would work in practice but agreed with the staff that it was important to press for strict implementation and emphasized that it was the intention of the Federal Council to do so. They added that measures making up the second part of the revitalization program were at the top of the legislative agenda of the new Parliament (elected in October 1995). They encompass reforms aimed at increasing efficiency in the delivery of government services, the liberalization of market access in the infrastructural sector and the continuation of efforts in the education and research sphere intended to sustain Switzerland's comparatively good performance in innovation (which compensates for its relatively high cost structure). Switzerland joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) on July 1, 1995, and has adjusted its legislation accordingly. Officials acknowledged, however, that the level of agricultural protection will remain very high, even after implementation of the tariff cuts mandated by the Uruguay Round. They said that more ambitious reforms of agricultural policy will be pursued in the years ahead aimed at switching gradually from price supports to direct income support and promoting ecological objectives. The authorities also intended to take steps to alleviate the loss of preferences which developing countries experienced as a result of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreement. The authorities noted that negotiations on securing a closer economic relationship with the European Union were continuing. Although agreement in most areas had virtually been reached, the successful conclusion of the negotiations was not yet in sight as the gap between the two parties on the free movement of people and on road and rail transport remained large. Switzerland generally publishes timely and comprehensive economic statistics. However, there are also a number of significant deficiencies, as outlined in Appendix IV. The authorities said that efforts to address these problems were underway and expected that the most important gaps in statistics would be eliminated within the next few years.

Staff AoDraisal The Swiss economy is already in the third year of a cyclical recovery. However, largely because of the effects of the substantial appreciation of the Swiss franc, the recovery has not so far been strong enough to even stabilize, let alone reduce, the modest amount of slack inherited from the preceding recession. On a more positive note, inflation has been contained to very low levels, notwithstanding the substantial one-off effects of the new value-added tax, while the external position has continued to display its customary strength. Progress has also begun to be made toward redressing the public finances, although deficits remain sizable and the public debt ratio is still rising. The short-term economic outlook is also not very bright. Barring any new shocks, economic growth should gradually pick up some strength as the drag from the foreign balance wears off and as domestic demand benefits from lower interest rates and improved terms of trade. However, it may be a while before growth reaches a pace sufficient to narrow the output gap. Meanwhile, inflation should decline in 1996 and the external current account should continue to show a large surplus. Against this background, the authorities are confronted with the task of ensuring the sustainability of the still fragile economic recovery, while at the same time building on the progress recently made in strengthening the public finances and easing structural rigidities. Given the unfavorable debt dynamics, fiscal policy has little room for maneuver beyond allowing the automatic stabilizers to work. But these are frustratingly weak in the case of Switzerland. Thus, it is especially desirable for the monetary authorities to use all the leeway that may be available for relaxing domestic monetary conditions, without abandoning the medium-term orientation of policy and its primary focus on keeping inflation in check. The substantial relaxation of monetary policy that has already taken place is most welcome, as it has relieved to some extent excessive upward pressures on the Swiss franc and, more importantly, has provided a substantial counterweight to the contractionary effects of the appreciation of the currency. It is still not possible to tell with confidence whether the downward trend in interest rates has run its full course, as the various indicators of monetary conditions provide somewhat conflicting signals and as it will take some time for the effects of the recent policy actions on the monetary aggregates and the economy to become apparent. It will therefore be necessary for the authorities to continue to monitor developments closely and to stand ready to lower interest rates further if base money remains significantly below its medium-term targeted path on account of weak activity and subdued inflation,. or in the event of a renewed steep rise in the exchange rate of the franc. By the same token, however, a substantial reversal of exchange rate developments or overshooting of the monetary targets that would threaten to rekindle inflation would call for action to tighten domestic monetary conditions. Also, given the uncertainties about the stability of the demand for base money, the adequacy Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - of the monetary policy framework should be kept under review, although the case for a change appears at present to be neither strong nor pressing. The modest improvement in the public finances that took place in 1994-95 is commendable, especially since it was achieved under macroeconomic conditions that turned out to be much less propitious than expected. Further consolidation will need to remain a key objective of fiscal policy in the years ahead so as to arrest, and preferably reverse, the upward trend in the public debt ratio before the prospective aging of the population begins to put additional pressure on the public finances. However, the means by which this objective is pursued is of greater import than the rapidity of its achievement. In this regard, the authorities' intention to eschew increases in the tax burden and to rely mainly on more efficient public management policies in the broader public sector is appropriate. However, continued efforts to improve the targeting of social benefits are also desirable. Increased attention should also be given to the need to reform and modernize the tax system. The shift from the turnover to the value-added tax was an important step in this direction. Nevertheless, various other weaknesses remain, including the 2-year cycle and long collection lags of the federal income tax and the high share of revenue obtained from specific duties. Addressing such weaknesses will strengthen the tax base and enhance the effectiveness of fiscal policy as a macroeconomic policy tool. The scope for reducing tax expenditure, including the generous incentives for private saving, also deserves to be explored, mainly with a view to alleviating the macroeconomic distortions they give rise to. In other areas of structural policies, significant reforms have recently been adopted and others are in the process of being implemented. Examples include the initiatives to liberalize domestic markets, technical barriers to trade, and public procurement policies, the initiation of reforms that will lower the level of price support in the agricultural sector, and the new rules governing access to unemployment compensation. These reforms are welcome not only because they have the potential to enhance efficiency (which after all may not be a top priority in a country that already enjoys a comfortable standard of living). They are essential if the potentially large resource shifts necessitated by an appreciating currency (and the ongoing closer integration of the Swiss with the global economy) are to be accommodated with minimum disruption. It is therefore important to sustain the momentum of reforms, to broaden their scope to areas (such as the public enterprises) not yet affected, and to ensure that they are strictly adhered to in practice. The authorities are to be commended for their liberal trade policies, except in agriculture where protection is still very high, and for their intention to revise the generalized system of preferences in order to counter the erosion of preferences resulting from the Uruguay round. On the other hand, the fall of ODA in relation to GDP is regrettable. As one of the most prosperous countries in the world, Switzerland should aim to bring its ODA closer to the internationally agreed target.

A staff scenario is also provided. This is in line with the expenditure plans implicit in the authorities' consolidation scenario, but is somewhat more cautious on GDP growth (the average nominal GDP growth rate for 1996-99 is projected at 3.2 percent rather than 3.8 percent). The main features of the table can be summarized as follows. 0 In the absence of any new measures, the federal deficit would tend to increase over the medium term and the debt ratio would continue to rise fairly rapidly (by about 1 percentage point of GDP each year). 0 The authorities' consolidation plan would allow the deficit to fall slightly toward the end of the period under consideration. This would be sufficient to stabilize the debt ratio by 1999. l Under the staff scenario, the prospective reduction of the federal deficit would be lower than projected by the authorities and the debt ratio would continue to rise, albeit slowly. In interpreting this scenario, it should be kept in mind that federal debt constitutes only half of total government debt and that the debt ratio for the lower levels of government has already been stabilized and will probably decline in the years ahead.

However, there are also a number of significant deficiencies. In particular, data on international capital flows are available only on an annual basis, statistics on the general government accounts are incomplete-- internationally comparable data for general government net lending do not exist --and subject to long delays, and national accounts statistics on value added and capital formation by sector become available only intermittently, after a lag of.several years, and the sectoral breakdown is not in accordance with international standards. The authorities have taken steps to address these problems: - The Swiss National Bank (SNB) will probably be able to publish quarterly capital account statistics by the end of 1998. Financial resources for the project have been provided and the SNB has been given the legal power to conduct compulsory surveys among banks. The Fund's planned coordinated portfolio investment survey at the end of 1997 might provide useful additional information in this regard. - The Federal Statistical Office will publish at the end of 1996 national accounts statistics on value added and capital formation by sector (according to the European System of Accounts standards) for the years 1990 to 1994. However, for the general government the data will not be on an accrued basis but on a cash basis. This means, for example, that the data will not be corrected for the long lags in income taxation.
