Economic performance in 1994 In contrast to past experience, Gabon's performance under the stand-by arrangement for 1994 was broadly satisfactory, aided in part by higher- than-expected oil exports. The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has been supported by restrictive financial and incomes policies, and by the implementation of a number of tax, price, and structural reform measures. Accordingly, the program objectives for output growth, inflation, and the external current account balance were achieved or exceeded; all the performance criteria were met, and all purchases under the stand-by arrangement were effected. The structure of relative prices and economic incentives has improved markedly, but the supply response of the non-oil economy has been modest so far. 2. Medium-term obiectives and Dolicies The Gabonese authorities have been encouraged by the performance in 1994. They consider that it has set the stage for addressing in a compre- hensive fashion the constraints that continue to confront the economy in the context of a medium-term program, in support of which they are requesting a three-year extended arrangement from the Fund. These constraints include: * Heavy dependence on the exploitation of exhaustible natural resources in the oil, wood, and mining sectors, with the rest of the economy relying essentially on the redistributed surpluses from these sectors. * Limited diversification of the production and export base, which renders the economy fairly vulnerable to external shocks. * Heavy external public debt and debt service payments burden, due in part to unproductLve past borrowings. * Public finances characterized by heavy dependence on oil revenue and a large share of the civil service wage bill in total government expenditure, along with a resurfacing of concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of public resource use. * An inefflcient and overstaffed public enterprise sector. * Weak development of the non-oil sector, which remains impeded by inadequate economic infrastructure, limited access to bank credit, and legal and institutional rigidities. * Private investment that is significantly lower than domestic private savings. As a result, real GDP has stagnated since 1985, contributing to a sharp decline in total employment and a major increase in unemployment, to an estimated 17 percent of the labor force. Income distribution has also Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- iv - become highly skewed; despite Gabon's relatively high per capita income, its social indicators are poor. Concerns about the rising unemployment and the higher cost of living have become a focal point of the ongoing domestic political debate. Gabon's medium-term adjustment strategy aims at accelerating output and employment growth through a diversification of the economy and the estab- lishment of a more liberal regulatory framework to foster the development of the non-oil private sector. The main macroeconomic objectives for 1995-98 comprise a pickup in real GDP growth to about 3 percent a year, through a strong recovery of non-oil activity; a reduction in consumer price inflation from 36 percent in 1994 to 2 percent by 1998; and the containment of the overall balance of payments deficit, to attain a viable fiscal and balance of payments position by end-1998. To achieve these objectives, the authori- ties' medium-term program emphasizes the preservation of the improvement in the structure of relative prices and economic incentives through the pursuit of restrictive fiscal, incomes, and credit policies; higher primary surpluses in the government budget, so as to substantially reduce total public debt as a ratio to GDP; higher and more effective government spending on economic and social infrastructure; the restructuring or privatization of public enterprises, with a front-loaded program of reforms in key public utilities; and the acceleration of other structural and institutional reforms. The main policy priorities are to strengthen the transparency and effectiveness of government financial management, boost government revenue from the non-oil sector, and effectively implement public enterprise reforms. The balance of payments projections indicate sizable but gradually declining residual financing gaps during 1995-98, which are expected to be fully covered by additional reschedulings of debt service obligations on pre-cutoff-date debt by Paris Club and other official creditors. 3. Staff annraisal Gabon's medium-term program is comprehensive and deserving of the support of the Fund and other bilateral and multilateral creditors. The authorities, including those atithe highest level, reiterated their strong commitment to adjustment, which augurs well for the success of the program. However, in the staff's view, some risks remain: * In the context of a heavy election calendar in the period ahead (municipal elections are expected to be held in October 1995, followed by parliamentary elections in 1996, and presidential elections in 1998), social and political pressures might lead to a relaxation of wage restraint and employment policy in the civil service and delay the implementation of public enterprise reforms. A lasting solution of the unemployment problem hinges on the success of the efforts to improve the environment for the development of the non-oil private sector and on the withdrawal of the State from directly productive activities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public* The outlook for government revenue is subject to some uncertainty, as it depends to a large extent on factors beyond the authorities' control. * The projected strong increase in commercial bank deposits with the central bank, in the absence for the time being of an effective mechanism for liquidity absorption, poses the risk of an excessive expansion in private sector credit once credit demand picks up, and in turn of pressures on foreign reserves and/or prices and needs to be monitored closely. * Gabon's balance of payments outlook remains vulnerable to developments in oil exports and depends heavily on the strength of the supply response of non-oil exports to the new economic environment, and on the stance of financial policies.

Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Gabon, together with discussions on a program that could be supported by an extended arrangement, were held in Libreville during the period May 25-June 8, 1995. u On March 30, 1994, the Fund approved a 12-month stand-by arrangement for Gabon, in an amount equivalent to SDR 38.6 million (35 percent of quota), together with a purchase amounting to SDR 21.5 million (19.5 percent of quota) under the export element of the compensatory and contingency financing facility (CCFF) (EBS/94/57, 3/18/94). The second review under the stand-by arrange- ment (EBS/95/21, 2/23/95) was completed by the Executive Board on March 24, 1995. The Board was notified of the final calculation of the export shortfall in 1994 (EBS/95/118, 7/18/95), which indicated much higher exports than initially projected and a resulting need for Gabon to effect an early repurchase of the entire amount of the CCFF drawing; this repurchase is expected to be made by early August 1995. The World Bank has supported Gabon's adjustment efforts with a US$30 million economic recovery loan approved in June 1994. In the attached letter to the Managing Director, dated July 25, 1995, the Minister of Finance, Economy, Budget, and Participations of Gabon requests a three-year arrangement from the Fund under the extended fund facility (EFF), in an amount equivalent to SDR 110.3 million (100 percent of quota), in support of Gabon's adjustment program for the period July 1995- June 1998 (Appendix I). It is proposed that 40 percent of these resources be made available on a semiannual basis during the first year of the extended arrangement, with the rest divided equally between the second and third years of the arrangement. If all purchases under the extended arrangement are made as scheduled, Gabon's outstanding use of Fund credit will rise from SDR 70.5 million (63.9 percent of quota) 'at end-June 1995, to SDR 144.5 million (131.0 percent of quota) at end-March 1998 (Table 1, and Appendix II). u The Gabonese representatives included Mr. Doupamby Matoka, Minister of Finance, Economy, Budget, and Participations; Mr. Leyimangoye, National Director of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC); Mr. Mounguenou, Financial Advisor to the Minister of Finance; and other senior government officials concerned with financial matters. The mission head was received by President Bongo. The staff team included Mr. Hadjimichael (head), Mr. Kpodar, Mr. Toe, Mr. Crowley (all AFR), Mr. Fratzscher (EP-PDR), Mr. Magnier (EP-AFR), and Ms. Estevez (assistant-AFR). Mrs. Dyer Cisse and Mr. Ba of the Africa Region of the World Bank participated in most of the policy meetings. Mr. Barro Chambrier, Alternate Executive Director for Gabon, also participated in the discussions. The Managing Director and Mr. Calamitsis also visited Gabon on July 1, 1995 and Mr. Ouattara on July 17, 1995 for discussions with the authorities.

The last Article IV consultation with Gabon was concluded on March 30, 1994. On that occasion, Executive Directors welcomed the broaden- ing and strengthening of Gabon's adjustment strategy through the devaluation of the CFA franc, as it offered a unique opportunity to improve Gabon's growth prospects and external position over the medium term. To this end, Directors underscored the importance of rigorous implementation of appro- priately tight financial and incomes policies. Directors also considered it essential to accelerate structural reforms, especially in the context of a program that could be supported in due course by an extended arrangement. A similar recommendation was offered by Executive Directors at the completion of the second review under the stand-by arrangement. On the political front, the disputed presidential elections of December 1993, which were won by President Bongo, were followed by some civil unrest. This led to discussions among all political parties in Paris in September 1994 and to the formation in October 1994 of a transitional government, with the participation of members of the opposition, to prepare for new parliamentary elections. The,Paris accords have been incorporated into a new constitution, which was approved in a national referendum on July 23, 1995. Municipal elections are expected to be held in October 1995, followed by parliamentary elections in 1996 and presidential elections in 1998. Box 1. Gabox Data Situation Gabon's available economic and financial data are fairly comprehensive and of reasonably good quality for all sectors of the economy, and are published, along with historical series, by the authorities on a semiannual basis; more recent economic developments are normally described in a quarterly publication (for details, see Appendix V). Data reported to the Fund have invariably covered a broad range of variables beyond the “core* data needed for surveillance, and have been reasonably up to date. The main data weaknesses relate to (a) the coverage of fiscal data, with extrabudgetary transactions not consistently included in the central government operations, while data on the local authority operations are not available; (b) the coverage and reliability of domestic public debt data, (c) the comprehensiveness of the data on the balance of payments transactions of oil companies, and their consistency with the national accounts; and (d) the coverage of consumer price data, which are limited to the capital city. The authorities are committed to overcoming these wealcn~ses and reporting to the Fund on a monthly basis a broad range of economic data. c II. Recent Economic Performance In contrast to Gabon's past experience with arrangements from the Fund (see Box 2), performance under the 1994 stand-by arrangement was broadly satisfactory: the price increases that followed the devaluation were contained, while output growth and the turnaround in the external current account balance exceeded program targets; all performance criteria were met; Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - Box 2. Gabon: Bac@pmd Gabon is a small country in Central Africa with a population of about 1 million, which is rising by some 2.5 percent a year. It is a member of the BEAC and other regional organisations of the CFA franc zone. The sharp increase in world oil prices in the early 1970s and 1980s stimulated oil exploration and output, which rose from 5 million tons in 1970 to 17.2 million tons by 1994, (Chart 1) and turned Gabon into the richest country in continental sub-Saharan Africa, with a per capita GDP of US$3,770 in 1994. The oil sector accounted during this period for the bulk of export earnings and government revenue, and for an increasing share of GDP; by 1994, the oil sector accounted for 44 percent of GDP, 2 percent of total employment, 80 percent of export earnings, and 60 percent of government revenue. The non-oil sector comprises the traditional export sectors of wood products and, to a lesser extent, manganese and uranium; a small manufacturing sector geared to domestic needs and sheltered from foreign competition; and a large public sector. Oil revenue and heavy recourse to foreign borrowing accommodated an ambitious public investment program, a generous pay policy for civil servants and other public sector employees, and recurring extra- budgetary outlays. At the same time, the “oil syndrome” contributed to acute shortages of skilIed labor, wage increases in the private and public enterprise sectors that exceeded by far productivity gains, and a massive migration from rural to urban areas, as well as immigration from neighboring countries. The sharp declines in world oil prices during 1976-77 and 1986-87 caused major disrup- tions in economic activity and government spending, and contributed to a steep expansion in external public debt, from 1 percent of GDP in 1965 to 54 percent by 1993, and eventually to the emergence of large domestic and external government payments arrears. The adjustment of the Gabonese economy to the worsening external environment during 1985-93 was relatively modest, relying mainly on a deflationary strategy that led to a stagnation of total real GDP, despite a strong increase in oil output. The strategy entailed large cuts in government investment and a reduction in the budget deficit, and cuts in the savings and investment of the non-oil private sector, with only limited progress in lowering the high unit labor costs and the domestic cost structure in general; in fact, in the face of political and social unrest in 1990, sizable wage increases were granted to civil servants. On a cumulative basis, real GDP increased by only 0.7 percent between 1985 and 1993, while total employment declined by 24 percent (Chart 2). Gabon’s performance under two 18-month stand-by arrangements from the Fund in 1989 and 1991 was disappointing; in the face of policy slippages and a weakening in world oil prices, both programs went quickly off track shortly after the first purchases were made. Gabon was unable to adhere to the terms of the October 1991 Paris Club debt rescheduling agreement, and the agreement was finally canceled in September 1992. Combined with a major strengthening of the French franc (to which the CFA franc is pegged) vis-a-vis other major currencies, Gabon’s real effective exchange rate (based on relative consumer prices) declined by only 18 percent between 1985 and 1993, a change too modest to compensate for the losses in competitiveness brought about by the cumulative decline of 46 percent in the terms of trade during this period (Chart 3). In response to the growing recognition that the internal adjustment strategy had failed to bring about the needed correction in relative costs and prices, Gabon and the other members of the CFA franc zone decided in early January 1994 to devalue the CFA franc by 50 percent against the French franc.

In the structural area, however, the needed adjustments in utility charges and improvements in efficiency in four major public enterprises, envisaged under the program, were significantly delayed. lJ The devaluation of the CFA franc was supported by restrictive fiscal, incomes, and credit policies, and by the implementation of a number of tax, price, and structural reforms. Civil service wages were raised by 8.5 per- cent in 1994, but were kept unchanged in the 1995 budget; wage increases in the private sector in 1994 averaged about 15 percent. In the context of the reforms undertaken by the regional customs union (UDEAC), import tariffs were reduced sharply to a range of 5-30 percent; several tax exemptions were eliminated 2/; import quotas were abolished, except for sugar; and export taxes were eliminated, except for wood,*pl240Xmangaaeanium, and oil products (the taxes on wood and manganese exports were raised). However, to allevi- ae the impact of the adjustment measures on the most vulnerable groups, public utility tariffs were raised only modestly and with significant delays, while the taxes on petroleum products were reduced to keep domestic retail prices unchanged. As a result, consumer price inflation accelerated (on a 12-month basis) to 47 percent by end-1994, but fell back to 12 percent by May 1995 (Chart 4); consumer prices rose by only 4 percent during the first five months of 1995, notwithstanding significant increases in water, electricity, and air transportation tariffs, an upward adjustment of the retail prices of petroleum products, and the impact of the introduction of an 18 percent value-added tax (VAT) in April. On an annual average basis, consumer prices rose by 36 percent in 1994, only slightly higher than projected (Table 2). 3J The (CPI-based) real effective exchange rate declined by 23 percent between December 1993 and May 1995; the improvement in competi- tiveness is estimated to have been much higher in terms of relative unit labor costs. The short-term supply response to the improvement in the structure of relative prices and economic incentives has been very modest so far, with limited import substitution and non-oil export growth (other than wood). The decline in real household disposable incomes contributed to a contrac- tion in real domestic demand of 9 percent in 1994 (a substantially less lJ For more details on performance in 1994 see EBS/95/21 (2/23/95), paragraphs l-6 of the memorandum on economic and financial policies (Appendix I), and the forthcoming background paper accompanying this report.. 2J As a result of these adjustments, the average import tariff declined from 27.4 percent in 1993 to 19.2 percent in 1994. 3J The consumer price index covers only the capital city and tends to overstate price increase because of the heavy weight of tradable goods in this index. The deflators of private consumption and non-oil GDP are estimated to have risen by only 23 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in 1994.

Meanwhile, unemployment has remained high, at an estimated 17 percent of the labor force, and has become a major social and political concern. Fiscal performance in 1994 was broadly on track, as higher-than- expected oil revenue more than offset a shortfall in non-oil revenue, while expenditure was lower than budgeted. As a result, the primary budget surplus rose markedly from 1.3 percent of GDP in 1993 to 5.4 percent, or almost twice the program target; the overall budget deficit was reduced sharply from 5.7 percent of GDP to 1.8 percent, respectively (Chart 5, and Tables 3 and 4). With the return of confidence following the devaluation, the demand for money recovered strongly in 1994, exceeding earlier expectations, and prompting a significant repatriation of private capital. Broad money rose by 38 percent during 1994, after sizable declines in earlier years, and allowed for a major improvement in the net foreign assets position of the banking system (Chart 6, and Tables 5 and 6). In the face of an improved profit and liquidity position of the private sector and a contraction in industrial output, bank credit to the private sector declined modestly during 1994, but picked up strongly in early 1995. Following the contain- ment of inflationary pressures in the region, the BEAC lowered its intervention rates between January 1994 and early 1995, but raised them modestly by June 1995, so as to preserve appropriate differentials with interest rates in France. At their present levels, bank deposit and money market interest rates are still negative in real terms (deflated by the year-on-end inflation rate). The external current account balance shifted to a surplus equivalent to 7 percent of GDP in 1994, well above program expectations (Chart 7, and Tables 7 and 8). This reflected essentially a major decline in the volume of imports (11.5 percent), attributable mainly to the contraction in domestic demand and the price effects of the devaluation. In SDR terms, non-oil exports declined somewhat (because of lower world prices for manganese and uranium), but this was more than offset by a marked decrease in imports, service payments, and net transfers abroad. Capital outflows remained large, though in SDR terms lower than in 1993, notwithstanding higher short-term trade credits extended by oil companies. As a result, the overall balance of payments deficit declined sharply, and was financed I/ In 1994 oil production amounted to 17.2 million tons and oil export prices to USS15.1 per barrel, compared with 16.0 million tons and USS13.1 per barrel assumed under the program, and an outturn of 15.6 million tons and USS16.1 per barrel in 1993.

With the valuation effects of the devaluation, the outstanding stock of external public debt (excluding the IMF) more than doubled in local currency terms, rising to the equivalent of 86 percent of GDP by end-1994 (USS3.6 billion) (Table 9). The improvement in the external current account balance in 1994 was brought about by a strong increase, as a ratio to GDP, in savings by the oil sector (reflecting mainly windfall profits from the devaluation) and by the Government, which more than compensated for an increase in the aggregate investment ratio (Table 10). Predictably, though, the savings ratio of the non-oil private sector eased marginally because of a sharp contraction in the real disposable income of the household sector. III. Report on the Discussions and Medium-Term Program The policy discussions with the authorities focused on an assessment of the adjustment challenges that lay ahead and on the formulation of an appropriate reform strategy. The authorities were very encouraged by developments in 1994. They considered that the impact of the devaluation so far had been more positive than they had expected, but remained concerned with the increase in the external debt burden in domestic currency terms. Unemployment and the impact of price increases on living standards, in the aftermath of the devaluation and the introduction of the VAT, heavily dominated the political debate. Against this background, the authorities, including those at the highest level, have publicly declared their intention to maintain appropriate economic policies in the period ahead and to address in a comprehensive fashion the constraints that continue to confront the Gabonese economy, so as to boost output and employment growth and improve Gabon's living standards (see Box 3). This determination was reiterated on the occasion of the Managing Director's visit to Libreville. 1. Medium-term strategy Gabon's medium-term policy objectives are to accelerate output and employment growth through a diversification of the economy and the estab- lishment of a more liberal regulatory framework to stimulate the development of the non-oil private sector.

CIhnsGn~F~gtheEcoaomy * The Gabonese economy remains heavily dependent on the exploitation of exhaustible natural resources, namely oil and, to a lesser extent, wood, manganese, and uranium. The rest of the economy relies essentially on the redistributed surpluses from these sectors. * The limited diversification of the production and export base renders the economy fairly vulnerable to external shocks. * Gabon’s external debt burden continues to be high, in part because of unproductive past investments, while debt service payments due in the period ahead are large, particularly in relation to government revenue. * Public finances are characterized by a heavy dependence on oil revenue and a large share of the civil service wage bill in total outlays. * The public enterprise sector has tended to be inefficient and overstaffed. * The distribution of income is highly skewed and, despite Gabon's high per capita income compared with other subBaharan African countries, social indicators are poor. * There have been renewed concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of use of public resources, particularly at the central government level. Weaknesses in budgeting and expenditure control procedures have raised questions among the donor community and contributed to a shortfall in nonproject external assistance in 1994. Sizable extrabudgetary outlays prior to 1994 had contributed to the accumulation of large domestic government payments arrears, which, in tum,have affected adversely the business climate. * The development of the non-oil sector remains impeded by inadequate economic infrastructure, limited access to bank credit, and weaknesses or rigidities in the institutional and legal framework. * Domestic private savings continue to be fairly large, and, for lack of productive domestic opportunities, contribute to capital outflows. dependence of government revenue and exports on oil receipts. To this end, policies will be directed at (a) preserving the gains in the structure of relative prices and economic incentives brought about by the devaluation through restrictive fiscal, incomes, and credit policies; (b) raising the level and effectiveness of government spending on economic and social infrastructure; (c) restructuring or privatizing public enterprises; and (c) accelerating other structural and institutional reforms. The main policy priorities are to improve the management of public financial resources and strengthen fiscal performance, so as to attain a viable fiscal and external position by end-1998 (i.e., one that does not require excep- tional financing). Consistent with this strategy, the main macroeconomic objectives for 1995-98 are to achieve average real GDP growth of about Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - 3 percent a year, implying an acceleration in real non-oil GDP growth to almost 5 percent a year; to lower inflation to 2 percent by 1998; and to maintain external current account surpluses ranging from 3 percent to 4 percent of GDP (see Box 4 for a summary of the objectives and policies of the program). Potential output growth in the period ahead is constrained by the fact that oil production would, on current industry estimates of proven reserves, level off at about 17.4 million tons a year during 1995-98, although the ongoing oil exploration activities could lead to an expansion in oil production capacity before the end of the decade, thus placing the burden of adjustment on the non-oil sector. Given the existing cost rigidities and the limited entrepreneurial culture, diversification may take time to materialize, although significant potential for growth does exist in agriculture, fishing, wood processing, mining, and services. Gains in these areas are within reach, provided the private sector is encouraged to take the lead, in a clean break with the policies of the past. Effective implementation of the authorities' medium-term strategy should lead to a significant improvement, in relation to GDP, in government savings and the net financial balance, as well as to increased investment by the non-oil private sector. Gabon finds itself in the enviable position of being able to generate sizable domestic savings, projected to remain in the period ahead at the equivalent of more than one half of GDP; the challenge is to encourage the investment of a growing proportion of these savings domestically. 2. Government financial management Weak discipline and the lack of sufficient transparency and rigor j:n government financial management have been recurring concerns in recent years. A number of initiatives have been taken by the authorities since late 1994 to remedy these weaknesses, including the undertaking with donor assistance of a census of domestic government payments arrears; the plac.e- ment since January 1995 of all responsibility for committing government expenditure under the sole authority of the Minister of Finance; and the initiation in April 1995 of a public expenditure review, with World Bank assistance. At the request of the authorities and as part of the preparations for an EFF-supported program, a detailed review of budgetary procedures was also carried out in April 1995 by a Fund technical assistance mission. The mission found limited discipline in government financial management, with some revenue not recorded in the budget, difficulties in controlling the level and composition of expenditure, and extrabudgetary spending. The existing legal framework governing budgetary procedures was found to be broadly satisfactory, but in practice not consistently adhered to. The authorities agreed to effectively implement the recommendations of the technical assistance mission. In fact, four of the principal recommenda- tions were implemented in June and early July 1995 as prior actions for management approval of Gabon's letter of intent.

The staff stressed the importance of adhering not only to the letter, but also to the spirit of these recommenda- tions, so as to improve the quality and transparency of financial management on a lasting basis. Government domestic payments arrears were lowered by CFAF 89 billion (4 percent of GDP) in 1994, exceeding substantially the initial program target, aided in part by nonproject external assistance. Nonetheless, the outstanding stock of arrears to domestic suppliers at end-1994 remained very large. It was estimated provisionally at CFAF 217 billion, or 10 percent of GDP, although subject to some uncertainty about its exact magnitude. The authorities have taken measures to limit government outlays to available resources and thus avoid the emergence of any new arrears, and a more definitive audit/verification of outstanding arrears will be completed by end-December 1995. Given the amounts involved, the program provides for the gradual elimination of domestic government arrears during the period to 1998, in line with available domestic and external exceptional resources; the repayment schedule, however, would be accelerated through utilizatioln of part of any privatization proceeds, and higher-than-programmed inflows of nonproject aid and government oil revenue. 3. Fiscal uolicv Attainment of a sustainable fiscal position is a prerequisite for achieving, as targeted under the program, a viable external position by 1998. Accordingly, the program seeks to raise the primary surplus further, from 5.4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 9.5 percent by 1998, so as to lower substantially total public debt, from the equivalent of 120 percent of GDP in 1994 to 87 percent by 1998. This should facilitate a turnaround in the overall budget balance from a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of more than 3 percent by 1998. These objectives are to be achieved through an increase in government revenue, from 25 percent of GDP to almost 28 percent, and a reduction in government expenditure, from more than 27 percent of GDP to less than 25 percent, respectively. Within these limits, fiscal policy will aim at supporting economic growth through the removal of tax distortions and a reallocation of government expenditure in favor of priority spending on economic and social infrastructure. The outlook for government revenue continues to be dominated by the likely evolution of oil revenue, which is essentially beyond the control of the authorities, as it depends on the outlook for world oil prices and exchange rates, and the prospective level of Gabon's oil production. On present WE0 assumptions, the positive impact of a projected modest increase in world oil prices is likely to be offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the CFA franc. As a result, government oil revenue Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - would peak at almost 17 percent of GDP in 1995 and ease steadily thereafter, to 15 percent of GDP by 1998. To help compensate for this decline and reduce the dependence on oil revenue in general, important tax reforms have been introduced by Gabon since early 1994. In the context of the reforms decided at the level of the regional customs union (UDEAC), a major simplification and reduction of import tariffs was implemented in early 1994 and a VAT was introduced, with effect from April 1, 1995, at a single rate of 18 percent. To complement these reforms, tax and customs duty exemptions granted to certain enterprises under special conventions (conventions d'etablissement) are to be renegotiated by end-December 1995 at the latest, so as to help broaden the tax base; progress made so far by Gabon in this regard has been modest. Import tariffs and the broad range for indirect tax rates for the UDEAC countries are set at the regional level, thus limiting Gabon's ability to modify these rates unilaterally; in any event, the present levels of these tax rates seem to be broadly appropriate. As a consequence, the targeted increase in non-oil revenue from 18 percent of non-oil GDP in 1994 to over 20 percent by 1998 is predicated primarily on a recovery in economic activity and on the broadening of the tax base and further improvements in tax administration. The limited prospects for a strong pickup in non-oil revenue do not leave room for any reduction in the period ahead in the existing export taxes on oil, wood, manganese, and uranium. The main justification for these taxes is that they constitute a form of royalties on the exploitation of exhaustible resources and serve also in part as compensation for the adverse effects on the environment. In recognition of the disincentive effects of taxes on exports, however, reductions would remain under review to the extent that revenue developments permit, consistent with the overall fiscal objectives. On the expenditure side, the authorities intend to raise the share of capital outlays and lower that of current spending, while respecting the objective of a decline in total expenditure as a ratio to GDP. Capital expenditure is projected to stabilize at around 6.3 percent of GDP, and current expenditure is to be reduced by 3 percentage points of GDP (or almost 9 percentage points of non-oil GDP), reflecting cuts across the board, but particularly in interest payments and the civil service wage bill. Interest payments are projected to increase initially--from 7.2 per- cent of GDP in 1994 to 8.6 percent in 1995--but, with the targeted decline in absolute terms in public debt, they would fall to 6.4 percent of GDP by 1998. Similarly, wage restraint and containment (as a minimum) of total employment are to lower the wage bill in real terms and in relation to non-oil GDP, from 13.5 percent in 1994 (and a peak of 14.2 percent in 1993) to 10.8 percent by 1998; the wage bill would thus level off at about 28 percent of total spending, but would decline sharply as a share of government revenue, from a peak of 43 percent in 1993 to 25 percent by 1998. These measures would allow the authorities to raise the share of nonwage outlays on education and health, from 15 percent projected in 1995 to 20 percent in 1998. Attainment of this objective should be facilitated by the privatization of key public utilities, which would make room for larger Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12 - investments in the social sectors within the public investment program. In this context, the staff stressed that, as the preliminary findings of the ongoing public expenditure review have shown, particular emphasis should be placed on enhancing the effectiveness of public spending in the social sectors. Even though social outlays have in recent years been at fairly high levels, the progress in improving education and health conditions has been relatively modest. 4. Monetarv nolicv During the program period, monetary policy will continue to be directed at validating the parity of the CFA franc vis-a-vis the French franc; given this nominal anchor, inflation should be expected to come down to the level prevailing in France. Velocity increased rapidly in the wake of the devaluation, but returned quickly to historical levels by end-1994. On th.e assumption of broadly stable velocity, broad money growth is projected to decelerate from 38 percent in 1994 to 7 percent by 1998. Given the sharp increase in the net foreign assets of the banking system in 1994, net domestic credit growth would be allowed during 1995-97 to exceed somewhat the expansion of bank liabilities to the private sector and thus to cause a modest net foreign exchange reserve loss. However, to keep this loss within manageable proportions, ceilings have been set on the net recourse by the Government to financing from the banking system, consistent with the statutory limit on such financing from the regional central bank. Bank credit to the private sector, which had fallen from almost 19 percent of non-oil GDP in the early 1990s to 14.4 percent by end-1994, would be allowed to recover gradually to 15.3 percent by 1998, partly because of a higher recourse to domestic borrowing by oil companies. The latter and some major domestic exporters have tended to borrow abroad; since early 1995, however, oil companies have increased their reliance on the domestic banking system,, despite higher interest costs, in an apparent move to diversify the currency composition of their financial liabilities. Bank lending to the non-oil private sector in Gabon has tended to be constrained mainly by the limited availability of bankable credit demand, ref'lecting poor documentation of investment projects and weaknesses in the legal framework. The ongoing monetary policy reforms of the regional central bank are expected to enhance the effectiveness of monetary management through increased recourse to indirect market-based instruments of monetary control. The system introduced in July 1994 features an interbank market, where banks and other eligible financial institutions trade funds at freely determined interest rates; an auction system for central bank advances, complemented by a repurchase system (prise en pension); and a refinancing window for medium- term bank credits. The system remains flawed, however, as the central bank sets both interest rates (8.75 percent at present) and quantities at the weekly auctions of liquidity injections. It is also asymmetrical, as a liquidity absorption mechanism does not yet exist, other than through the acceptance of voluntary bank deposits with the central bank at below-market interest rates. Bank reserve requirements exist notionally on sight and time deposits, but at a zero rate. In the face of increasing bank deposits Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - with the central bank, the BEAC decided in early July 1995 to introduce, with effect from January 1996, reverse auctions (i.e., offering of central bank certificates), but still at administered interest rates, and to remove the controls on bank minimum deposit rates (except for deposits below CFAF 5 million). Through these operations, the BEAC expects to ensure that the lending capacity of commercial banks is consistent with the balance of payments objectives of the region; commercial banks are subject to limits on their net open foreign assets position, which the BEAC intends to strictly enforce. The staff, in its discussions both with the Gabonese authorities and the six-monthly meetings with the BEAC, has argued for the lifting of interest rate controls and the abolition of the refinancing facility for medium-term bank credits. The authorities acknowledged that interest rates had to protect the balance of payments and ensure arbitrage toward the CFA franc. They felt, however, that the current imperfections in the regional money market and weaknesses in certain national banking systems made it necessary to maintain for the time being central bank control over certain key interest rates. As for the medium-term refinancing facility, the authorities of the BEAC consider that it could be removed once instruments and markets for investment financing would have been more fully developed. 5. Structural reforms Crucial in securing the growth of the employment objectives of the program is the undertaking of a broad range of structural reforms designed to unlock Gabon's growth potential in the non-oil sector. In particular, the authorities intend to move with determination to improve the efficiency and financial performance of public enterprises; reform the civil service; and liberalize the legal and institutional framework by revising the Labor Code, enacting a Competition Law, and updating the business legislation (harmonized at the level of the CFA franc zone) and adopting an Investment Code (the previous Code was rescinded in early 1994, eliminating a broad range of tax exemptions). These reforms and their schedule of implementa- tion are described in paragraphs 20-23 and Table 1 of the memorandum of economic and financial policies (Appendix I). Gabon's public enterprise sector comprises 39 enterprises in which the State has an equity participation of at least 25 percent. Ten of them are wholly owned by the State, mostly public utilities or commercial enterprises operating in agriculture, forestry, the livestock sector, and transporta- tion. Overall, public enterprises accounted in 1993 for about 14 percent of non-oil GDP, but for 22 percent of total employment. For many years, the sector has been plagued by inefficient management, overstaffing, high operating costs, cross debts and arrears, and partial dependence on government subsidies or on-lending for the financing of its investment. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicWhile committed to reform, the authorities have been somewhat concerned, given the prevailing social and political conditions, about appearing to dispose of the national patrimony, converting public monopolies into private monopolies, and raising unemployment. Given this background, the reforms envisaged under the program focus initially on five key enterprises that play a major role in the economy--the electricity and water company (SEEG), the railway company (OCTRA), the post office/telecommunica- tions company (OPT-TIG), Air Gabon, and the oil refinery (SOGARA). The management of the first two enterprises will be offered for privatization by end-December 1995 in the form of long-term concession contracts (a struc- tural performance criterion); these contracts will preserve the ownership of the existing capital stock by the State, but will allow for new investment by the new private investors/managers and freedom of entry of new firms into the sector. The concession contracts, which will be prepared with technical assistance from the World Bank, will also include adequate regulatory provisions to avoid any abuse of monopoly power. In contrast, Air Gabon and OPT-TIG will be restructured by end-1995 in preparation for a possible privatization, while plans will be developed for the sale of the government shares in enterprises in which the Government has a minority participation of 10 percent or less. Privatization plans for the agricultural and com- mercial public enterprises are to be finalized in 1996. To facilitate the implementation of these reforms in a transparent framework, a Privatization Law was adopted by the Government in June 1995 and is awaiting parliamentary approval. In addition, the authorities intend by end-1995 to identify the cross debts and arrears among public enterprises and the Government and to design a schedule for their elimination. Employment in the civil service, and the public sector in general (including local and municipal authorities), has risen significantly in recent years, partly to offset the fall in employment elsewhere in the economy. At the same time, civil service salaries have been raised to fairly generous levels (amounting on average to the equivalent of US$16,200 in 1993 and US$8,740 in 1994 after the devaluation), exceeded only by average salaries in public enterprises. While wage increases in 1994 were kept modest (8.5 percent) and no increase has been provided in the 1995 budget, civil~service employment has continued to expand, by 4.7 percent in 1994 and 3.4 percent in the first half of 1995, and has now reached 35,200 people; these increases reflected primarily the impact of a regulari- zation of staff hired at an earlier time (and whose salaries were already included in the wage bill). Under the program, the authorities intend to stabilize the size of the civil service during the second half of 1995 and to respect quarterly cumulative limits on the wage bill throughout the program period, consistent with total increases in the wage bill of 7.8 per- cent in 1995, 3.4 percent in 1996, 1.5 percent in 1997, and 1.0 percent in 1998; observance of these objectives will require wage restraint and, as a minimum, stabilization if not cuts in the civil service staff. Detailed understandings on the civil service reform program (along the lines indicated in paragraph 23 of the memorandum of economic and financial policies) will be reached at the time of the first review of the program.

Social issues 15 - Employment promotion and containment of cost of living increases are Gabon's main social concerns. The National Employment Office, set up in 1994, is providing employment counseling, training courses, and support services to job seekers, and will try to facilitate the redeployment, to the private sector, of the redundant employees likely to be dismissed from the public sector; the retrenched employees will receive appropriate compensa- tion benefits. The Government also intends to undertake a census of contractual workers employed in the administration and to introduce incen- tives for early retirement for civil servants. In the meantime, in a move to preserve jobs for the Gabonese citizens, the authorities took forceful measures in early 1995 to repatriate some 80,000 immigrant workers, mainly from neighboring countries. In addition, in late June 1995, the authorities announced their intention to "Gabonize" employment to the extent possible, with the replacement of all expatriates currently occupying positions in the public and private sectors. Concerns among the public at large over the rising cost of living in the aftermath of the devaluation have been made more acute recently by reports of speculative price increases by some private firms, following the introduction of the VAT in April 1995. In response, the authorities have embarked on a publicity campaign on the modalities of the tax and have taken measures to ensure strict adherence to these modalities by operators. None- theless, to help alleviate the impact of the VAT on the most vulnerable groups, in June 1995 a small additional number of essential consumer goods were exempted from the VAT and retail prices of medicines were lowered by 10 percent through tax adjustments. 7. External sector policies, balance of payments outlook, and capacity to repay the Fund The pursuit of appropriately restrictive financial and incomes policies should help maximize the gains in competitiveness from the devaluation of the CFA franc.- Such gains will be crucial for diversifying the production and export base and achieving external viability by end-1998, as targeted under the program. Given the structure of the Gabonese economy, the supply response of the economy to the new economic environment will unavoidably be slow. The establishment of a preferential low tariff rate for trade with the other BEAC partners- -at 20 percent of the common external tariff--has stimulated regional trade, albeit from a very low base, but has so far had no noticeable impact on Gabonese exports. Gabon indeed remains a net importer from the rest of the UDEAC. At the same time, Gabon's high external debt leaves very limited room for any additional recourse to foreign borrowing on commercial terms, and as a middle-income country, Gabon is not eligible for concessional assistance or concessional terms on its debt reschedulings. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - Gabon's exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions; capital transactions are also fairly liberal. The authorities have indicated that they are prepared to accept in the period ahead the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and are working with their BEAC partners to elicit an early decision on this matter. The trade system is also virtually free of restrictions; the only remaining quota, on sugar imports, is to be eliminated in January 1996, and will be replaced by a 30 percent surcharge for a three-year period, consistent with the UDEAC agreement. The import quotas on a range of other goods were eliminated in early 1994, and the 30 percent import surcharges applied on these imports will be reduced to zero in 1997. With the effective implementation of the financial and structural policies described above, the external position is projected to improve significantly over the medium and long term. Balance of payments develop- ments will continue to be dominated by trends in the oil sector, which accounts for the bulk of exports and net service payments abroad (e.g., payments for nonfactor services, interest payments, profit remittances, and other factor payments). u The volume of oil exports is expected to level off, while oil prices would rise marginally, with the terms of trade remaining broadly stable. Non-oil exports (essentially wood, manganese, and uranium) are expected to increase in volume terms by about 7.5 percent a year during 1995-98 in response to the restoration of competitiveness; other non-oil exports will pick up markedly, but from a very low base. At the same time, with the expected upturn in activity in the non-oil sector, the volume of imports is projected to rise at a somewhat faster pace than real GDP. On this basis, the current account surplus is projected to ease from an exceptionally high level in 1994 (7 percent of GDP) to 3 percent in 1995, before rising gradually to more than 4 percent by 1998. The capital account is projected to continue to record sizable deficits, reflecting mainly the large, but gradually declining, amortization payments obligations on external public debt. On current indications, inflows of nonproject foreign assistance (mainly from France) are expected to remain modest, falling to CFAF 52 billion in 1995, CFAF 35 billion in 1996, CFAF 20 billion in 1997, and zero thereafter. Private capital out- flows (including short-term capital) are projected to decline substantially from CFAF 159 billion in 1994 (7.4 percent of GDP) to some CFAF 84 billion by 1998, partly as a result of the improvement in the domestLc policy environment and the increase in the local investment opportunities. As a result, the overall balance of payments deficit would widen markedly in 1995, but should return to its 1994 level by 1998. This deficit, together with the targeted buildup in gross official reserves, is projected to be u A large part of oil production and exploration activities are contracted out by oil companies to specialized foreign firms; this accounts for the large net service payments abroad, other than interest payments and profit remittances, in the balance of payments.

Assuming terms comparable to those granted to Gabon by the Paris Club in April 1994, these gaps could be expected to be fully covered by additional reschedulings of debt service obligations on pre-cutoff-date debt by Paris Club and other official creditors on terms comparable to the 1994 agreement. Gabon's debt service payments due on external public debt during 1995-98, while averaging only 25 percent of export earnings, will remain fairly substantial in relation to government revenue, declining from 67 percent in 1995 to 46 percent by 1998. With sustained high primary budget surpluses, however, external public debt would fall from 86 percent of GDP in 1994 to 73 percent by 1998. The external position is projected to improve further during the period to 2001, switching gradually into a modest overall surplus. However, Gabon's balance of payments will remain vulnerable to developments in world oil prices and the volume of oil production. In addition, the external outlook depends heavily on the strength of the supply response of non-oil exports and the stance of domestic financial policies, as illustrated by the alternative balance of payments scenarios summarized in Table 11. In view of the conservative program assumptions about oil production, the downside risks of a shortfall in oil exports are considered rather low; instead, it is more likely that oil output will be somewhat higher than assumed, given the sizable ongoing exploration activity. A 3 percent annual growth in the volume of oil exports would substantially lower the financing gaps, improve the fiscal position and real GDP growth, and facilitate an acceleration in the pace of reduction of domestic government arrears and/or external public debt. In contrast, a stagnation of non-oil exports in volume terms, or a faster volume growth than under the baseline scenario in imports by the non-oil sector (that could result from a faster expansion in private sector credit), would significantly worsen the balance of payments and, on unchanged policies, the fiscal position. Clearly the latter two scenarios are not sustainable and would call for appropriate early corrective measures. Gabon's outstanding use of Fund credit will rise modestly in the period to 1998 in relation to total external public debt and GDP, to 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Repurchase obligations and charges would remain below 2 percent of export earnings and 311 percent of government revenue (Table 12). Gabon has had a good repayment record vis-a-vis the Fund, even though there have been delays of 2-11 days on a few occasions in recent years, mostly for technical reasons; to avoid such problems in the future, the authorities have given appropriate instructions to the BEAC to automatically debit their account for payments falling due. On the basis of the projected external outlook, Gabon should have no difficulty in discharging its financial obligations to the Fund in a timely manner.

Objectives and policies Consistent with the medium-term framework, the macroeconomic objectives of the program for the first year of the extended arrangement, which covers the period July 1995-June 1996, are to accelerate real GDP growth to about 3 percent during 1995-96; to lower average consumer price inflation to 11 percent in 1995 and 5 percent in 1996; and to contain the overall balance of payments deficit. The policy priorities will be to strengthen government financial management, broaden the tax base, and step up public enterprise reforms. Fiscal policy in 1995 aims at raising the primary budget balance to almost 8 percent of GDP through an increase relative to GDP in both oil and non-oil revenue, and a modest reduction in current expenditure excluding interest. Oil revenue will benefit from a carryover of oil company income taxes from 1994 (as such taxes are based on the profits recorded in the previous year), while non-oil receipts are expected to be boosted by the recovery in activity and the introduction of the VAT. Revenue developments during the first half of 1995 were consistent with budget estimates; in fact, VAT collections so far have been somewhat better than expected, not- withstanding some delays in extending the tax to oil company transactions and to subcontractors of companies benefiting from tax exemptions. On the expenditure side, the 1995 budget provides for a modest (7.8 percent) increase in the wage bill, below targeted average inflation, and for a recovery in capital spending. The budget for 1996, which will need to be presented to Parliament by early October 1995, will provide for a further increase in the primary surplus to 8.6 percent of GDP, and a switch in the overall balance to a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP. Non-oil revenue would rise further in relation to GDP, as a result of the first full-year impact of the VAT and of the renegotiation of the tax conventions with major private and public enterprises. Noninterest spending would also be lowered further in relation to GDP, largely through a containment of the wage bill. The budget for 1996 will be reassessed at the time of the first review under the extended arrangement, envisaged for early 1996, so as to ensure that it remains consistent with the overall macroeconomic framework. The main challenge of monetary policy in 1995-96 is to effectively control domestic credit expansion in the face of rapidly rising bank deposits with the regional central bank and the inadequacy of monetary policy instruments available to the BEAC to absorb excess bank liquidity. The multiplier of reserve money is projected to decline to hLstorically low levels in 1995 and 1996, mainly as a result of a combination of government borrowing from the central bank and sizable net repayments by the Government to the commercial banks, as required under the terms of the rescheduling agreement reached with the banks (Libreville Club) in 1994; the banks appear reluctant at this stage to extend new credit to the Government.

The program includes a number of safe- guards against the risk of a surge in private sector credit, which at any rate is constrained by the limited availability of bankable demand for credit u; these safeguards include no new refinancing of medium-term credits by the central bank during the rest of 1995, upward adjustments in interest rates, the introduction of reverse auctions with effect from January 1996, and close monitoring of monetary developments by the authorities. 2/ The monetary situation and prospects will be assessed by the staff at the time of the first review in early 1996 and, if necessary, additional corrective measures will be considered to ensure the consistency of the monetary program. 2. ProPram monitoring To facilitate the progress in policy implementation, a number of quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks have been identified, as shown in Table 2 of the attached memorandum on economic and financial policies (Appendix I). These targets incorporate an asymmetric adjustment clause for larger-than-programmed debt relief and nonproject external assistance, as well as a contingency mechanism for deviations of government oil revenue from the program targets (deviations of government oil revenue from targets exceeding a given benchmark will result in adjustments in the performance criteria and benchmarks on net bank credit to the Government and the net domestic assets of the central bank and the banking system, as described in paragraph 33 of the memorandum). V. Staff Appraisal Gabon's performance under the stand-by arrangement approved in March 1994 was broadly satisfactory, thanks in part to a strong expansion of oil exports. The 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc of January 1994 has been supported by restrictive financial and incomes policies, and by the implementation of a number of tax, price, and structural reform measures. u A rundown of bank deposits with the central bank to finance a stronger expansion in private sector credit than assumed under the program would, with an unchanged demand for money, tend to lower foreign exchange reserves and, to the extent that the demand for nontradable goods increases, put upward pressures on prices. u Introduction of treasury bills, to complement the central bank's instruments of monetary control, was not thought practical at this stage, given the past experience of issuing government financial instruments in Gabon. As the repayment schedule of these past obligations was not fully adhered to by the Government, sales of new treasury bills would require large risk premiums.

The structure of relative prices and economic incentives has improved markedly, although the supply response of the non-oil economy has remained modest to date. Concerns about the rising unemployment and the impact of price increases on the standard of living have become a focal point of the ongoing domestic political debate. The staff shares the authorities' view that their performance in 1994 has set the stage for addressing in a comprehensive fashion and in a medium- term framework the constraints facing the Gabonese economy. The authori- ties' medium-term adjustment strategy aims at accelerating output and employment growth through a diversification of the economy and the estab- lishment of a more liberal regulatory framework to foster the development of the non-oil private sector. The main macroeconomic objectives for 1995-98 entail a pickup in real GDP growth to about 3 percent a year, through a strong recovery of non-oil activity; a reduction in consumer price inflation to 2 percent by 1998; and the containment of the overall balance of payments deficit and the attainment of viable fiscal and balance of payments posi- tions by end-1998. To achieve these objectives, the authorities' medium- term program appropriately emphasizes the preservation of the gains in the structure of relative prices and economic incentives through the pursuit of restrictive fiscal, incomes, and credit policies; higher primary surpluses in the government budget, so as to reduce substantially total public debt as a ratio to GDP; higher and more effective government spending on economic and social infrastructure; the restructuring or privatization of public enterprises, with a front-loaded program of reforms in key public utilities; and the acceleration of other structural and institutional reforms. In this context, the staff believes that particular attention will need to be given to strengthening on a lasting basis the transparency and effectiveness of government financial management, boosting government revenue from the non-oil sector, and carrying out effectively the envisaged reforms in the public enterprise sector. The experience in 1994 and early 1995, and in particular the restraint in granting wage increases for the civil service, as well as the declared strong commitment of the authorities, including those at the highest political level, to the reform process, augur well for the success of the program. A number of risks still remain, however. First, the heavy election calendar in the period ahead will test the authorities' resolve. Social and political pressures might lead to a relaxation of wage restraint and of employment policy in the civil service, and delay the implementation of public enterprise reforms. In response to the rising unemployment in recent years, the authorities have tended to increase recruitment in the civil service and the public sector in general. The continuation of this trend in 1994 and the first half of 1995 is worrisome. A lasting solution Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 21 - of the unemployment problem hinges on the success of the efforts to improve the environment for the development of the non-oil private sector and bring about a withdrawal of the State from directly productive activities that the private sector can carry out more efficiently. Second, the outlook for government revenue is also subject to some uncertainty, as it depends to a large extent on factors beyond the authorities' control. Oil revenue depends on the likely trends in world oil prices and the prospective trends in domestic oil production, while non-oil revenue depends mainly on the likely response of activity in the non-oil sector to the new economic environment. It is therefore all the more important that efforts focus on further improvements in tax administration, as the room for raising tax rates further is very limited. Third, the projected strong increase in commercial bank deposits with the regional central bank poses the risk of a potentially excessive expan- sion in private sector credit, and in turn pressures on official reserves and/or prices. It is imperative that the regional central bank take this concern into account in setting its targets for refinancing medium-term bank credits and in its intervention operations; in this regard, the recent decision by the BEAC to introduce reverse auctions by January 1996 is welcomed. Gabon's balance of payments is expected to improve significantly over the medium term. However, even after taking into account expected disburse- ments from bilateral and multilateral creditors, including purchases from the Fund under the requested extended arrangement, Gabon will continue to face sizable, albeit declining, financing gaps during the period 1995-98. These gaps are expected to be fully covered by additional reschedulings of eligible debt service obligations by Paris Club and other creditors. Gabon's balance of payments outlook remains vulnerable to developments in o.il exports and depends heavily on the strength of the supply response of non-oil exports to the new economic environment, and on the stance of financial policies. Overall, the staff believes that the measures already implemented by the authorities, combined with those planned for the period ahead, are substantial and adequate to achieve the objectives of the program for 1995-98, Therefore, the staff recommends approval of Gabon's request for an extended arrangement and believes that the authorities' efforts deserve also the financial support of other creditors and donors. Gabon continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, but its exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The authorities' indica- tion that they intend to accept in the near future the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and their ongoing efforts to elicit an early decision on this matter by their partners in the BEAC, is welcomed.

To support these objectives and policies the International Monetary Fund grants this extended arrangement in accordance with the following provisions: 1. For a period of three years from September --, 1995, Gabon will have the right to make purchases from the Fund in an amount equivalent to SDR 110.3 million, subject to paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 below, without further review by the Fund. 2. (a) Until September --, 1996, purchases under this extended arrange- ment shall not, without the consent of the Fund, exceed the equivalent of SDR 44.12 million, provided that purchases shall not exceed the equivalent of SDR 22.06 million until March 15, 1996. (b) Until September --, 1997, purchases under this extended arrange- ment shall not, without the consent of the Fund, exceed the equivalent of SDR 77.21 million. (c) The right of Gabon to make purchases during the second and third year shall be subject to such phasing as shall be determined. 3. Gabon will not make purchases under this extended arrangement: (a) throughout the first year, during any period in which the data at the end of the preceding period indicate that (i) the ceiling on net domestic assets of the Central bank at the national level, or (ii) the ceiling on the net credit to the government by the banking system, or Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - APPENDIX I (iii) the ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external borrowing by the Government with original maturities of 1 to 12 years and 1 to 5 years, or (iv) the ceiling on short-term external borrowing outstanding contracted or guaranteed by the Government, or (VI the target on net reduction in domestic government payments arrears, referred to in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the memorandum annexed to the attached letter and specified in Table 2 attached thereto, is not observed; or (b) if Gabon has not eliminated by end-December 1995 its outstanding stock of external payments arrears, and thereafter if, at any time during the period of the arrangement, Gabon incurs any new external payments arrears, as specified in paragraph 32 of the memorandum annexed to the attached letter and in Table 2 attached thereto; or (c) if Gabon fails to fulfil1 its intentions regarding the structural performance criteria referred to in paragraph 34 of the memorandum annexed to the attached letter and specified in Table 2 attached thereto; or (d) during any period after March 14, 1996, until the review contemplated in paragraph 3 of the attached letter and in paragraph 35 of the annexed memorandum, has been completed; or (e) throughout the second and third years of the extended arrangement, until suitable performance clauses have been established, or if such clauses having been established, are not being observed; or (f) if Gabon: (i> imposes or intensifies restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, or (ii> introduces or modifies multiple currency practices, or (iii) concludes bilateral payments agreements which are inconsistent with Article VIII, or (iv) imposes or intensifies import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. When Gabon is prevented from purchasing under this extended arrangement because of this paragraph 3, purchases will be resumed only after consulta- tion has taken place between the Fund and Gabon and understandings have been reached regarding the circumstances in which purchases can be resumed.

Gabon's adjustment program for 1994 was supported by a stand-by arrangement from the Fund, in an amount equivalent to SDR 38.6 million, or 35 percent of quota. Gabon made also a purchase in March 1994, amounting to SDR 21.5 million, or 19.5 percent of quota, under the Fund's compensatory and contingency financing facility (CCFF} in compensation of a shortfall in export earnings projected for 1994. Gabon's performance under the stand-by arrangement was satisfactory: the macroeconomic objectives of the program were broadly met; all the performance criteria were observed; and all purchases under the arrangement have been made. Actual export earnings in 1994 turned out to be substantially higher than initially projected, necessitating an early repurchase of the CCFF drawing. The Government of Gabon will effect this repurchase in the immediate future. 2. The Government of Gabon has embarked on a reinforced medium-term reform program that addresses the remaining constraints to sustained output growth in a more systematic and frontal fashion. The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the Government of Gabon describes its economic and structural adjustment strategy for the period July 1, 1995-, June 30, 1998. In support of these policies, the Government of Gabon requests financial assistance from the Fund in the form of a three-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility in an amount equivalent to SDR 110.3 million, or 100 percent of quota. 3. The Government of Gabon is aware that purchases under the extended arrangement are subject to the observance of semiannual quantitative and structural performance criteria, the completion of five semiannual reviews of the program, and observance of the standard clauses regarding the exchange and trade systems. The first review under the extended arrangement will be completed not later than March 31, 1996. 4. The Government of Gabon believes that the policies described in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies are adequate to achieve the objectives of its economic program for 1995-98 but it stands ready to take any additional measures that may be appropriate for this purpose, in consultation with the Fund. The Government will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the implementation of the policies of the program. In addition, after the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 41 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT period of the arrangement and while Gabon has outstanding balances under the arrangement, the Government of Gabon will consult with the Fund, at the initiative of the Government or at the request of the Managing Director of the Fund,. on its economic and financial policies.

Recent Economic Performance 1. Gabon's performance under the 1994 stand-by arrangement was broadly in line with program expectations; all performance criteria were met* all purchases under the arrangement have been made. The increase in'tEid civil service wage bill was contained at 10 percent as targeted, while wage increases in the private sector averaged about 15 percent. In the wake of the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994, and in the context of the UDEAC reforms, import tariffs were reduced sharply to a 'range of 5-30 percent; several tax exemptions were eliminated; import quotas were abolished, being replaced with temporary import surcharges of 30 percent, except for the quota on sugar imports; and export taxes were eliminated, except for wood, manganese, and oil products (so as to capture part of the windfall profits from these exports). However, to alleviate the impact of the devaluation on the most vulnerable groups, public utility tariffs were raised modestly and with some delays, while taxes on petroleum products were cut to keep domestic retail prices unchanged. Consumer price inflation (measured by changes in the CPI index for African households) acceleratsd during 1994, but nonetheless averaged only 36 percent for the year as a whole, only slightly above the program target; the 12-month inflation r,ate fell to 12 percent by May 1995. The real effective exchange rate, basead on relative consumer prices, declined by 24 percent between December 1993 <and March 1995. The short-term supply response to the new economic environment was very modest, with very limited import substitution. The decline in real household disposable income gave rise to a sharp contraction in real domestic demand (8.6 percent) and non-oil output. Real non-oil GDP declined by an estimated 3.0 percent, but a strong pickup in oil production allowed for an increase of 1.7 percent in total GDP. 2. Fiscal performance in 1994 was broadly on track, resulting in a significant improvement in the Government's budgetary position. On the revenue side, higher-than-expected oil revenue more than offset a shortfall in non-oil receipts, which reflected mainly a sharp decline in the volume of imports. Total recorded government expenditure, however, was kept signifi- cantly below programmed levels, because of lower-than-projected interest payments due (in view of the lower volume of, and delay in securing) foreign financing, and lower-than-expected capital spending. As a result, the primary surplus rose from 1.3 percent of GDP in 1993 to 5.4 percent of GDP, almost twice the program target, while the overall deficit declined to 1.8 percent of GDP. 3. Monetary developments in 1994 were marked by a strong growth in broad money and a substantial improvement in the net foreign assets position of the banking system, while net domestic assets declined. The improved profit and liquidity position of the private sector contributed to a modest reduction in bank credit to the private sector. Broad money rose by 38 percent during 1994, after sizable declines in earlier years. Broad Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT money growth eased to 23 percent in the year to March 1995, while private sector credit picked up, increasing by 13'.5 percent during the same period. With the containment of inflationary pressures in the region, the common central bank (BEAC) lowered in stages its lending rate from 14 percent in early 1994 to 10.5 percent by June 1995, and its remuneration of bank deposits from 9.75 percent to 4.5 percent, respectively. 4. Updated balance of payments estimates suggest that the current account shifted from a small deficit in 1993 to an unprecedented surplus of almost 7 percent of GDP in 1994, exceeding substantially program expecta- tions. This reflected essentially a strong growth of oil and wood exports, which benefitted from firm world demand, and a steep reduction in the volume of imports (11.5 percent), attributable mainly to the price effects of the devaluation. However, the improvement in the current account balance was offset in large part by an increase in amortization payments due and an expansion in short-term trade credits by the oil sector, which are linked to the value of oil exports. The overall balance of payments remained in deficit, albeit at a much lower level than in earlier years. This deficit, together with the clearing of the large end-1993 external payments arrears and the increase in gross official reserves, was financed primarily by debt relief from Paris Club, other bilateral, and London Club creditors. All bilateral debt rescheduling agreements with Paris Club creditors were signed by mid-1995. 5. In the structural area, however, delays were recorded in adjusting the structure of utility charges of four major public enterprises--Air Gabon, the water and electricity company (SEEG), the oil refinery (SOGARA), and the post office/telecommunications company (OPT-TIG)--to offset the devaluation-induced increases in costs; these delays, however, did not necessitate a recourse to government subsidies, given the internal adjust- ment measures implemented by these enterprises. The telecommunication charges were adjusted upwards by some 40 percent soon after the devaluation, while the electricity tariffs and water charges were raised by 15 percent in December 1994. Air Gabon tariffs for international flights were raised by 60 percent for passengers and 100 percent for freight in March 1994, and the tariffs for domestic flights were increased by 35 percent in January 1995. The retail prices for petroleum products were increased by an average of 11 percent in May 1995. II. Medium-Term Policv Framework a. Overall strateny 6. The adjustment achieved in 1994 is significant and sets the stage for addressing in a more comprehensive fashion the major constraints that continue to confront the Gabonese economy. The latter remains heavily dependent on the exploitation of exhaustible natural resources, namely oil, wood, manganese, and uranium. The rest of the economy relies essentially on the redistributed surpluses from these sectors. The limited diversification of the production and export base renders the balance of payments position Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT fairly vulnerable to external shocks. In addition, Gabon's external debt and debt service burden continues to be high, in part because of unprodluc- tive past investments; debt service payments due on the external public debt are exceptionally heavy, particularly in relation to government revenue. These factors, combined with a sharp decline in world oil prices during 1985-88, have contributed to modest real GDP growth over the past decadle (averaging 1.2 percent a year during 1986-94) which, in the face of increas- ing population (at 2.5 percent a year), has given rise to a sharp decline in employment in the modern sector and a strong pickup in open and disguised unemployment. As a consequence, the public sector (central government and public enterprises) has become the biggest employer, accounting for about 10 percent of the labor force and for almost 60 percent of employment in the formal sector. 7. Furthermore, notwithstanding some progress in 1994, the management of public financial resources (both at the level of the Central Government and the public enterprise sector) remains weak. These limitations include insufficient discipline in budgetary procedures and accounting practices, as well as weaknesses in effectively monitoring overall fiscal developments. Sizable extrabudgetary expenditure commitments had been undertaken prior to 1994, contributing to the emergence of domestic payments arrears. There- fore, it is urgent to strengthen the efficiency and transparency of public sector management through a containment of operating deficits, improved control of employment levels, the elimination of cross debts and arrears, and the gradual elimination of government subsidies. 8. The large surpluses generated by the private sector have resulted in recent years in sizable domestic savings, which have exceeded by far domestic investment. A large part of domestic savings covered the deficit on factor income payments and transfers in the balance of payments, but in the absence of attractive domestic investment opportunities they have also fueled short-term capital outflows. The development of the non-oil private sector remains impeded by inadequate economic infrastructure, limited access to bank credit, weaknesses or rigidities in the institutional and legal framework, and large government domestic payments arrears. 9. In order to address these constraints and weaknesses in a more systematic and frontal fashion, and building on the progress achieved in 1994, the Government has reinforced its medium-term economic strategy. The central objective of economic policies in the period ahead is to accelerate output and employment growth, while attaining by 1998 a viable fiscal and external position (without a need for exceptional balance of payments financing). Potential output growth in the period ahead is constrained also by the fact that oil production would, on current industry estimates of proven reserves, level off at about 17.4 million tons a year, thus placing a heavy adjustment burden on the non-oil sector. Diversification, however, may take time to materialize, although significant potential for growth is believed to exist in agriculture, the fishing and wood processing sectors, mining, and the services sector. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT 10. In this context, the main objectives of the 1995-98 program u are to (a) achieve average real GDP growth of about 3 percent a year, implying an acceleration in real non-oil GDP growth to almost 5 percent a year; (b) 1 ower average consumer'price inflation from 36 percent in 1994 to 2 percent by 1998; (c) contain the narrowing in the external current account surplus from 7 percent of GDP in 1994 to about 4 percent by 1998; and (d) raise Gabon's contribution to the gross official reserves of the regional central bank to the equivalent of 3.3 months of imports by end-1998, while normalizing relations with external creditors. The main policy priorities are to improve significantly the management of public financial resources and to diversify the production and export base. The attainment of these objectives will require the preservation of the gains in the structure of relative prices brought about by the devaluation of the CFA franc; restrictive fiscal and credit policies; higher and more effective government spending on economic and social infrastructure; the restructuring or privatization of public enterprises; and the acceleration of other struc- tural and institutional reforms that foster an enabling environment for private sector development. Such policies should lead to an increase in the savings and investment of both the government and the non-oil private sectors. The Government recognizes that the medium-term projections are subject to some uncertainty and that the quantitative objectives of the program are essentially linked to the underlying economic assumptions (in particular about non-oil GDP growth) and the assumptions about exogenous factors and that these objectives will be re-examined at the time of program reviews. b. Fiscal nolicv 11. The primary objective of fiscal policy over the medium term is to support economic growth through the removal of tax distortions and a restructuring of government expenditure toward priority spending on economic and social infrastructure. In addition, fiscal policy will be directed at raising further the primary budget surplus so as to achieve a reduction in the public debt/GDP ratio and help attain a viable balance of payments position. Accordingly, the primary budget surplus will be raised from 5.4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 9 l/2 percent by 1998, thus allowing a shift in the overall fiscal balance from a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of more than 3 percent by 1998. As a result, total public debt would decline from 120 percent of GDP in 1994 to 87 percent by 1998. 12. The immediate priority of fiscal policy is to improve the trans- parency and effectiveness of public resource use. A number of major steps to this end have already been taken by the Government. In particular, the Government has placed since early 1995 all responsibility for committing government expenditure under the sole authority of the Ministry of Finance and initiated a public expenditure review, with World Bank assistance. In u As the EFF-supported program covers the period July 1995-June 1998 and the fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, the medium-term program straddles the four calendar years to 1998. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 46 - APPENDIXI ATTACHMENT addition, at the request of the Government, an audit of budgetary procedures -was undertaken in April 1995 by an IMF technical assistance mission, and several key recommendations of this mission were implemented in June 1995.. In particular, the actions taken have included (a) the discontinuation of the "simplified procedure" for expenditure commitments; (b) the issuance, and strict implementation, of a circular by the Minister of Finance to all government departments specifying the proper procedures for budget prepara- tion, expenditure control, and public accounting, consistent with the exist- ing legal framework; (c) the discontinuation of all extrabudgetary fiscal transactions (on both the revenue and expenditure sides); and (d) the commencement of separation of the functions and responsibility for treasury management and public accounting-- which had until June 1995 been carried out by the same person (Tresorier Payeur General)--with the appointment of independent directors for these services. The remaining recommendations will be implemented in the period ahead (the main measures and the envisaged schedule of implementation are indicated in Table 1). To facilitate this process, Gabon will request, if necessary, additional technical assistance from the Fund. 13. On the revenue side, the key objective is to raise non-oil revenue from the equivalent of 18 percent of non-oil GDP in 1994 to over 20 percent by 1,998, in order to provide adequate resources for priority government spending. Complementing the major reforms in customs duties introduced in 1994, a value-added tax (VAT) at a single rate of 18 percent was introduced with effect from April 1, 1995. Non-oil revenue is expected to be boosted by the projected recovery in economic activity. Greater buoyancy is also predicated on the renegotiation by end-1995 of the tax exemptions granted to certain enterprises under special conventions (conventions d'etablissement) and other measures to broaden the tax base; a further strengthening of tax administration; and increases in the indirect taxes on petroleum products. Import tariffs and other indirect tax rates for the BEAC countries are set at the regional level, thus limiting Gabon's ability to modify these rates unilaterally, which in any event seem broadly appropriate. 14. Total government expenditure is targeted to be reduced as a ratio to GDP from 27 percent in 1994 to 25 percent by 1998, primarily through a cut in interest obligations on public debt and in part by a containment of other current spending. Capital expenditure is to be raised from 6 percent of GDP in 1994 to 6.3 percent by 1998, and to be directed mainly at improving the economic and social infrastructure. Within current spending, emphasis will be placed on reducing the weight of the wage bill in relation to non-oil GDP. This will require a sizable further reduction in real terms in the wage bill through continued wage restraint, reduced employment of foreign technical experts, and, as a minimum, a stabilization of the overall size of the civil service. On this basis, the wage bill is envisaged to decline from 13.5 percent of non-oil GDP in 1994 to less than 11 percent by 1998, on the assumption that nominal non-oil GDP growth will be consistent with the program targets. In the context of the public enterprises reform program, subsidies to public enterprises, which are projected at Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 47 - DPENJ)= I ATTACHMENT CFAF 7 billion in 1995, will be eliminated as soon as possible, but not later than 1997 to make room for priority‘spending. The share in total spending of nonwage government expenditure in the education and health sectors will be raised from 15 percent in 1995 to 20 percent by 1998. 15. The Government is keenly aware of the fact that the existence of domestic government arrears constitutes a major impediment to private sector development. Accordingly, the Government has taken all necessary measures to avoid the emergence of any new arrears, through a strengthening of the expenditure control procedures, as indicated above, and the containment of government spending within available resources. Domestic government arrears were reduced by CFAF 89 billion in 1994 through cash payments; in addition, outstanding obligations to commercial banks (Libreville Club), amounting to CFAF 146 billion, were rescheduled over a ten-year period. The outstand- ing stock of arrears at end-1994 nonetheless remained large, estimated provisionally at CFAF 217 billion (10 percent of GDP). However, the exact level of legitimate domestic government arrears remains to be assessed more accurately; accordingly, major efforts have been initiated since late 1994 to verify the validity of outstanding claims on the government and to estimate by end-December 1995 at the latest the true amount of arrears. The authorities intend to phase out the existing stock of domestic arrears by 1998. The pace of elimination of arrears could be accelerated through the use of potential net proceeds from the privatization of public enterprises (see paragraph 21), or part of any higher-than-programmed government oil revenue (see paragraph 33), and any surplus inflows of external nonproject assistance relative to program projections. C. Monetarv policv 16. During the program period, monetary policy will continue to be directed at validating the fixed exchange rate vis-a-vis the French franc; given this nominal anchor, inflation should be expected to come down to the level prevailing in France. Credit policy will remain restrictive so as to help contain the expansion in total domestic demand and achieve the overall balance of payments objectives. On the assumption that velocity would remain broadly unchanged at its end-1994 level, the growth in broad money is expected to decelerate from 38 percent in 1994 to 7 percent by 1998; the counterpart of the expansion in broad money would essentially be an increase in the net domestic assets of the banking system, with net foreign assets declining modestly from a high level in 1994. The stock of central bank advances to the Government will be targeted to remain below the statutory ceiling, while further net repayments will be made by the Government to commercial banks (given the debt rescheduling terms of the Libreville Club). Within a restrictive overall credit policy, private sector credit would expand somewhat faster than nominal non-oil GDP growth; additional liquidity would be provided to the private sector through the clearing of domestic arrears. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 -. APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT 17. The additional reforms recently adopted by the regional central bank, which will become effective from January 1, 1996, will contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy through an increasing recourse.to indirect market-based instruments of monetary control, notably the use of reverse auctions of central bank liquidity. The Government is committed to urging within the BEAC for the elimination of the refinancing by the central bank of medium-term bank credits (B window). Through ope'n market operations, the BEAC will ensure that the lending capacity of commer- cial banks remains consistent with the balance of payments objectives and that interest rates are maintained at levels with appropriate differentials from those prevailing abroad to discourage capital outflows. The Govern- ment, in collaboration with the regional bank commission (COBAC), will further strengthen bank supervision and strictly enforce the existing prudential requirements. d. Pricing nolicies 18. Most government controls on prices have already been lifted, and only a small range of goods remains subject to administered prices. The authorities will manage flexibly administered prices, through periodic adjustments in price levels to reflect fully changes in costs or in tax rates. They also intend to introduce in 1996 a more flexible mechanism for the determination of retail prices for petroleum products that ensures full cost pass-through and the preservation of the real value of excise taxes. e. Structural policies 19. Structural reforms will be directed at strengthening Gabon's growth potential in the non-oil sector and creating an enabling environment where the savings generated by the private sector can be invested produc- tively in the domestic economy. To this end, the Government intends to move with determination to improve the efficiency and financial performance of public enterprises; reform the civil service; and liberalize the institu tional framework to foster private sector development and employment creation; details of the envisaged structural reforms and their implementation schedule are indicated in Table 1. 20. In the public enterprise sector, a General Commission for Rehabilitation and Privatization has been set up to oversee the disengage- ment of the State from directly productive activities. With assistance from the World Bank, the Government has adopted a broad reform strategy and a concrete plan of actions for the period immediately ahead. In particular, a Privatization Law was adopted by the Government in June 1995 and is awaiting approval by the Parliament. Five major enterprises have been identified for early restructuring or privatization. The management of two of these companies-- the electricity and water company (SEEG) and the railroad company (OCTRA)--will be offered for privatization by end-December 1995 in the form of medium- or long-term concession contracts; these contracts entail the privatization of the management of the existing capital stock and the freedom to undertake new investment projects by the private investors, as well as freedom of entry into the sectors by new firms. The concession or Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - privatization contracts for these enterprises will be finalized in early 1996 and will include appropriate regulatory provisions to avoid the emergence of private monopolies. At the same time, the Post and Telecom- munications Office and the International Telecommunications company of Gabon (OPT-TIG) will be split into two separate entities and a plan will be finalized by end-December 1995 for the privatization of the international telecommunications company (TIG). Similarly, restructuring/privatization plans will be finalized by end-December 1995 for Air Gabon and the post office, and by 1996 for the agricultural and commercial public enterprises. The Government will also withdraw by end-December 1995 from the management of the oil refinery (SOGABA), in which it has a minority participation, while government subsidies to this enterprise (including subsidies in kind) will be phased out by 1997; the ex-refinery price of petroleum products will also be linked to the world price of refined products (c.i.f. Libreville). Furthermore, by end-December 1995, the Government will (a) identify the cross debts and arrears among public enterprises and between the enterprises and the Government, and establish a schedule for their elimination; and (b) adopt a plan for the sale of its shares in companies in which it has equity participation of less than 10 percent. These reforms will be supported by technical assistance from the World Bank and other donors. 21. The Government is aware that the restructuring of public enterprises will most likely result in labor shedding. To alleviate the social costs, appropriate compensation benefits will be offered to redundant public enterprise employees, whose average salaries are fairly high in comparison with the civil service and the private sector, financed in part by the budget and in part from the likely proceeds from the privatization of public enterprises. The National Employment Office, set up in 1994, will provide employment counselling, training courses, and other support services to facilitate the redeployment of retrenched employees in the private sector. Any remaining privatization proceeds will be used to accelerate the elimination of government domestic arrears or the repayment of external public debt. With assistance from the World Bank, the Government will set up in 1996 a participation fund to promote the purchase of shares by public sector employees and other nationals in privatized public enterprises; it will also set up a scheme for the financing of small- and medium-size enterprises. The World Bank conducted in April 1995 a poverty assessment survey, the results of which will be discussed with the authorities over the next few months. 22. A number of other structural reforms are also envisaged to improve the institutional and legal framework for private sector activities. A Competition Law will be enacted in 1995. The Labor Code will be revised by early 1996, liberalizing the modalities for hiring and releasing labor by private and public enterprises, with adequate safeguards against abuses and appropriate compensation for retrenched employees. The Government will also adopt by late 1996 an updated business legislation, harmonized at the regional level, and intensify its efforts to improve the effectiveness of the judiciary. A new Investment Code is currently being prepared by the Government, aimed at enhancing the transparency of the existing framework Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50 - APPENDIX2 ATTACHMENT for promoting private investment, particularly in the mining and forestry sectors. The new Investment Code will be‘consistent with the UDEAC reforms, will not introduce any new fiscal incentives, and will be adopted in 1996 after prior consultations with the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank. 23. Regarding the civil service, the Government announced in early 1995 a reform plan designed to make the administration more responsive to the needs of the country, by redefining its roles and functions, reducing costs, and re-allocating operating budgets. In the context of this broad framework, the Government intends to (a) prepare staffing plans (cadres oreaniaues) for all ministries by end-1996 and, on the basis of these plans, ensure that the existing civil service staff is consistent with budgeted posts; (b) reduce over time the overall size of the civil service, so as to help observe limits on the overall level of the civil service wage bill; (c) develop and implement a precise policy for the employment of foreign technical assistance experts; and (d) consider the appropriateness of a compensation system linking salary increases to performance. Given the impact of civil service salary decisions on wage costs in the non-oil sector, the Government will strictly follow a policy of wage moderation in the civil service. In this context, civil service employment will be contained at 35,200 by end-December 1995, the same level as at present, and specific quantitative objectives for the civil service reform program for subsequent years will be fixed by the same time. f. External sector nolicies 24. The principal objective of Gabon's external policies is to maxi- mize, through moderation in cost increases, the gains in competitiveness from the devaluation of the CFA franc. Such gains will be crucial for diversifying the export base and achieving external viability. Policies will also be directed at keeping to a minimum the recourse to nonconces- sionary foreign borrowing, and liberalizing further the trade system. The quantitative restriction on sugar imports will be eliminated by January 1996, and will be replaced for a three-year period by a temporary surcharge of 30 percent. The 30 percent surcharge on imports of selected goods, that had been subject to quantitative restrictions until early 1994, will be lifted in early 1997. Gabon's exchange system is free of restric- tions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Gabon is prepared to accept formally in the period ahead the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and is working with its BEAC partners to elicit an early decision on this matter. III. Program for 1995-96 25. The program for the first year of the extended arrangement covers the period July 1995-June 1996. Consistent with the medium-term framework, the program for 1995-96 will aim at (a) accelerating total real GDP growth to about 3 percent a year, consistent with a strong recovery in non-oil real Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 51 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT GDP; (b) lowering average consumer price inflation to 11 percent in 1995 and 5 percent in 1996; and (c) containing the overall balance of payments deficit. The policy priorities will be to strengthen government financial management, broaden the tax base, and accelerate public enterprise reforms. 26. The 1995 government budget provides for an increase in the primary balance,to almost 8 percent of GDP. Oil revenue is projected to rise markedly as a ratio to GDP, largely as a result of a carryover from 1994 of income taxes of oil companies. The introduction of the VAT in April 1995 has resulted in some speculative price increases in May, which are expected to be reversed, at least in part, later in the year. The revenue yield so far has been consistent with budget estimates, but some practical difficul- ties have arisen in effectively applying the VAT on oil company imports. The Government is currently in the process of overcoming these start-up difficulties, as well as effectively extending the coverage of VAT to the subcontractors of companies benefitting from tax exemptions. In addition, fiscal policy in 1995 aims at reducing further tax exemptions through a renegotiation by year-end of tax incentives provided by ad hoc agreements (conventions d'etablissement) with foreign and domestic investors, and the effective implementation by end-December 1995 of a tax-inclusive system of government expenditure. The 1995 budget also provides for an increase in the wage bill of 7.8 percent and for an expansion in capital expenditure. 27. An integral part of the program for 1995 is the strengthening of government financial management. In addition to the measures already implemented, the following key actions are expected to be completed by end-December 1995, based on the recommendations of the Fund technical assistance mission: (a) completion and effective implementation of a plan of the specific procedures for the separation of the functions and responsibilities of the Treasury and the public accounting directorates; (b) shift of all bank accounts held by individual ministries or agencies to a centralized treasury account held with the central bank; (c) explicit integration of the net financial transactions of the Treasury with local or municipal authorities in the government budget; (d) centralization of all government receipts within the treasury accounts (with some autonomy in the management of VAT receipts); (e) strengthened monitoring of budget execution and preparation on a monthly basis of a comprehensive table on budget operations (tableau de bord des finances oubliaues); and (f) completion of a comprehensive audit of government domestic arrears. 28. The stance of fiscal policy will be tightened further in 1996, so as to help contain demand pressures and facilitate the gradual repayment of domestic arrears. Accordingly, the primary and overall budget surpluses are targeted to increase in relation to GDP to 8.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. The projected decline in oil revenue as a ratio to GDP is expected to be offset by greater buoyancy of non-oil revenue as activity in the non-oil sector picks up further, as well as by a reduction in total government expenditure. In this context, the civil service wage bill will be limited to CFAF 184.6 billion in 1996 (3.4 percent higher than in 1995). The details of the program for 1996 will be finalized at the first review of the extended arrangement. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 52 -. APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT 29. The main challenge of monetary policy in 1995-96 is to control domestic credit expansion effectively in a context of excess bank liquidity and weaknesses in the instruments of monetary control. The adoption by the BEAC from January 1, 1996 of reverse auctions of liquidity will facilitate this task. In addition, the national monetary authorities intend to propose to the BEAC to set at zero the objective for refinancing for Gabon for the rest of 1995. To help contain the overall expansion in the net domestic assets of the banking system, the Government's recourse to net borrowing from the central bank will be kept below earlier targets (fixed at the time of the second review under the stand-by arrangement), while additional net repayments will be made to the commercial banks. The latter net repayments will contribute to an additional buildup of bank deposits with the central bank and an associated further decline in the multiplier of reserve money, thus underscoring the importance of a prudent liquidity management policy by the central bank. Overall, broad money is projected to increase by 18 per- cent in 1995 and 9 percent in 1996, while private sector credit is programmed to expand by 19 percent during 1995 and 12 percent in 1996. IV. External Financing 30. Gabon's balance of payments outlook is dominated by prospective developments in oil exports. The program is based on the assumption that oil prodluction would stabilize at 17.4 million tons a year throughout the period 1995-98. In addition, in line with the Fund's latest World Economic Outlook, world oil prices are assumed to rise from USS15.5 per barrel in 1994 to USS16.9 per barrel in 1995-96, and to USS17.4 per barrel by 1998. The French franc exchange rate is also assumed to stabilize at F 5.1 per U.S. dollar during 1995-97 and to ease modestly to F 5.2 per dollar in 1998. On the basis of these assumptions and the effective implementation of the policies outlined in the preceding paragraphs, Gabon's current account surplus is projected to decline to 3 percent of GDP in 1995, before rising to over 4 percent by 1998. Given the envisaged structural reforms and the gains in competitiveness that should ensue, non-oil exports, especially forestry products, are expected to regain momentum after several years of relative stagnation. Prudent financial policies would help contain the annual increase in the volume of imports at a rate broadly in line with real non-oil GDP growth. The capital account, however, will remain in sizable deficit, owing mainly to the burden of public debt service. Inflows of external nonproject assistance are currently projected at CFAF 52 billion in 1995 and CFAF 35 billion in 1996, reflecting primarily bilateral aid from France. The strengthened policy framework should be expected to contribute to a decline in short-term capital outflows. External public debt is projected to decline as a ratio to GDP from 86 percent in 1994 to 72 percent by 1998. 31. The overall balance of payments deficit would rise markedly in 1995 and narrow gradually thereafter. Together with the targeted increase in gross official reserves, this would give rise to gradually declining financing gaps throughout the program period, which are expected to be fully covered by additional debt rescheduling by Paris Club and other creditors. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT More specifically, in 1995-96, after net use of Fund resources (of CFAF 31.2 billion), the financing gaps are currently projected to amount to CFAF 162 billion in 1995 and CFAF 150 billion in 1996. To help cover these gaps, the Government intends to request from Paris Club creditors a new debt rescheduling of debt service payments due on pre-cutoff-date debt. V. ProPram Monitoring 32. To monitor progress in policy implementation, quantitative semi- annual performance criteria and quarterly benchmarks have been established, as shown in Table 2, comprising ceilings or floors on: (a) the net domestic assets of the central bank at the national level (ceiling); (b) the net credit to the Government by the banking system (ceiling); (c) new nonconces- sional external borrowing of l-12 years and l-5 years maturities (ceiling); (d) new external borrowing with maturity of less than 1 year (excluding normal import-related credits) (ceiling); (e) the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears; (f) the minimum reduction of domestic payments arrears ; (g) the net domestic assets of the banking system (ceiling); (h) the civil service wage bill (ceiling); (i) total government expenditure, excluding interest payments (ceiling); (j) government oil revenue (floor); and (k) government non-oil revenue (floor). The first six indicators will constitute performance criteria for end-December 1995 and for end-June 1996 and semiannually thereafter, and quantitative benchmarks for the intervening quarters. The quarterly targets for the net domestic assets of the central bank indicated in Table 2 will be adjusted downward by the amount of any net absorption of liquidity by the central bank through reverse auctions. 33. The quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks will include an asymmetric adjustment clause for larger-than-programmed debt relief and nonproject external financing. In addition, in view of the uncertainties about the outlook for oil prices and output levels, the program will include a contingency mechanism for saving any surplus of government oil receipts in excess of the baseline projections and above a cumulative annual threshold of CFAF 30 billion. These savings will be placed in the treasury accounts with the central bank. Ninety percent of the first CFAF 30 billion of any surplus oil receipts could be used to reduce domestic government arrears, while the remainder could be used to offset non-oil revenue shortfalls. In contrast, in case of lower-than-programmed oil receipts, 40 percent of the shortfall up to a cumulative annual maximum limit of CFAF 10 billion will be offset by additional borrowing from the banking system, with the rest compensated by higher non-oil revenue or lower government expenditure, up to a maximum limit of 1 percent of non-oil GDP (CFAF 14 billion in 1995). Given the importance of the amounts of revenue and expenditure at stake, if these adjustments are not sufficient, the program targets will be reviewed in consultation with the Fund staff. 34. The program for 1995 includes also two structural performance criteria for end-December 1995 on (a) the offer for tender of the privatization of the management (concession contracts) of the electricity and water company (SEEG) and the railroad company (OCTRA); and (b) the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 54 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT completion and effective implementation of a plan for the separation of the functions and responsibility for treasury management and public accounting. As part of its efforts to reinforce its economic management and monitoring capacity, the Government has set up a technical inter-ministerial committee responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of policy implementation. To facilitate the monitoring of economic developments in Gabon by the Fund, the Government will submit to the Fund on a monthly basis a broad range of economic and financial statistics, particularly the "core" data required for surveillance. 35. The second purchase under the extended arrangement will be conditional on the observance of the performance criteria for end-December 1995 and completion of the first review, not later than March 31, 1996. The review will focus on the formulation and adoption of an appropriate govern- ment budget for 1996, and an assessment of the progress made in improving the management of public financial resources. The subsequent purchases from the Fund will also be conditional on the observance of performance criteria and the completion of semiannual reviews.

A US$50 million structural adjustment loan (SAL), appraised in 1987, became effective in April 1988. Its purpose was to support the Government's reform program designed to: reinforce public sector management; improve the performance of public enterprises; liberalize the incentive regime in favor of private, non-oil activities; and reformulate sectoral policies. The conditions of the SAL were fully met by December 1989 and the loan was fully disbursed. In 1989 the Bank approved two other loans: a US$30 million loan for road maintenance, that closed in June 1995, and a US$5 million loan for a technical assistance project focusing on economic training that closed in December 1993. In June 1992, the Bank approved a forestry/environment investment loan for USS22.5 million. The definition of an environmentally sound legislative framework for the exploitation of forestry resources was a condition of effectiveness. The loan was declared effective in September 1993. Following the adjustment of the parity of the CFA franc on January 12, 1994 a quick-disbursing economic recovery loan (US$30 million) to support the immediate accompanying measures that are part of the adjust- ment program was approved by the Board on June 21, 1994 and has been fully disbursed. In addition, a transport sector technical assistance loan (USS5.2 million) was approved on July 7, 1994. Gabon signed the MIGA Convention on April 15, 1994. A public expenditure review (PER) with a view to helping the Government formulate a high-return and sustainable program of public expenditure which supports its development objectives was conducted by the World Bank in April 1995. IFC is currently engaged in four projects in Gabon, in the mining and petroleum sectors. These projects concern the development of the on-shore Rabi oil field in a joint venture with Shell Gabon and Elf Gabon (for an original gross commitment of US$170 million, including a participation of USSllO million), and the construction of a port and improved handling facilities for manganese exports. IFC's total gross commitments to Gabon since 1988 amount to USS215.2 million. After taking into account repay- ments, cancellations, and the sale of a US$llO million interest in the venture with Shell Gabon, IFC holds net commitments amounting to USS28.5 million.

Data are generally methodologically sound, consistent with international classifi- cation standards. Detailed economic and financial statistics, including long historical data, are published in the Tendances de l'Economie, issued on a semiannual basis by the General Directorate of Statistics and Economic Studies of the Ministry of Planning; more recent sectoral developments are described in detail in the Tableau de Bord de l'Economie, issued on a quarterly basis by the General Directorate for the Economy of the Ministry of Finance. The coverage and remaining areas of weaknesses of sectoral data are described below. Data reported to the African and the Statistics Departments of the Fund have tended to be reasonably up to date, but there is room for further improvement, particularly for the data reported to the Statistics Department. In the context of the extended arrangement, the authorities have agreed to report to the Fund on a monthly basis a broad range of economic and financial statistics, including provisional &ta, so as to facilitate the monitoring of progress in policy implementation. 1. National accounts Comprehensive annual national accounts data are available for the period up to 1991, on an output, income, and expenditure basis, both in real and nominal terms; data for 1992, in nominal terms only, are also available; these data are prepared by the General Directorate of Statistics and Economic Studies of the Ministry of Planning. Provisional estimates of national accounts data for 1993 and 1994 are also available, prepared by the General Directorate for the Economy of the Ministry of Finance. The cover- age of developments in the oil and other key export sectors is based on a range of indicators, which may not fully capture the profits generated by these sectors. Major inconsistencies remain between national accounts and the balance of payments statistics. The staff and the authorities are working closely to establish a more consistent data base. 2. EmDlovment and unemplovment Detailed annual data on employment are available for all sectors of the economy until 1993, including a breakdown of employment between the public and private sectors. However, data on unemployment and the total labor force are not systematically available. 3. Prices Two-monthly consumer price indices for the African households and the middle-income households are available only for the capital city of Libreville. These indices are based on a rather outdated family expenditure survey of 1968-69, and they attach a large weight to the prices of food and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 64 - APPENDIX V Gabon - Statistical Issues (continued) basic consumer goods. A new household survey was conducted in 1993, which should allow more representative statistics. Nonetheless, even with an updated basket, consumer prices would continue to overestimate price developments for the country as a whole. 4. Government accounts Detailed data are available on a monthly basis on government revenue, expenditure, and the overall fiscal position. However, since 1992 no data on government finance statistics have been reported to the Statistics Department. The coverage of available data is limited to the Central Government. Some weaknesses remain due to extrabudgetary operations and lack of transparency. Preliminary steps to address the situation have been taken: an audit is being conducted to determine the exact amount of out- standing domestic public debt; a FAD review of budgetary procedures and expenditure control has been completed in April 1995; some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. 5. Monetarv statistics Quarterly data on monetary statistics for Gabon, as well as for the other member countries of the Central African Monetary Union, are reported to the Fund on microcomputer diskettes by the regional central bank (BEAC) on a monthly basis. These diskettes are sent by regular mail, entailing some delays; the latest was received in May 1995 and deals with the data for February 1995. However, more updated monetary statistics for Gabon are provided by the National Agency of the BEAC in Libreville. Coverage is comprehensive and detailed with the data quite reliable, although there may be, from time to time, minor discrepancies between the two sources. 6. External public debt Comprehensive data on the outstanding stock of external public debt and its composition, together with detailed projections on debt service due, are available and provided (usually to Fund missions) by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement. In the recent past, the authorities have had difficulty providing these data--partly because of changes in personnel; comprehensive data on the composition of external public debt for the period prior to 1994 are not available. 7. Balance of navments and trade statistics Annual data on exports and imports of goods and services and on capital flows other than the public debt are provided by the BEAC. The data are detailed and comprehensive through 1994, but suffer from a few shortcomings. Import data appear to be underestimated. In addition, the overall magnitude Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 65 - APPENDIX V Gabon - Statistical Issues (continued) and detailed breakdown of private capital flows, particularly of short-term capital movements, is subject to some limitations about its reliability and comprehensiveness; weaknesses in national accounts data and the accounting practices of oil companies contribute to these limitations. 8. Public enterprise sector While a fairly good data base exists on the operations of public enterprises, information is communicated to the staff on an ad hoc basis, notably during Fund missions to Libreville. Understandably, the data are provided on an annual basis, taking into account the periodicity of the financial years of the enterprises and the need to have their accounts audited. At present, the data provided to staff cover only the wholly-owned and mixed enterprises in which the Government's equity participation is at least 25 percent.
