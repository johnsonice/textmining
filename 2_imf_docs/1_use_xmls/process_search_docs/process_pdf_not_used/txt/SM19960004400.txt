The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Suriname were held in Paramaribo during November 27-December 12, 1995. Suriname's representatives included the Ministers of Finance, Natural Resources and Energy, Social Affairs and Housing, and Trade and Industry; the President of the Central Bank; and other senior officials. The staff representatives were Messrs. Lizondo, Medeiros, Bodart, Oppers, and Mrs. Randall (all WHD). 2. Suriname has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. u The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 18, 1995 (EBM/95/5). On that occasion, Directors expressed concern about the continued deterioration of Suriname's economic performance and urged the authorities to implement a comprehensive program aimed at reducing inflation, strengthening the external accounts, and setting the basis for sustained economic growth. To this end, Directors recommended a tightening of fiscal policy, measures to move interest rates to positive levels in real terms, and the maintenance of a unified market-determined exchange rate. They also recommended a strong effort to provide an adequate statistical basis for decision making. 3. Suriname has made progress in the generation and provision of economic data to the Fund, and has started to implement some technical assistance recommendations from STA. However, serious deficiencies remain regarding timeliness, coverage and quality of data (Appendix IV), which hamper the Article IV consultation process and the surveillance between consultations. II. Backnround A. Developments before 1995 4. Suriname's economic performance deteriorated markedly in the 1980s owing to a worsening of its terms of trade and the failure to take corrective policy actions. This weakening was exacerbated by the suspension in late 1982 of development assistance from the Netherlands following reports of human rights violations 2J, and guerrilla activity against the Government. As international reserves dropped to low levels, the authorities resorted to trade and exchange restrictions and price controls, generating large distortions in relative prices and prompting widespread u A summary of Suriname's relations with the Fund is presented in Appendix I. Suriname has not had arrangements from the Fund nor has it had financial operations with the World Bank. A summary of Suriname's relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is presented in Appendix III. u This assistance averaged US$87 million a year in 1980-82; it was resu- med in 1988, and averaged US$45 million a year in 1989-95. These amounts compare with an estimated average GDP of US$600 million in 1989-95. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 2 - parallel market transactions. During 1982-89 real GDP declined by a cumulative 10 percent, while annual inflation averaged 14 percent. 5. In the period 1990-94 real GDP declined slightly, while inflation accelerated, reaching almost 600 percent during the 12-month period ended December 1994 (Table 1). This marked increase in inflation resulted mainly from expansionary fiscal policy, central bank exchange losses arising from an official multiple exchange rate system in effect between late 1992 and mid-1994 (see box below), and a gradual shift out of domestic financial assets as interest rates became increasingly negative in real terms. Evolution of Suriname's Exchange Rate System Suriname had a single official exchange rate until October 1992. This rate remained fixed in terms of U.S. dollars from December 1971 to October 1992. As inflationary pressures accumulated during the 1980s and the early 199Os, the exchange rate in the parallel market diverged widely from the official rate. In October 1992 the authorities introduced an official multiple exchange rate system. This system underwent several changes during its existence, and at one time comprised as many as seven exchange rates, some of them partly determined by market forces. Under this system, the Central Bank incurred large losses because its average buying exchange rate (measured in Suriname guilders per U.S. dollar) was higher than its average selling exchange rate. In July 1994 the authorities unified the official exchange market by introducing a uniform exchange rate (managed by the Central Bank). Subsequently, however, there were some departures from a unified system. Starting in late 1994 banks were allowed to have transactions with clients at a "banks" exchange rate, which was substantially depreciated with respect to the official rate. Also, in May and June 1995 the Central Bank intervened in the market at an "intervention" exchange rate, which also was depreciated with respect to the official rate. Since July 1995, however, there has been a return to a unified system, as all legal transactions have taken place at the official exchange rate; also, the spread between the official and the parallel exchange rate has been negligible (see text). 6. The public finances (defined to include the central government accounts and central bank exchange losses) improved markedly in 1994 (Table 2), mainly as a result of the various modifications to the exchange system in that year. The overall deficit of the Central Government declined from 8.7 percent of GDP in 1993 to 2.3 percent of GDP in 1994, reflecting a sharp increase in revenue from income taxes paid by the bauxite companies and from higher import duties and fees on international trade, due to the use of more realistic exchange rates for the calculations of these taxes in 1994. The losses of the Central Bank declined from about 11 percent of GDP in 1993 to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1994. A large part of the losses in 1994 took place Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 3 - in the first half of the year, but substantial losses continued after unifi- cation reflecting contracts that had to be effected at past exchange rates. 7. Upon unification of the official exchange market in July 1994, the official exchange rate was set close to the prevailing parallel exchange rate (Chart 1). However, as access to the official market on the demand side continued to be restricted, and the official exchange rate was kept relatively constant in the presence of high inflation, the spread between the parallel and the official exchange rate widened to close to 70 percent by mid-October 1994. Starting at that point, and for the rest of the year, the authorities depreciated the currency rapidly in the official market and granted import licenses more liberally. 8. Confidence in the currency, however, continued to erode, generating a shift away from domestic financial assets. Inflation rose to an average of 30 percent a month in the last quarter of 1994, and by end-1994 the spread between the official and the parallel exchange rates stood at 22 percent. B. Developments during 1995 9. Suriname's economic performance improved markedly in 1995. Inflation declined to an average of 9 percent a month in January-May 1995, and the price level fell by 13 percent during the second half of the year, bringing the 12-month rate on inflation down to 37 percent by December 1995. This was the result of a major improvement in the public finances and of the use of the exchange rate as an informal anchor for prices starting in mid-1995. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 4 percent in 1995. 10. The fiscal balance turned from a deficit of 7 percent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of 5.3 percent of GDP in 1995, owing to the full-year effect of the unification of the exchange market in mid-1994, a large improvement in the country's terms of trade, and fiscal measures. Central bank exchange losses declined from 4.6 percent of GDP in 1994 to 0.3 percent of GDP in 1995. The central government overall balance shifted from a deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of 5.7 percent of GDP in 1995. Government revenues increased markedly, mainly as a result of higher world prices for bauxite derivatives, better tax administration, and the introduc- tion of a pay-as-you-earn system for income taxes in July 1995. At the same time, government expenditure fell, mainly reflecting a decline in foreign grants linked to expenditure. 11. In mid-1995 the Central Bank intervened in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the Suriname guilder. It halted the depreciation of the currency with respect to the U.S. dollar in the official market (which had amounted to 13 percent during the first five months of 1995) and made Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- , abundant foreign exchange available to banks. u These actions, supported by a large stock of international reserves (US$70 million as of end-May, compared with a monetary base equivalent to US$48 million), turned expecta- tions around. The currency appreciated rapidly to the level of the official exchange rate, both in the parallel market and in the "banks" market. 12. During the second half of 1995, the authorities gradually appreciated the Suriname guilder in the official market, by a cumulative 22 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar. During this period, banks effected their trans- actions with clients at the official exchange rate, and the spread between the parallel and the official exchange rate remained negligible. In real effective terms, the Suriname guilder appreciated by 36 percent in 1995 with respect to 1994 (using period-average exchange rates); the real effective appreciation was 25 percent in the second half of 1995 with respect to the first half of the year (Chart 2). u 13. The net domestic assets of the banking system (net of adjustments) declined during 1995, in part reflecting a fall in net credit to the public sector (Table 3). As of mid-1995, banks' lending interest rates stood at 40-45 percent, while interest rates on time deposit were in the range of 15-45 percent. With the decline in inflation, these rates became sharply positive in real terms, which led to a rapid growth in monetary aggregates (broad money rose by 27 percent in nominal terms during July-September) accompanied by a large increase in the net foreign assets of the banking system. Bank credit to the private sector also grew rapidly (by 26 percent in nominal terms during July-September). As banks reached their credit ceilings, they increased substantially their deposits at the Central Bank. 14. In March 1995 the Central Bank started to issue gold certificates as a way of absorbing liquidity and setting a floor for interest rates. These certificates are redeemable on demand, are indexed to the international price of gold (valued at the official exchange rate), and carry an interest of 5 percent per year. The stock of gold certificates reached Sf 2 billion (about US$4 million, compared to US$65 million of gross international u The Central Bank receives foreign exchange surrendered by the main exporting sectors (except the bauxite sector, which is not subject to export surrender requirements but has to pay taxes in U.S. dollars), and buys and sells foreign exchange to the public sector and commercial banks. Commer- cial banks undertake all other authorized transactions with the public. u For the period prior to unification, the calculation of the real effective exchange rate is based on an average of the official exchange rates (weighted by the estimated value of exports and imports effected at each rate) and the parallel exchange rate (weighted by the value of exports not subject to surrender requirements and that of imports for which there was no need to document a foreign exchange transaction, such as "own funds" imports). For the period after unification, the calculation is based on the official and the parallel exchange rates, with a similar weighing scheme.

Suriname's external accounts strengthened considerably in 1995 (Table 4). The current account surplus is estimated at US$92 million .(17 percent of GDP), compared with US$60 million in 1994. Export proceeds increased markedly, mainly as a result of a 26 percent rise in the price of bauxite derivatives (which in 1994 accounted for 73 percent of Suriname's exports); proceeds from other exports increased by 7 percent. The increase in exports was offset only in part by a rise in imports resulting from higher economic activity and the appreciation of the currency. 16. There were substantial inflows of short-term capital owing to the increase in domestic real interest rates. u The overall balance of payments showed an estimated surplus of US$85 million in 1995. Gross international reserves grew by US$96 million to US$158 million (3.3 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services) by end-1995. u However, external payments arrears on government and government-guaranteed debt (most of it with Brazil and the United States) increased from US$65 million at end-1994 to US$71 million at end-1995. u III. Report on the Discussions and Prosnects 17. The authorities stated that policies in 1996 would be directed at consolidating the recent gains made in reducing inflation, while maintaining a satisfactory external performance. Prices had declined in the second half of 1995, but the authorities were expecting upward pressures on prices in 1996, in part as a result of substantial wage adjustments likely to take place throughout the economy. With this in mind, they were targeting a 12-month rate of inflation in the range of 6-12 percent by end-1996. 18. While the policies contemplated for 1996 seemed to be broadly consis- tent with the authorities' general macroeconomic objectives, the mission stressed that risks remained. Projections were subject to considerable uncertainty owing to the recent sharp change in macroeconomic conditions in Suriname, there could be expenditure pressures associated with the next general elections scheduled for May 1996, and there was the possibility of further central bank exchange losses (see below). Thus, the mission recommended that policies for 1996 allow for a safety margin to confront unexpected adverse developments. L/ Historically, the balance of payments has shown outflows of medium- and long-term private capital, which mainly reflect lending from the bauxite companies to their parent companies. 2/ About US$18 million of the increase in gross international reserves during 1995 resulted from central bank purchases of domestic gold. u The staff is working to ascertain whether external arrears by private debtors remain, which would evidence an exchange restriction.

On the basis of the authorities' policies, the mission prepared a scenario for 1996 that envisages a 12-month rate of inflation of 10 percent by end-1996, a moderate accumulation of gross international reserves, and a small decline of external payments arrears (other than by rescheduling). The scenario was based on real GDP growth of 4 percent and the continuation of positive real interest rates. The process of remonetization of the economy is assumed to continue in 1996, although at a much lower pace than in the second half of 1995. The nominal exchange rate would remain around present levels through mid-1996, and then the currency would depreciate gradually with respect to the U.S. dollar in reflection of the increase in prices that would take place during the year. The external current account surplus would decline, mainly as the result of a large increase in imports. Net long-term capital outflows would decline owing to improved prospects for investment, while short-term inflows would slow down. A. Domestic ~olicv issues 1. Fiscal policy 20. Under the authorities' policies, the central government accounts would weaken noticeably, moving from a surplus of 5.7 percent of GDP in 1995 to a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 1996. On the revenue side, the authorities have modified the rates and brackets for the wage and income taxes in order to reduce the tax burden, which they considered to be excessive. Also, revenue from fees on international trade was expected to fall as a result of Suriname's accession to the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) in January 1996. On the expenditure side, the authorities planned to elimi- nate subsidies to state companies in the productive sector early in 1996, and subsidies on electricity by midyear. Total expenditure, however, would rise owing to an increase in government wages and in other current outlays. The authorities explained that they could not be specific about the increase in government wages to be granted in 1996, because it depended on negotia- tions to be conducted with the civil service unions early in the year. They expected strong pressures for a large increase that would offset part of the reduction in real wages experienced in recent years. The projection above assumes a 20 percent increase in nominal wages from their late-1995 levels (real wages would rise by 32 percent on average from 1995 to 1996). 21. The mission urged the authorities to limit the projected deterioration in the public finances so as to help achieve a stronger external performance and build the desirable safety margin for unexpected developments. To raise revenue, the mission suggested: increasing export taxes on existing logging concessions; raising consumption taxes; and strengthening the collection of tax and nontax revenue. On the expenditure side, it recommended: contain- ing wage increases and the growth of other current expenditures; removing "ghost" civil servants from the payroll; and advancing the elimination of electricity subsidies. The authorities indicated that they would give consideration to the mission's proposals. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 7 - 2. Credit policy 22. Under the scenario prepared by the mission, the net domestic assets of the banking system (net of adjustments) would grow during 1996, reflecting the expansion of credit to both the private and the public sectors. Credit to the private sector would increase by 20 percent in real terms during 1996, which would imply a substantial slowdown from the expansion registered during the third quarter of 1995 (latest available information). Central bank net credit to the Central Government would increase by about 3 percent- age points of GDP to finance the Government's small deficit and offset its net repayments of foreign debt; this would require that the Central Bank absorb liquidity from commercial banks by a similar amount. Broad money in real terms is assumed to grow by 18 percent during 1996, compared to 33 per- cent in the third quarter of 1995. Under the projection, broad money in real terms as of end-1996 would be at about the same level as at end-1993, and still 48 percent below the level of end-1992. 23. The authorities indicated that the Central Bank could incur exchange losses in 1996 owing to legal claims presented by certain exporters, which would allow them to buy foreign exchange from the Central Bank at exchange rates that are appreciated with respect to the current official rate. The authorities were exploring ways of limiting such losses. As the magnitude of possible losses was highly uncertain, the scenario prepared by the mission does not include exchange losses. However, to the extent that these losses materialize, the authorities would need to introduce offsetting fiscal measures in order to help achieve their objectives regarding inflation and external performance. 24. The authorities stated their intention to maintain nominal interest rates around present levels so as to help contain domestic expenditure and keep domestic financial assets attractive to the public. The mission agreed with the need to maintain interest rates at positive levels in real terms, while noting that some gradual decline in nominal rates could be allowed once expectations of a stable exchange rate and low inflation take hold. It also emphasized the need to review the soundness of the financial system, as some institutions may have been affected severely by the recent sharp increase in real interest rates. The authorities said that the situation of the financial system remained strong. 25. The mission recommended that market mechanisms be used for determining the level of interest rates. Currently, while banks are apparently free in setting interest rates, they are subject to moral suasion. lJ In this context, the mission recommended that new instruments of monetary control be developed, including reserve requirements on bank deposits and open-market 1/ There are six commercial banks, four of which are government-owned. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - operations in treasury bills. u Initially, the current system of credit ceilings could be replaced by (nonremunerated) reserve requirements. This would allow the Central Bank effectively to sterilize the resources that banks currently keep (without remuneration) at the Central Bank. Over time, a market for treasury bills could be developed. The authorities believed that the system of credit ceilings had worked well and that gold certifi- cates had been efficient in absorbing liquidity, but recognized the possible need for new instruments of monetary control in the future. B. External policy issues 26. Suriname's recent accession to CARICOM has led to a modification in its trade regime. Previously, four import tariffs were in effect, including 5 percent on raw materials, 10 percent on manufactured goods, 20 percent on luxury goods, and 40 percent on electronic goods. Since January 1, 1996, most imports from CARICOM member countries are free from restrictions and subject to a zero tariff, while imports from other countries are taxed at the Common External Tariff, with most rates in the range of 5-25 percent. Taxes and quantitative restrictions on exports to other CARICOM member countries, as well as financial support to export activities, are prohibited. There is not sufficient information available at this stage to assess the implications of joining CARICOM for Suriname's external trade. 27. The authorities indicated that they intended to keep the exchanae rate with respect to the U.S. dollar stable around its present level. However, during the course of 1996 they might allow for a gradual adjustment of the exchange rate as needed to preserve competitiveness. They also were of the view that exports would not be affected adversely by the recent real appreciation of the currency because the main exporting sectors (parti- cularly bauxite and rice) were working with sufficient margins, partly due to recent increases in the international prices for their products. 28. The mission recognized the difficulties in identifying a proper level for the exchange rate, given the important modifications that the trade and exchange regimes have undergone in the recent past, and was in broad agree- ment with the authorities' stance on exchange rate policy. However, it noted the importance of promoting the development of nontraditional exports and stressed the need to monitor developments closely so as to be in a position to react promptly to an undesired weakening of the trade accounts. The mission also urged the authorities to avoid reinstituting a dual (official) foreign exchange market, and to keep the official market free from restrictions so as to improve economic efficiency, including by reducing the activities in the parallel market. u At present, the Central Bank relies on the issuance of gold certificates and on credit ceilings (which are defined in relation to the level of deposits of individual banks). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 9 - 29. Under the scenario prepared by the mission, the external current account surplus would decline from 17 percent of GDP in 1995 to 8 percent of GDP in 1996. This would reflect mainly a large expansion in imports owing to the continued effect of the recent appreciation of the real exchange rate, and the higher availability of bank credit. The overall balance of payments would show a surplus of US$18 million in 1996. As of end-1996, gross international reserves would reach US$175 million (3.2 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services), while external payments arrears would have declined to US$39 million (including the effect of rescheduling). 30. Suriname engages in multiple currencv practices subject to Fund approval. In general, the official exchange rate is determined on the basis of the level of the interbank rate over the previous five days; as a result, the official exchange rate on a given day may deviate from the closing interbank rate of the previous day by more than 2 percent. Suriname also maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval. There is a limit on the allocation of foreign exchange for travel (US$1,500 per year per person), and the transfer of profits and dividend remittances is subject to limits decided on a case by case basis by an official commission. The mission recommended that those restrictions be removed promptly, particu- larly in view of Suriname's improved external position. 31. The mission emphasized the importance of re-establishing orderly relations with all external creditors through the elimination of external pavments arrears. In January 1996, Suriname reached an agreement with Brazil for the rescheduling of US$68 million in debt, of which US$27 million was in arrears. C. Structural oolicies 32. The mission recommended a restructuring of the public sector over the medium term. Public administration should be strengthened through a streamlining of the civil service that would allow the Government to pay competitive salaries in order to retain qualified personnel. Also, state enterprises should be privatized to reduce the burden on the public finances and enhance economic efficiency. u 33. The authorities indicated that the reform of the civil service was high on their agenda for the near future. In the meantime, they were providing economic incentives (through the civil service unions) to employees that would leave the civil service to start private businesses. The authorities also said that privatization could not be started immediately owing to the lack of expertise in this area; they intended to request technical assis- tance on privatization, most likely from the World Bank or the IDB. They explained that the elimination of subsidies to state enterprises in the u There are about 100 state enterprises and parastatals in Suriname. There is little information on these institutions, but a new technical cooperation project financed by the IDB will help address this problem.

Initiatives underway regarding the tax svstem include the design of property and value-added taxes (with technical assistance from the Netherlands) which, if approved by Parliament, could be introduced in 1997. 34. The authorities expected to send to Parliament in the near future a draft for a new investment law that would modernize the legal investment framework in Suriname, and thus would improve the overall investment climate in the country. They also noted that all price controls had been removed. The mission recommended the removal of other administrative controls that hamper economic activity, such as a decree that requires approval from the Ministry of Labor for the layoff of workers in the private sector. D. Other policy issues 35. The authorities have continued with their efforts at protecting the poorer sezments of the population. They indicated that resources from grants were being used to finance the Social Safety Net (free distribution of food packages to poor families), the financial assistance program (distribution of cash to compensate for the elimination of some consumption subsidies), and the old-age pension scheme. They explained that they were seeking to improve the management of their programs, but found it difficult to retain qualified social workers due to the low government salaries. 36. The authorities explained that they had taken steps to ensure a proper development of Suriname's forests. They submitted to Parliament a draft law to broaden the legal framework for the logging industry, and to establish a forest authority which would monitor the exploitation of the forests and its imnact on the environment. They also were planning measures to prevent the illegal production of Fold and its adverse consequences on the environment. IV. Medium-term Outlook 37. The medium-term projections, presented in Table 5, assume that the authorities will continue to favor policies consistent with macroeconomic stability (including a strong fiscal position, positive real interest rates, and a unified official exchange market). In particular, and mainly reflecting the planned introduction of value-added and property taxes in 1997, it is assumed that the central government will achieve a surplus of 2 percent of GDP starting in 1997. Investment would be expected to increase, owing to the more stable macroeconomic environment and to higher profitability in the bauxite sector resulting from higher prices. Real GDP would grow by an average of about 4 percent a year in the projection horizon. 38. The volume of exports of bauxite derivatives is assumed to increase by 2 percent a year as a result of new investment and higher efficiency, while Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - prices of these products are assumed to move in line with the latest WE0 projections (increasing gradually through year 2000 and falling slightly in 2001). The volume of other exports would increase moderately owing to growth in foreign demand. Grants are assumed to decline gradually from US$56 million in 1997 to US$33 million by 2001, and a similar pattern is assumed for imports associated with grants. Other imports would increase with economic activity. 39. Based on these assumptions, the external current account surplus is projected to decline gradually from US$51 million in 1996 to US$ll million in 2001. Net capital outflows would be expected to decline, mainly reflect- ing lower medium- and long-term outflows. The overall balance of payments would show a surplus of about US$15 million a year on average during 1996- 2001. This would allow for the elimination of external payment arrears by end-1998, and for an increase in gross international reserves to US$206 million (2.9 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services) by end-2001. 40. These projections are particularly sensitive to developments affecting the bauxite sector. For example, if the volume of exports of this sector were to remain constant at its 1996 level, gross international reserves as of end-2001 would be US$77 million (1.1 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services). Similarly, if the prices of these products were to be 5 percent lower than in the baseline scenario during 1996-2001, gross international reserves as of end-2001 would be US$70 million. lJ Q. Staff Appraisal 41. Suriname's economic performance improved markedly in 1995, and the staff commends the authorities for this achievement. Economic growth resumed after two years of declining output, inflation fell sharply, and the balance of payments registered a large surplus. This outcome resulted from a major strengthening of the public finances, the use of the exchange rate as an anchor, and a sharp increase in real interest rates. 42. The public finances strengthened following a large improvement in the country's terms of trade, the unification of the foreign exchange markets in mid-1994 which virtually eliminated central bank exchange l'osses in 1995, and fiscal measures that included better tax administration and the intro- duction of a pay-as-you-earn system for income taxes. Central bank inter- vention in the foreign exchange market in mid-1995 halted the depreciation of the currency, which was followed by a sudden fall in inflation. The resulting sharp increase in real interest rates attracted private capital inflows, which, together with the impact of the favorable terms of trade, led to a substantial accumulation of international reserves. lJ These developments also would have an adverse impact on the public finances. A decline in the price of bauxite derivatives by 5 percent would reduce government revenue by the equivalent of about 1 percent of GDP.

The authorities' policies for 1996 are broadly in line with their objectives of maintaining low inflation and a satisfactory external performance, but risks remain. There is uncertainty about how the economy will continue to adjust to the recent sharp changes in macroeconomic conditions, there may be pressures on the public finances associated with the next general elections or with less favorable than expected external conditions, and there is the possibility of further central bank exchange losses. Therefore, the authorities should move promptly to strengthen policies so as to aim at a stronger international reserve position and create a safety margin to confront unexpected adverse developments in 1996. 44. For these reasons, the authorities should take measures to limit the envisaged weakening of the public finances in 1996. Revenues could be increased by raising export taxes on existing logging concessions, raising consumption taxes, and strengthening the collection of tax and nontax revenue. Expenditure could be curbed by restraining wage increases and the growth of other current outlays, removing "ghost" civil servants from the payroll, and advancing the planned elimination of electricity subsidies. The authorities also should make efforts at limiting central bank exchange losses, and any such loss should be borne by the Central Government. 45. The authorities' intention of maintaining interest rates that are positive in real terms is welcome. Nominal interest rates could be allowed to decline gradually as expectations of a stable exchange rate and low inflation gain strength. It would be important to rely on market mechanisms for the determination of interest rates so as to reduce rigidities in finan- cial markets. In this context, the authorities are encouraged to develop new instruments of monetary control. It also would be important to carry out a comprehensive review of the soundness of the financial system, as some institutions may have been affected severely by the recent increase in real interest rates. 46. The authorities' intention of keeping the value of the currency in terms of U.S. dollars stable around its present level, while allowing for a gradual adjustment in the future as needed to preserve international competi- tiveness, is appropriate in principle. However, it would be important that the authorities monitor developments closely so as to be in a position to react promptly to an undesired weakening of the external accounts. Also, they should maintain a unified official exchange market free from restric- tions so as to improve economic efficiency and reduce the scope of the parallel exchange market. 47. Suriname's recent debt rescheduling agreement with Brazil was an important step in reducing external payments arrears. The authorities should continue with efforts at re-establishing orderly relations with all external creditors through the early elimination of remaining arrears. 48. A restructuring of the public sector would be crucial to ensure a lasting improvement of the public finances and a strengthening of public Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - administration. In this context, the authorities' plans for a comprehensive civil service reform and the privatization of state enterprises should be defined and implemented as soon as possible. The authorities' plan for introducing an investment law that will improve the overall investment climate in the country is welcome, and the authorities are urged to remove remaining administrative controls that hamper economic activity. 49. Suriname has made progress in the generation and provision of economic data to the Fund, but serious problems remain regarding the timeliness, coverage, and quality of the data. The authorities are urged to reinforce their efforts in this area, in particular by a rapid implementation of Fund technical assistance recommendations, and by further technical assistance on monetary and balance of payments statistics. Substantial progress in the timely production of good-quality data would be crucial to help strengthen economic management and improve the surveillance of economic developments. 50. Suriname engages in multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), and 3, arising from the mechanism used to determine the official exchange rate. It also maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), arising from the nontransferability of profit and dividend remittances and limits on the allocation for travel abroad. The authorities are urged to remove these restrictive exchange practices promptly. In the absence of a clear timetable for such removal, their approval is not recommended. 51. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Subsequently, there were some departures from a unified system. These included transactions between banks and their clients, and certain central bank sales of foreign exchange to banks, in which the Suriname guilder traded at discounts of up to 40 percent with respect to the official exchange rate. There is also an active parallel (illegal) market where the Suriname guilder has traded at higher discounts. Since mid-1995, however, the spreads among the various exchange rates have virtually disappeared, and as of late-December 1995 the currency was trading at around Sf 400 per U.S. dollar. Suriname engages in multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), and 3, arising from the mechanism used to determine the official exchange rate. It also maintains exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), arising from the nontransferability of profit and dividend remittances, and limits on the allocation of foreign exchange for travel abroad. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The 1994 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 18, 1995 (EBM/95/5). Suriname's exchange restrictions were not approved. Suriname is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - APPENDIX I IX. Technical Assistance In June 1995 the Statistics Department provided technical assistance in the areas of government finance, balance of payments, monetary, national accounts, and price statistics. The mission made a number of detailed recommendations to make Suriname's statistical system more useful for policy analysis and consistent with international standards (see Appendix IV).

As of January 17, 1996, the IDB had approved loans totaling USS17.6 million, of which USS16.7 million had been disbursed, and 33 nonreimbursable technical cooperation projects worth USS13.1 million. 1. Loans Since 1986, the IDB has approved two loans (in 1987) totaling USS7.8 million- -of which USS1.5 million was on concessional terms--to support Suriname's health sector by upgrading the Nickerie hospital. The major components of the program consist of: the construction of a 75 out-patient section, a surgical, obstetrician and nursery section, a pharmacy, a polyclinic, and an emergency care section. 2. Technical cooperation Five technical cooperation projects totaling USS7.0 million are currently in execution. In October 1995, the IDB approved nonreimbursable financing of USS1.2 million for a technical cooperation project to help the government of Suriname establish a system to provide reliable data on the financial operations of the central government, public enterprises, utilities, and other institutions of the nonfinancial public sector. The system, to be established as an independent financial information unit under the overall jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, will enhance the government's ability to carry out and monitor its economic policies and contribute to efforts to reform state administration. In January 1996, the IDB approved non-reimbursable financing of USS1.7 million for a technical cooperation project for the institutional strengthening of the General Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The objective of the project is to improve the coverage, quality, and timeliness of economic and social statistics produced by the ABS in order to provide policymakers and the general public with better tools for evaluating economic policies and the socioeconomic situation of the country. The major components of the project include statistical organization and management, national accounts, enterprise surveys and business statistics, trade statistics, and household surveys and the consumer price index.

In the past year, there has been a noticeable improvement regarding the currentness of monetary and fiscal statistics, but long lags still remain with respect to national accounts and external sector statistics. Also, the quality of macroeconomic statistics in Suriname is poor in coverage and accuracy. This is due in part to various resource constraints, including the scarcity of qualified staff, insufficient training programs, and shortages of equipment and supplies. The authorities are making efforts at improving Suriname's statistical system. In June 1995, STA provided technical assistance in the areas of government finance, balance of payments, monetary, national accounts, and price statistics. The mission made a number of detailed recommendations, a few of which have commenced implementation. The authorities expressed an interest in further Fund technical assistance on monetary and balance of payments statistics. Also, they are receiving financial assistance from the IDB to enhance economic and social statistics (see Appendix III). Suriname has very few statistical publications, which are usually not available on a regular basis owing to resource constraints. The General Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is the official agency responsible for the publication and dissemination of economic data. Real sector: National accounts data are unreliable beyond 1992 owing to various compilation problems and delays at the sectoral level. The quality of national accounts data in constant prices also is impaired by use of an outdated base year (1980). The ABS has indicated that it may coordinate the introduction of the System of National Accounts 1993 with other CARICOM countries, but could not specify a date for when this would be implemented. The consumer price index is based on an outdated basket (1968-69). However, the ABS recently began a pilot household expenditure survey which, if successful, will serve as the basis for a new consumption basket. This effort will be aided by the implementation of an IDB technical assistance project aimed at institutional strengthening of the ABS. The most recently published information on wages and employment is through end-1994. Public finances: The Fund staff relies on fiscal data reported in the "Flash Report", which records the fiscal outturn on a monthly basis. This report is compiled from various data sources, resulting in differences in timing of recording. There are additional problems with respect to both the comprehensiveness of the coverage of fiscal operations and the consistency of the data across the sectors. In particular, the Flash Report's data on domestic and external financing, external debt service, and most external grants must be supplemented with information from other sources. In addition, the Flash Report fails to capture all of the operations of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - APPENDIX IV central administration, including those that are not channelled through the main account of the Central Bank of Suriname (CBS). The authorities plan to start implementing soon a project financed by the IDB, which will create a Financial Information Unit. This unit will seek to broaden the coverage of the fiscal accounts to encompass the public sector as a whole, improve the classifications used in the Flash Report, and present the fiscal accounts on an accrual basis. The quality of Suriname's government finance statistics needs to be improved before they can be published in the GFS Yearbook or in IFS. Monetarv sector: Data on the monetary sector need to be adjusted before being used by the area department. These adjustments seek to: reconcile information on net foreign assets with balance of payments data; reclassify some government accounts in the balance sheet of the CBS; identify exchange losses; and reclassify gold certificates. There are inconsistencies in the historical valuation of monetary gold and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. In addition, available information does not allow the separation of bank accounts (deposits and loans) denominated in domestic and in foreign currency. The authorities plan to implement STA recommendations regarding these issues, but they could not specify a date when full implementation could be expected. External sector: Balance of payments data on a cash basis must be adjusted to a transaction basis with information obtained from several independent sources, which results in problems of coverage and differences in timing of recording. Moreover, modifications in the coverage of balance of payments data has resulted in major breaks in the historical series. In addition, data from different sources on the same variable frequently do not match, and stock and flow data are usually inconsistent, However, the currentness of balance of payments statistics is expected to improve with the implementation of the new Automatic System for Customs Data (designed to facilitate the data entry process), which became operational in January 1996. The balance of payments presentation is being revised to conform with the methodology of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, a process that will require a minimum of a year. Although there have been improvements in the presentation of external debt data, there is still no comprehensive information on disbursements, and on the breakdown between payments on current obligations and payments on arrears.
