Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Zafre, together with discussions for the post-suspension review of Zafre's overdue financial obligations to the Fund, were held in Kinshasa during the period November 21- December 5, 1995. .u Zafre continues to avail itself of the transitional' arrangements under Article XIV, but no- longer maintains restrictions under Article XIV. Zaxre is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. u Zafre'has been continuously in arrears to the Fund since November 1990. A declaration of ineligibility was issued on September 6, 1991, and a declara- tion of noncooperation on February 14, -1992; ZaZre's voting and related rights were suspended effective June 2, 1994. .At the fi,rst,post-suspension review on December 16, 1994, the Executjve Board decided that, unless Zafre had resumed active cooperation with the Fund in the areas of policy implementation and payments performance,' it would give consideration at the time of the next review to initiating the procedure on compulsory withdrawal. At the subse- quent meeting on August 2-3, 1995, the Executive Board decided to postpone consideration of the initiation 'of the procedur,e until the time.of the next Article IV consultatipn or within six.months, whichever occurred sooner. The Executive Board also lifted the ban on' Fund technical assLstance'to Zafre to assist the authorities in the implementation of their anti-inflation program. w Since February 1995, the Zairian authorities have adhered to a monthly payments schedule.to the Fund, albeit at a level insufficient to prevent the further accumulation of arrears. Payments to the Fund reached SDR 14.7 mil- lion (USS22.5 million) in 1995, the highest level since 1991. As of end-December 1995, Zafre's overdue obligations to the Fund amounted to SDR 286.5 million, or 98.5 percent of quota. In a letter to management dated December 20, 1995, the authorities indicated their intention to raise the' level of monthly payments to the Fund from USS2.5 million to US$3 million during January-March 1996, and further to US$3;5 million during April-June 1996. 1/ The Zafrian representatives included the Minister of Finance, Mr. Pay- Pay, the Governor of the Bank of Zafre, Mr. Djamboleka,. and other senior officials. The mission also held discussions with the,bankers' association and the executive council of the business organization (ANEZA). The mission was received by the Prime Minister, Mr. Kengo. The staff team consisted of Mr. Acquah (head), Mr. Beaugrand, Mrs. Devaux, Mr. Toe (all AFR), Mr. Barnard (PDR), and Ms. Casaromani (administrative assistant--AFR). Close contact was maintained with World Bank staff, who also visited Kinshasa in December 1995 to discuss structural reform plans with the authorities. 2/ The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 1, 1994 (EBM/94/49). Notifications of delay were issued to the Executive Board on September 5, 1995 (EBD/95/120), and January 30, 1996 (EBD/96/11). y The staff report for the August 1995 post-suspension review.was issued as EBS/95/123 (7/26/95). The thrust of the Executive Board discussion was conveyed in letters from the Managing Director to President Mobutu and Prime Minister Kengo (EBS/95/123, Supplement 1, 8/10/95).

Zaire's relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are summarised in Appendices I and II, respectively; basic data are presented in Appendix ,111,; medium- and long-term scenarios and external debt.sustainability are discussed in Appendix IV; and statistical issues are described in Appendix V. II. Performance Under the Disinflation ProPram Throughout.the'first half of the 199Os, Zafre was in the grip of chronic hyperinflation, currency depreciation, and output contraction. During 1990,!:94,, -: on average, consumer 'prices rose,by more than 30 percent a month, and real GDP declined by 9%.'percent annually (Table 1). Much of 'the country's industrial capacity fell into disuse and decay, or was destroyed in sporadic outbreaks of violence. The deterioration in Zafre's economic and financial situation stemmed from mismanagement, and unrestrained government spending, financed by currency issue. The hyperinflation spiral received a further boost in late 1993 from an illiconceived currency exchange, and in 1994 from disorderly currency issues by the central bank. In the 12-month period through September 1994, inflation reached a record 90,000 percent and currency depreciation 99.9 percent (Chart 1). As the exchange and trade system rema,ined essentially liberal, with the national currency, the new zafre, in a de facto free float, external competitiveness was protected, lending some resiliency to the private sector. Nevertheless, price and exchange rate volatility, punctuated by currency shortages, undermined confidence in the system; commercial.bank intermediation virtually collapsed; and the economy. became extensively dollarized and centered on a broad-based informal exchange market : , '( In late 1994, the authorities adopted a disinflation program that appeared extraordinarily ambitious and fraught with considerable risks, based as it was on balancing the government budget on a cash basis. Government revenue had collapsed to the equivalent of US$138 million (2.3 percent of GDP), compared with more than US$l billion in 1989. The taxable base was severely eroded, following several years of hyperinflation and output tail- spin, and reflected a rising share of the informal sector in economic activity, The main copper mining company (Gecamines), which used to contri- bute up to one-third of government revenue in the late 19809, had almost stopped operating because of financial and technical difficulties, and periodic attacks on its installations. Moreover, low real wages in the civil service had been a source of major disincentive for revenue-collecting agencies,, and these were generally thought to retain portions of revenue collections to supplement their own incomes and finance their operations. Expenditure control was lost, and bank-financed extrabudgetary spending had increased markedly--rendering the budget largely irrelevant as a policy tool.

Set against this, there was a critical mass of essential outlays estimated at about US$234 million, including the equivalent of US$123 million for the wage,bill. for non-inflationary financing, In the absence of any scope the prospective residual financing gap of US$42 million (or 22 percent of projected revenue) called into question the feasibility of one key prong of the authorities' disinflation program--the halting of the monetary financing of government operations. Also potentially problematic was the aspect of monetary restraint, which hinged on regaining effective control over currency issue by the central bank. a In the event, the Government stepped up its revenue collection efforts and kept cash outlays markedly below revenue. During January-June 1995, government revenue amounted to the equivalent of US$151 million, and the surplus on treasury operations on a cash basis reached US$69 million (Table 2, and Chart 2), but wage arrears accumulated in 1994 remained outstanding. 1/ The tightening of fiscal policy initiated a recycling of currency through the banking system, a process that had virtually ceased with the extensive dollarization and the disarticulation of financial intermediation by banks: The reflow of currency notes into banks, essentially to provide cover for tax- payments, also resulted in a steep narrowing of the discount of bank deposits over currency notes, thereby largely restoring the internal parity of the zaEre and stemming the shift in favor of foreign currency notes. u In August 1995, budgetary surplus, in view of pressure from social partners pointing to the the authorities announced a schedule to liquidate all government wage arrears and a plan for major public works, mostly road maintenance. Consistent with this announcement, expenditure surged from September onward to about twice the average level recorded in previous months, coinciding with lower contributions to the budget from Gkcamines and a drop in the yield from excise taxes on petroleum products. 5/ The resulting deficit u As compared with a preliminary estimate of US$114 million for government revenue in 1994. u The authorities' draft budget for 1995 was presented in the staff report for the December 1994 review following suspension of Zaire's voting and related rights (EBS/94/234, 12/6/94). (J%y 26, 1995). Developments in the first half of 1995 were reviewed in EBS/95/123 k/ In January 1995, because of the scarcity of bank notes (owing to a lack of foreign exchange to finance their importation) and the illiquidity of the banking system, the parallel exchange rate for new zafre deposits rose to four times the rate for currency notes in terms of the U.S. dollar (NZ 15,000, compared with NZ 3,700). w ‘The fall in tax payments by petroleum distribution companies may have resulted from deductions on account of large deliveries made to the army, in connection with military operations conducted in eastern Zaire. To that extent, taxes due were actually used to finance a surge in government outlays.

With the large injection of liquidity into the system, the exchange rate of the new zaXre fell to NZ 9,200 per U.S. dollar by end-September, from NZ 6,400 at end- August, and inflation reached 22 percent in September, as against 4% percent in August. Inflation and currency depreciation continued at a high pace through mid-November, at which point the exchange rate was in the neighborhood of NZ 16,000 per U.S. dollar, representing a cumulative depreciation of 60 percent over the ten-week period from end-August 1995. While the sharp swing in expenditure policy and the drawdown of govern- ment balances in the latter part of the year gave a renewed impetus to inflationary expectations, much of the underlying inflation was due to the persistently high growth of broad money-- at about 14 percent a month on average during 1995--which had largely nonfiscal causes. Both the central bank and several deposit money banks recorded considerable operating losses that were entirely financed by money creation. The Bank of ZaXre faced mounting costs for printing currency, and its traditional sources of income virtually dried up in 1995. Early in the year, the Treasury suspended its payments of interest charges to the central bank and provided it with only a small part of the local currency counterpart for payments to the Fund. Receivable interest from refinancing activity surged, but this was lmostly from unsecured overdrafts extended to five commercial banks that faced solvency problems and were exposed to a combination of a shrinking resource base and nonperforming assets. Thus, whereas the net government position vis-a-vis the banking system turned creditor, the deficits of the banks led to a sharp increase in other net domestic assets, which accounted for an estimated two thirds of the growth in broad money during 1995 as a whole (Table 3). Finally, the exchange market turbulence was also fueled by untimely changes in the regulatory environment. On October 3, 1995, in a move aimed at strengthening the use of the new Zaire and increasing the availability of foreign exchange in the interbank market, the central bank banned domestic purchases of gold and diamonds with foreign currency, and raised the surrender requirement for their export from 20 percent to 50 percent. As a result, recorded trade in gold and diamonds dropped, and the surrender of foreign exchange diminished considerably. In early November, the Bank of Zafre rescinded its earlier decisions and set the surrender requirement at 30 per- cent. At the same time, it introduced new procedures that closely aligned the fnterbank exchange rate with the rate prevailing in the exchange bureaus. I/ Following these changes, foreign exchange inflows apparently resumed. IJ The daily fixing sessions with commercial banks held at the Bank of ZaXre open with quotations based on the market-determined bureau rate. As a result, the spread between the interbank and bureau exchange rates 'declined to about 4 percent in November 1995, compared with an average of 8 percent during the first ten months of the year. Even under ideal conditions, some spread could remain insofar as the foreign exchange bureaus deal exclusively with currency notes, contrary to the interbank market. (In the past, the bureau rate was generally referred to as the "parallel exchange rate.")

While still high in absolute terms and volatile, inflation and currency depreciation in 1995 were the lowest on record since 1990 (Table 1). Average monthly inflation dropped from 47 percent in 1994 to an estimated 13+ percent in 1995. Government revenue collection rose markedly, from US$138 million to some US$312 million, and the budget was kept in surplus. despite the settlement of wage arrears from September onward. The disinfla- tion process, however, exposed the depth of the structural problems in the banking system and the need to contain the,banks' deficits as an integral part of the anti-inflation strategy. Meanwhile, Zaire's underlying external payments situation has remained precarious. Recorded imports have adjusted steadily in recent years with the income contraction and the drop in exports. Yet, the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) has remained very large, at the equiva- lent of some 13 percent of GDP in 1995. As all capital disbursements have ceased, except for humanitarian assistande, the current account deficits have invariably translated into ever larger overall balance of payments deficits, which have entailed a major buildup of external debt payments arrears. In the process, the Bank of Zaire's reserves have been depleted, or frozen as collateral against external liabilities. As of end-1995;.the central bank's free reserves amounted to only US$5 mil,lion., barely sufficient to cover one month of its own foreign expenditure. III. ReDort on the Discussions The consultation discussions were structured around the authorities' main policy objective for 1996-- to break inflationary expectations decisively and reduce the inflation rate to 20 percent (on an end-of-period basis), with a view to laying the ground 'for launching a comprehensive adjustment program as soon as conditions permit. The authorities agreed with the staff representa- tives that the experience gained from 1995 indicated the way to lend credi- bility to the anti-inflation strategy. First, the fiscal policy stance would need to be firm and stringent, and the Treasury forgo all recourse to monetary financing. Second, fiscal policy would have to be solidly buttressed by an adequately restrictive monetary stance, which required addressing forcefully the quasi-fiscal deficits in the banking system. Third, exchange market regulations had to be stable, as indeed should the rest of the relatively liberal regulatory framework in place: Fourth, to bolster the acceptability of the price and exchange rate stabilization measures, concrete steps ought also to be taken in the area of structural reforms to facilitate a sustained economic recovery. Finally, beyond the immediate disinflation,strategy, a forward-looking and coherent set of adjustment policies framed in a medium- term context would be essential, and these should take appropriate account of the financial and other constraints, especially the weight of external debt service obligations, on the prospects for growth and external viability.

To avoid monetary financing of the government budget, the authorities have chosen to conduct fiscal policy during the year on the basis of monthly and quarterly cash management plans, rather than the ambitious 1996 budget submitted to Parliament in late 1995 (Table 2). The latter provided for large increases in both revenue and expenditure (to US$479 million), which remain uncertain at this stage-- especially considering that the bulk of the increase in revenue would have to stem from a better performance of revenue- collecting agencies. In contrast, the cash management plan anticipates a more modest improvement in government revenue, by 20 percent in U.S. dollar terms to US$374 million (5.8 percent of GDP). , No major new tax measures are envisaged, pending a comprehensive overhaul of the tax system. The revenue projection hinges on three key factors: (a) some increases in output of copper, cobalt, I/ and crude oil; (b) the regular collection of petroleum excises, to be secured through adequate adjustments in the retail prices of petroleum products in line with cost-price and exchange rate developments; and (c) closer monitoring of nontax revenue by a directorate for administrative fees, registration taxes, and participations, which is expected to be operational early in the year. The fiscal outlook in 1996, however, remains extremely difficult. Poten- tial claims on the budget will continue to exceed available resources by a wide margin, which calls for strict expenditure limits and clear priorities. Guided by the overriding principle that expenditure should not exceed actual revenue collections, the authorities intend to apply nominal ceilings on cash expenditure in domestic currency terms, set to be consistent with projected revenue in foreign currency terms, and thus with the desired inflation and exchange rate targets. They will also endeavor to maintain a high degree of stability in the level of monthly cash outlays to avoid imparting fluctuations to the fiscal impulse. The asymmetry in the specification of revenue and expenditure targets is designed to ensure that, should inflation exceed the targeted level, government spending will not be automatically adjusted upward, as in the past, to capture any revenue dividend, in nominal terms, from exchange rate depreciation or inflation. Wage settlements would be negotiated so that nominal increases in the pay scale are consistent with the targeted rate of inflation in 1996, and can be accommodated within the total expendi- ture envelope. The fiscal policy stance implies a modest primary surplus (0.6 percent of GDP) for 1996, but because of the large interest burden the overall government deficit on a commitment basis is expected to remain high, at 12.2 percent of GDP (excluding grants), than'in 1995 (Tables 1 and 4). or 1% percentage point of GDP less IJ The entry into operation of a new conveyor belt is expected to allow increased copper mining, higher cobalt output. while the reprocessing of slag would yield somewhat No major recovery in the activity of Gbcamines is expected in the short run, as this would require substantial investment, but foreign partners have expressed interest in developing a new copper mining site, which could come on stream within three to five years. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicIn drafting the 1996 budget, the authorities aimed at substantially raising.other expenditures, including outlays for general operations and maintenance, external debt service, and investment-- all areas that bore the brunt of expenditure compression in the past year. However, the room for maneuver was severely restricted by the limited increase in projected revenue and the imperative to avoid monetary financing of the budget in 1996. Another constraint was the need to address the central bank's losses through budgetary transfers --a key prong in the anti-inflation strategy. To meet some,of these concerns, the authorities agreed on the need to develop priority projects, especially for the social sectors and urgent rehabilitation works; these projects would be implemented from the second half of 1996 onward in case actual revenue collection exceeds projected levels, and should also provide the basis for enhanced humanitarian assistance. I/ 2. Monetary nolicy In 1996 the effective control of reserve money in Zaire will depend on (a) the recycling of currency notes through the banking system, at first mostly for the purpose of tax payments, and (b) the pursuit of a policy designed to leave banks, at least initially, with no alternative but to surrender cash (or foreign exchange) to the central bank to effect tax pay- ments on behalf of their customers --a development that should also serve to reestablish confidence in bank intermediation. To reinforce this process and encourage portfolio shifts in favor of zafre-denominated assets as inflation- ary expectations recede, the authorities will aim at stabilizing the net domestic assets of the central bank, at least during the first half of the year, in a major break with past practices. The policy implies providing nonmonetary financing to cover the operating deficit of the Bank of ZaZre, and this is to be assured by the Treasury. It also calls for revamping.the central bank's interest rate and refinancing policies, with a view to gearing them to the objective of price and exchange rate stabilization. Over time, the Bank of ZaYre has accumulated large capital and valuation losses that have undermined its financial viability. 2J The intent is to streamline the Bank's organizational structure in 1996, to place it on a sound footing and allow it to exercise the primary responsibility of defending the external value of the national currency. The Bank's operating costs would also be lowered in the process, but with little impact on its profitability in I-J Donor project assistance to Zafre was suspended in 1993, and it has not resumed since then. Official grants received in 1994-95 and those projected for 1996 correspond to humanitarian assistance, mostly in connection with the Rwandese refugee population in eastern Zaire. However, part of an EU grant approved in September 1995, for about US$lOO million, may be used for urgent rehabilitation needs, including some road works. 2J .Although the Government's net position with the banking system turned creditor in 1995, this leaves out of consideration its consolidated debt, which should also include the accumulated losses of the Bank of ZaXre. The Bank's revaluation losses were estimated at NZ 13 trillion (USSO. billion) as of end-1995.

Given its monetary policy concerns, the Bank of Zafre took major steps in early December 1995 with respect to the five commercial banks faced with solvency problems. These banks were excluded from further access to central bank refinancing and barred from the clearing mechanism. To issue certified checks to.clients for the payment of taxes, these banks therefore will need to avail themselves of positive balances with the central bank. Meanwhile, since four of the banks concerned are government owned, the authorities are explor- ing ways to restructure them or consolidate their operations, but have ruled out recapitalization. If necessary, the banks may be liquidated, in which case the Government would assume the timely reimbursement of deposits (these totaled less than.NZ 100 billion at end-November 1995). In the case of the fifth commercial bank, foreign partners are willing to restructure its operations and proceed with a recapitalization as soon as possible. Beyond addressing the problem of the operating deficit of the banking system, the authorities.,intend to improve the scope for monetary policy and develop flexible instruments to regulate liquidity. First, the central bank will implement a more active interest rate policy, and make adjustments in the base rate at least on a bimonthly basis to promote an interest rate structure that is positive in real terms. As a step in this direction, the rediscount rate --which had remained unchanged at 125 percent (or 228 percent, when compounded monthly) since June 1995--was raised to 143 percent on January 5, 1996. Second, the central bank will implement firm refinancing ceilings, set for each bank in relation to its deposit base, and will ensure that prevailing rules regarding collateral securities are observed. Third, the authorities will explore the possibility of issuing treasury bills or central bank securities, with a view to promoting a market determination of interest rates and reversing disintermediation. However, confidence factors could limit the scope of action in this area in the short run. 3. ExchanPe and navments svstem In light of the experience in 1995, the authorities are committed to maintaining a stable regulatory environment in 1996, especially with regard to the exchange and payments system. As reported above, the surrender require- ment for small-scale gold and diamond exports was lowered to 30 percent in November 1995; no further change is anticipated. Part of the exchange proceeds surrendered are resold by the Bank of Zafre in the interbank market L/ The largest new zaXre note in circulation (NZ 5,000) is presently worth about USSO.30, barely enough to cover seignorage, and it makes the zaXre highly inconvenient for transaction purposes, while adding to the tendency toward currency substitution. New higher-denomination notes will thus need to be issued to replace part of the existing stock, at a substantial cost to the Bank of Zafre.

As of end-1995, there was no restriction subject to Article XIV; the earlier limits on travel allowances have been lifted, and requests for foreign exchange for the purpose of travel abroad are only subject to declaration and possible ex post verifications of their bona fide character by the central bank. In practice, the bulk of such foreign exchange transactions takes place through foreign exchange bureaus, which have a record of less than full compliance with reporting.requirements. Moreover, the importation or exporta- tion of foreign currency notes has been free since August 1991. Zaire maintains a restriction on outward remittances by expatriates (limited to 50 percent of net salaries), which was first introduced in 1971, and was temporarily approved under Article VIII at that time (but this restriction is not systematically enforced). As described in the report for the 1994 Article IV consultation, Zafre also maintains exchange restrictions evidenced by external payments arrears and there is de facto a multiple currency practice arising from the segmentation of the exchange market. This segmenta- tion is expected to disappear as foreign exchange transactions gradually return to the interbank market, in response to the authorities' tight fiscal and monetary policies, and as confidence in the disinflation strategy takes hold. More importantly, the introduction of more -flexible arrangements for the determination of the interbank exchange rate should in principle preclude any significant divergence between the interbank quotations and the rates posted by the foreign exchange bureaus. The Zafrian authorities have prepared legislation for ratifying the World Trade Organization (WTO) treaty, which has been submitted for parliamentary consideration. Subject to its approval, Zafre is expected to become a member of the WTO in early 1996, although its prerogatives would remain suspended ,until arrears on contributions (of some USSO. million) are cleared. JJ Since December 1994, Zafre has also been a member of the regional association COMESA, which aims at promoting free trade in southern Africa. However, Zaire's membership in the WTO or other trade associations is unlikely to exert any significant impact on the allocation of resources until such time when the formal sector recovers, which presupposes a return of the bulk of trade payments through the banking system. 4. Structural reform plans While Zaire's economy is largely unregulated, the authorities recognize the need to address urgently a number of issues to improve the acceptability of stabilization measures and lay the basis for a resumption of growth. There is also the realization that ambitious structural reforms are unlikely to be successful when launched in an economic environment that is highly uncertain, lJ Zajire's commitments under the WTO treaty include the elimination of a 20 percent import surcharge, which was used occasionally in the past for protective purposes, and the standardization of customs valuation procedures.

Although the scope for action is severely constrained by the iack of financial resources, the authorities intend to implement a few specific measures, which will allow them in due course to initiate more comprehensive structural reforms. The World Bank staff has been closely associated with this exercise. IJ Apart from the urgent need to repair and maintain a critical mass of physical and social infrastructure, one of the key areas on which the authorities intend to focus their reform efforts is the civil service. The Government's payroll covered an estimated 570,000 in 1995, including 71,500 retired civil servants and some 142,000 in the military. levels are considered excessive, Current staffing being neither justified by needs nor consistent with available resources. Staff compensation has been eroded by inflation and constrained by budgetary resources, and salaries effectively paid by the Treasury have fallen to extraordinarily low levels (about US$12 a month on average in 1995). A first practical step was taken to improve control over employment and the payroll by removing a total of 13,000 staff (mostly ghost workers) from government rosters in 1995. Plans are being developed for voluntary departures of civil servants, but the lack of funding is likely to prevent their quick implementation. For 1996, all staff who have reached retirement age (a total of about 15,000) will be obliged to retire by midyear. Also, the authorities will continue to enforce a ban on recruitment and promotions. . The revitalization of the public enterprise sector is another policy concern of the authorities. As of end-1994, the Government's portfolio included 56 wholly owned public enterprises, with a combined turnover of about US$900 million, and some 60 mixed companies. The authorities' approach to restructuring this portfolio is to associate private partners in the manage- ment of publicly owned assets (e.g., the railways sector), and in the develop- ment of new mining operations (notably for copper). Although there is some encouraging evidence of investor interest, the authorities still need to design a comprehensive strategy and adopt a legal framework for the public sector reforms and privatization. To this end, draft legislation has been submitted to Parliament that aims at clarifying the legal procedures involved and setting transparent rules for the divestiture of public enterprises. Finally, the authorities expect to restructure the banking system, which may involve the closure or merger of several commercial banks, and to stream- line the central bank's operating structure, with technical assistance from the Fund. In other areas, reforms are only at a preparatory stage, and not much concrete action can realistically be expected outside the framework of a comprehensive adjustment program, with technical and financial assistance from the international community. for tax and customs reforms, A committee has been named to prepare proposals which would aim at simplifying the tax structure, IJ 'The World Bank staff team that visited Kinshasa in December 1995 agreed with the authorities on a series of steps to be taken with a view to formulating a comprehensive structural reform agenda, with possible technical assistance from the Bank.

It is expected that ZaXre's tax reform efforts will benefit from Fund technical assistance, beginning in the second quarter of 1996. Additional structural reform plans, notably in the areas of agricultural development, education, and health, are also under preparation, which may benefit from the assistance of World Bank staff at a later stage. 5. Statistical issues and urozram monitoring The authorities agreed with the staff on the need to strengthen the collection and compilation of statistics, with a view to improving the formu- lation of economic and financial policies. Priority areas include monetary data and balance of payments estimates. As a first step, and pending the development of a well-formulated strategy to address all statistical issues in a comprehensive fashion, the authorities intend to review the compilation of monetary statistics, with Fund technical assistance. Moreover, to strengthen the monitoring of economic and financial developments, the Bank of Zafre has been publishing a weekly bulletin of indicators, which is forwarded to the staff on a regular basis. To help in the monitoring of economic and financial policies. the Zafrian authorities have adopted a number of quantitative and structural benchmarks for 1996 (Table 7). The authorities intend to ensure the observance of these benchmarks in order to facilitate attainment of their policy objectives, and establish a track record of improved policy performance. A positive outcome would strengthen the credibility of their stabilization efforts, which would assist Zaire in seeking to resume cooperation with the Fund and restoring normal relations with the international community. IV. Medium-Term Adiustment Strategy The challenges facing the authorities are formidable, considering the impact on the economy of several years of hyperinflation (see Box 1). Placing the economy back on a sustainable growth path and toward external viability will require a firm commitment to fiscal discipline, tight monetary policies, as well as wide-ranging structural reforms, once inflation has been brought durably under control. Nevertheless, Zafre's economic potential remains considerable, given not only its vast mineral reserves--many of which are still unexploited--but also its fertile land and diversified economic base. When essential infrastructure (especially the transportation network) is back in operation, and provided that the authorities pursue the right macroeconomic policies and maintain an investor-friendly regulatory environment, it is estimated that Zafre's economy could recover quickly and sustain growth rates well above 5 percent per annum over the medium term. An analysis of the medium- and long-term macroeconomic prospects suggests that even with an optimal set of policies, Zajire would be faced with large external financing gaps for some time (Appendix IV).

ZaXre's debt service payments due in that year alone would amount to US$7 billion (100 percent of GDP), including-the requirements to clear some US$6% bil,lion in arrears. out of this total, an estimated.USS1.6 billion would not be reschedulable (including some US$450 million--102 percent of quota-- in overdue ob.ligations to the Fund, and an estimated US$720 million in debt payments arrears vis-,a-vis other multilateral financial institutions, mostly the African Development Bank). Clearly,. a special concerted effort by Zaire's major creditors and donors would be required to mobilize external assistance to meet financing needs on such a scale. However, while ZaTre's external debt burden is heavy, the baseline scenario indicates that once the initial problem of arrears is resolved, a comprehensive adjustment could set the economy on a path toward debt sustainability within about 10 years. Under this scenario, the ratio of debt to GDP would decline from an estimated 230 percent in 1995 to less than 100 percent by 2005, and further to 55 percent in 2015; in parallel, the debt service would fall to some 25 percent of export earnings, declining thereafter to 13 percent in 2015. In net present value terms, the debt ratio to exports Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public. - 13 - would fall from 800 percent in 1995 to 230 percent in 2005, and 115 percent by 2015. The projected debt profile is predicated on.a number of critical assumptions regarding. the treatment of Zafre's external debt obligations: (a) an up-front clearance of nonreschedulable arrears in 1997; (b) a flow rescheduling of Zafre's eligible pre-cutoff-date debt obligations on Naples terms (with 67 percent concessionality on non-ODA pre-cutoff-date debt and a top-up from 33 percent to 67 percent for amounts previously rescheduled on Toronto terms); (c) a stock of debt operation, also at 67 percent concession- ality, at the end of the three-year consolidation period of the flow resched- uling; and (d) substantial inflows of program assistance (averaging some 12 percent of GDP) in the first three years, which is at the upper end of what could reasonably be -expected to be forthcoming in support of a strong adjustment program. The underlying adjustment has several key features: (a) sustained fiscal consolidation that,would allow a continued increase in public savings, and contribute to a sharp upswing in the domestic savings rate over the medium term; (b) a recovery of exports, with volumes growing initially by some 9ll percent annually through 1998 and by about 5 percent thereafter; (c) a rising contribution of private investment, financed in part by net private capital inflows; (d) a steady increase in gross investment to 9% percent of GDP in 2005 and further to 19 percent of GDP in 2015; and (e) tight demand management and realistic exchange rate policies that keep import growth broadly in line with income. The underlying savings and investment balances imply that the external current account deficit (including official transfers, and before debt relief) would narrow sharply from 9.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to a range of 2-3 percent through 2000, and decline steadily thereafter. 3;/ The convergence of Zafre's debt indicators toward the threshold values for sustainability within about ten years is reasonably robust, but there are a number of areas of uncertainty. First, the scenario assumes a steady implementation of adjustment policies designed to promote sustainable economic growth, which presupposes inter alia a stable political environment. Second, the initial stages of a comprehensive adjustment program would greatly hinge on the phasing of the repayments of nonreschedulable arrears, and the mix of options actually selected by bilateral creditors in debt rescheduling opera- tions. Third, the adjustment path could be subject to 'terms of trade shocks, while the recovery of private investment and exports would depend on the extent and speed to which capital inflows respond to the improved credibility of policies. Fourth, the timing for the start of the adjustment program may JJ The initial drop in the external current account deficit would result largely from the consolidation of debt payments arrears. In 1995, accrued late interest on arrears was estimated at US$440 million, or the equivalent of 7.3 percent of GDP.

The'progress achieved so far,'however; is fragile and much remains to be done. Inflation is still too high and volatile, as evidenced by,the surge in. prices during the last quarter of 1995. The exchange market is susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiments and is yet to be convinced of the credibility and sustainability of the authorities' disinflation policies. At the same time, the disinflation strategy has exposed major weaknesses in the banking system lJ Another source of uncertainty is the limitation of data; especially with regard to estimates of imports and private capital flows in the balance of payments.

Successful stabilization will require that the authorities address these issues forcefully in the context of their program for 1996. First, the authorities' commitment to balance the budget 'and to forgo monetary financing of treasury operations is key; it leaves them with very little room for maneuver. It calls for a vigorous revenue mobilization effort. At the same time, to enhance the acceptability of the stabilization program and its sustainability, expenditure priorities must be clearly defined and strictly implemented without accumulating new domestic arrears and without imparting sharp fluctuations to the fiscal impulse. Wage adjustments are unavoidable in the short run, but these should remain mod&rate, in order not to crowd out other outlays, and to help moderate inflationary expectations. Second, the sanctions imposed on banks with solvency problems and the tighten- ing of criteria for access to the refinancing window are essential steps toward gaining control over reserve money growth; but very much needed as well is a restructuring of the banking system. The authorities should also imple- ment in a determined manner the new flexible interest rate policy, which aims at establishing a positive real interest rate structure. The recent increase in interest rates is a good signal to the markets. Decisive measures should be taken to deal with the problems posed by the deficit of the Bank of Zaire, along with those of the publicly owned'commercial banks, to contain the monetary pressures stemming from these sources. In any event, the Treasury must provide timely transfers 'to cover the central bank's deficit if the monetary targets are to be achieved. The authorities'should also take full advantage of Fund technical assistance recommendations to restructure the operations and management of the Bank so as to put it on a sound footing. Consistent with their intent to restore active cooperation with the Fund, the ZaXrian authorities have indicated to the staff their determination to pursue their stabilization policies in 1996. They have set firm policy targets, with quarterly benchmarks, which the staff has been requested to monitor. This is welcome. The targets are ambitious but appropriate. The underlying policies are essential for consolidating the stabilization gains and for establishing a credible track record of policy performance. Substan- tial progress under the authorities' program should prepare the ground for a sustained and comprehensive adjustment, which could benefit from a resumption of external financial support. A credible and comprehensive adjustment cannot be delayed, if Zaire's very difficult external payments prospects are not to be further compromised. The authorities need to formulate a medium-term framework for fiscal consoli- dation, public sector portfolio restructuring, and infrastructure rebuilding that could position the economy on the path to recovery and durable growth. Given the present state of the economy, the staff's current assessment is that even with a strong set of policies, external debt sustainability and viability would still be distant, and that progress toward it would require significant up-front debt relief and external assistance on a scale that is in thr- upper limits of what could plausibly be expected in support of a strong adjustment program.

This represents a significant effort, considering the tight foreign exchange situation, and signals the authorities' commitment to stabilize the level of arrears to the Fund as soon as possible. ZaZre maintains an exchange and payments system with few formal restric- tions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. In practice, the limit on outward remittances by expatriates is not binding, as the exportation of foreign currency is free. The new system of exchange rate determination leans heavily on the market-based quotations of the foreign exchange bureaus. As the disinflation strategy takes hold, this should help eliminate the multiple currency practice arising from the segmen- tation of the exchange market, which is subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. As regards the restrictions arising from the existence of external payments arrears,. the staff urges the authorities to strengthen their adjust- ment strategy, with a view to paving the way for a comprehensive solution to Zaire's external payments problems. In view of the absence of a timetable for the elimination of the remaining restrictions and the multiple currency practice, the staff does not recommend approval of their retention by Zafre. Finally, Zafre maintains and periodically publishes a rather comprehen- sive set of economic statistics, which facilitates macroeconomic assessments. However, the staff encourages the authorities to improve the internal consistency and coverage of these data, especially in the areas of the national accounts and the balance of payments. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Zaire be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Nonfinancial Relations VII. Exchanee Rate Arrannement \ The national currency, the.new zafre, is freely floating. The exchange market was. unified in December 1990. The new Zaire (NZ) was introduced on October 19, 1993 at a parity of NZ 1 to 3 million old zaj;res, and at an initial rate of NZ 3 per U.S. dollar. Local currency equivalent: NZ 22,045 = SDR 1 VIII. Article IV Consultation with the Fund Zaire is on the standard 12-month cycle. The staff report for the 1994 Article IV consultation with Zafre (SM/94/115, 5/g/94) was considered by the Executive Board on June 1, 1994. The Executive Board adopted the following decision: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Zafre's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3, and in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with ZaTre in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63) adopted on April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Zafre's restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions are maintained in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, except that the exchange restrictions evidenced by certain external payments arrears are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and that the.multiple currency practice arising from the segmentation of the exchange market is subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. 3. The Fund encourages ZaFre to take appropriate steps to remove the ,remaining restrictions maintained under Article XIV as soon as circumstances permit and urges elimination of the measures subject to Article VIII. IX. Resident ReDresentative A resident representative post in Kinshasa was opened in 1984. The last staff member to hold the position, Mr. Ebrahim-Zadeh, was recalled in February 1993 because of the security situation.

Recent Technical Assistance The provision of technical assistance by the Fund to Zajire was banned following the declaration of non-cooperation, in February 1992. However, to support the- authorities' adjustment efforts, the Executive Board authorized the resumption of technical assistance on August 3, 1995. Following this decision, a MAE mission visited Kinshasa during the first half of December, 1995 to review the Bank of ZaTre's needs for technical assistance, notably in the areas of management and audit, and bank supervision. A STA mission is planned for February 1996 to review financial statistics, and FAD staff are expected to advise the authorities on tax reform plans later in the year.

Bank group operations financed physical and social infrastructure, production activities, institutional building, and adjustment programs. The distribution of World Bank lending was as follows (in percent of total, based on original loan amounts): Agriculture 10.3 Mining and industry 26.4 Energy 4.4 Transport and infrastructure 38.0 Population and health 6.7 Economic management and technical assistance 4.0 Adjustment lending 10.2 IFC participated in five investment operations in Zaire, for a total of US$47 million, and in several equity participations for US$2 million. In the light of deteriorating economic and financial conditions during 1990-93, the Bank streamlined its portfolio to focus on urgent rehabilitation and social needs of the country. On July 15, 1993, IDA disbursements were suspended, following Zaire's failure to settle outstanding debt obligations. On November 15, 1993, Zaire was declared on nonaccrual status, and the port- folio was subsequently canceled and closed. The Bank's resident mission in Kinshasa was closed in January 1994. As of end-December 1995, Zafre's outstanding obligations to the World Bank Group amounted to US$1,436 million, and overdue obligations totaled US$141 million (of which US$51 million vis-a-vis IBRD, US$49 million vis-a-vis IDA, and US$41 million vis-a-vis IFC).

Introduction This appendix supplements the discussion of Zafre's medium-term balance of payments outlook and assesses the sustainability of the debt service burden over a 20-year horizon. Zafre is a resource-rich country with considerable potential for a rapid and sustained recovery of output and exports. Nonethe- less, the-country's capacity to service a very large stock of external debt remains uncertain, even on the assumption of a restructuring on favorable terms of eligible debt obligations by Paris Club and other bilateral creditors, and the resumption of substantial flows of grants and concessional lending. 2. External debt burden Zafre's outstanding external debt (including arrears) was estimated at USS13.8 billion as of end-1995, equivalent to 230 percent of GDP. The increase in external debt during the last five years reflected almost entirely the accrual of arrears, as there has been virtually no new lending since 1990. From 1991 to 1995, on average, Zafre's actual external debt service payments were equivalent to only about 4 percent of scheduled debt obligations, and external debt payments arrears (including unpaid late interest) rose from US$l.l billion to USS7.8 billion. Scheduled debt service represented 62 per- cent of exports of goods and nonfactor services in 1995; including late interest, it is estimated that Zafre's debt service ratio exceeded 90 percent (Tables IV-1 to IV-3). The net present value of the debt as at end-1995 was estimated at USS11.9 billion, equivalent to some 800 percent of exports of goods and non- factor services. The average grant element on the stock of current principal was approximately 30 percent, and on total outstanding debt (including arrears), 14 percent. 3. Medium-term scenario - key assumptions and results a. Program assistance and financing gaps The baseline scenario assumes a continuation and strengthening in 1996 of the stabilization program pursued by the Government in 1995, and the implemen- tation from 1997 onward of a comprehensive adjustment program strong enough to warrant Fund support (under the ESAF) and program lending by other multi- lateral institutions as well as bilateral donors. In this scenario, approval of an ESAF arrangement in 1997 would be preceded by a period of monitoring by the Fund, during which payments would rise to a level at least sufficient to lJ The main elements of the external debt sustainability analysis were discussed with World Bank staff, who expressed basic agreement with the conclusions.

It is assumed that ZaZre is granted up-front access under the putative ESAF arrangement sufficient to repay bridge loans disbursed to clear arrears with the Fund, in line with the experience of some other protracted arrears cases. 1/ At this stage, none of the program assistance implied in the medium-term scenario is identified. Thus ) &ricto sensu, the whole need for program assistance constitutes a financing gap, a which would have to be covered by renewed flows from the Fund, the World Bank, and other multilateral institu- tions and bilateral donors. If the gaps could plausibly be filled throughout the projection period, Zarre's debt situation would be seen as potentially sustainable. Under the baseline scenario, only 1997 presents a residual financing need that exceeds plausible program assistance flows. All arrears on multilateral and post-cutoff-date bilateral official debt would be cleared in this year, resulting in a very large financing need. Out of some USS2.5 billion in required program assistance over'l997-99, nearly US$2 billion would fall in the first year of this period. After 1997, however, the projected levels of program assistance decline sharply, to US$370 million and US$160 million in 1998 and 1999, respectively (Tables IV-4 and IV-5). The magnitude of Zafre's financing requirements in 1997 would clearly pose a difficult challenge to the authorities. J/ The projected financing gap could be more plausibly covered if it could be spread out over a three- year period. For instance, Paris Club creditors might be willing to defer the clearance of arrears on post-cutoff-date debt within the three-year consolida- tion period of the rescheduling arrangement assumed to take place in 1997. Similarly, ZaTre's financing needs could be smoothed if the settlement of arrears vis-a-vis some multilateral institutions were phased over two or three years, By stretching out the reduction of nonreschedulable arrears in this way, the projected new flows of program assistance over the period 1997-99 would be more evenly distributed, rather than heavily front-loaded as in the baseline scenario. In this case, the amount of program assistance required over 1997-99, though large, would be within the bounds of what could reasonably be expected by way of disbursements. lJ Total access under the assumed ESAF arrangement is 180 percent of the current quota, with 100 percent (SDR 291 million) on approval. Being in arrears to the Fund, Zarre did not participate in the last quota increase in November 1992. After clearing its overdue obligations to the Fund, Zafre's quota would normally be raised to SDR 394.8 million; access under the assumed ESAF would be equivalent to 133 percent of the new quota. 2J This convention is used in Table IV-5, in which all official transfers and official loan disbursements correspond to project assistance. 3J. While .part of the gap could be covered by the sale of public assets (e.g., public enterprises and mining rights), this has not been factored in the projections as there is little basis to assess the amounts that could be mobilized in this way.

The underlying inflows of program assistar;<+e from 2000 to 2015 in the baseline scenario average 1.1 percent of GDP, wiLli a peak of 1.8 percent in the first year. Program assistance on such a scale would be broadly in line with ZaTre's past experience or with that of other developing countries. b. Medium-term macroeconomic proiections Under the program, gross investment would increase steadily from 2.7 per- cent of GDP in 1995 to 11 percent of GDP in 2005, and 19 percent of GDP in 2015. Private investment is projected to account for about three fourths of the increase, 1997. Much of financed in part by net private capital inflows, beginning in this would be expected initially to rebuild Zafre's physical and social infrastructure, and to develop the vast mineral reserves and other export sectors. The repatriation of private capital and direct foreign investment would rise to the equivalent of 3 percent of GDP by 2001, before levelling off and gradually declining in relation to national income. The sustained increase in investment, combined with the existence of extensive unused capacity at the beginning of the program period, would permit average ., real GDP growth to exceed 5 percent a year over the medium term. The incre- mental capital-output ratio is projected to decline from an average of over 3 in the first years of the program to about 1.5 by 2015, as returns to investment projects progressively come on stream through the projection period. National savings would show a sharp increase in 1997, mainly as a result of the drop in interest on the external public debt, since arrears are assumed to be rescheduled on concessional terms. The sustained fiscal consolidation, which is an integral part of the adjustment program, would entail a continued rise in public savings, although this would be partially offset in the first few years of the program by a fall in private savings. Zaire's external current account deficit (including sfficial transfers, before debt relief) would shrink dramatically in 1997, GDP. Subsequently, from 9.6 percent of GDP to 2.1 percent of after remaining in the range of 2%-3% percent of GDP through 1999, the current account deficit is projected to narrow gradually to the end of the projection period. Since interest on rescheduling exceeds scheduled interest throughout the projection period, lJ 'the current account deficit after debt relief is on average about 1 percentage point of GDP higher in the period 1997-2015 than the deficit computed on the basis of currently scheduled interest. Excluding official transfers, the current account deficit after debt relief would average 2% percent of GDP over the projection period, reaching 1% percent of GDP in 2015. Exports rebounded in 1995, after a long period of decline, and this recovery would be consolidated and sustained in the context of a comprehe.nsive adjustment program. Export volumes are projected to grow by an average of lJ Late interest, which makes up a large proportion of interest due lin 1995 and 1996, is not scheduled, contrary to interest on the rescheduled stock o'f unpaid late interest.

All major categories of exports--including metals, diamonds, coffee, and other agricultural exports-- are projected to grow steadily in volume terms over the twenty-year horizon. Nevertheless, the projections are in some ways conservative, especially as copper exports would not return to their mid-1980s level before the end of the projection period. Import volumes are projected to show a similar growth pattern, as the rapid pick-up in investment would imply a surge in capital good imports early on. The income elasticity of imports is assumed to average 1.2 from 1997-99 before settling down to around unity for the rest of the projection period. The prices of Zafre's main exports are expected to decline relative to import pricesby an average of 1 percent a year over the ten years beginning in 1996. IThe projected prices of copper and coffee, in particular, would fall over the next few years. From 2005 to 2015, it is assumed that there is no further change in the terms of trade. The evolution of the deficit on services largely reflects the path of interest obligations, giving the same sharp fall (7 percentage points of GDP) in 1997 and a gradual decline thereafter. Nonfactor services are projected to register a deficit of some 8% percent of GDP in 1996 and 1997, shrinking slowly to less than 7 percent in 2005 and about 6 percent in 2015. One aim of the program would be for Za'ire to steadily reconstitute its gross international reserve position. Over the period 1997-2015, gross reserves are assumed to rise by an average of US$40 million a year, reaching 2.1 months of imports (US$l billion) by the end of the projection horizon, compared with 1.3 months (US$l55 million) at end-1995. C. Assumntions concerninp debt relief The projections assume that, in the context of an adjustment program supported by an arrangement with the Fund, the Zaerian authorities would reach understandings in 1997 with Paris Club creditors on a flow rescheduling of eligible pre-cutoff-date debt obligations. The rescheduling would be on Naples terms, with a three-year consolidation period corresponding closely to the period of the assumed ESAF arrangement. Non-ODA pre-cutoff-date debt is assumed to be granted 67 percent concessionality, with ODA debt being resched- uled over 40 years (with a 16-year grace period) on terms at least as favorable as the original loans. The concessfonality on amounts previously rescheduled on Toronto terms is assumed to be topped up from 33 percent to 67 percent. Other bilateral claims would be accorded the same treatment as Paris Club debt. For simplicity, all creditors are assumed to choose the debt reduction option under the Naples menu. Over the period to 2015, this implies slightly higher debt service than a mix of the three concessional options (debt reduction, debt service reduction, and capitalization of moratorium interest). If any creditors were to choose the nonconcessional (long maturi- ties) option, however, the debt service burden would be somewhat heavier than assumed in the baseline scenario. In the year 2000, after the end of the three-year consolidation period of the flow rescheduling, it is assumed that the Paris Club would agree to a stock of debt operation. By then, the ratio of the net present value of debt Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - APPENDIX IV to exports of goods and nonfactor services would be falling rapidly and t e debt service ratio (after rescheduling) would stabilize at about 25 perceiit. The likelihood of a stock of debt operation is highly uncertain, since it is unclear whether creditors would be confident that this would constitute an exit rescheduling. However, assuming a single operation is a convenient simplification, which does not affect significantly the evolution of the debt and debt service ratios relative to the alternative of continued flow resched- ulings on Naples terms. For the stock of debt operation, as for the flow rescheduling, it was assumed that 'all creditors choose the debt reduction option, and that concessionality on amounts consolidated on Toronto terms is topped up $0 67 percent. As regards Zaire's commercial debt, which is all in arrears, it was assumed that the outstanding stock of debt is bought back in 1998 at a price of 20 cents on the dollar. d. Debt and debt service ratios In the baseline scenario, the ratio of debt to GDP would fall from 230 percent in 1995 to 100 percent in 2007 and 60 percent in 2015. Over the same period, the ratio of the net present value of debt to exports of goods and services would decline even more dramatically, from 800 percent to 120 percent--falling below 250 percent in nine years, 200 percent in 12 years, and 150 percent in 16 years. Reflecting the assumed up-front clearance of nonreschedulable arrears, the ratio of debt service to exports of goods and nonfactor services spikes to 112 percent in 1997, before settling at about 25 percent until 2005, and declining steadily thereafter to reach 14 percent in 2015 (Table IV-3). Were the settlement of nonreschedulable arrears to be phased, as discussed above, cent during 1997-99, the debt service ratio would average about 53 per- and would remain below 26 percent thereafter. Given the low initial base of government revenue in Zafre, and despite steady increases in the ratio of revenue to GDP throughout the projection period, the ratio of debt service to revenues in the baseline scenario remains high until the latter part of the projection horizon. Debt service obliga- tions in 1995 were almost three times as high as government revenue; after assumed debt relief, debt service is projected to average 57 percent of revenue over 1997-2015, and to remain in excess of 20 percent by the end of this period. Nevertheless, these ratios would be consistent with a steady increase in nondebt government expenditure relative to GDP. 4. Sensitivity analysis The main assumptions underlying the baseline scenario are subject to various downside risks. To illustrate the sensitivity of the results to variations in such assumptions, three variations were considered (Table IV-6). If the prices of the main metals exported by Zajlre were 10 percent, lower than assumed in the baseline scenario, there would be a cumulative export shortfall over the 20-year horizon,of about USS2.8 billion. The current account deficit would be expected to be about 1 percent of GDP larger throughout the projection period, and the ratio of debt service to exports of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 38 - APPENDIX IV goods and nonfactor services would be higher by about 3 percentage points. The improvement in the ratios of debt to GDP and the net present value of debt to exports would also be slower than in the baseline scenario. With metals accounting for about a fourth of Zaire's merchandise exports in 1995 and projected to make up more than a third of total exports on average over the medium term, a 10 percent drop in metals prices is roughly equivalent in its impact to a 3 percent deterioration in the terms of trade, other things being equal. Any other source of a terms of trade deterioration of this broad magnitude would therefore be expected to have a similar effect. The second variation on the baseline assumptions was to let annual export volume growth be lower by 1 percentage point throughout the projection period. The effects of this assumption are less marked initially but greater in the outer years than in the first alternative scenario. The cumulative export shortfall over the period 1996-2015 would be over US$5 billion, resulting in a current account deficit greater on average by more than 1 percentage point of GDP. Again, the improvement in the indicators of the debt service burden would be slowed, as it would now take over ten years for the debt service ratio to settle below 25 percent. The improvement in the ratio of debt service to exports of goods and nonfactor services virtually halts after 2010, although the downward trend would resume after 2015. With even lower export growth, however, the dynamics could be altered decisively and put external debt on an explosive path. Finally, the impact of less concessional borrowing terms was considered. If the interest rate on new program loans were one point higher than in the baseline scenario, the additional financing costs would build up gradually to approach US$90 million a year by 2015. Over 1997-2015, the cumulative extra cost would be about USSO. billion, and the current account deficit would be 0.2 percentage point higher than in the baseline scenario. On average, the debt senrice ratio would be higher by about 2 percentage points. This scenario suggests that, were Zafre to borrow exclusively at market rates, the debt service ratio would be unlikely to attain sustainable levels and the debt burden could grow progressively heavier over time. 5. Conclusion In the baseline scenario, Zafre's debt burden attains sustainable levels within about ten years. Nevertheless, such a scenario implies a need for program assistance in the first few years that is at the upper end of what could normally be expected in support of a strong adjustment program. Thus, assuming that the authorities establish a solid track record of performance in 1996, there could be a case for special treatment of the stock of arrears over 1997-99 as a prerequisite to attain external debt sustainability. Shortfalls in export volume growth, adverse terms of trade developments, and less favorable borrowing terms were all seen to slow significantly the projected improvement of key indicators. However, the assumptions underlying the baseline scenario may in some respects be overly conservative. In particular, after a long period of dramatic contraction of economic activity, there may be scope for several years of rapid recovery before growth settles to the long-run trend rate. The baseline scenario also incorporates a gradual Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - APPENDIX IV deterioration of the terms of trade over the next ten years, and no improve- ment in the period 2006-15. Even so, by the end of the projection period, all indicators of the debt service burden are well below conventional threshold values for sustainability, and still declining steadily.

The central bank also issues a monthly Statistical Bulletin and occasionally a Survey of Recent Monetary and Financial Developments, the latter, as well as a weekly Statistical Summary. Except for basis, these documents have not been forwarded to the Fund on a regular and AFR staff normally update data on the occasion of missions. reflecting organizational problems, Mostly and often with long delays. data reporting to STA has been irregular The quality of data is uneven, and in many cases their interpretation has been subject to considerable uncertainty because of hyperinflation since 1991. 1. OutstandinP statistical issues a. Real sector Price and international trade statistics are being reported to STA with significant delays. The most recent figures refer to August 1995 for the consumer price index and to July 1995 for trade statistics. National accounts data have been provided only through 1993. Foreign trade statistics are reported in SDRs, rather than in local currency as usually practiced in other countries. No information has been provided to STA regarding the methodologies underlying the compilation of the consumer price index and the national accounts. b. Government finance The quality and coverage of data published in the GFS Yearbook (GFSY) have deteriorated in recent years. Since 1992, no data on extrabudgetary and social security operations have been reported. In particular, the non- reporting of expenditure financed by foreign grants and loans results in expenditure figures that are much lower than the corresponding figures from AFR. Data reported for GFSY are also included in IFS. No monthly or quarterly data are reported for IFS. C. Monetarv accounts Reporting of monetary data from the Bank of Zafre has not been timely and the quality of data reported is poor. Following an in-house review over the last two years, STA streamlined the IFS report forms and introduced some changes in the presentation on monetary statistics, including the reclassifi- cation of revaluation accounts and restricted deposits. However, a number of long-standing statistical problems remain unresolved. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 48 - APPENDIX V d. Balance of navments Zafre does not report balance of payments data to the Fund's Statistics Department. Balance of payments data published for 1982-90 were provided by desk economists, Data for subsequent years were not considered suitable for publication by STA. 2. Technical assistance missions in statistics (1992-nresent) None. Following the Executive Board decision of August 1995 to lift the suspension of Fund technical assistance to Zaire, STA has responded favorably to a recent request by the authorities for assistance in the area of money and banking statistics. The proposed mission, which is scheduled for the.second half of February 1996, will conduct a thorough review of the Bank of Zarre's procedures for collecting and compiling monetary statistics for the monetary authorities and the deposit money banks.
