Introduction The mission u that visited Yerevan between July 31-August 14, 1995 conducted discussions for the first review under the one-year stand-by arrangement (SBA) for Armenia approved by the Board on June 28, 1995 in an amount equivalent to SDR 43.875 million (65 percent of quota). 2/ The mission also conducted the 1995 Article IV and Article XIV consultation discussions, and met with Prime Minister Bagratian, Minister of Finance Barkhoudarian, Minister of Economy Andreasian, Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) Chairman Asatrian and senior officials of the Government and the CBA. The mission overlapped with a series of World Bank missions that were initiating work on a structural adjustment credit for early 1996. The authorities have indicated their intention to seek Fund support under the ESAF for a medium- term program by end-1995. Armenia became a member of the Fund in May 1992 and avails itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. At the last Article IV Board discussion in July 1994, Executive Directors, while acknowledging the regional conflict and the earthquake destruction as serious disruptions in Armenia's move toward a market economy, had called for an acceleration of structural reforms to lay the basis for medium-term growth. Executive Directors had expressed the hope that, with a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the Fund could move quickly to provide financial assistance in support of an ambitious stabilization and structural adjustment program. The timeliness and coverage of Armenia's economic data are good and sufficient both for monitoring the SBA and for surveillance purposes. The quality of the data base continues to improve, but weaknesses remain (Appendix IV). L/ The mission comprised Messrs. Catsambas (Head), Gilmore, Ms. Thacker (EUR II), Messrs. Jen (PDR), Gerson (FAD), Fadeyev (BLS), and Ms. Baker (Administrative Assistant, EUR II). Ms. Jones, who will assume her duties as the Resident Representative on September 20, accompanied the mission and participated in policy discussions. Z?/ See EBS/95/100 dated 06/13/95. In December 1994, an STF-supported program was approved by the Executive Board, followed on June 28, 1995, by a 12-month SBA (June 1, 1995-May 31, 1996) and a second purchase under the STF.

Performance Under the SBA and Recent Economic Developments 0 All performance criteria wexe met. l Parliamentary elections in July returned current coalition to power. l Improved coordination between the fiscal and the monetary authorities has resulted in improved control of monetary aggregates, although uncertainties remain. Fiscal policy has been prudent. l Structural reforms continued apace. l Future challenges include the strengthening of the tax base, banking reform and an accelerated pace of enterprise restructuring. 1. Performance under the SBA While all the performance criteria under the SBA were met (Annex 1, Table l), some with comfortable margins, external arrears were accumulated by Armenian state enterprises on payments to Russia and Turkmenistan for oil and gas imports, respectively. Arrears on payments for gas imports from Turkmenistan amounted to USS19.5 million, and arrears on oil imports from Russia to US$25 million at end-July. Acknowledging that delayed external payments would send an inappropriate signal to the international communit]y, the authorities have expressed the intention to regularize arrears and to preclude their recurrence in the future. The European Union (EU) extended loans to Armenia in the period 1992 to 1994 to pay for imports of food and medicine. The staff understands that the EU accepts that Armenia cannot service this debt and that the EU is taking steps to provide exceptional assistance consistent with the program and Armenia's limited capacity to pay. A principal payment of ECU 38 million (US$50 million) fell due on August 20, which Armenia has not paid pending action by the EU. In light of the understandings received from the EU, the staff does not consider that these liabilities give rise to arrears for program purposes. Most structural benchmarks through August 15, 1995 were also observed, and the authorities continued to show a strong commitment toward establishing the legal and institutional framework for a market economy (Annex 1, Table 2). The major exception was the non-imposition of reserve requirements on the Savings Bank, which the authorities felt lacked the necessary liquidity to comply.

Overview Since the last Executive Board discussion on the Article IV consultation with Armenia, significant progress has been made on all fronts: on regional issues, a July 1994 agreement formalized a de facto ceasefire and discussions for permanent peace have continued since then; on political issues, parliamentary elections held in July 1995 have returned the ruling coalition to power with an enhanced majority; and on economic issues, the authorities have successfully begun a comprehensive program of stabilization and economic reform which was initially supported by the STF and is currently supported by an SBA. By the end of 1994 stabilization was taking hold in Armenia and there were signs of a pick up in economic activity. A combination of bold structural reform measures, especially in fiscal policy, privatization, and price liberalization, coupled with restrictive financial policies during the last quarter of 1994 brought inflation down from nearly 50 percent per month during the first half of 1994 to 27 percent in the last quarter of last year. After a cumulative decline of nearly 60 percent during 1992-93, real GDP growth is estimated to have been 5 percent in 1994. Bolstered by the success of the stabilization program under the STF and significant official capital inflows, the Government pursued prudent macroeconomic policies that led to a continuation of growth with moderate inflation during the seven-month period to July 1995. Real GDP growth for 1995 is expected to be at least 5 percent with annual inflation under 30 percent (Table 1 and Chart 1). b. Fiscal oolicv Fiscal policy was highly successful in 1994, as the budget deficit fell from about 56 percent of GDP in 1993 to about 16 percent in 1994. Fiscal performance was broadly on track during the first half of 1995, with both nominal revenues and expenditures being slightly higher than anticipated. However, the nominal stock of tax arrears continued to rise, and the calling of contingent liabilities related to government-guaranteed domestic loans resulted in additional expenditure arrears. L/ A successful netting-out operation between tax and expenditure (budgetary) arrears was carried out, although this was clearly a symptomatic solution. The faster-than- programmed repayment of budgetary expenditure arrears (a structural benchmark) led to a cash deficit of 16.8 percent of GDP in the second quarter of 1995, or 1.8 percentage points higher than the program l/ The stock of expenditure arrears at the end of 1994 was revised to dram 11.9 billion, or 6 percent of GDP, from an original estimate of dram 11.3 billion, following more recent information received from local authorities.

With the authorities .establishing large deposits with the CBA, domestic financing was 5 percentage points of GDP lower than anticipated under the program (Table 2 and Chart 2). u c . Monetarv and credit nolicies Credit expansion in late 1994 and early 1995 was lower than anticipated under the STF-supported program, but monetary policy during the first half of 1995 was uneven: while a number of steps had been taken in late 1994- early 1995 to improve its effectiveness (including imposing reserve requirements on foreign exchange deposits, relaxation of official charges against cash withdrawals, and abolition of interest rate minima), unusually large official foreign capital inflows that were not effectively sterilized caused a surge in reserve money during the first quarter of 1995. This increase was initially reflected in a build up in banks' correspondent accounts with the CBA as government funds were transferred to spending ministry accounts with commercial banks. In line with staff recommendations, CBA improvements in sterilization procedures, and a markedly improved collaboration between the Ministry of Finance and the CBA sharply reduced NDA by the end of the quarter. As a result, reserve money was lower than programmed at end-June. These policies also allowed broad money growth to be held to 1 percent in June, after an increase of 40 percent between February and May (Tables 3 and 4). The multiplier, which had fallen owing to the earlier official inflows, subsequently reverted to its previous level. Following a five-month period of relative stability, refinance and auction interest rates declined rapidly in July, but remain highly positive in real terms. With projected annual inflation at 30 percent, lending rates at about 100 percent 3/ clearly incorporate a substantial risk premium (Chart 3). In particular, this premium reflects the lack of an effective legal structure for debt recovery, the low creditworthiness of the enterprise sector due to a serious arrears problem, and the existence of a high margin between deposit and lending rates. I-/ The 1995 nominal GDP figure has been revised downward in light of the projected lower inflation, resulting in an upward revision of some GDP ratios. 2/ Performance criteria on the CBA's NDA, bank credit to government and NFA would have been met even without the faster-than-anticipated disbursements under the World Bank Rehabilitation Credit. 3/ Because this rate is reported on a noncompound basis, the effective annual rate is about 160 percent. Unless otherwise stated, all interest rates in this report are on a noncompound annual basis as reported by the authorities.

The July result, however, is believed to reflect more an increase in aggregate supply, owing to seasonal factors, rather than reduced aggregate demand. d. Balance of pavments and exchange rate oolicv Beginning with the STF-supported program, several new regulations concerning external transactions were introduced and the authorities have shown particular commitment to the maintenance of a liberal trade regime. But the external situation remains weak, and a considerable part of Armenia's imnorts, which increased significantly from a year ago, reflects humanitarian assistance. While the total value of exports remained virtually unchanged from the same period a year earlier, the apparent stagnation is due to the halting of clearing trade L/ with Russia and a decline in clearing exports with Turkmenistan. During the first half of 1995, the external current account (excluding official transfers) showed a deficit of US$171 million, equivalent to about 27 percent of GDP (Chart 4). Reflecting large official inflows, both gross official reserves and net international reserves grew rapidly during the second quarter: at end-June gross reserves were US$73 million, equivalent to 1.5 months of imports, and net reserves at US$46 million exceeded the program floor by US$16 million. While external debt rose from US$200 million at end-1994 to US$307 million at end-June, due primarily to the disbursements from the World Bank and Russia, debt service remained low in the first half of 1995. An important aim of exchange rate oolicv since 1994 has been the relative stability of the dram. In the conditions prevailing during that period, it has been possible to achieve this objective while at the same time adhering to the targets of the monetary program. As a result, the auction exchange rate has remained within a band of dram 400-410 per U.S. dollar during 1995, although the exchange bureau cash rate was more volatile (Chart 5). The higher-than-expected increase in international reserves did not lead to a higher base money in the second quarter, as the Government refrained from spending the accumulated domestic equivalent of the official capital inflows. During the first six months of 1995 the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 3.8 percent, reflecting a depreciation against FSU currencies of 3.5 percent and an appreciation against the non-FSU currencies of 6.9 percent. At end-June, the overall REER of the dram was 31.4 percent higher than it was a year ago (Chart 6). 1/ Clearing trade is defined as an officially administered barter trade arrangement that seeks to maintain a balanced trade through unspecified exchange of goods, and periodically settles the residual through payments in cash.

Structural reforms Since early 1994, the Government has made a determined effort to deepen structural reforms, which have been conducive to the continuing upward trend in economic activity. Prices of most commodities, including the price of bread, have been liberalized and subsidies on most goods have been eliminated. lJ The prices of services that are still regulated (such as utilities and urban transport) are raised regularly with increases in costs, though energy prices cover only direct input costs. Privatization of small enterprises is on track, though that of medium- and large-scale enterprises is proceeding at a slower than envisaged pace. To encourage enterprise restructuring, the Government has set up a pilot group of ten loss-making enterprises, with the explicit purpose of restructuring those that are financially viable and liquidating others. Given the passage of the bankruptcy and collateral laws, this approach is expected to provide a powerful demonstration effect. f. The hurdles still ahead Despite positive developments under both the STF-supported program and the SBA, Armenia continues to face serious challenges in the future. On the political front, medium-term prospects for trade and growth will crucially depend on the lifting of the blockade along the westward and eastward trade routes. On the economic front, the netting out operation between tax and budgetary arrears, though a satisfactory organizational procedure, does not represent a long-term solution to the prevention of their recurrence. Thte fragility of the banking sector is not only a threat to the stability of the financial system but also complicates the analysis of monetary relationships. And the clearing trade relations with Russia and Turkmenistan have intensified the problem of interenterprise arrears, generated tax arrears, and caused the emergence of external arrears. On balance, therefore, the greatest challenges that lie ahead are clearly related to an acceleration of structural reforms and enterprise restructuring, which would unleash market forces and allow the emergence of a strong private sector. In agriculture, for example, the privatization of the distribution system would remove a major impediment to more rapid growth of this sector. More generally, the development of a market-oriented legal system would provide the framework for greater private sector initiative and entrepreneurial activity. It was with this perspective in mind that policy discussions covered not only the remainder of 1995 but also 1996 and further steps in the direction of an ESAF arrangement. L/ Mills and bakeries have not yet been privatized and are still subject to profit margin restrictions, which will remain in place until they are privatized in 1996.

Program and Policv Discussions Discussions focussed on required policy adjustments to the program to ensure that it remains on track in 1995 and to strengthen the 1996 outlook. I/ Although policy discussions for 1996 were preliminary, the authorities requested an early input from the staff to incorporate it in the initial preparations of the 1996 budget. Policy discussions also addressed longer-term policy issues, especially in the areas of wage policy and exchange rate policy. Based on these understandings, the program aims at raising growth to 8 percent for 1996 while halving inflation to about 14 percent (Table 1). 1. Fiscal oolicv and budgetary reform l Discussions on fiscal policy aimed at keeping the domestic deficit (see footnote 1, page 13) at program levels for both 1995'and 1996. l The authorities agreed to a new package of fiscal measures effective October 1, 1995 and January 1, 1996. Box 1 summarizes the revised fiscal estimates for 1995 and 1996 and compares them with the original program targets. a. Prosoects for 1995 In addition to the tax arrears and the contingent liabilities noted earlier, preliminary information on goods and services expenditure in the first weeks of the third quarter indicated that overruns were so substantial as to jeopardize the program targets for that quarter. The staff was assured that no outstanding second quarter contingent liabilities remained to be called, and the budget had stopped the practice of providing guarantees since late 1994. To ensure the feasibility of the fiscal objectives of the program for 1995, the authorities have decided to adopt additional revenue and expenditure measures 2J designed at keeDine the nominal domestic deficit of the state government at the level envisaged under the program; this would ensure that domestic bank financing would not exceed program levels. 3J The new exDenditure measures are expected to yield savings equivalent to 2 percent of fourth-quarter GDP. On the revenue side, the authorities have agreed to introduce ahead of schedule l/ Revenue projections for the remainder of 1995 and 1996 have been revised downward due to a more appreciated exchange rate than assumed under the program, and to revised projections about the enterprise profits tax.

The authorities agreed with the staff that the potential for new w arrears could undermine the feasibility of the fiscal objectives, especially since, following a temporary reduction in the outstanding stock by June 1, they increased again during that month and stood at dram 11.3 billion (2.1 percent of 1995 GDP) as of July 1.

However, they are considering allowing the largest debtors I/ Some of the proposed excise rates are still low by international standards, leaving room for further revenue enhancement.

The staff stressed that this problem signals the need for greater enterprise restructuring efforts, and improved tax administration and the authorities agreed that it will be properly addressed as part of the enterprise medium-term strategy, which is already in progress with the assistance of the World Bank. b. The 1996 budget The authorities are aware that the 1996 budget will reflect a compromise among conflicting objectives, notably the continuation of the stabilization efforts, on the one hand, and the increased demands for budgetary resources from the deepening of structural reforms, especially in the context of a possible ESAF arrangement, on the other. The staff held preliminary discussions with the authorities on the possible expenditure priorities, taking into account the likely external assistance, the changing economic circumstances, especially in the energy sector, the enterprise restructuring plans, and the eventual abolition of the clearing trade. The staff emphasized that these understandings will need to be revisited in the context of discussions for an ESAF arrangement. On the exDenditure side, greater emphasis will be given to reform- related outlays, including legal and environmental issues, and the removal of structural impediments for the viable enterprises such as clearing trade arrangements and corporate governance (Box 2). Compared with the original program, the preliminary 1996 budget now calls for a nominal reduction in most current expenditures. u The authorities have also recognized that the proposed 70 percent nominal increase in the budget wage bill is not compatible with the present fiscal capacity of the country, and have agreed to scale down the increase to under 60 percent. These expenditure measures are expected to yield savings equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP. On the revenue side, the authorities have agreed to introduce additional revenue measures beginning January 1, 1996, which, coupled with the full-year effect of the measures to be adopted by October, are expected to contribute approximately 1 percent of 1996 GDP to tax collections. LZ/ The new tax and expenditure measures are expected to result in a 1996 deficit only slightly higher as a share of GDP than the original program projections. Nevertheless, the Government will continue to reduce its net indebtedness to the CBA (Table 2). 1/ The preliminary budget calls for a scaling down of health, education, and child allowances. The latter is not, strictly speaking, a reduction but a revised projection based on the actual take up rate observed during the first six months of 1995, which has already led to a revision in the second half of this year. 2/ Annex II lists the fiscal measures for the 1996 budget.

Environmental Issues Armenia has faced a variety of environmental problems in recent years, and the Government is beginning to take steps to address them: * The capital city of Yerevan escaped earthquake damage in 1988, but faces a potential environmental threat due to the planned m-opening of Medzamor nuclear station by end-September, 1995. The station, situated 30 kilometers to the west of Yerevan, lies on a seismic fault line, and had been closed since 1988. The Government feels that it has no choice but to open the plant, which can produce up to 23 percent of Armenia’s total electricity generation. * The air quality of Yerevan is less than optimal due to its situation in the Ararat Valley-- surrounded by mountains--that traps air pollutants. While only a few cars are driven in the capital city, and limited public transport and industry operate, the low grade of fuels used by vehicles creates a degree of smog. The Ararat Valley has also suffered from desalinization due to poor irrigation and water management practices, exhaustion of arable land, and deforestation for winter fuel. * An ongoing environmental concern has been the quantity and quality of the water in Lake Sevan, a large mountain lake situated in central Armenia. The water level of this lake fell by 20 meters during the last 60 years due to extensive water usage in the area. This depletion of water volume, combined with fertilizer/pesticide runoff and untreated sewage disposal, has threatened the ecosystem. The Government will soon pass a decision to limit how much water can be taken from the lake, and the World Bank has arranged a grant through the Institutional Development Fund to restore the ecosystem. 2. Monetarv policv and banking sector issues l Monetary policy aims at keeping inflation under 30 percent for 1995 and under 14 percent in 1996. l The state of the banking sector is a serious concern, despite recent measures to strengthen prudential requirements. l Interest rates remain highly positive in real terms, reflecting in part a considerable risk premium. l End-September performance criteria remain unchanged. a. Revised monetary nroiections for 1995 The primary objective of monetary policy continues to be the pursuit of low inflation, and the price level decline in July allows the program to target end-period inflation of under 30 percent. The interest rate decline during July and the relative stability of the exchange rate seem to indicate that the monetary program is not excessively tight and, therefore, the end- September performance criteria were not changed. However, while performance criteria are appropriate for the third quarter, the indicative target on Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - broad monev is now unlikely to be achieved. The revised program, therefore, calls for the same rates of broad money‘growth but starting from the higher level observed at end-June 1995. u For the year as a whole, broad money is thus projected to increase by a cumulative 46 percent, compared to the program target of 42 percent. Velocitv is expected to remain at its June level through the third quarter before picking up in the final quarter of the year due to seasonal influences (Tables 3 and 4). b. The monetary Dropram for 1996 Compared with initial program projections, broad money growth has been revised up from 22 percent to 25 percent for 1996, and the end-period inflation rate has been revised upward slightly from just under 10 percent to over 13 percent on an annual basis. The inflation pattern within the year has also been adjusted to give more recognition to seasonal factors. A slightly smaller repayment of credit by the Government to the banking sector is now projected. The money multinlier, though expected to increase slightly in 1996, has been difficult to predict; the fragility of the banking system, continuing structural changes, increases in liquidity requirements and improvements in the payment system, all make the demand for reserve money a difficult relationship to establish (Tables 3 and 4). On interest rate oolicy the authorities indicated that interest rates remain highly positive in real terms, in reflection of the perceived credit risks. The staff agreed that there may, therefore, be only limited scope for lowering interest rates much further until banks are able to enforce their claims more effectively. C. Structural reforms Banking system issues remain a serious concern, as bank capitalization remains low, nonperforming loans are a large part of banks' portfolios, and some banks do not comply with all prudential regulations. To avoid undermining the stabilization objectives, the staff has cautioned the authorities against providing CBA or budgetary resources until and unless well-defined strategies for restructuring ailing banks are in place. The staff has also advised against CBA or Government involvement in any deposit insurance scheme. The Government has refused to contribute funds to the Savings Bank to meet its reserve requirements, or later its prudential requirements. More generally, the authorities have enhanced the supervisory regime for banks and will require large commercial banks to be audited in 1996. In addition, a proposed tax treatment for loan loss writeoffs will also strengthen the banking system. 2/ An auction of short-term L/ In consultation with the authorities, indicative targets for NDA of the CBA and net bank credit to government for end-December and end-March have also been revised upward in line with broad money changes. 2/ The net fiscal impact of this move remains unclear.

External sector issues l Armenia maintains a liberal trade regime. l Clearing trade arrangements with Russia and Turkmenistan are expected to come to an end--the former in January 1996 and the latter over a period of time. 0 The authorities were encouraged not to resist an appreciation of the exchange rate, if market forces point to that direction. a. Balance of Payments and trade regime External sector policies will continue to focus on maintaining a liberal exchange and trade regime, and creating an environment conducive to foreign investment and the expansion of private trade activities. On trade reform, the authorities have decided to simplify, by October 1, the tariff structure by collapsing the five tariff bands currently in place to two bands at zero and 10 percent. Established in February 1992 as mechanisms mainly to circumvent the problem of currency inconvertibility, the clearing trade arrangements with Russia and Turkmenistan have since become impediments to enterprise reform, because they lack transparency, foster inefficient trade and production practices, and eventually lead to both external and domestic interenterprise arrears. The authorities reaffirmed their intention to dismantle the clearing trade with Russia as of January 1996 and to move in a similar direction in their trade relations with Turkmenistan. Assuming similar effects from the dismantling of clearing trade with Turkmenistan as those observed following the reduction of clearing trade with Russia, new staff projections of the balance of navments show that the surge in exports previously projected to take place in late-1995 will now take place in 1996. The current account deficit for 1995 is projected to be US$331 million (25 percent of GDP), since the private transfers from Armenia's well-organized diaspora are now projected to exceed earlier expectations. With revised figures for the external sector for the first half of 1995, staff projections now indicate that, during the second half of the program (January to June 1996), a financing zao of US$lOO million remains, compared to US$llO million in the original program. Contributions from major donors are expected to help close this gap, and the staff will report on firm commitments at the next review (Table 5). u IL/ EU humanitarian assistance previously allowed for in the program has now been confirmed; it will not affect the financing gap.

This is expected to be achieved through three important steps: first, the imposition of a hard-budget constraint on some enterprises that are heavy energy users; second, an increase in the collection rates of households from a current level of lo-20 percent, by making local districts accountable for their residents; I/ and third, the eventual abolition of clearing trade with Turkmenistan, which will place all energy users on a commercial basis. b. Exchanee regime and exchanpe rate oolicv With the opening of a third auction market, foreign exchange auctions are now held five times weekly. More importantly, the lifting of restrictions in the interbank foreign exchange market in July, in line with Fund recommendations, has been a step toward the full liberalization of the foreign exchange market. In August 1995 the wedge between the exchange rate in the bureau cash market and the official auction rate vanished. The staff agreed with the authorities that, so far, the stability of the exchange rate had been helpful, but encouraged them to allow a greater role for market forces in its determination. Despite the observed stability over the last few months, fixing the rate may not be the appropriate policy at this juncture, given the uncertainties regarding external financing and autonomous capital inflows. The staff discussed the appropriate level of the real exchange rate and shared the authorities' view that, currently, it is not a primary concern for exporters. All indications are that the dram may be substantially undervalued vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, in terms of both the Purchasing Power Parity principle and dollar wage costs. The staff shared its findings with the authorities and recommended that they should not resist pressures for an appreciation of the dram, especially in response to autonomous capital inflows such as may be expected as the economy is remonetized. However, the CBA remained wary that a substantial nominal appreciation may be unsustainable over the medium term. C. Exchange measures subiect to Fund iurisdiction Exchange restrictions arise from a bilateral payment agreement with Turkmenistan and from the correspondent account arrangements which the CBA maintains in operation with the central banks of several FSU countries. L?/ I/ Initial experiments with this approach show that collection rates could increase to 60 percent. z/ The restrictions arising from the correspondent account arrangements are maintained under Article XIV, Section 2. The restriction arising from the bilateral payments agreement with Turkmenistan is covered by the temporary exemption from the "three-month rule" approved by the Fund in July, 1994.

IV. Medium-Term Outlook and Ganacity to ReDav the Fund l Medium-term developments will be influenced by the nonnalization of trade patterns with neighboring countries. l The medium-term outlook assumes a strong commitment to fiscal consolidation and the mobilization of domestic resources. l The economy will continue to depend on significant foreign inflows in the next few years, but positive domestic savings are expected at the turn of the century. 1. Medium-term outlook Economic developments over the medium term will be greatly influenced by the peace process, the opening of borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan, and stability in other neighboring countries. The pattern of trade will also be influenced by the timing of the abolition of clearing trade with Turkmenistan (Tables 6-8). Most growth is expected to come through increases in industrial output and services. Although the concept of capacity utilization can be misleading at a time when so many structural changes have taken place and much of potential output may not be saleable, the staff understands that some enterprises are in a position to expand output quickly without major investment. Even so, enterprises will need to re-tool within the next few years to refocus production toward higher quality goods to penetrate into export markets outside the CIS. The staff projects output to grow by 5 percent in 1995 and by a further 8 percent in 1996, before gradually returning to a 4-5 percent rate during the latter part of the projection period. l/ The growth projections are predicated on a series of important assumptions, including improved energy supplies and the availability of necessary infrastructure through projects currently financed by the World Bank and the EBRD. Restrictive financial policies are assumed to reduce inflation from an annual end-period rate of 30 percent in 1995 to around 13 percent in 1996, and to under 7 percent in 1997 and beyond. The tight financial policies, l./ The authorities have now raised their growth estimate for 1995 to 7.5 percent. Given the problems encountered in estimating real GDP growth during the year, the staff has decided to adopt a conservative approach and continues to forecast 5 percent growth for this year.

There is little prospect for net domestic savings in the short term, but net domestic dissaving is expected to decrease throughout the projection period (Chart 7). Government gross savings are expected to turn positive in 1998 and nongovernment gross savings in 2000. Foreign savings are expected to continue to provide the bulk of savings until 2001. Official flows are expected to be gradually replaced by foreign direct investment, as Armenia benefits from its highly supportive diaspora. Government investment is expected to pick up in 1997 and beyond in line with the Public Investment Program. The fiscal framework reflects reasonable revenue growth; a conservative estimate of the availability of foreign grants; and a sustainable reduction in current expenditure (Table 7). The projections assume domestic nonbank financing of about 2 percent of GDP by 2002, a level that should be attainable through increasing sales of treasury bills without recourse to bank borrowing. With improved domestic conditions, an increasing share of capital expenditure should be financed through domestic savings. Up to the year 1998, the government sector bears the brunt of the adjustment in line with the decline in grants and official financing items on the balance of payments. By the year 2002, government debt is projected to be 40 percent of GDP. This is consistent with the overall macroeconomic framework, including the investment targets, and the inflation and growth objectives. The fiscal projections assume a significant increase in the current expenditure share of the wage bill, from about 12 percent in 1995 to about 21 percent in 2002. In line with the authorities' government restructuring plan and in anticipation of an expected civil service reform, budgetary employment is assumed to be reduced from 391,000 in January 1995 to 270,000 by the end of 1998, with constant budgetary employment after that date. At the same time, the nominal average budgetary wage is projected to rise by about 330 percent between 1995 and 2002, corresponding to a 150 percent increase in real terms. This rate of increase is substantially lower than the authorities' proposed 400 percent real increase over the medium term. Although wages in Armenia are very low (Box 3), the staff projections make it clear that the authorities' present wage policy is incompatible with the country's projected fiscal capacity or the availability of external financing, assuming no major offsetting tax or expenditure adjustments are made. Nevertheless, staff projections imply that the ratio of budgetary to nonbudgetary wages could rise from 30 percent in 1995 to 50 percent in 2002. Upon normalization of trade relations with neighboring countries, both exports and imports are expected to increase strongly in the initial years, with imports envisaged to respond relatively more quickly, reflecting the country's massive rehabilitation and reconstruction needs. In the medium term, rapid export growth will likely be propelled by imports of capital goods and the concomitant improvement in productive capacity, and is expected to be concentrated in human-capital intensive products such as Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - - Box 3. Government Restructuring Plan * A Government restructuring plan, already in progress, calls for the elimination or merging of ministries to reduce their number from 57 at the beginning of the year to 23 by the end of 1995. In addition, the plan calls for an initial reduction of budgetary sector employment by 10 percent by the end of the year and a cumulative reduction of 33 percent by the end of 1998. In concert with these downsizing efforts, the authorities intend to conduct a review of civil service wages that could lead to a four-fold increase in real budgetary wages by the end of 1998, and to a decompression of the wage structure. Budgetary wages are presently extremely low, averaging about US$7 per month in the second quarter of 1995. compared with US$23 per month for the nonbudget sector. * Although the staffing review process has yet to occur, the authorities have given some preliminary indication of the employment cuts they expect to make. In relative terms, the sharpest reductions in employment would come in agriculture and communal services, where employment would fall by approximately 80 percent. Employment in the social and cultural sphere, and in legislative, judicial and executive bodies is projected to fall by about 35 percent, but employment in law enforcement will fall by only about 5 percent. * These employment figures, though preliminary, point to some interesting conclusions. Since 57 percent of budgetary sector employment is in the health and education ministries, sharp declines in the workforce of these sectors are inevitable. This implies that the sharp downsizing of government will require not only a civil service restructuring plan but also significant changes in the way the Government delivers health and education benefits, For example, the Government is now considering adopting a fee for service requirement for some forms of health care, which would allow the payroll of most health care providers to be shifted from the budget to hospitals and clinics. software and "re-exports," i.e., processing of intermediate goods from the East to be marketed in the West (Table 8). With Armenia's trade-oriented economy during the Soviet era, exports as a percent of GDP are expected to expand from 17 percent in 1995 to 30 percent in 2002. As the need for intensive capital replacement/investment subsides, imports are envisaged to fall from 42 percent in 1995 to 34 percent by 2002. Although reliance on foreign savings would most likely persist, the current account deficit is projected to narrow after 1997, both in absolute terms and as percent of GDP, and to be increasingly financed by autonomous capital inflows. Gross official reserves are projected to grow from a level equivalent to 1.5 months of imports at end-1995 to 3.0 months-equivalent b,y 1998. The assessment of capacity to repay as set out in EBS/95/100 remains valid. A new assessment will be made as part of the second review of the program (Tables 9 and 10).

Staff Aooraisal Armenia has taken a bold step forward in the pursuit of stabilization and economic reform. With the successful implementation of policies under the STF-supported program and the initial, generally positive, performance under the SBA, Armenia should be ready to deepen economic reform and move quickly toward the establishment of an economy based on market forces and a strong private sector. Fiscal consolidation and budgetary reform are at the heart of the adjustment effort. The staff commends the authorities on the substantial progress they have achieved in the adoption of new fiscal measures under the STF and the SBA-supported programs. Nevertheless, the fiscal situation remains fragile. It is urgent that the authorities intensify their efforts to find a permanent solution to the issue of tax arrears, including a review of the penalty structure, along with concrete steps to strengthen the tax and customs administration. While the Government's desire to increase the penurious wages of civil servants is understandable, the staff remains skeptical about the Government's capacity to achieve a five-fold increase in real wages in the next few years. Noting that for the economy as a whole no real wage increase is sustainable unless it reflects a commensurate improvement in productivity, the authorities are strongly encouraged to adhere to the employment targets provided for under the program, which could allow an increase in the average budgetary wage compatible with the Government's stabilization objectives. More generally, until the Treasury system and a more effective cash management system are in effect, there is need for careful expenditure control to ensure the generation of savings planned for the remainder of 1995 and in 1996. The improvement in coordination between the CBA and the Ministry of Finance, has resulted in a careful monitoring of the monetary orozram by the CBA and led to an auspicious start of the SBA-supported program. The increase in cash in circulation, while encouraging if it represents a shift from foreign currencies to the domestic currency, needs to be carefully monitored because it might also reflect disintermediation and tax evasion. With respect to interest rate nolicv, the staff understands that there may be need for high nominal rates, even with declining inflation, in the context of borrowers' creditworthiness and the related risk premium in lending interest rates. However, to reduce real interest rates over the medium term, the staff emphasizes the need for legal reform and enterprise and financial sector restructuring. The staff fully shares the authorities' concern about the fragility of the banking system and supports recent steps in line with MAE recommendations to improve the prudential supervision framework. The authorities are urged not to inject budgetary or CBA resources into any bank until such time as a restructuring plan has been completed in order to ensure that losses do not continue to mount. The staff stresses the need Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18 - for the development of appropriate institutions to render the recently adopted laws on collateral and enterprise bankruptcy enforceable. The external current account will remain in sizable deficit in the next few years and structural changes related to the dismantling of clearing trade may slow export growth in the short term. It is important under these conditions that the authorities continue to pursue a liberal trade policy to encourage private initiative and the pursuit of new export markets. The staff is pleased to note that the authorities are opting for an administratively simple tariff structure and expresses its support over the authorities' resolve in maintaining a liberal trade regime. The monetary authorities' view that the present exchange rate regime is appropriate has been borne out by developments during 1995. Although the staff understands the emphasis on the stability of the dram during a period of great uncertainty, it encourages the CBA not to resist a nominal appreciation of the dram, especially in response to re-monetization of the economy, which should be accommodated by monetary policy. As there are presently indications of possible undervaluation, some appreciation of the dram would not pose competitiveness problems and would, instead, contribute to the attainment of the inflation objectives. Taking advantage of the good progress made under the STF and the SBA in achieving macroeconomic stability, Armenia should be able to make a major advance in implementing reforms of a medium-term nature. A medium-term economic program with focus on structural reforms would promote sustainable growth and external adjustment with low inflation, and could be supported under an ESAF arrangement. The staff urges the authorities to begin developing a policy framework which, in addition to targeting a sustainable growth in real incomes, would also address issues such as steps needed to protect the poor; streamlining of expenditures on health, education, and the protection of the environment; the implementation of a public investment program; and the acceleration of enterprise restructuring. At the same time, Armenia should intensify its efforts to mobilize domestic resources and phase out its dependence on foreign financing, especially of a humanitarian nature. Such an approach would be the best guarantee for the success of the country's medium-term reform efforts. The policy measures envisaged so far under the SBA-supported program have mostly been implemented in a timely fashion and all the performance criteria have been observed. The staff is satisfied that the Government is taking concrete steps to ensure the regularization of arrears and to prevent the recurrence of the problem in the future. The staff also supports Armenia's decision to maintain a dialogue with Georgia on the rescheduling of the official arrears owed by Georgia. The delay in the implementation of a few structural benchmarks, such as the reserve requirements on the Savings Bank, could also undermine the credibility of the authorities' resolve in the reform process. The staff Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - urges the authorities to adhere to the time schedule specified in the program for the implementation of the structural measures, especially in those areas where slippages have consistently occurred. Armenia will continue to rely on significant external assistance in the foreseeable future to successfully implement its bold program of stabilization, adjustment, and rehabilitation. The authorities are encouraged to continue their efforts at mobilizing additional external resources in support of the reform process. The multiple currency practice arising from the spread which may emerge between the official rate and the buying and selling rates prevailing in the market is subject to approval under Article VIII. In the absence of a clear timetable for the elimination of this measure, the staff does not recommend approval. It is proposed that Armenia continue on a 12-month consultation cycle.

A. 1995 Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Republic of Armenia's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, and in concluding the 1995 Article XIV consultation with the Republic of Armenia, in the light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Armenia conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. The Republic of Armenia maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, described in EBS/95/155, in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, except for the multiple currency practice arising from the spread which may emerge between the official rate and the exchange rates prevailing in the foreign exchange market which is subject to approval under Article VIII. The Fund encourages the Republic of Armenia to eliminate the measures maintained under Article XIV, Section 2 and urges the Republic of Armenia to eliminate the multiple currency practice which is subject to approval under Article VIII as soon as possible.

The World Bank has been actively involved with Armenia during the last two years. The first IBRD loan to Armenia was an Institution Building Loan for US$12 million, approved in March 1993, and USS3.9 million has been disbursed to support the implementation of the Government's reform program in the areas of financial reform, privatization, tax administration, labor market services, and economic management. An IDA/Earthquake Reconstruction Credit for SDR 20.1 million was approved by the Bank's Executive Board in January 1994. The loan will finance the reconstruction of housing and the restoration of employment sites in the earthquake zone and SDR 10.1 million has been disbursed. A Power Maintenance Credit for SDR 9.4 million was approved by the Bank's Executive Board in December 1994 for rehabilitation of power generation facilities and SDR 0.3 million has been disbursed. At the same time an Irrigation Rehabilitation Credit for SDR 29.4 million was approved, has been declared effective, and SDR 2.5 million has been disbursed. A first Country Economic Memorandum was completed in March 1993, and updated in November 1994 and a poverty assessment is underway. An Energy Sector Review was completed in June 1993, and an Agricultural Sector Review was discussed with the authorities in September 1994. An SDR 41.5 million rehabilitation credit was approved by the Bank Board on February 28, 1995, and became effective on March 7, 1995, and is now fully disbursed. Work is well advanced on municipal, social, agriculture and energy projects. A project preparation facility has been approved for the Social Investment Fund project; disbursements to date are us$155,000. The World Bank will provide US$16 million for highway reconstruction starting September, 1995. A total of 1,420 kilometers of road will be reconstructed under this project with additional funds of US$15 million from other international creditors.

The first EBRD loan to Armenia of ECU 46.8 million was for the Razdan thermal generating power plant; disbursements under this loan amounted to ECU 11.8 million at end-1994 and are expected to amount to USS35.2 million in 1995. This loan is being used to purchase and install equipment for electricity generation. Further, in 1994 an ECU 24.1 million loan for an air cargo terminal was agreed and signed and disbursements are expected to begin in late-1995. The EBRD is also active in other areas. Currently it is focusing on a loan to support restructuring of food markets that has passed the project identification and definition phase. It is also working on project identification and definition to develop a proposal to improve the operation of wholesale markets. The EBRD is also planning to grant Armenia US$2 million loan to facilitate the creation of a Farmer's Mutual Assistance Association, designed to develop the private sector of agriculture. It is also reviewing plans to establish and operate a Private Investment Finance Company in Armenia.

Data on the Consumer Price Index, exports/imports and overall government balance are now compiled on a monthly basis, l/ data on the interest-rates are available two times a week and data on international reserves, base money and exchange rates are available on a daily basis. Nevertheless, weaknesses still remain in several areas especially with regard to international comparability of the data. Table 1 shows the core data, which are adequate for continuous surveillance. The table also shows the authorities publication policy. National Account Statistics The GDP data in Armenia still suffer from many of the shortcomings with respect to reporting and coverage described in previous Staff Reports. However, the authorities are receiving considerable assistance from the OECD to reclassify and re-estimate the accounts according to SNA methodology and to enhance coverage. Work on re-estimating the GDP for 1993 and 1994 is currently in progress. The authorities need now to focus on the compilation of an appropriate point-to-point GDP deflator. Although the staff has developed an alternative method of estimating nominal GDP by using expected average inflation and real growth, this method involves using a smoothing process to derive quarterly GDP. While the smoothing process is consistent with the current observed pattern in output, it is likely that this pattern will change as the structure of the economy changes and may yield inaccurate estimates over time. Price statistics The Armenian authorities now report a monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is fairly reasonable in its coverage and compilation. However, the methodologies for compiling other price indices are not comparable internationally. For example, because of the way enterprises report prices, the current WPI reflects changes in the cost of production, rather than the price received by the producer of the product. In line with recommendations made by Fund technical assistance missions, the authorities are planning to replace the WPI with the PPI and also develop export and import price measures with the assistance of the Fund. I/ Some lag in availability still persists. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 45 - APPENDIX IV Fiscal Sector Government finance data suffer from the following coverage, classification, and methodological deficiencies: (1) most foreign-financed expenditure is not included in the budget; (2) unlike republican government cash data, which are available monthly with minimal delays, local government expenditure data are available on a quarterly basis only, and with a lag of several weeks; (3) expenditure data on an accrual basis are available only with a substantial lag, and are subject to frequent (generally upward) revisions. This situation is unlikely to improve before the authorities implement a treasury system; (4) the present classification code by Articles does not provide sufficient detail to enable a complete classification of expenditure either by function or by economic type. In line with the authorities' objective of introducing an economic classification of expenditure, the current classification needs to be revised and expanded to generate more details; and (5) the changes in government deposits with the Central Bank and the commercial banks are not included in the compilation of financing, although for monetary programming purposes, a reconciliation between the fiscal deficit and its financing is typically available. External Sector While significant improvement has been made in the compilation of balance of payments statistics, weaknesses remain in three main areas. On trade data, the customs coverage of the border with Georgia is still inadequate, as a significant amount of trade crosses the porous border without being captured by official data. Second, private transfers are judged to be large, though, due to its veiled nature, official quantification is difficult. Third, an enterprise survey to measure services and nonbank financial flows needs to be introduced to gather data on important items now missing in the balance of payments accounts. Monetary Statistics Although the quality of monetary data has improved considerably, the authorities have yet to implement a number of recommendations contained in a report transmitted to the authorities in May 1995. Issues pending implementation relate mainly to the classification of foreign currency accounts between resident and nonresident sectors, the definition of Armenia's official external reserves, the reconciliation of interbank accounts, and the proper recording of IMF-related accounts. MAE has placed an accounting advisor in the CBA to expedite the introduction of a new chart of accounts for the Central Bank.
