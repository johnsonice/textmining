Oman’s economic performance in 2007 continued to be strong. Despite declining oil production, high oil prices and steady progress in implementing structural reforms contributed to strong non-oil growth. Rising inflation, however, is a concern. Looking forward, the authorities’ main challenge is to further diversify the economy to sustain growth and provide employment opportunities for Oman’s rapidly growing labor force, while maintaining price stability.  2. The political situation remains stable. Oman has been ruled since 1970 by Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al-Said, who is assisted by a council of ministers. Public campaigning was permitted for the first time ahead of the October 2007 elections for the Majlis Al Shura, one of two advisory councils. 3. Oman has made some progress on issues raised in the 2006 consultation. The authorities are moving ahead with their diversification plan. However, the frontloaded implementation of the public investment program specified in the seventh Five-Year development plan has contributed to rising inflationary pressures.  II.   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 4. Economic developments in 2007 were favorable. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by about 6.4 percent, supported by high oil prices and a rapid expansion of the non-hydrocarbon sector, including transportation, communications, wholesale and retail trade, and construction. Consumer price inflation is estimated to have averaged 5.5 percent in 2007, compared with 3.2 percent in 2006. The main factors contributing to the increase in inflation were supply-side constraints related to the construction boom, the strong growth in domestic demand, rising world food prices, and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies (Box 1). 5. Oman was hit by a cyclone in June, causing substantial destruction. Grants of about 2 percent of GDP were received from neighboring countries to assist the authorities with the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, which is expected to continue over the next two years. 6. The overall fiscal position remained in surplus in 2007 and the non-oil fiscal deficit (excluding grants) narrowed. Hydrocarbon revenues remained broadly  Real GDP, 2003–08(Annual percentage change)-8-6-4-202468101220032004200520062007 Est.2008 Proj.-8-6-4-2024681012Real hydrocarbon GDP 1/Real nonhydrocarbon GDPReal GDP Sources: Omani authorities; and Fund staff estimates.1/ Includes crude oil, refining, natural gas, and liquefied natural gas production.

Inflation in Oman has been driven by external and domestic factors. Among the external factors, the international prices of most food items have risen significantly. Bad weather conditions coupled with an increase in the regional demand for fresh fruits and vegetables has added to the price pressures. Also, the cost of imported labor (expatriates) has increased recently. Rapid economic growth in key Asian markets, particularly in India, has expanded the range of domestic career opportunities available to Asian professionals, as well as their compensation levels. Salaries in India, for instance, are estimated to have grown by an average 14 percent in 2007, the same rate as in 2006. This, along with an increase in the regional demand for professional and non-professional expatriates, has put upward pressure on expatriates’ salaries. In addition, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar has increased the cost of imported goods and labor.   On the domestic side, strong private sector demand, owing to the large increase in the number of expatriates and abundant liquidity, have spurred demand for real estate, including for speculation. This has contributed to sharp increases in rents, leading the government in September 2007 to introduce a two-year cap of 15 percent on rental increases. The expansionary fiscal stance in previous years, along with a 15 percent pay rise for all public sector employees that took effect in January 2007, have further fueled domestic demand.   Looking ahead, inflationary pressures are likely to continue. Food and nonfuel commodity prices are expected to decline, but ongoing investments and the economic diversification program are likely to sustain strong domestic demand, while supply-side constraints will ease slowly. Also, monetary conditions, if maintained, are likely to favor further increases in asset prices (real estate and equity), which could fuel additional demand pressures.

Lower spending on defense more than offset the surge in capital expenditure related to the government’s development program. As in the past few years, the fiscal surplus was used to reduce government external debt and augment the Infrastructure Development Fund and the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF). As a result, assets of the SGRF rose to about $11.6 billion (29 percent of GDP) by end-2007, an increase of $7.4 billion since end-2002.

The current account surplus is estimated to have narrowed to 10 percent of GDP in 2007, from 12 percent in 2006. Higher international oil prices helped boost export earnings notwithstanding lower oil production (4 percent decline), but this was more than offset by strong growth in imports. The financial account improved significantly, owing to increased borrowing by banks and strong stock market activity. As a result, the CBO’s reserves rose to $8 billion at end-2007 (4.7 months of prospective imports of goods and services). Reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, Oman’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated by 1.6 percent since 2005.

Money growth accelerated in 2007, owing to the accumulation of foreign assets and strong growth in credit to the private sector. Broad money grew by 34 percent in October 2007 (year-on-year), up from 25 percent in December 2006, with private sector credit growth accelerating from 20 percent to 31 percent (year-on-year) over the same period. The availability of credit was boosted by abundant liquidity in the banking system, partly owing to inflows triggered by speculation on a possible revaluation of the Omani rial vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and increased competition from newly licensed banks. To stem the acceleration in credit growth and mop up liquidity, the CBO raised reserve requirements from 3 percent to 5 percent in December 2007, following an earlier decision to exclude cash balances from the calculation of accepted reserves. The CBO has also recently approved the removal of the cap on the total outstanding stock of certificates of deposit (CDs), thereby increasing its scope to further mop up liquidity.   9. The commercial banks remain profitable and well-capitalized, and nonperforming loans are being reduced.1 There is significant potential for continued strong credit growth because of the buoyant economic activity and the low level of penetration (private sector credit is equivalent to only 80 percent of non-oil GDP). Although the large recent credit expansion led to a decline in the banks’ average capital adequacy ratio, this ratio was still 13.4 percent in September 2007, compared with a new minimum of 10 percent.2                                                  1 The decline in NPL ratios may be partly due to the rapid credit growth. 2 With the implementation of Basel II in 2007, the CBO reduced the minimum capital adequacy ratio from 12 to 10 percent.

The implicit subsidy on petroleum products has continued to increase. With the exception of gas oil, domestic retail prices of petroleum products have remained largely unchanged, notwithstanding the increases in international prices over the last four years. The authorities acknowledged the need to reduce implicit petroleum subsidies, which are estimated to have doubled since 2004. Noting the petroleum price differential between Oman and the U.A.E., the authorities estimate that a hike in retail prices of about 60 percent would be required to eliminate incentives to arbitrage petroleum products to the U.A.E., but they indicated that such an adjustment would encounter strong public opposition.  22. The authorities plan to put the Civil Servant Employees Pension Fund on a sound and sustainable financial footing. They intend to cover the existing actuarial deficit by lump sum transfers from the budget, while generating efficiencies from consolidating the various public pension funds and improving financial viability by increasing both the retirement age and employee contributions. B.   Monetary and Financial Sector Issues 23. Monetary policy is limited by the exchange rate peg and a high degree of capital mobility, but there is some scope for the CBO to further improve liquidity management. The authorities have recently tightened liquidity and indicated their willingness to raise reserve requirements further, if needed. Interest rates on CBO 28-day CDs, however, have been below the U.S. benchmark policy interest rate since 2002. In this regard, a policy of aligning short-term interest rates more closely to comparable rates in the U.S. could help reduce excess liquidity.   24. A recent Fund technical assistance mission recommended the setting up of a Market Development Fund to help sterilize structural excess liquidity and promote the development of the government securities market. The latter, in turn, would provide benchmarks for the pricing of corporate debt and enhance financial intermediation. However, with fiscal surpluses expected to continue, the authorities are reluctant to start issuing government debt and carrying the cost of sterilization.

The authorities noted their intention to invest abroad some of the government deposits now held at commercial banks. As of November 2007, government deposits at commercial banks amounted to about RO 940 million (6 percent of GDP), compared with 650 million in November 2006. Reducing these deposits and, going forward, depositing excess cash balances with the central bank or investing them abroad, would help reduce the lending base of the commercial banks.  26. The banking system is sound, and the CBO continues to improve regulatory and supervisory standards. Banking system vulnerability is low, and the authorities indicated that the recent global financial turmoil appears not to have affected the banking system, given the limited direct and indirect exposure of Oman’s banks to the U.S. subprime market. However, they will continue to monitor developments in capital flows and asset markets closely. They also noted that periodic stress testing of banks indicated a high degree of resilience to combined shocks to interest rates, exchange rates, the stock market index, and an increase in NPLs. In January 2007, the CBO started implementing Pillars I and II of Basle II. In April 2007, the CBO doubled the minimum capital requirement for local banks to RO 100 million, and for branches of foreign banks to RO 20 million. The CBO is also developing its risk-based supervision model, which is expected to be in place in 2008. Banking system vulnerability is low. With most of the recommendations of the 2003 FSAP already implemented, the authorities expressed interest in undertaking an FSAP update in 2009. C.   Exchange Rate Issues 27. The authorities reiterated their position that Oman does not intend to participate in the GCC monetary union, but they remain committed to maintaining the U.S. dollar peg. The peg provides a useful and credible anchor for monetary policy, and simplifies trade and financial transactions and risk management. In this context, the authorities were of the view that a revaluation of the rial was not advisable at this time, as it would affect adversely the competitiveness of the nascent non-oil sector and would not be very effective in stemming inflation, which has been explained to a significant extent by factors other than the depreciation of the U.S. dollar.  28. An analysis of the level of Oman’s real exchange rate suggests that the rial is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3). While there is some evidence of undervaluation, the current account surplus is projected to decline to a level below the current account norm by 2012, owing to lower oil receipts and increased imports. Despite the almost threefold increase in oil prices since 2003, the decline in oil production has resulted in the oil balance increasing only moderately from 43 percent of GDP in 2003 to 47 percent in 2007, limiting the appreciation of the equilibrium REER expected from the sharp increase in the terms-of-trade. The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis and assessment of the level of the exchange rate.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public 17 Corrected: 4/17/08   33. The key challenge faced by the authorities is to contain inflation. Although a bout of relatively high inflation in nontradeables is likely to be inevitable as part of the adjustment process to a more appreciated equilibrium real exchange rate, moderating the growth of domestic demand and reducing supply bottlenecks, especially in the construction sector, is necessary to avoid inflation from becoming entrenched.  34. Fiscal policy should contribute to moderating domestic demand. Although the envisaged increase in capital outlays in the 2008 budget is important for long-term growth, there is scope to slow the pace of implementation by reprioritizing and phasing investment projects. Containing current expenditures on wages and pensions, as well as streamlining on-budget subsidies on electricity and water, would also help. In addition, staff encourages the authorities to move ahead with their plans to phase subsidies on domestic petroleum products and introduce a value added tax and, possibly, a corporate income tax. Implementation of these expenditure and revenue measures is essential to reducing the non-oil fiscal deficit over the medium-term and to safeguarding macroeconomic stability. 35. Liquidity conditions and the strong growth of credit to the private sector should be monitored closely. Despite the limited scope for monetary policy under the peg, the CBO should help reign in excess liquidity by aligning more closely domestic interest rates with comparable U.S. rates. The staff supports the authorities’ readiness to further raise reserve requirements to mop up liquidity, if necessary. Regarding the financial system, the recent increase in the minimum capital requirement for banks is likely to play only a limited role as a entrance hurdle, given the high liquidity in the region. In this regard, the staff recommends developing a comprehensive licensing policy to help balance the growth potential of banks with the absorption capacity of the market. The new licensing policy should incorporate a thorough review process, including of the strategy and philosophy of new banks, their funding sources, the scope of their operations, country risk of the parent company, and the quality of bank supervision in the home country. It should also foster transparency through adequate documentation. 36. The government can also help facilitate the CBO’s management of excess liquidity by gradually reducing its existing deposits in commercial banks and, going forward, depositing its excess cash balances with the central bank or abroad. In addition, the implementation of the recommendations made by the recent MCM technical assistance mission on liquidity management could facilitate the broadening and deepening of the money market and enhance the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. 37. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to maintain the current peg to the U.S. dollar, which has provided a credible monetary anchor and has helped sustain investor confidence. However, this means that other policies must play a supportingDownload Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public18   role. In particular, staff attaches a crucial role to fiscal policy in helping to contain inflation and to structural reforms in improving efficiency and competitiveness.  38. The medium-term outlook for growth depends on a vigorous implementation of the government’s structural reform agenda and diversification plans. In this regard, investment in infrastructure to develop tourism, manufacturing, and gas-based non-hydrocarbon industries is key to increasing exports, and providing employment opportunities for Oman’s rapidly growing labor force. Staff also welcomes the priority attached by the government to education and training in order to raise the productivity of the Omani labor force. 39. The authorities are taking steps to improve the quality of the economic statistics, especially labor market data. Looking ahead, they are encouraged to develop consolidated fiscal accounts, including transactions on the publicly-administered social security funds, undertake a fiscal transparency ROSC, and continue efforts to compile and disseminate a comprehensive IIP. 40. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Oman take place on the standard 12-month cycle.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public
