Real GDP is estimated to have grown by over 1 percent after two years of negative growth and inflation (end-of-period basis) decelerated sharply from 77 percent to 5 percent. The central government overall balance improved from a deficit of 13 percent of GDP in 2000 to about balance in 2001; the market exchange rate was stable; and gross official reserves rose from around one to almost three months worth of imports by end-2001. Progress on key structural reforms remained slow in 200 1, especially with respect to the public sector and banking system. However, in contrast to his stance at the time of the 2001 Article IV mission, the President, this year, has indicated his desire to aggressively move forward on public sector reform. The authorities and the Inter-American Development Bank have just started preliminary discussions on financial and technical assistance for this project. There were some significant reforms in other areas, in particular, the replacement of an inefficient system of credit ceiling limits with a simpler and more transparent reserve requirement ratio; and legislation establishing a ceiling on the government’s debt. In June 2002, the authorities eliminated surrender requirements for nonmining sector exports. A major relaxation in fiscal policy occurred in March 2002 when the government implemented an agreement with the civil service unions for an average increase of 60 percent in civil service salaries (and an increase in the wage bill of 6l% percent of GDP). Discussions with the staff centered around the need to adopt short- and medium-term measures to offset the wage increase, which threatened to undo most of the progress made during 2001 towards macroeconomic stability. Indeed, the currency has already depreciated some 15 percent since March and inflation in April and May rose to a 25 percent annualized rate. On current policies, the fiscal deficit is projected to be almost 4 percent of GDP in 2002, and the staff recommended a menu of measures to reduce the fiscal deficit to 1% percent of GDP this year. The staff also emphasized the need for the stronger fiscal stance to be supported by an appropriately tight monetary policy. On exchange rate policy, the staff recommended that the authorities adjust the official rate to the level of the market rate to eliminate the multiple currency practice resulting from the current exchange rate policy. The staff welcomed the new apparent impetus on public sector reform and an initiative on private sector development being undertaken with World Bank technical assistance. The staff also encouraged the authorities to expedite the completion and implementation of new bank regulations, which are being drafted with the assistance of a Fund resident advisor, to enhance the supervisory and regulatory framework. Suriname’s statistics are very weak and seriously compromise surveillance, economic analysis, and economic management. Technical assistance from the Fund and the Inter- American Development Bank (IDB) has started to show results, but much more remains to be done.

The 2002 Article IV consultation discussions with Suriname were held in Paramaribo during April 1%26,2002.’ The mission met with the President of the Republic, the Ministers of Finance, Planning, Home Affairs, Agriculture, Natural Resources, Health, and Education, the President of the Central Bank of Suriname (CBS), as well as representatives of the private sector and the labor unions. 2. The last Article IV consultation with Suriname was concluded by the Executive Board on May 9,200l. On that occasion Executive Directors welcomed the measures taken by the government to stabilize the economy, particularly the efforts to restore fiscal discipline. For 2001, they urged the authorities to build on the gains made thus far by tightening control over public expenditure, especially with a firm, clearly articulated public sector wage policy; continuing not to use central bank credit to finance the government’s operations; and moving quickly towards reforming the regulatory and supervisory framework of the banking system in keeping with the Base1 core principles. Directors also emphasized the importance of structural reforms in the civil service and the public enterprise sector for consolidating the gains made in macroeconomic stabilization over the medium term. 3. At the time of the 2001 Article IV consultation, Directors expressed concern over the poor quality of Suriname’s economic and financial statistics. During 2001-02, the Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have provided technical assistance to improve the national accounts, balance of payments, trade, price, and money and banking statistics, and some progress has been made. However, data from all sectors still suffer from serious misclassifications and narrow coverage, and are not compiled and disseminated promptly. 4. Suriname has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.2 II. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS 5. Suriname’s macroeconomic performance deteriorated in 1997-2000. Real GDP growth averaged 0.2 percent a year, inflation 46 percent, and the external current account deficit 19 percent of GDP. The parallel foreign exchange market premium reached over 115 percent by September 2000 and by the end of that year, gross foreign exchange reserves had fallen to around one months’ worth of imports. * The staff team comprised Messrs. Alleyne (Head), Bindley-Taylor, Hendrick, Papaioannou, and Ms. Quiros (Assistant) (all WHD). 2 Fund relations with Suriname are summarized in Appendix I.

The fiscal deficit of the central government averaged 10.2 percent of GDP during 1997-2000, financed mainly by credit from the central bank. This resulted in high inflation rates, an appreciation of Suriname’s real effective exchange, rate and substantial pressure on the balance of payments. In an effort to control the foreign exchange market, the government introduced multiple exchange rates (there were 7 by 1997) which had the effect of taxing the export sectors of rice, banana and manufacturing and output in these sectors fell in the period 1997-2000, as did output in the services sector, particularly trade and finance. Moreover, official aid and grants from the Netherlands declined rapidly as relations with the Dutch authorities deteriorated over the growing fiscal indiscipline, with negative effects on infrastructure investment, which further hampered the growth process. 7. The government that took office in August 2000, quickly introduced a series of strong measures to restore macroeconomic stability. It devalued the guilder by 88 percent;3 eliminated all special exchange rates except for imports of baby milk and baby products;4 stopped central bank lending to the government; removed subsidies; raised tariffs on petroleum products, water, and electricity; and reduced a comprehensive list of price controls to one with 11 basic consumer items used mainly by low income groups. The fiscal saving resulting from the elimination of subsidies, the effect of the higher exchange rate on U.S. dollar denominated tax collections from the bauxite and petroleum companies, and the end of the electoral expenses incurred by the previous regime virtually eliminated the net borrowing requirements for the government in the fourth quarter of 2000. 8. During 2001, the authorities further tightened macroeconomic policies, and the resulting economic environment, manifested in a stable exchange rate and a decline in inflation from 77 percent to less than 5 percent, began to have a positive effect on investor and donor confidence. Real GDP (including the informal sector) increased by 1.3 percent in 2001 following two years of substantial decline. Output growth was led by petroleum and bauxite, with the latter increasing substantially out of a need to obtain the appropriate blend required by the alumina plant. In the agricultural sector, rice production increased after significant declines in previous years, in response to a rescheduling of the commercial bank debt of large scale farmers, and direct government cash support to small farmers. At the same time, banana production was plagued by industrial action, low international prices, and cash flow problems which, early this year, led to a halt in production at the state-owned banana company that still continues. 3 As a result, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 17 percent for the year ended 2000 (Figure 1). 4 A special exchange rate (Sf 1,100 per U.S. dollar), is still applied to imports of baby milk and formula.

According to official data, the external current account deficit widened from 13 percent of GDP in 2000, to around 25 percent of GDP in 2001, mainly as a result of a large one-off repatriation of dividends and profits by one of the bauxite companies. Merchandise exports and imports both fell by over 10 percent, and the trade balance worsened slightly. The most significant development in the capital account was a US$l2 1 million loan (16 percent of GDP) to the government by the National Development Bank of the Netherlands.’ By end-2001, gross international reserves had increased to US$lO7 million, or slightly less than three months of imports of goods and services.6 10. In 2001, the authorities intensified their fiscal consolidation efforts. The full-year effect of the previous year’s devaluation on U.S. dollar tax collections, together with increases in excise taxes, led to an increase in central government current revenue of almost 8 percent of GDP.7 Strong expenditure control efforts, especially in the area of goods and services, together with the full-year effect of the measures taken in late 2000, led to a reduction in current expenditure by around 6 percent of GDP, despite a 30 percent wage increase awarded to civil servants in June. In all, the fiscal position shifted from a deficit of 13 percent of GDP in 2000 to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2001. 11. Monetary policy played a complementary role to fiscal policy in helping to restore macroeconomic stability. Net credit by the central bank to the government was reduced by 10 percent of GDP, as the government paid a large part of its debt to the central bank using the proceeds from the Dutch loan. In addition, the authorities replaced the cumbersome and distortionary multiple credit ceiling system with a single, unremunerated reserve requirement of 27.5 percent of total deposits. Money supply (M2) increased by 32 percent and net credit to the private sector grew by about 64 percent, even though real lending rates increased.8 5 The 5-year loan, for Euro 138 million, is guaranteed by the government of The Netherlands. It carries a fixed interest rate of 5.18 percent a year and has a one-year grace period. 6 Net errors and omissions increased from -7.2 percent of GDP in 2000 to 12 percent in 2001, most likely reflecting the reversal of capital flight that probably took place during previous years. The level of net errors and omissions is high, due to remittances and informal gold sector exports, neither of which is explicitly recorded in the official balance of payments statistics. 7 The excise tax on cigarettes and tobacco increased from 17 percent to 100 percent; on alcohol from 18 percent to 45 percent; on beer from 13 percent to 30 percent; and on soft drinks from 5 percent to 10 percent. 8 Nominal interest rates fell from 34 percent at end-2000 to 26 percent at end-2001. A large proportion of credit activity was due to refinancing of previous debt. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-lO- 12. By early 2001 the value of the guilder in the parallel market had appreciated sufficiently to the point of convergence with the official exchange rate of Sf 2,178 per U.S. dollar, and official trading bands, which had been imposed at the time of the devaluation, were phased out by April.’ For the rest of the year the market exchange rate fluctuated within 1 percent of the official exchange rate. 13. A significant relaxation in fiscal policy occurred in March 2002 when the government implemented an agreement with the civil service unions for an average increase of 60 percent in civil service salaries. This increase, together with the 30 percent wage increase granted in June 2001, is projected to result in an increase in the wage bill in 2002 of 80 percent, or 6% percent of GDP. The 2002 wage accord, was agreed in January and included a realignment of the salary structure, the conversion of large nontaxable allowances into part of the basic salary, as well as an increase in all basic salaries, but its total costs only became clear in March. The main beneficiaries of the wage increase were the administrative workers, many of whom received increases well in excess of 100 percent, while teachers, police, nurses, and other “special categories” received substantially smaller increases. 14. Concern about the direction of macroeconomic policy has revealed itself most visibly in pressures on the guilder, which has had an immediate effect in raising domestic inflation. During March, and in anticipation of the wage increase, the guilder depreciated by about 10 percent in the parallel foreign exchange market rising to around Sf 2,400 per U.S. dollar towards end of that month, while the official rate remained at Sf 2,200 per U.S. dollar. In April, the parallel market rate continued to depreciate, reaching Sf 2,520 per U.S. dollar on April 25, when the CBS ordered banks and cambios (foreign exchange houses) to trade at a rate no higher than Sf. 2,400 per U.S. dollar, while keeping the official rate unchanged. This measure resulted in a virtual drying up of the supply of U.S. dollars in the cambios and by mid-June, after the value of the guilder had fallen to Sf 2,800 per U.S. dollar in the parallel market, the CBS lifted the restriction on the market exchange rate (although it kept the oflicial exchange rate unchanged) and further liberalized the foreign exchange market by eliminating the surrender requirements for all exporters except those in the mining sector. lo By end-June the market rate had appreciated to Sf 2,600 9 When the authorities devalued the Surinamese guilder in August 2000, they imposed a band of Sf 500 on either side of the new official rate. This band was reduced to Sf 200 in December 2000 and Sf 175 February 2001. lo Exporters in the nonmining sector must still repatriate export earnings but now may deposit them in foreign exchange accounts or sell them to the commercial bank of their choice at the existing market rate. A special regime still exists for foreign exchange proceeds of the mining sector (bauxite and oil). In the case of both companies, all taxes must be paid to the central bank in foreign currency. In the case of the state oil company, its export earnings must be sold to the central bank at the official exchange rate, while the bauxite companies (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ll- per U.S. dollar. Inflation pressures have also re-emerged, with the 12-month rate rising from 4.9 percent in December 2001 to 8.8 percent in May 2002 and monthly inflation rates equal to 1.9 percent (i.e., 25 percent at an annualized rate) in both April and May. 15. Progress on most key structural reforms was limited in 2001. After initial talks in February 2001 with the World Bank for a possible diagnostic study on reforming the civil service, there were no further discussions. Similarly, since the time of the 2001 consultation discussion when the issue was raised, no action was taken to resolve the problem of four small state-owned banks, two of which are likely insolvent. The new central bank law is still in the drafting process. 16. An important step was taken to improve fiscal governance in February 2002 wit1 the enactment of a new law placing a 60 percent ceiling on the ratio of total government debt to GDP. Total government debt stood at 53 percent of GDP at end-2001, of which external debt comprised 43 percent of GDP.” The law defines debt on a commitment (rather than a disbursement) basis and because the government currently exceeds the debt ceiling when measured in those terms, the law specifies a five-year grace period before requiring compliance with the ceiling. l2 The law stipulates penalties (including imprisonment) for government officials if the debt ceilings are exceeded without previous authorization from parliament and sets up a semi-autonomous department in charge of debt management. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 17. The discussions centered around the deterioration in the public finances stemming mainly from the civil service wage increase, and possible measures to prevent the derailing of the successful stabilization program implemented in 2001. Long standing structural reform issues relating to civil service reform, public sector restructuring, private sector development, and strengthening of the banking system were also major topics of discussion. must surrender to the central bank (again at the ofIicia1 rate) the amount of foreign exchange needed to meet their local expenses (e.g. local supplies and employee wages). l1 About a quarter of this debt represents long standing unpaid loans to Brazil and the United States (PL-480 disbursements). Suriname has been attempting to negotiate debt restructuring or debt forgiveness agreements with both countries, but efforts by Suriname and its creditors have been sporadic and not well coordinated. l2 The US$13 million second tranche of an IDB agricultural sector loan, which is dormant and unlikely to be disbursed because of failure to satisfy conditionality, represents the most significant portion of committed but undisbursed lending.

On the basis of current policies, the staff projects that the fiscal position of the central government would shift from a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2001 to a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2002, with a gross financing requirement of 9.4 percent of GDP. Given the country’s limited access to capital markets and since programmed official gross lending to Suriname is only US$l million this year (largely from the Inter-American Development Bank), virtually all funding would have to come from the domestic banking system. 19. Fiscal revenue is projected to decline from 35.4 percent of GDP in 2001 to 33.8 percent in 2002. A go-slow in the tax administration department is expected to continue to hamper tax collections, especially of indirect taxes,13 while the dividend payment of the state-owned oil company is projected to fall on account of the decline in oil prices. The decline in revenue will be offset, in part, by an increase in personal income tax revenue on account of the higher civil service taxable incomes resulting from the wage increase. 20. As a result of savings from the elimination of the fuel subsidies and direct payments of old age pension benefits, total government expenditure is projected to rise by only 2% percent of GDP (to 37.7 percent), despite the increase in the wage bill of some 6% percent of GDP. The fuel subsidy, which was paid to fuel companies as the difference between their cost of petroleum and their selling price (adjusted by a profit markup), was ended in 2000 but the government did not finish paying companies (some 1 percent of GDP) until 200 1. The government had been “double-paying” old-age pension benefits, by first paying its employee contribution (5 percent of its wage bill, to the civil service pension fund), but then also paying pension fund benefits directly. Having sufficiently capitalized the fund, the government discontinued paying pension benefits directly (a saving of 1.7 percent of GDP), leaving these payments to the pension fund. 21. Although the wage agreement was designed to correct severe distortions within the civil service wage structure introduced during the 1998-2000 period, the staff pointed out that the government’s attempt to achieve the realignment within one fiscal year and outside the context of a comprehensive civil service reform was a serious mistake from an economic policy standpoint.14 The prospect of a large increase in the deficit was already causing pressures on the exchange rate and the re-emergence of inflation and inflation expectations. Moreover, rather than contributing to more peaceful labor relations, the large wage adjustment granted to the majority of civil servants was provoking I3 A go-slow has been in effect since the beginning of the year on account of a desire for higher transportation and other allowances. i4 At over 18 percent of GDP, the size of the central government wage bill would be much larger than in any other country in the region.

Also, confidence in the government’s commitment to sound macroeconomic policies had been damaged, with adverse implications for donor participation in Suriname’s economic development program as well as for foreign and domestic private investment. 22. The president indicated that he had felt compelled to go ahead with the wage increase even with the knowledge of the substantial adverse macroeconomic implications. He felt that, having accepted the agreement in January, he could not subsequently renege on it. He added that the staffs suggestion to reopen negotiations with the main civil service trade union was politically unfeasible. He also discounted the statement by the leader of the main civil service union that the union was willing to discuss with government the possibility of phasing in the agreement. The minister of finance indicated that the government did not intend to grant any further wage increases in 2002 and would defer the payment of the back pay for January-February 2002 to the following year. B. Macroeconomic Outlook Under Current Policies 23. With the deterioration in the public finances, the souring of investor and donor confidence, the staff’s projections indicate an unsustainable macroeconomic scenario for 2002-2003, with low economic growth, rising government debt, and declining international reserves. The central bank is assumed to limit its financing of the government’s gross financing requirement to 4 percent of GDP, in line with a legal limit.i5 The rest of the financing is assumed to come from commercial banks. As a result, there is some crowding out of credit to the private sector, which declines by 3 percent in real terms. Real GDP would grow by 1 percent, with the nonmining sector growing by % percent, while inflation is projected to rise to 28 percent by the end of the year. The external current account deficit would be 17 percent of GDP,16 as a result of an increase in imports fuelled by the civil service wage increase, and gross international reserves would fall to less than one month’s worth of imports. Under this scenario, the guilder would depreciate by 20 percent relative to the official rate, i.e., to Sf 2,750 per U.S. dollar, by the end of the year. l5 Under the Central Bank Act, central bank financing of the government in any single year cannot exceed 10 percent of budgeted revenue. In 2002, this would be equivalent to 4 percent of GDP. l6 Beginning in 2002, remittances, estimated at 7 percent of GDP, and informal gold sector exports, estimated at 4 percent of GDP, are removed from net errors and omissions and included in their appropriate current account categories.

In 2003, the fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 5.7 percent of GDP, in part, reflecting a 20 percent across-the-board wage increase.17 Financing is once again assumec to come mainly from the domestic banking system. With the limit on central bank financing, commercial bank lending to the government would crowd out credit to the private sector, which is projected to decline by 4 percent in real terms. Real GDP growth would rise to 2 percent, mainly because of a programmed increase in petroleum sector output (the nonmining sector would grow by 1.7 percent), inflation would decline to 2 1 percent, and gross international reserves would fall almost to zero. C. Macroeconomic Policy Measures to Restore Stability 25. The staff urged the authorities to act quickly and decisively to stem the weakening of confidence in the government’s macroeconomic management, and adopt measures to minimize the government’s need to resort to domestic banking system credit. In this regard, it was important that the government present as soon as possible, a revised budget to parliament, including a series of fiscal measures that would minimize the fiscal deterioration and a clear financing plan. To have a positive impact on private sector confidence, it would be important that the measures include efforts to contain the growth of the civil service wage bill. 26. The staff recommended that the authorities should target a fiscal deficit of no more than 1% percent of GDP for 2002, which, with a supportive tight monetary policy stance, could stem the acceleration of inflation, arrest the slide in the exchange rate and set the stage for a return to economic stability in 2003. Real GDP growth under this “active” scenario would be 1.2 percent in 2002, rising to 3 percent in 2003, with the nonmining sector growing by about 3 percent. Inflation would accelerate to 21 percent during 2002 and would fall to 8% percent during 2003 (or about 13 percentage points lower than projected in the current policies scenario). The external current account deficit would be 12% percent of GDP in 2002 and would remain virtually unchanged in 2003, while gross international reserves would fall to around 1 ‘/z months of imports in 2002 and 2003. 27. The lower deficit envisaged for 2002 under the active scenario would also be consistent with a need to contain the government’s gross borrowing requirements, given its large scheduled public external debt amortization payment (5.1 percent of GDP) and limited options for new external funding. In addition, although the implied domestic financing requirements would still mean resorting once again to central bank credit, this could be done without breaching the statutory annual limit on central bank lending or substantially crowding out the private sector from bank credit (real private sector credit would grow by 5 percent). l7 The wage increase is assumed to be the result of pressure from the teachers and police but would have to be granted to the entire civil service in order not to undo the realignment of the salary structure achieved in 2002. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- Fiscal Policy 28. To contain the fiscal slippage, the staff recommended a menu of measures that would yield savings in a relatively short time, including increases in the sales and gasoline taxes; the suspension of the traditional 13th month payment or “holiday pay” (normally give] in June every year); and cuts in transfers to public enterprises and special interest groups, such as the rice farmers (Box 1). It also urged the authorities to start addressing quickly structural problems that have had a negative effect on public finances, such as civil service and public enterprise policies (see below), even though these would likely take a longer time to implement. 29. The authorities emphasized their commitment to minimize the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions but stated that they were not yet in a position to outline a specific plan of action. They agreed with the analysis of the staff, including the need for decisive action, and indicated that some of the recommended fiscal measures had already been endorsed by the Cabinet. ** However, they admitted that, politically, the measures, particularly on the revenue side, would still be difficult to implement, given their obvious unpopularity. They were aware of the need for wage restraint, and indicated that they planned to resist any further wage increases in 2002, despite the demands of the unions representing the teachers and the police to reopen wage negotiations. They also planned to maintain a hiring freeze on all non-professional staff posts and try to reduce current allowances. However, the authorities were reluctant to suspend the annual “holiday pay”, which is equivalent to one month’s wage bill (1% percent of GDP). Rather, they indicated that they would seek to reduce other expenditure (goods and services, investment) to achieve fiscal savings. lg The staff encouraged them to pursue this objective carefully and consistent with the government’s public policy priorities so as to avoid making expenditure cuts in an ad hoc manner, particularly in infrastructure. l8 At the time of writing, draft legislation to raise the sales tax on goods from 5 to 8 percent and on services from 7 to 10 percent, the tax on lottery winnings from 5 to 10 percent, and the tax on lottery tickets from 10 to 15 percent had been endorsed by the Cabinet but had not yet been submitted to the parliament. i9 Given that the holiday pay was made, the fiscal adjustment in the staffs active scenario relies only on the proposed revenue increases as well as some assumed cuts in nonwage spending.

The staff commended the monetary authorities for their efforts at restoring discipline to monetary management and their success in bringing down the rate of inflation in 2001. The authorities explained that because central bank extension of credit to the government had been at the root of the sharp acceleration of inflation in 1999-2000, the CBS had been determined not to extend credit to the government to send a clear signal of its commitment to maintaining a low inflationary environment. In the current context, however, the CBS president conceded that some central bank financing of government operations may be inevitable but, cognizant of the statutory limit and the government’s intention to regain control of its finances, emphasized that such credit would be kept to a minimum. 31. The staff recommended that the central bank aim at achieving the growth of base money and the inflation objective included in the staff’s active scenario. The CBS would need to stand ready to raise reserve requirements to contain the overall expansion of credit, especially if government borrowing exceeded the projection in the active scenario. Because of some concerns about the health of the banking system (see below) and, given the already relatively high level of the reserve requirement ratio, the staff recommended that any further increases in the ratio be remunerated and its fiscal implications offset by cuts in expenditure. 32. The staff supported the CBS’s decision to remove all restrictions on the exchange rate at which banks and cambios were allowed to buy and sell foreign exchange as well as the decision to formally eliminate surrender requirements for all nonmining sector exporters. Moreover, on economic efficiency grounds, the staff urged the authorities to allow the official rate to be market determined, noting that the existing policy constituted an unfair tax on the state oil company and was also undermining the revenue position of the government. The staff also pointed out that the existing divergence of the market rate from the official rate, which far exceeded 2 percent, constituted a multiple currency practice. 33. CBS officials concurred that the official rate ought to reflect market conditions. In the present circumstances, they indicated that an adjustment of the official rate would take place once the trends of the market (excluding factors associated with speculative behavior) became clearer. They emphasized that their policy was not to have a permanently rigid peg but to allow a gradual adjustment of the official rate, in order to avoid the destabilizing effects of substantial and rapid depreciations of the exchange rate, as had occurred in past years. However, they agreed with the staff that the stable foreign exchange market conditions during 200 1 and their positive effect in stabilizing import prices and bringing down inflationary expectations were rooted in the tight stance of fiscal and monetary policies of the period.

While the economy will likely continue to be dominated by the bauxite and petroleum sectors over the next five to ten years,20 employment creation and the achievement of the government’s poverty reduction objectives will depend on the ability of the nonmining sector to grow strongly. The mining sector has minimal linkages to the rest of the economy, employs few persons, and will not be able to absorb the influx of workers into the labor force in coming years. Strong, sustainable growth in the nonmining sector will depend on its ability to attract investment and increase productivity so as to improve competitiveness. Stable macroeconomic conditions will help create such an environment but the authorities will also have to undertake structural reforms to remove various impediments to investment and productivity growth. 35. As noted above, little progress has been made on key structural reforms thus far. However, in recent months, the authorities have displayed an interest in accelerating the pace of reforms and have contacted multilateral institutions to assist them in developing programs for public sector reform and private sector development. Public Sector Reform 36. The serious problems of overstaffing and absenteeism and their consequences have been detailed in previous staff reports, namely: (i) declining average real salaries and a flat salary profile have led to an exodus from the civil service at senior and professional levels, creating a large deficiency in institutional capacity and compromising the quality of public service delivery; and (ii) the inability to free up budget resources for infrastructure development.21 The staff once again emphasized the need for civil service reform, arguing that the two problems cited above have had a direct negative effect on overall economic efficiency, private investment, and the government’s ability to create an enabling environment for private sector development and sustainable growth. Also, unless the issue of 2o The two bauxite companies have each presented proposals to the government seeking exclusive mining rights to hitherto untapped bauxite deposits in western Suriname. The staff emphasized the need for the authorities to acquire sufficient expertise to be able to evaluate these proposals and negotiate effectively with the companies. At the staffs recommendation, in June 2002, the authorities invited experts from the World Bank/IFC Mining Department to discuss those issues. 21 The central government civil service employs approximately 35,000 persons, or about 60 percent of the formal sector’s labor force, and 8 percent of the population. Public sector employment is roughly estimated at 40,000, and the financial cost of this work force is significant, with civil service wages and salaries representing some 18 percent of GDP in 2002 and the wage cost of the rest of the public service being hidden in the transfers to various enterprises. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- civil service reform was addressed soon, important initiatives currently underway in the Ministries of Planning and Finance to improve institutional capacity throughout the government, with the help of technical assistance and finance by donors, would likely produce only short-run improvements. Most importantly, because of the recent wage increase, the need for reform had become even more urgent for fiscal sustainability reasons. 37. The staff emphasized the importance of public enterprise reform as a means of ensuring medium-term sustainability of the public finances, increasing overall economic efficiency, and promoting private sector development. As a first step towards restructuring, the mission urged the authorities to intensify their efforts to obtain financial information on these companies, most of which do not tile audited accounts or other official financial documentation but yet receive transfers from the govemment.22 38. As noted earlier, the president indicated that he was determined to move aggressively in the area of civil service and public enterprise reform.23 To underscore this determination, it has been decided that the reform program will be run from the office of the president. The authorities have already had informal discussions with the UNDP and IDB for assistance and an IDB mission visited Suriname in June 2002 to discuss the prospects for beginning a study on public sector reform, using a US$750,000 loan facility that had been previously earmarked for this purpose. The authorities consider public enterprise restructuring to be an integral part of the envisaged public sector reform. In this regard, they also indicated their intention to pursue an extensive rationalization of the public enterprises, including through privatization. The staff welcomed the apparent new impetus being given to public sector reform. To signal the government’s commitment to reform, the Ministry of Home Affairs, with the full cooperation of the rest of the cabinet, should seek to strictly enforce the civil service rules already in existence with a view to tackling the lack of discipline that pervades the service. 22 In early 2002 an effort was made by the Ministry of Finance to determine the number of companies still in operation and to obtain financial information of their operations. Over 110 requests were sent out based on the existing register of companies. Over a period of six months only five responded. 23 Because certain ministries have traditionally been reserved for particular ethnic groups, successive governments, while recognizing the need for reducing the size of the civil service, have always urged “caution”, citing the need for such reductions to be done carefully to avoid charges of discrimination.

The condition of the banking system may have worsened in 2001, as compared to the previous year. 24 The staff was particularly concerned about: (i) the adequacy of the capital base of certain banks; (ii) the lack of adequate provisioning for nonperforming loans; (iii) the capital iza ion of interest income for loans over three months in arrears; and (iv) the t’ mismatch between short-term deposits and long-term credits, which may create liquidity problems for some banks. These problems have developed over the years and are the result of inadequate banking supervision and regulation rules, which often do not conform with the Basle Core Principles (BCP).25 40. The authorities conceded that the regulation and supervision of the commercial banks are not in compliance with established international norms and that commercial bank practices with respect to loan loss provisioning and interest capitalization, are not consistent across all the banks. The current Bank Act, which was introduced in 1968, is in need of revision, since it does not embody the BCP. The CBS has made efforts in recent years to upgrade on-site inspection procedures and has instituted effective training programs for bank inspectors under the guidance of the MAE resident advisor. The staff urged the authorities to expedite the enactment of three supervision acts and five regulations currently being drafted with the assistance of the MAE advisor, in order to provide a regulatory framework more in line with international accepted norms.26 In addition, appropriate attention should be given to the timely enactment of the AML legislation (also currently being drafted), in order to comply with relevant international codes and standards on anti- money laundering and the financing of terrorism. 24 The banking system consists of three relatively large commercial banks, one foreign- owned and one owned by the government, three small state-owned commercial banks, and a national development bank. 25 At end-2001, the risk-weighted capital to asset ratios of the three largest commercial banks were 6.6 percent, 8.1 percent, and 19.1 percent. However, since these ratios are calculated on the basis of unadjusted capital and asset data, the reported results would likely be revised downwards if appropriate adjustments for nonperforming loans and loan loss provisioning were made. In particular, there are no regulations on the classification of loans, and the staff was informed that loan balances of banks included capitalized income for loans that were more than three months in arrears, and that loan loss provisions were on the low side. Unfortunately, the lack of information on banks’ practices regarding capitalization of income prevents a more definitive assessment of the soundness of these banks. 26 The three supervision acts consist of a bank supervision act; an insurance companies act; and a pension funds act. The five regulations will establish rules on capital adequacy; loan classification and provisioning; prudential lending limits; insider lending; and fixed asset investments.

The central bank is studying how best to resolve the problem of four small state- owned banks, two of which may be insolvent. It believes that the main problem affecting these banks was poor management and that, once properly restructured with professional managers knowledgeable with working with the special risks associated with lending to small farmers and small businesses, these institutions are potentially profitable. The central bank is considering, among other options, a merger of those four institutions and the possible recapitalization of the merged bank. An IDB consultant has been commissioned to study the issue and to recommend a course of action. The staff welcomes this development but warned that, whether through liquidation or recapitalization, the financial cost to the government of resolving the current problem would likely be substantial and need to be factored into the government’s medium-term fiscal program. Private Sector Development and Trade Policy 42. The staff noted that private sector development was the key to bringing down the high unemployment rate (17 percent in 2000), as well as minimizing any employment dislocation that may result from a rationalization of the civil service. The staff commended the authorities for inaugurating a tripartite consultative commission with business groups and labor unions to address this issue. It also commended them for inviting specialists from the World Bank to assist in the setting-up of the Investment Institute, the administrative agency at the heart of a plan to create a one-stop shop for investor services, and to examine and recommend enhancements to the recently enacted Investment Code. 43. The authorities’ national development plan recognizes that facilitating export growth in the nonmining sector will have to be a key component in the growth of the private sector economic activity and the country’s overall economic development strategy. Towards this end, the staff highlighted the importance of establishing support facilities to educate the private sector about the implications of commitments that Suriname will face as a result of its membership in CARICOM and WTO, as well as the potential commitments under a FTAA and ACP-European Union Agreement.27 Regarding CARICOM, the staff inquired when the authorities planned to implement the final tariff reduction, from 25 percent to 20 percent, of the common external tariff, which had originally been envisaged for 1998. The authorities indicated that they were in the process of preparing the required legislation and that it should be ready before the end of the year. In this context, 27 Private sector representatives told the staff that they had not been aware of the all the implications of CARICOM membership and therefore had been unprepared, with the result that they had lost significant domestic market share to CARICOM imports and had not been able to exploit potential export markets. For example, imports from Trinidad and Tobago grew from 9 percent of total imports in 1994 (the year before Suriname joined CARICOM) to 16.8 percent in 200 1. Exports to Trinidad and Tobago grew from 1.2 percent of total Surinamese exports to 5.8 percent (and grew from 0.7 percent of total Trinidadian imports to 1 percent). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - the authorities should be prepared to make additional fiscal adjustments to fully offset the loss of revenue from the tariff reduction. Statistics 44. The mission emphasized the need to improve Suriname’s economic and financial statistics, although it acknowledged some improvement with respect to the quality, timeliness and transparency of data from the CBS and the ministry of finance. The mission also urged the authorities to pursue vigorously all options for technical assistance available through donor agencies to address this most pressing need. IV. MEDIUM-TERMMACROECONOMICPROJECTIONS, 2003-07 45. If the government accelerates the pace of structural reforms, the medium term outlook could be positive and it is not difficult to envisage economic growth rates averaging 5 percent a year. There are many factors that could work in Suriname’s favor: (i) The economy would be recovering from a low base, i.e., after a prolonged period of economic stagnation; (ii) the bauxite sector is poised for a major investment program equivalent to around 20 percent of GDP, which given the need for the construction of new plant and supportive infrastructure would have a strong multiplier effect for the rest of the economy; and (iii) there is over US$200 million (22 percent of GDP) of grant money remaining from the Treaty Fund,28 which could be made available to support structural reforms and finance public human capital and physical investment. 46. The staff prepared an illustrative medium-term scenario that is an extension of the “active” scenario described earlier under which the authorities follow strong macroeconomic policies and follow through aggressively on structural reforms (Tables 7-10 and Figure 2). The central government budget is projected to be in balance by 2007 and the government debt to GDP ratio to fall to below 25 percent.29 This should allow for enough room to deal with the contingent liabilities that may have to be recognized 28 This is a fund established by the government of The Netherlands at the time of Suriname’s independence in 1975, intended to be used to support Suriname’s economic development. From time to time, the Dutch government has suspended disbursements, including during the period of military rule. At the present time, the position of the Dutch government is that the pace of disbursement will depend on the extent to which the overall economic policy environment (macroeconomic and structural policies) is consistent with maximizing the efficient use of the funds. 29 No change in arrears is assumed in the two medium term scenarios presented in this section. The authorities expect that a final resolution of this issue will take the form of a cancellation of the arrears or some type of debt for environment swap. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - in the process of cleaning up the public enterprises, including the state-owned banks.30 The bulk of the bauxite sector investment program is assumed to take place in 2004-2005. Evidence of decisive steps to address the issues of civil service reform, privatization, and private sector development would send a strong positive signal to donors and investors, even though, for example, the civil service reform would only gradually lower the wage bill and improve institutional capacity. Accordingly, the growth rate in the nonmining formal sector is projected to increase steadily to over 5 percent in 2006 and 2007, with much stronger growth in the tradeables sector, based mainly upon a rebound in the agricultural sector. Real GDP growth would average just under 4% percent per year over the 2003-2007 period. 47. A weaker macroeconomic policy stance and a continuation of the traditional “cautious” approach to structural reform would present a more risky and less robust medium-term outlook (see Figure 2). In an alternative illustrative scenario, which extends the “current policies” scenario described earlier, the authorities are assumed to move slowly on structural reforms, including civil service reform. A slower pace relative to that outlined in the active scenario means that restoring stable macroeconomic conditions becomes difficult, with the likelihood that large fiscal deficits and high inflation would persist. Also, as noted earlier, foreign exchange reserves would be almost depleted by 2003. The government debt to GDP ratio would also rise and breach the statutory 60 percent limit. Such an economic environment would not be conducive to increasing the level of private investment and donor assistance. Since Suriname is already far behind most other developing countries in the region with respect to the acquisition of modem technology, and could continue to lose ground, its competitiveness could decline. As such, underlying growth in the nonmining sector would average around 1% percent a year in the medium term, although overall growth would average about 13/ percent a year because of the temporary spin-off benefits from the construction of new plant and infrastructure for the new bauxite/alumina operations. In any case, given a population growth rate of 1.7 percent, this growth is unlikely to put much of a dent in the unemployment rate or allow for a significant improvement in average standards of living and reduction in poverty. 3o For example, under this scenario, if debts of 15 percent of GDP were assumed over the course of 2004-05, the deficit would rise by an average of 1% percent of GDP, and the debt would rise to 63 percent of GDP in 2005, but fall to 57.5percent of GDP by 2007, below the 60 percent statutory limit.

After several years of economic mismanagement, Suriname experienced a return to macroeconomic stability during 2001. The fiscal deficit fell dramatically, the exchange rate was relatively stable during the year, inflation fell to single digits for the first time in over five years, and the foreign exchange reserves of the country were strengthened significantly. Also, the 2002 budget marked the first time in over ten years that the budget was presented to and approved by the national assembly on time. 49. However, a significant relaxation in fiscal policy occurred in March 2002 when the government implemented an agreement with the civil service unions for an average increase of 60 percent in civil service salaries. While the reason for the increase, i.e., to correct a misalignment in the salary structure that developed over the past five years, is understandable, the decision to pay the increase within one year severely complicates efforts at sound economic management and threatens to undermine the gains achieved in 200 1. Concern about the direction of macroeconomic policy has manifested itself most visibly in pressure on the guilder, and in raising inflation and inflation expectations. 50. It is crucial that the authorities act quickly and decisively to stem the weakening of confidence in the government’s macroeconomic management, and adopt measures to restore fiscal discipline. Full implementation of the wage increase without offsetting fiscal measures threatens to bring about a return to the period of low economic growth, high inflation, depleted foreign exchange reserves, and exchange rate market and financial instability that generally characterized the 1990s. However, if the government takes early action to restore macroeconomic stability and accelerates the pace of structural reforms, the medium-term outlook could be very positive, with economic growth rising substantially. 51. The government should therefore target a budget deficit for 2002 of about 1% percent of GDP, comprising of measures that would yield savings in a relatively short time, including increasing the sales and gasoline taxes; and cuts in transfers to public enterprises and special interest groups. To have a positive impact on private sector confidence, it would be important that the measures include efforts to contain the growth of the civil service wage bill and thus the government should resist granting any more wage adjustments this year and postpone payment of the January-February 2002 back pay to next year. It would also be important for the authorities to start quickly addressing structural problems that have had a negative effect on public finances, such as civil service and public enterprise policies, even though these would likely take a longer time to implement. 52. The monetary authorities should be commended for their efforts at restoring discipline to monetary management and their success in bringing down the rate of inflation. The replacement of credit ceilings, which had proven to be cumbersome and distortionary, with a reserve requirement, is a welcome development and the transition between the two systems has been handled smoothly. In the current environment, the central bank will need to stand ready to raise reserve requirements to contain the overall expansion Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - of credit to help offset growing inflationary pressures. Given the relatively high level of the reserve requirement ratio and some weakness in the banking system, any further increases in the ratio should be remunerated and their fiscal implications offset by cuts in expenditure. 53. The recent measures to liberalize the foreign exchange market by removing surrender requirements for nonmining exports and allowing most current account transactions to take place at a market-determined exchange rate are to be commended. The authorities however, should now adjust the official rate to the market exchange rate, as the current policy unfairly taxes the state oil company, undermines government revenue, and constitutes a multiple currency practice. Since there is no definite schedule for removal of the multiple currency practices originated by the difference between the official and the market exchange rates that affects the surrender requirement for mining exporters and in the existence of a preferential exchange rate applicable to baby milk and formula, the staff does not recommend Fund approval for the retention of these measures. 54. A comprehensive reform of the civil service is needed in order to reduce its size, redistribute positions across ministries and occupations, and raise the quality of its output. Public enterprise reform, aimed at rationalizing the size of this sector, either through closing or privatizing companies is also necessary to increase the sector’s productivity and profitability. These reforms in the public sector are crucial to Suriname’s medium-term fiscal sustainability as well as helping raise the country’s overall economic efficiency. They now take on an added urgency in light of the new wage agreement. 55. The recent decision by the president to move forward aggressively with a public sector reform and to run the program from his office is a positive development. It is also encouraging that discussions are now being held between the authorities and the IDB on the financing of a diagnostic study and strategic plan. 56. The authorities are aware that they need to substantially upgrade the supervisory and regulatory framework of the banking system, which does not conform to Base1 core principles. They are currently addressing the issue with the help of resident experts from the Fund and the IDB and are encouraged to expedite the process of enactment of the three supervision acts covering the banks, insurance companies, and pension funds, and five regulations now being drafted in the central bank, which will establish rules on capital adequacy, loan classification and provisioning, prudential lending limits, insider lending, and fixed asset investments. It would also be important to prepare an adequate regulatory framework for cambios (foreign exchange houses) in order to further enhance the central bank’s control on monetary management. Appropriate attention should be given to the timely enactment of the anti-money laundering legislation (which is now being drafted), in order to comply with relevant international codes and standards on anti-money laundering and the financing of terrorism. 57. Notwithstanding improvements in a number of areas, Suriname’s economic and financial statistics remain weak, and compromise economic analysis and the formulation of economic policy. The statistical deficiencies also make the practice of good Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - governance difficult. The authorities are urged to take full advantage of the technical assistance that has been provided by and is available from the IDB and the Fund, beginning with the public finance and monetary statistics, where improvements can be made with the least difficulty. 58. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

A commercial or parallel market exists for banks and cambios. In April 2002, the Central Bank mandated a ceiling on the selling rate of the U.S. dollar in the commercial market for foreign exchange, of not more than 200 guilders above the official selling rate.This ceiling was removed in June 2002 and the foreign exchange market liberalized by the elimination of foreign exchange surrender requirements for nonmining exporters. In July 2002 a spread of around 16- 20 percent existed between the official and commercial exchange rates. A special exchange rate Sf 1,100 per U.S. dollar applies to milk products. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 9, 200 1 (SM/01/3 1) and (SM/O l/l 17). Suriname’s exchange restrictions were not approved. Suriname is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. IX. Technical Assistance: FAD-A mission visited Paramaribo in May 1997 to review the budget preparation process.

Since the authorities took office in late 2001, some effort is being made to improve the accuracy and flow of economic data, particularly with respect to the banking and fiscal sectors. However, some information, particularly those relating to the real sector and the balance of payments, is still received with substantial lags and much work remains to be done to improve the accuracy and timeliness of these data. Real Sector National accounts estimates are not current; the latest available data refer to 2000. Although rough estimates of the size of the informal economy indicate that it may be as large as 40 or 50 percent of that of the formal economy, the Statistical Office makes no attempts to measure its size in any systematic manner. National accounts at constant prices is based on 1980 weights, which are outdated and need to be revised. There is generally no effort to reconcile the national accounts data with that of the balance of payments. In 200 1, the outdated CPI, which used weights derived from a household survey of April- March 1968-69, was replaced with a new price index based on a household expenditure survey of October-December 2000. Public Finances Central government finances are the only financial accounts available for the public sector, and a substantial amount of adjustments and additional information are still needed to get a relatively accurate and comprehensive picture of these fiscal accounts. With respect to revenue, data are collected on a cash basis by the Inland Revenue Department and the NonTax revenue Division. There is a Central Paymaster Department which also produces records on a cash basis, for both revenue and expenditure, as does the central bank, whose statement of government operations, (produced daily, weekly and monthly) is the basis for the liquidity report on revenue and expenditure prepared by the Ministry of Finance. Some capital expenditure items pass through the Central Paymaster account but the majority of capital expenditure seems to be recorded at ministerial level and is not reflected in the paymasters’ accounts. Consequently, capital expenditure has to be inferred from the level of external grants, the source of which has to be the external agencies, as there is no central domestic registry for receipts of external grants. Moreover, as non-tax revenue include indistinguishably genuine non-tax items, as well as grants, and domestic and foreign loans, it is difficult to make separate estimates of the non-tax items. As there is no centralized system for the overall collection and reconciliation of various sources of data, the Ministry of Finance, the Treasury Department, the Central Bank, and the Central Paymaster all record different numbers for the same categories of revenue and expenditure. The authorities have begun the process of streamlining the system of fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4l- APPENDIX II reporting, improving the reconciliation process, and standardizing the reporting format. The authorities have reintroduced the “Flash Report”, an internal document with detailed coverage of revenue and expenditure, which they had stopped producing in the last several years, but which improves the transparency of fiscal reporting, especially in the area of expenditure. However, there is a pressing need for standardization of expenditure by economic classification and more coordination in reporting between the line ministries and the Ministry of Finance, as well as between the central bank and the Ministry of Finance. Since 1991, no data on the central government operations in Suriname have been published in IFS and since 1986, no data on consolidated central government have been published in the GFSY. The resumption of reporting GFS data for these two IMF publications is highly recommended. The collection of consistent financial data for the rest of the public sector presents an enormous challenge. Part of the problem is that the actual number of public enterprises remains unknown although officially there are approximately 9 1 companies, some of which are dormant, others are social associations (for the blind, handicapped, etc.), and many others are very small. None of these public enterprises produce financial accounts on a timely basis as a result of which their impact on fiscal operations, domestic credit, and employment is difficult to measure. In order to obtain much needed technical assistance in this area, the authorities, after a hiatus of about 10 years, are seeking to renew their relations with the World Bank. Monetary Accounts Monetary data reported to STA have had long lags of between 6 to 14 weeks an outdated reporting format, requiring some adjustments for analytical purposes. Central bank balance sheet data for the period 1998-2000 were distorted, due to the nontransparent treatment of foreign assets and loans to the central government. A STA technical assistance mission visited Suriname (January 9-l 8,200l) to advise the authorities on a suitable reporting format for monetary data and to help prepare a template for more transparent accounting of the assets and liabilities of the central bank and commercial banks. The mission also suggested ways to prepare and promote a faster and more accurate dissemination of monetary data. Since mid-200 1, following the authorities’ implementation of the mission’s recommendations, central bank balance sheet data are being reported with a lag of l-l .5 months and the transparency of the accounts now meet IFS standards. However, the reporting of commercial bank data is still subject to significant delays due in part to the outmoded data processing system used by some of the commercial banks. Balance of Payments Balance of payments data are still prepared on a cash basis in Suriname. While trade data are relatively reliable, data on services and capital inflows suffer from poor compilation systems and procedures, misclassification and poor reconciliation controls. During April-May 2000, a technical assistance mission from the Statistics Department visited Suriname to examine and report on the required changes needed to bring the BOP reporting system in conformity to the Balance of Payments Manual 5 (BPMS). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 42 - APPENDIX II The mission made extensive comments relating to changes in format, methods of collection of data, the need for surveys, and the need for new classification of transactions. During the mission, the authorities completed the migration of the classification system to the BPMS for the period 1995-98. The mission also noted the need for further technical assistance in the short and medium term, the need for additional training of more staff in the methodology of the BPMS, and the need to strengthen the legal framework to allow the central bank to request data from private enterprises. The authorities, after receiving the report of the technical assistance mission, indicated their willingness to implement the suggested measures. However, many of the problems in the compilation of BOP statistics are due to the non-cooperation of private sector agencies, owing, in part, to weak laws governing the enforcement of statistical reporting requirements. The authorities are contemplating the drafting of new laws with a view towards strengthening the ability of the Central Statistical Office to collect relevant data from private sector firms and to impose stronger penalties on those that do not cooperate in a timely manner.
