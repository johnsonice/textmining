Introduction A staff mission visited Buenos Aires during July 31-August 11 to conduct the 1995 Article IV Consultation discussions and the review under the extended arrangement. I/ In the letter circulated on August 30, 1995 (EBS/95/146), the authorities request (a) a waiver for a minor deviation with respect to one of the June fiscal performance criteria and (b) modifi- cation of the performance criteria mainly applicable to the public finances for the remainder of the year. The three-year extended arrangement was approved on March 31, 1992 in an amount equivalent to SDR 2,483 million (161.5 percent of quota), and an extension for a fourth year with augmentation by SDR 1,537 million (100 per- cent of quota) was approved on April 6, 1995. 2/ On the latter date, Argentina purchased SDR 1,047 million or 68 percent of quota raising total purchases to SDR 3,252 million under the arrangement, including SDR 717 million in support of DDSR operations. As of end-August 1995, Argentina's outstanding use of Fund credit was SDR 3,739 million (243 percent of quota), and SDR 769 million remained available under the arrangement. Completion of the present review would allow Argentina to draw SDR 256 million or 16.7 percent of quota. During the last Board discussion in April 1995, Directors commended the authorities for the decisive measures taken in March 1995 to reestablish financial stability and restore confidence. However, they cautioned that the authorities should stand ready to adopt additional fiscal measures, if necessary, and that efforts at structural reform should be strengthened to support the Convertibility Plan. Most basic indicators for macroeconomic surveillance, such as data on international reserves, are published promptly and are reliable. There are, however, significant problems with other statistical information, particularly as regards the balance of payments methodology, the lack of information on the provincial public finances, the absence of a consistent data series of the public finances on the GFS basis, and the consistency between the below-the-line financing in the fiscal accounts and the money and banking statistics (see Appendix III). I/ The mission consisted of Messrs. Hardy (Head), Kreis, Guzman and Traa (all WHD), Pifion-Farah (PDR) and Cafionero (EP-WHD) and was assisted by Mr. Figuerola, the Fund's resident representative in Buenos Aires. The mission met with the Ministers of Economy and Labor, the President of the Central Bank, other senior officials, and representatives of the private sector. Mr. Zoccali, Alternate Executive Director for Argentina, participated in the discussions. 2/ Argentina has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4.

Recent Develonments After four years of rapid economic growth aided by large private capital inflows, in the first few months of 1995 the Mexican crisis triggered an outflow of canital from Argentina that in turn precipitated a sharp contraction in domestic demand and activity. The capital outflow was reflected in a decline of almost US$8 billion in deposits in the Argentine banking system (or around 18 percent of total deposits) between late December 1994 and mid-May 1995, a sharp decline in the stock and bond markets, and a surge in interest rates (Charts 1 and 2). The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) responded to these events by lowering reserve require- ments from 17 percent (weighted average) before the crisis to around 14 percent in May 1995, I/ and by providing some ArgS1.7 billion of special rediscounts to support weak banks. As a consequence, the Central Bank's net international reserves fell by close to US$6 billion during the first quarter of 1995. Even so, interest rates rose to peak levels in March, a number of banks experienced difficulties, and credit became virtually unavailable for many small- and medium-sized firms. Facing a loss of confidence and difficulties in rolling over public sector maturities, in March 1995 the authorities took strong measures to bolster the public finances and provide support to the banking system. It was in this context that Areentina nepotiated a fourth Year extension of the extended arraneement from the Fund (see EBS/95/51). The measures, which were expected to yield over 2 percentage points of GDP in 1995, included a temporary 3 percentage point surcharge on the value added tax (VAT) rate, which was exempted from revenue-sharing with the provinces, and a wage cut for higher-paid public employees. The aim was to shift the overall balance in the public finances (excluding privatization receipts) from a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1994 (and a projected deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 1995) to a surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP in 1995, with privatization expected to generate an additional 0.8 percent of GDP. Separately, the Government set up two Trust Funds- -capitalized by foreign and domestic loans --to facilitate the restructuring of the provincial and private banks. At the same time, the Government announced its intention to accelerate structural reforms covering labor legislation, bankruptcy laws, and the provincial finances. This program also received strong support from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Eximbank of Japan, as well as from private foreign banks and the domestic private sector. The resources that were mobilized in the months following the program's announcement were sufficient to meet the public sector's debt service obligations, create the Trust Funds, and rebuild the BCRA's gross international reserves. 1/ Or from 22 percent to 16 percent including cash-in-vault (from March 1995 onwards banks were allowed to count up to 50 percent of cash-in-vault against the legal reserve requirements; this facility is being phased out between July and November 1995).

However, the credit squeeze and fiscal tightening, together with the uncertainty surrounding the presidential elections in mid- May, triggered a sharp decline in both consumntion and investment in the second quarter of 1995. Thus, real GDP in the second quarter is estimated to have been about 1.5 percent below the corresponding period of 1994. Reflecting the weakening in the economy and a sharp increase in the labor force participation rate, the urban unemnlovment rate jumped to 18.6 percent in May 1995, from 12.2 percent in October 1994. The rise in unemployment reflects both structural and cyclical factors. Despite rapid economic growth in 1991-94, the urban unemployment rate increased from 6 l/2 percent to over 12 percent as employment grew by only 1.5 percent a year while the labor force participation rate trended steadily upward. The slow growth of employment reflected reductions in public sector employment (particularly in the state enterprises) and strong gains in productivity in the traded goods sectors as a result of the substitution of capital for labor in response to changes in relative costs. Also, illegal immigrants from neighboring countries absorbed jobs created in the construction and services sectors in these years, which may distort the labor market statistics. Reflecting higher female and youth participation, the labor force participation rate rose from 39 percent in 1990 to 43 percent in 1995, which is still somewhat below the level of comparable countries, such as Italy or Spain. The sharp rise in the unemployment rate from October 1994 to May 1995 stemmed from a 200,000 (2 percent) decline in total employment and an increase of 600,000 in the labor force during this period. During the first half of 1995, Argentina's external current account adjusted rapidly, reflecting the slackening in domestic demand, strong foreign demand (particularly from Brazil) and good agricultural crops. Exports (in U.S. dollar terms) were 47 percent higher in the first half of 1995 than in the same period of 1994, while imports declined by 5 percent. Excluding trade with Brazil, Argentine exports are estimated to have increased by 30 percent, including a strong performance of manufactured goods exports for the third year in succession (exports of manufactures of industrial origin rose by close to 30 percent a year in 1993 and 1994). The trade balance shifted to a surplus of US$l billion (0.7 percent of GDP) in the first half of 1995, from a deficit of USS2.9 billion (2 percent of GDP) in the corresponding period of 1994. For the year as a whole, the trade surplus is now projected to be USS1.4 billion, compared to a deficit of almost US$6 billion in 1994, and the external current account deficit is projected to narrow to USs3.7 billion (1.3 percent of GDP), from US$lO billion (3 l/2 percent of GDP) in 1994 (Table 1). This would be some 0.8 percent of GDP lower than programmed. Assuming a modest recovery toward the end of the year, real GDP is projected to grow by 0.5 percent in 1995, instead of the 2-3 percent that had been programmed. Inflation, which fell from 7.3 percent during 1993 to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4 - 3.7 percent during 1994, is expected to decline to 2 l/2 percent in 1995 despite the hike of the VAT rate. The credit squeeze and decline in consumption had a strong adverse impact on public sector revenues, which were some ArgS1.6 billion or 2 percent of GDP below program in the second quarter of 1995. Part of this shortfall was offset by lower revenue-sharing transfers to the provinces, and the rest by lower capital expenditure, lower than expected pension outlays, and by late payment of June wages amounting to over Arg$SOO million. As a result, the program's end-June ceilings on the public finances were observed, with one minor exception (the limit on the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector was exceeded by Arg$27 million or 0.1 per- cent of total government expenditure). All the program's other performance criteria were met by wide margins, as shown below. The large margins under the targets on the BCRA's free international reserves and net domestic assets reflected the placement of unused trust fund resources on deposit at the BCRA, instead of abroad, as had been assumed.

The provinces as a group incurred a deficit of some 0.8 percent of GDP in 1994, which was covered largely by pledging bonds that were issued to them as payment by the National Administration for old debts. With this source of financing unavailable in 1995, the provinces have been under strong pressure to reduce expenditure, and a number of provinces accumulated arrears on wages and pension payments in the first half of 1995. Several provinces recently have cut current and capital expenditures, including nominal wages, and have accelerated privatization of their public banks and enterprises. The financial crisis in the first half of 1995 weakened the financial system. Several credit cooperatives and wholesale and provincial banks, which experienced deposit losses of 50 percent or more, were unable to meet reserve requirements and became heavily reliant on BCRA rediscounts and swaps. In the first few months of 1995, the Central Bank intervened 14 private banks; of these, two have been reopened, 10 were restructured and sold off and the remaining two are being auctioned, with support from the Trust Fund set up for that purpose. In addition, four provincial banks (out of 27) have been privatized and 10 others are in the process of privatiza- tion with support of resources from a second Trust Fund. Some 30 other institutions have disappeared as a result of mergers and acquisitions. As the BCPA provided extensive support to banks with liquidity problems through rediscounts and swaps, the restructuring of the financial system has utilized considerably less resources from the Trust Funds to date than the ArgS3.7 billion that was allocated to them in the program. The Trust Fund for restructuring the private banks, with an initial capital of ArgS2.5 billion, as of August had disbursed only ArgS0.2 billion. Current opera- tions may require the disbursement of an additional Arg$0.4-0.6 billion, some of which will cancel BCRA rediscounts. While there may be additional disbursements, it is unlikely that the remaining capital will be needed in full. The Trust Fund to assist in restructuring the provincial banks, with a potential lending capacity of ArgS1.3 billion, has already committed ArgS0.9 billion in support of the privatization of seven banks, and ArgS0.3 billion has been disbursed, mainly to cancel outstanding rediscounts with the BCRA. The remaining resources will be consolidated in a new fund to assist in the restructuring of the provincial public finances, that will also incorporate various World Bank and IDB loans for the purpose, This Fund may be called on to assist in the privatization of additional provincial banks. To strengthen the banking system's liquidity position and promote lower interest spreads, in August 1995 the reserve requirement system was restruc- tured and made more uniform. Minimum reserve requirements, which were previously deposited at the BCRA and were not remunerated, will be phased Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - out by November 1995 and a uniform liquidity requirement phased in. u This liquidity requirement can be satisfied through the purchase of Bank Liquidity Certificates issued (and remunerated) by the Argentine Treasury, with the proceeds to be placed in international reserve holdings of the BCRA. Banks also will have the option to place deposits in a special account abroad to comply with the liquidity requirement. The new scheme will eliminate the previous high reserve requirements on demand and savings deposits, which discouraged banks from promoting the use of checking accounts. Moreover, by remunerating the banks' required liquidity holdings, it will reduce bank spreads, though at a direct cost to the Treasury (estimated at some Arg$200 million a year). As a result of these changes, the overall average liquidity requirement (as a ratio of bank deposits) is expected to rise to 15-16 percent by December 1995 from 14 percent in June (or to 18-19 percent, from 16 percent, if cash-in-vault is included). The Argentine peso appreciated by 34 percent in real effective terms (CR1 weights) during the period April 1991-January 1994, but between the beginning of 1994 and August 1995, the real effective rate of the peso depreciated by almost 8 percent reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis other major currencies and the real appreciation of the currencies of Chile and Brazil (Chart 3). In judging the adequacy of competitiveness, it should be noted that approximately half of the cumula- tive loss of competitiveness from April 1991 to date, as measured by the real effective exchange rate indices, has been offset by changes in taxation and efficiency gains stemming from structural reforms and improvements in relative productivity. u The very strong performance of exports in the first half of 1995, following two years of rapid growth of exports of manufactures of industrial origin, suggests that competitiveness is not inadequate at present. Between the presidential elections in mid-May 1995 and end-August 1995 about half of the Arg$8 billion loss of bank deposits had been regained, while the stock and bond markets recovered most of their earlier declines. Nevertheless, although domestic interest rates subsided to pre-crisis levels, bank credit to the private sector remained weak. Moreover, the return of deposits to the banking system was mainly concentrated in the larger banks, leaving the smaller banks in a strained condition. The public sector regained access to international credit markets in August 1995 with the placement of two five-year Eurobond issues (in DM and Yen) equivalent to US$l 3/4 billion with spreads that were only marginally higher than the pre- crisis levels.

For example, the share of households below the poverty line in the Greater Buenos Aires area declined from more than 35 percent at end-1989 to 14 percent at end-1994. However, in 1995 the slowdown in economic activity and the surge in unemployment may well have halted this trend. Air pollution, contamination of groundwater and other environmental pollution are a major problem affecting the principal cities and industrial areas of the country. The World Bank is assisting the authorities in the analysis of this issue and in designing appropriate remedies. III. Summary of the Discussions The discussions centered on policies for the remainder of 1995 and for 1996 that would help complete macroeconomic adjustment, bolster confidence and lead to a resumption of 'output growth. The authorities felt that the significant narrowing of the external current account deficit, the reflow of capital, the recovery in bank deposits, and the public sector's renewed access to foreign borrowing were all evidence that the Convertibility Plan no longer faced major risks from the external side. Rather, the main risk now stemmed from the slowdown in domestic demand (which was adversely affecting fiscal revenues) and the associated rise in unemployment. In this context, while reiterating their commitment to sound public finances as a central element in the Convertibility Plan, they considered that some modification of the immediate fiscal targets of the program was justified. At the same time, they felt that it was essential to proceed expeditiously with tax measures and structural reforms designed to increase private saving and investment, foster employment, promote solvency in the provincial finances, and strengthen the banking system and improve its efficiency. The authorities also indicated that they intend to request a successor stand-by arrangement in support of their 1996 program. 1. Fiscal oolicv The authorities and the staff agreed that the major revenue shortfall emerging in 1995 compared to program stemmed mainly from the weaker-than- anticipated growth in the economy, and the pronounced weakness in key components of domestic demand, which were important for the tax base. This necessitated some revision in the program's immediate fiscal policy objec- tives if fiscal policy were not to become procyclical. At the same time, the envisaged easing of the fiscal policy targets was not to go beyond that implied by allowing the automatic stabilizers to work, and there was full agreement that the public finances needed to be brought into balance in 1996 as the economy recovered. While the authorities considered that the revenue shortfall mainly reflected the downturn in domestic demand, they believed that tax evasion Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 8 - and noncompliance had increased significantly as a result of the credit squeeze. To encourage compliance with the tax laws, several steps had been taken. These included: (1) broadening of the base of the personal income tax, by replacing the employee social security tax credits by lower personal income tax deductions; (2) the introduction of new facilities for regularizing tax arrears via IOUs that the government intends to discount with the banking system; and (3) strengthening the administration of the VAT and income taxes to reduce evasion. L/ The staff noted that repeated recourse to tax moratoria and amnesties may end up weakening compliance. Even with these measures, which are expected to yield some ArgS1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, total current revenues are projected to fall ArgS6.2 billion (2 percent of GDP) below original program levels in 1995. Some ArgS1.2 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) of this shortfall would be automatically offset by lower transfers to the provinces under the revenue sharing agreement. In addition, discretionary expenditures would continue to be restrained through lower authorizations and cash rationing, and salary payments would continue to be paid with a one-month lag. Reflecting the commitment on expenditure restraint, the revised program includes ceilings on discretionary noninterest expenditure. Overall, noninterest expenditure would be some Arg$2 billion (4 percent) b'elow program, including ArgS0.8 billion of cuts in discretionary outlays. For the year as a whole, there would be an overall deficit (excluding privatization receipts) of ArgS2.4 billion or 0.8 percent of GDP, rather than the earlier planned surplus of Arg$2 billion or 0.7 percent of GDP (see tabulation below and Tables 2, 3 and 4). The authorities expected that this deficit would be covered with privatization proceeds. 2J On these grounds, the authorities are requesting a modification of the program's September and December 1995 fiscal targets. lJ Persons would now be required to submit evidence of VAT payments f:or expenditures up to a predetermined level of their annual income, and would be required to pay tax on any shortfall when they file their personal income tax returns. The registry of share ownership would be required, and nonerasable cash registers would become mandatory for all retailers. 2/ The authorities expect to receive ArgS0.8 billion from the privatization of the Government's remaining shares in already privatized public utility companies and ArgS1.6 billion from sale of various gas companies and electricity plants, including the concession of operating rights to Argentina's share of Yacyreta, the binational electricity company jointly owned with. Paraguay. The latter operation, however, may take longer than planned. The authorities also expect to receive some ArgS1.2 billion from the privatization of the government's remaining shares of the YPF oil company in 1996, which will be earmarked to support further reforms in the provincial public finances.

Given the stronger-than-expected performance of private saving (Table 5), the authorities believed that the public sector deficit could now be accommodated without in any way jeopardizing the Convertibility Plan. The Trust Funds are expected to require less resources than originally planned and additional resources from the recent international bond issues had become available. These will be used to buy back domestically held public debt, thereby lowering future debt servicing costs and providing liquidity to the economy. Thus, despite the emergence of a fiscal deficit, there would still be room for an expansion of credit to the private sector of over 10 percent in the second half of 1995 (Table 6). To encourage job-creation and discourage evasion, the authorities have decided to implement a phased reduction of 30 percent in emplover social security contributions, which currently range from 33 percent in Buenos Aires and other advanced provinces to 16.5 percent in outlying areas. l/ 1/ Evasion of social security contributions is thought to be around 40 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - The reduction would take place in equal steps in September and November 1995, and in January 1996. Though this measure is expected to have very little impact on collections in 1995, the direct revenue loss for 1996 is estimated at 0.7 percent of GDP. For 1996, the authorities stated that they are aiming at overall balance in the national public finances, excluding privatization receipts. They believed this would be achievable even after the reduction in social security contributions, on the basis of the expected strong pick up in economic activity and improved tax administration. However, if necessary, they were prepared to seek an extension through December 1996 of the 3 percentage point VAT surcharge, which is due to expire at end-March. Noninterest expenditures would be kept about level with 1995. Restraint on discretionary expenditure would be of critical importance, as about half of any increase in tax collections is automatically transferred to the provinces under the revenue-sharing arrangements. The staff pointed to the risk that revenues may fall short of projec- tions both in 1995 and 1996 because economic growth may be lower than the authorities are projecting, and the effects of tax administration measures may not meet the authorities' expectations. Indeed, on the staff's assump- tion of 3 percent real GDP growth in 1996 (instead of 5 percent in the authorities' scenario) and including the extension of the VAT surcharge (without revenue-sharing), the staff foresaw a deficit in the nonfinancial public sector of at least 1 percent of GDP next year. The deficit would be somewhat greater if the VAT surcharge became subject to revenue sharing. The staff also expressed concern that privatization receipts could fall short of projections in 1995. The authorities explained that the reduction of employer social security contributions was essential to reduce costs and promote employment. It would also reduce the incentives for evasion. Moreover, they indicated that they would arrange bridge financing against any shortfall in privatiza- tion receipts in 1995, if needed. The specification of the 1996 program, along with any measures that may be needed, will constitute an important part of the discussions on the next review of the program that are scheduled for November 1995. 2. Monetarv nolicy The authorities were heartened by the recovery in bank deposits in recent months, and considered that the restructuring of the private banking system was well under way. They noted that, given the large external resources that had been mobilized to cover the public sector's financing needs and the Trust Funds, there would be room for a substantial expansion of credit to the private sector in the second half of the year if deposits continue to increase, as programmed. This was key to a recovery in activity. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - The staff noted that, despite significant progress in the restructuring of the banking system, the situation of many banks continued to be delicate. Nonperforming loans as a share of total loans was high, particularly in the provincial banks. Moreover, the bulk of the returning deposits had accrued to the 20 largest banks, which account for 70 percent of the system, while other banks are shut out of the interbank market and have continued to rely very heavily on special BCRA discounts for liquidity assistance. Further- more, banks seemed to have a preference for building up liquidity in the present circumstances and were slow in expanding credit. In this context, the authorities agreed on the need to move rapidly in restructuring the financial sector to help reestablish credit to the private sector. The recent changes in the application of the reserve requirements are expected to help rebuild the banking system's liquidity to close to the pre- crisis level by year-end, and should at the least maintain the proportion held at the Central Bank and raise its international reserve holdings. The change was done to allow the banks to earn interest on required reserves (the Central Bank law prohibits remuneration of reserve requirements) so as to help reduce interest spreads, I/ and to eliminate the distortions created by the previous system. The staff stressed that banks should be encouraged to rebuild liquidity margins as rapidly as possible, without unduly constraining credit, to put them in a position to better withstand any future shocks to the system. The staff also emphasized the need to reduce central bank net credit and to strengthen its free international reserves (i.e., gross international reserves above the level required for backing of the monetary base) so as to bolster the Convertibility Plan and restore an operating margin for the BCRA in the event of a renewed outflow of capital. In this context, the revised program ceilings strengthen the end-1995 target on free reserves by US$200 million. In addition, the staff recommended that part of the resources from the recent international bond issues be used to increase the BCRA's free international reserves, rather than for amortization of domestic debt. However, the authorities felt that debt reduction operations were a higher priority as they would provide liquidity to the domestic economy and also improve the access of the private sector to external credit. 3. External policies The authorities believed that the recent export surge reflected heightened competitiveness resulting from the tax and structural reform measures that have been implemented, and the large investments and improve- ments in relative productivity that have taken place over the last four years under the Convertibility Plan. Their policy is to bolster competi- tiveness further by lowering costs through a reduction in employer social 1/ The nonrenumeration of legal reserve requirements is estimated to account for about 1 point of the roughly 10 percentage point average interest differential in the Argentine financial system.

In early 1995, Argentina eliminated the 10 percent statistical tax on imports and took further steps to liberalize trade in the context of implementation of the common market agreement with Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay (MERCOSUR). With the exception of some 200 items, tariffs were eliminated on MERCOSUR imports and the common external tariff (CET) on non- MERCOSUR imports was set to range from 0 to 20 percent, with a schedule for tariff rates on the excepted sectors to converge to the CET over time. For instance, tariffs on capital goods, which were increased from 0 to 10 percent in March 1995, would increase gradually to 14 percent by 2001. Each MERCOSUR member country has been allowed to continue with its own tariffs and regulations covering the automobile and sugar sectors, pending agreement on common arrangements for these sectors. In March 1995 a 3 percent statistical tax was reimposed, with fuels, capital goods and imports from other MERCOSUR countries exempted. The net effect of these changes was to reduce the average tariff rate (including the statistical tax) from 15 percent to about 11 percent. The authorities explained that Argentina's trade policies would continue to be implemented consistent with obligations under applicable trade treaties. They noted that Argentina's agricultural export sector stands to benefit in the medium-term from international trade liberalization under the Uruguay Round. 4. Structural reforms The authorities believe that the appropriate response to the recession and rise in unemployment is to accelerate structural reforms, particularly by increasing the flexibility of the labor market. The recently passed Law of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises contains provisions that allow for the decentralized negotiation of collective contracts and relax rigidities in employment conditions in enterprises with up to 40 employees. The Work- Related Accidents Law, which recently passed the Lower House, is expected to lower employment costs, and the recently passed Bankruptcy Law should facilitate restructuring, inter alia by suspending the application of collective bargaining agreements during bankruptcy proceedings. A proposed new Collective Bargaining Law also would decentralize collective bargaining and enhance flexibility in employment conditions. With the assistance and financial support of the World Bank, the authorities are preparing a reform of the publicly-funded health insurance scheme ("obras sociales"), which would allow members free affiliation and promote competition among health insurers and providers. In addition, as noted in the Policv Memorandum (EBS/95/146), the government is looking at ways to improve the administration of the public health system of pensioners and to improve the targeting of other social expenditures, such as discre- tionary pensions, unemployment benefits and family allowances. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 13 - Important progress is being made in adjusting the provincial finances and in the privatization of provincial banks and provincial enterprises. The federal-provincial revenue-sharing arrangement is scheduled to be renegotiated during 1996, which the government expects will provide an occasion to give renewed impetus for progress in the areas of provincial tax reform, deregulation, privatization and reform of the provincial social security systems. As already noted, the Government plans to earmark ArgS1.2 billion of privatization receipts in 1996 to support provincial reforms. IV. Medium-Term Outlook The updated baseline medium-term balance of payments projection is based on a recovery of GDP growth to about 5 percent a year from 1997 onwards, and an increase in the investment/GDP ratio to about 20 percent (Table 7). It assumes prudent financial policies (with fiscal balance from 1996 onward) leading to continued net capital inflows. In the baseline projection, after narrowing substantially in 1995, the external current account deficit would gradually decline further to 0.8 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. The medium-term assumption on growth of export volumes is maintained at 7-8 percent a year. Prospects are good for exports of unprocessed and processed agricultural products, which constitute some three fifths of total exports, reflecting the modernization of farming techniques and the effects of the Uruguay Round. The prospects for exports of oil, natural gas, minerals and manufactured goods also appear bright on the basis of further improvements in competitiveness, higher investment and demand growth in Argentina's main trading partners. Import growth is projected to exceed GDP growth in the medium-term reflecting the rise in investment, with its relatively high import content. Given Argentina's external trade liberalization and the increasing integration of MERCOSUR, trade deepening may result in higher volume growth of both imports and exports than assumed in the baseline projection. The projected current account deficits would be largely financed by inflows of private capital averaging over US$5 billion a year, with some 40 percent projected to come from direct investment. Gross reserves are projected to grow in line with currency issue and nominal GDP, and total external debt would decrease from 26 percent of GDP in 1995 to about 20 percent by the turn of the century, or from over 300 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services to 220 percent by the year 2000. Public external debt is expected to decline from 24 percent of GDP in 1995 to 17 percent of GDP by the year 2000. Assuming that remaining purchases are made on schedule, outstanding Fund credit would peak during the first quarter of 1996 at 281.2 percent of quota, and Fund repurchases and charges would peak at a level of 56 percent of quota in the year 2000. Given the country's projected payment capacity, there do not appear to be major risks to the Fund, as Fund repurchases and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - charges would reach a peak of only 3.7 percent of exports of goods and non- factor services in the year 2000. A deeper and/or more prolonged slowdown in GDP growth, or less disci- plined financial policies than assumed in the baseline scenario, could significantly alter the medium term outlook. A deterioration in the fiscal stance, for example, would not only result in lower national savings, but could also result in lower access to international capital markets, and thus to a narrower current account deficits. The medium term growth path under this scenario would be substantially lower. Conversely, increased confi- dence in the sustainability of Argentina's reform program and financial policies, and therefore in its medium-term prospects, could be expected to result in more buoyant capital inflows which could raise the growth prospects. Slower export volume growth (by 2 percentage points a year relative to the baseline) or a higher income elasticity of imports (1.8 instead of 1.2) would increase the debt-to-GDP ratios by about l-l.2 percentage points each year over the medium term. The effect of higher international interest rates (2 percentage points higher than in the baseline) would be an increase of the debt/GDP ratio of about 0.4 percent each year, mitigated to some extent by the share of debt contracted at fixed exchange rates (Table 8). V. Staff Anpraisal The crisis of confidence and the capital outflows that occurred in the first few months of 1995 have had a dampening effect on the Argentine economy, but have resulted in a marked strengthening in the external current account balance. Real GDP declined in the second quarter of 1995, compared with the corresponding period of 1994, and the urban unemployment rate rose sharply. Over the same period, the trade balance shifted into surplus reflecting buoyant exports and a decline in imports. Real GDP now is projected to show little or no growth in 1995 and the external current account deficit will be much smaller than envisaged in the original program. In response to the bold package of measures adopted last March, Argentina's economy appears to have stabilized in recent months. About half of the Arg$8 billion outflow of bank deposits that occurred between late December 1994 and mid-May 1995 has returned to the banking system, and there are signs that bank credit is beginning to recover. The renewal of access to the international capital markets, evidenced by the recent large DM and yen Government bond issues, is also a welcome development. Argentina's strong and broadly based export performance in the first half of the year, coming after two years of rapid increases in exports of manufactured goods, suggests that, despite the initial erosion of competi- tiveness under the Convertibility Plan, Argentina's present level of inter- national competitiveness is adequate. However, although the previous Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - concerns about the external viability of the program have subsided, new concerns are raised by the emerging recession, the associated weakening in the fiscal position (both in the nonfinancial public sector and the provinces), and the sharp increase in unemployment. The rise in the unemployment rate reflects both structural and cyclical factors, and unemployment is likely to remain a difficult problem for some time to come. In this context, it will be important to expedite planned steps to increase flexibility in the labor market, such as greater decentralization of collective bargaining. The recently announced phased lowering of employer social security contributions also may help reduce labor costs and promote employment, but the revenue losses may need to be made up in 1996 to maintain the credibility of the Convertibility Plan and confidence in the program, thereby enabling Argentina to continue attracting capital inflows from abroad. Reflecting the drop in consumption and the effect of the credit squeeze on tax compliance, public sector revenue is projected to show a large short- fall in 1995 compared to program. However, the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (excluding privatization proceeds) will be limited to 0.8 per- cent of GDP in 1995, as against the programmed surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP, after taking account of a renewed effort to enhance revenue collection, higher-than-programmed expenditure cuts and delays, and lower revenue transfers to provinces. The staff considers that a modification of the fiscal target for 1995 of the order indicated is appropriate given the present weak state of the economy and the availability of non-Central Bank sources of financing. As the economy recovers, it will be important that equilibrium be restored promptly in the public finances. However, although activity is expected to pick up in the second half of 1995, the recovery may well be quite moderate as consumer demand will be constrained by high unemployment and the downward pressure on wages. Indeed, unless there is a large reduction in tax evasion, the fiscal deficit is likely to widen in relation to GDP in 1996, even if the VAT surcharge is extended for the full year. This is a matter of concern as, in the context of the Convertibility Plan, such a fiscal outcome could lead to a loss of confidence, and therefore hinder economic growth. The staff expects to work closely with the authorities before the completion of the next review in the design of measures that would ensure an early return to overall budgetary balance. The provinces need to make further efforts to reduce current expenditure, improve efficiency in the delivery of social services and streamline and broaden their local tax systems so as to alleviate the burden on the national public finances and improve resource allocation. In the context of the renegotiation of the federal-provincial revenue-sharing arrangement in 1996, it will be important to deepen the reform process in the provinces, and to reduce the rigidity of the current system. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 - The new system of liquidity requirements will eliminate the distortions of the previous system and, by effectively remunerating required reserves, should help narrow interest spreads, though at some cost to the budget.. It will be important to rebuild a strong margin of liquidity in the system to restore the capacity of the financial system to withstand future shocks, and it also would be prudent to build up the margin of free reserves at the Central Bank above the program targets. While considerable progress has been made to date in the restructuring of the financial system, a signifi- cant segment has not benefitted from the deposit reflow and remains in a seriously weakened condition. The restructuring of the private banking system and the of provincial banks therefore needs to be given further impetus. The authorities are requesting a waiver for a minor deviation from the June ceiling on the fiscal deficit, and a modification of the September and December program performance criteria to allow for a deficit in the nonfinancial public sector. While noting the risks inherent in Argentina's current situation, the staff supports the authorities' requests as a temporary response to the recession, and in light of the authorities' continued commitment to the maintenance of sound underlying public finances. The staff notes that the authorities intend to request a new Fund arrange- ment next year to succeed the extended arrangement, which is scheduled to expire in March 1996. Although the basic indicators for surveillance purposes are published in a timely fashion and are reliable, there are significant problems with other statistical information, particularly as regards the external accounts and aspects of the public finances, and the authorities are urged to address these deficiencies without delay. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - VI.

Disbursements slowed somewhat in 1992, to US$171 million,, but in 1993, disbursements surged to over USS1.5 billion, due largely to a debt workout program involving a freestanding debt and debt service reduction (DDSR) loan (US$450 million), approved in February 1993, and set- asides from two other policy loans. Disbursement amounted to US$548 million in 1994 and reached US$465 during the first six months of 1995. The Bank is currently pursuing policy-based lending in response to the program of the Argentine authorities designed to confront the hemisphere financial crisis. A Provincial Reform Loan (US$300 million) was approved by the Board in January. The Bank has subsequently approved further support for provincial reforms with the Provincial Bank Privatization Loan (US$500 million) and the Bank Reform Loan (US$500 million) aimed at consolidating the reform of the financial system. In addition, the Bank is preparing a hybrid Health Insurance Reform Loan (US$230 million). For investment lending, the Bank will continue to focus on poverty alleviation and improved delivery of social services. Ongoing technical support is being provided to the authorities for their privatization program and in the areas of tax administration and public sector reform. Additional technical support would be provided under the Capital Market TA loan, approved in February 1994, for the institutional strengthening of the securities market regulatory agency, the implementation of the new pension reform legislation and creation of a supervisory agency for pension funds. This loan complements the Capital Market Development Loan (US$500 million) also approved at that time which provides for a backstop fund to lengthen the maturity of commercial lending.

National accounts National accounts data were revised in April 1993 (see SM/93/137, Appendix VI) and responsibility for the preparation of these data was transferred from the Central Bank to the Ministry of Economy in 1994. Nat,ional accounts in current and constant prices are available only on an annual basis, and the analysis of the savings-investment balance suffers from weakness of the data on the external accounts. 2. Prices Consumer and wholesale prices are collected by the National Institute of Statistics and are published monthly. Both indices are based on outdated expenditure surveys. 3. Other sector data There is little consistent information on wages and employment by sector, and there is no official monthly industrial production index. 4. Government finance statistics Information on revenue and expenditure of the Central Government, decentralized agencies, public enterprises and social security system (the nonfinancial public sector) is available on a cash basis with a lag of 2-3 months, but data on the provincial public finances is available only with considerable delays and in summary form. A consistent series on the nonfinancial public sector and provincial governments according to the government finance statistics classification is not available since 1989. There is virtually no continuous information on financing flows that can be corroborated with above-the-line and monetary sector data. 4. Monetary statistics Monthly data on the Central Bank balance sheet and the monetary survey are published in the BCRA Statistical Bulletin, generally with a lag of about two months; longer delays may occur, particularly as regards the audited end-of-year Central Bank balance sheet. The coverage of banks in the monetary survey is comprehensive, and the compilation of the monetary statistics includes an adjustment for late reporting. However, the sectorization of accounts, especially as regards credit to the nonfinancial public sector and provinces, is inadequate. In particular, the classifica- tion of public sector enterprises has not been adjusted to take account of privatizations. This contributes to the problems regarding the consistency Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - APPENDIX III between below-the-line financing in the fiscal accounts and the money and banking statistics. 5. Public debt Prior to 1994, data on public sector debt were incomplete and not available on a timely basis. The statistical information has improved both as regards coverage and currentness, and the data are now available on a quarterly basis, but revisions to the stock of outstanding debt are made reflecting the regularization of previously undocumented obligations. 6. Balance of pavments The balance of payments statistics are seriously flawed because of deficiencies related to source data, coverage, and methodological issues, resulting mainly from difficulties in applying the residency criterion. Two official versions of the balance of payments are currently being produced. Responsibility for the preparation of the balance of payments was transferred recently from the Central Bank to the Ministry of Economy, At the request of the Ministry of Economy, the Fund has provided a resident advisor for a six-month period starting in April 1995 to assist in developing a new system of data collection and compilation, consistent with the Fund's balance of payments methodology.
