Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Antigua and Barbuda were held in St. John's during the period January 23-February 7, 1995. 1/ The representatives of Antigua and Barbuda included the Prime Minister; the Minister of Finance; the Minister of Public Works, Transport and Energy; and other senior officials. Mr. Rainford, Advisor to the Executive Director for Antigua and Barbuda, participated in the final policy discussions. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. At the conclusion of the 1993 Article IV consultation on December 6, 1993 (EBM/93/165), Executive Directors called on the authorities to give urgent attention to the adoption of a strong and comprehensive adjustment program. A strengthening of the fiscal position would need to be comple- mented by efforts to normalize relations with external creditors and settle external arrears. II. Background A period of rapid economic growth in the 1980s was followed by a slow- down in the first years of the 1990s as the growth of tourism and tourism- related activities slackened. The current balance of the public sector deteriorated substantially reflecting a weakening of revenue and a sharp increase in wages and other current expenditure, which led to a decline in public investment and a large buildup of external arrears that remain to be addressed. At the same time, Antigua and Barbuda's membership in the Eastern Caribbean monetary union and the peg of the Eastern Caribbean dollar to the U.S. dollar helped to keep inflation low. The growth of real GDP picked up from an average of 3 percent in 1990-93 to 4.2 percent in 1994 on the strength of increased tourism from Europe. Inflation remained at about 3 l/2 percent (Tables 1 and 2). The real effective exchange rate of the Eastern Caribbean dollar based on consumer price movements in Antigua and Barbuda was unchanged in 1994, but the countrv's competitive position may have weakened somewhat reflecting private sector wage increases of about 7 percent (Charts 1 and 2). The current account deficit of the public sector rose from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1990 to 3.3 percent of GDP in 1993, and over this period the overall public sector deficit rose from 4.3 percent of GDP to 4.7 percent of GDP (Table 3). Public sector dissavings rose further to 4 percent of GDP in 1994 and the overall deficit went up to 6.5 percent of GDP. Increased tax l/ Fund staff representatives were Messrs. Arbulu-Neira (Head), Gluski, Lewis, Lim, and Velloso (all WHD), and Ms. Jupp (Assistant-WHD). Represen- tatives of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) participated in the mission.

The increase in tax collections reflected measures that were adopted in the 1994 budget, including the extension of the sales tax to nonhotel restaurants and an increase in both the customs service charge and the cruise-ship passenger tax. The government wage bill increased by 15 percent despite the postponement until 1995 of the payment of half of the 8 percent general wage increase, as government employment was raised by about 6 percent and a vocational training scheme was introduced. I./ The main source of deficit financing in recent years has been the accumulation of external payments arrears (the buildup in arrears averaged 10 percent of GDP a year in the period 1990-94). There have been virtually no new foreign credits since 1991. In 1994 there was a significant amount of domestic financing as well; banks and nonbanks extended credits at interest rates of up to 12-13 percent a year in certain cases, typically with a condition that fiscal revenue be earmarked to service these loans. Finally, there was a further accumulation of domestic arrears to the private sector in 1994. There also has been a continuous accumulation of intra-public sector arrears. These arrears (which involve taxes, contributions to the social security and medical plans, and the payment of utilities) reduce incentives for fiscal discipline in the Central Government and in the public enter- prises. Government arrears to the Social Security Scheme reached EC$150 million (12 percent of GDP) at end-1994, despite a transfer of government land in 1994 to settle some of these arrears. Antigua and Barbuda, as a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, does not have an independent monetary or credit policy. Net domestic assets of the banking system grew slowly in 11994; the private sector's demand for credit remained weak following the March 1994 election, possibly reflecting uncertainty about future policies, particularly in the fiscal area (Table 4). The growth of bank liabilities to the private sector (as measured by M2) increased broadly in .Line with the growth of nominal GDP, and commercial banks increased their holdings of net foreign assets by about US$lO million (equivalent to about 4 percent of M2). Domestic interest rates remained at international 1evel.s. The external current account deficit (after grants) fell from US$58 million in 1990 to US$31 million in 1993 (6.9 percent of GDP), reflecting growth in tourism receip,ts (Tables 5 and 6). Nevertheless, the capital account shifted to a deficit position in this period, and an overall balance I/ Under the scheme, the Government pays the wages of new entrants to the labor force either as civil servants or as "on-the-job" trainees in private enterprises.

The current account deficit declined further to US$27 million in 1994 (5.4 percent of GDP), based on the continued strengthening of tourism and a slowdown in imports associated with a fall in investment. However, net capital outflows continued because of a drop in foreign direct investment and the buildup of net foreign assets by commercial banks noted above. The overall balance of payments deficit was about US$37 million in 1994 (7.5 percent of GDP), which once again was financed mainly by an accumulation of arrears. External debt rose from US$330 million at end-1990 to US$400 million at end-1994 (80 percent of GDP) (Table 7). External arrears (including penalty interest) rose from 42 percent of GDP at the end of 1990 to 62 percent at end-1993 and 68 percent at end-1994, and now represent about 85 percent of external debt. u Overdue payments on two loans (a credit from Italy for construction of a hotel, and a loan from Japan for construction of a desal- ination plant) account for more than 50 percent of outstanding arrears. Most of the servicing of external debt obligations that has taken place in recent years has resulted from the earlier earmarking of public sector revenue (e.g., lease payments for U.S. military bases, the Government's share of profits from the West Indies Oil Company, and oil consumption taxes) for such payments. There were some debt-service payments to the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in 1994, but arrears remain which preclude new lending by the CDB to Antigua and Barbuda. In January 1995, Antigua and Barbuda implemented the first stage of CAPICOM's common external tariff (CET). The authorities indicated their commitment to the timetable which calls for a full phase-in of the CET by mid-1998. 2/ III. Policv Discussions and Prospects The discussions focussed on policies that would help Antigua and Barbuda address its serious fiscal imbalances and thus begin to deal with the arrears problem, increase public investment, and lay the basis for sustained growth. During previous consultation missions and staff visits, the staff has discussed the main elements of a program to meet these objectives. In early 1/ The arrears are due to insufficient domestic resources of the Antigua and Barbuda Government and of the public entities that do not form part of the Government's budgetary process with which to purchase foreign exchange from the regional central bank, and not, in the latter case, to a direct governmental limitation on the availability or use of foreign exchange as such; they therefore do not evidence the existence of exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval. 2/ See SM/93/241, Appendix V. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 4 - 1994 the Fiscal Affairs Department of the Fund provided technical assistance on the design measures, particularly in the tax areas, to strengthen the public finances. More recently, the authorities have been developing a "home-grown" fiscal adjustment program with help from the ECCB, CDB, and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). In addition, they aim to sell certain public assets and to renegotiate external obligations on a bilateral basis following the pattern of the 1990 rescheduling of a portion of Antigua and Barbuda's external arrears. However, no timetable for asset sales or for bilateral debt negotiations has been established. On the basis of fiscal projections for 1995 and the medium term, the mission estimated that th,e measures included in the "home-grown" program would not be sufficient to stem the accumulation of arrears and provide for an increase in public investment. In addition, the,mission cautioned that the bilateral approach to debt renegotiation favored by the authorities was unlikely to succeed in normalizing relations with creditors and donors and lead to a resumption of new lending. Against this background, the mission urged the authorities to adopt additional fiscal measures over the next two years as part of a compre- hensive adjustment program that could be supported by the Fund. Such a program, combined with stepped-up privatization and a Paris Club resched- uling, could address the country's arrears problem and set the stage for lasting economic growth. However, the authorities restated their past position that they were not inclined to request the use of Fund resources. 1. The authorities' fiscal strategy The draft budget for 1995 (which is expected to be approved by Parliament in April 1995) was framed against the background of the "home- grown" program. The growth of real GDP is projected to slacken somewhat to 3 l/2 percent in 1995 as the growth of tourism is likely to be affected by a lack of adequate infrastructure. Inflation is projected at 3 percent. The authorities expect that the external current account deficit will remain at about 5.5 percent of GDP with the slowdown in tourism being offset by a fall in imports (as a percentage of GDP) associated with weak investment. With the capital account projected to be in equilibrium, the overall balance of payments deficit would decline to US$30 million. The budget proposal includes revenue projections and budgetary appro- priations for most spending agencies of the Central Government, and outlines an investment program equivalent to 12 percent of GDP. However, the invest- ment program lacks a careful assessment of the country's investment require- ments and the cost effectiveness of projects, and the budget does not esti- mate the central government balance or identify the sources of financing. On the revenue side, the draft budget includes an increase in medical benefit contributions from 5 percent to 7 percent of wage income, and the introduction of an education levy at a basic rate of 2.5 percent of wages and salaries. Also, there are increases in indirect taxes on tourism, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 5 - property taxes, and several licenses and fees. In addition, selected con- sumption tax rates would be raised to offset the revenue effect of the reduction in import duties under the first stage of the Caribbean Com- munity's common external tariff. A business licensing procedure introduced in early 1995 was expected to facilitate the collection of back taxes. The privatization of LIAT--the regional airline in which Antigua and Barbuda holds a 10 percent share--was expected to yield US$l million (or 0.2 percent of GDP) in 1995. With regard to spending, the authorities noted that no general wage increase would be granted in 1995 or 1996, and that the hiring of government workers would be strictly limited. In addition, external debt-service payments would remain at roughly the same level as in 1994--reflecting the previous earmarking of revenue--and there would be a further substantial accumulation of external arrears. The authorities were reluctant to project the 1995 fiscal result until they knew the debt-service relief that might result from refinancing exter- nal debt to a major creditor representing about 36 percent of public exter- nal debt. No timetable for the rescheduling had been established. In any event, the authorities indicated that the budget would be managed on a cash basis. That is, cash outlays would be constrained to the level of available government revenue and any proceeds from borrowing or asset sales that might be available. 2. Baseline fiscal scenario On the basis of the draft 1995 budget and projections of the rest of the public sector, the mission projected that public dissavings would decline by 0.9 percentage point of GDP to 3.1 percent of GDP in 1995. Revenue would rise from 25.8 percent of GDP in 1994 to 27.3 percent of GDP in 1995, while current spending would rise from 29.8 percent of GDP to 30.4 percent. Full implementation of the investment plan thus would result in an overall public sector financing requirement of about 15 percent of GDP. However, the staff estimated that the authorities could rely at most on financing equivalent to about 5 percent of GDP--reflecting the difference between external interest payments coming due and cash payments of debt- service obligations out of earmarked revenue, together with small amounts of domestic borrowing and asset sales. On this basis, the mission estimated that public investment would be limited to about 2 percent of GDP in 1995. The mission also prepared a medium-term fiscal projection assuming no change in fiscal policy and maintenance of the authorities' approach to fiscal management. The baseline scenario assumed no new revenue measures after 1995 and that current expenditure would be limited in order to keep public sector dissavings at about 3 percent of GDP in the medium term. Financing was projected to average 4.5 percent of GDP; this included the difference between interest payments coming due and external debt-service Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 6 - payments in cash out of earmarked reve.nue equal to the 1994 level (which would result in.an accumulation of external arrears of about US$30 million a year), and minimal external financing. No debt-service relief or proceeds from privatization was assumed (Table 8). Constrained by the projected low level of public savings and financing, public investment would be less than 2 percent of GDP a year. 3. Alternative scenario with stronp: fiscal adiustment The mission also developed a normative medium-term scenario based on strong measures that would reduce the fiscal imbalance, avoid a further accumulation of arrears and begin dealing with the stock of arrears, and permit a higher rate of public investment. The cornerstone of the normative scenario was an effort to increase public savings by an additional 5 percentage points of GDP in 1995-96. Also, it was assumed that the proceeds of US$50 million from the sale of tourist properties and the public utilities (a one-time gain equivalent to 9 l/2 percent of GDP) would be used to reduce the stock of arrears, and that the remaining arrears would be eliminated by a Paris Club rescheduling. The fiscal effort would include some of the following measures: reintroduction of the personal income tax (yield 1.7 percent of GDP); a reduction in public employment (1 percent of GDP); and lower outlays on current goods and services (2.3 percent of GDP). These measures could be accompanied by others to strengthen the financial position of the public utilities by increasing tariffs--particularly of water and electricity-- reducing overstaffing, and improving collection procedures. An improvement in the fiscal position of: the public utilities would help set the stage for their privatization, which was recommended on fiscal and efficiency grounds. In addition, the mission suggested specific measures to improve tax collec- tions and reduce tax exemptions. Under this scenario the current balance of the public sector would improve from a deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 1994 to a surplus of about 3 percent of GDP in 2000, and the overall balance would shift from a deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to a small surplus in 2000. Public investment would rise to an average of about 3.5 percent of GDP in 1996-2000, the level considered to be the minimum required to sustain a rate of economic growth of around 5 percent toward the end of the period (see Table 8). Supported by the strengthening of the public finances, the external current account deficit would narrow from 5.4 percent of GDP in 1994 to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2000, reflecting a substantial growth of tourism receipts that would more than offset an increase in imports associated with higher investment. The overall balance of payments would be in equilibrium in 1996-2000 (Table 9). The authorities did not challenge the main elements of the various scenarios. However, they suggested that the effect of improvements in tax Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 7 - administration and in revenue collection was underestimated in the base year, which could have significant implications for the projections. They expected that in 1995 Parliament would approve laws that would strengthen the Inland Revenue Department's ability to collect overdue taxes and raise the penalties for nonpayment of the corporate income tax. They noted that the targeted US$50 million in proceeds from privatization could be achieved by the envisaged sale of the Royal Antiguan Hotel and other public assets in the tourism sector (in particular, another hotel and a duty-free shopping complex). They did not envisage privatizing the public utilities in the foreseeable future. The authorities indicated that they did not foresee political support for additional revenue measures over the next two or three years or for cuts in public employment (other than by attrition). The authorities also said that they were not considering a Paris Club rescheduling because of their reluctance to seek a financial arrangement from the Fund. Instead, they would aim to refinance the external debt on a bilateral basis. They would seek to close the remaining financing gap by domestic borrowing. The mission cautioned that delay in implementing a comprehensive adjustment program would aggravate an already difficult situation charac- terized by distortions and a lack of creditworthiness that severely constrains investment, both public and private. The failure to provide sufficient public investment to upgrade infrastructure could jeopardize the growth of tourism and the economy. Moreover, as revenues increasingly are earmarked at source to entice creditors to lend to the Government, the public sector would find it difficult to cover its basic spending obliga- tions, including wages. Lastly, given the authorities' reluctance to seek a Paris Club rescheduling, the staff recommended that the authorities contact external creditors promptly to explore available options. 4. External competitiveness and labor market policies The E.C. dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of ECS2.7 per U.S. dollar since 1976. The mission noted that the maintenance of com- petitiveness would depend on wage restraint, improvements in productivity through structural reforms, and most importantly a strengthening of the public finances. Wage restraint and employment reduction in the public sector would help to consolidate the public finances and moderate wage pressures in the private sector. The mission stressed that the Government should promote labor market flexibility to facilitate employment creation in the private sector, which will be needed as jobs are lost in the public sector. In this regard, the mission cautioned against the envisaged plans to establish a legal minimum wage, which would serve to increase labor-market rigidity. The authorities said that they would reconsider their plans for a minimum wage and that they intended also to continue with the vocational training program and with a liberal immigration policy.

Development strategy In contrast to the early 1980s when t:he public sector was involved directly in tourism-related projects, in recent years government partici- pation in the economy has focussed on providing support to the private sector, including through the maintenance of infrastructure. However, the authorities were considering expanding the role of the social security system to that of developer and mortgage lender as envisaged in a new housing program. The program would include the use of land received by the Social Security Scheme (as settlement of some central government arrears) to develop medium- and low-income housing tracts. The authorities considered that tourism and tourism-related activities should continue to play a major role in Antigua and,Barbuda. Value added of hotels and restaurant services averaged about 12 percent of GDP in 1990-94, and tourism receipts accounted for about 75 percent of foreign exchange receipts. The authorities indicated that Antigua and Barbuda will strive to maintain its share of the high end of the tourist market. They noted that this segment is less dependent than others on changes in competitiveness in other tourist destinations, and was not expected to be affected by recent developments in Mexico. The authorities also have begun to take steps to diversify the economy by fostering private investment in other sectors of the economy including agriculture and manufacturing. To promote cotton production, mainly for export, the authorities have initiated a program to provide seeds, fertilizers, and support services. Also, Antigua and Barbuda has received assistance in livestock management from the European Development Fund, and in horticulture from the People's Republic of China. In late 1994 Parliament approved the Free Trade and Processing Zone Act awarding tax holidays and other incentives to firms engaged in the manufacture of goods :for export, but no firms have been established yet under the terms of this Act. At the same time, the authorities indicated that they would continue to encourage the expansion of accommodation capacity in existing tourist facil- ities through tax holidays and tax-free imports. They expect an increase in tourist capacity of about 3 percent in 1995 (compared with about 8 percent in 1990-94), with furthler diversification toward private homes and time- share units. The mission agreed with the authorities' aim of diversifying the economy, given the cyclical nature of tourism. However, the staff noted that such efforts would need the underpinnings of a fiscal policy that permits the upgrading of infrastructure to sustain private sector activity. In this regard, the mission cautioned the authorities about the possible negative effect on the financial soundness of the Social Security Scheme of expanding its role into commercial activities.

Environmental and povertv issues The authorities acknowledged that current low levels of public sector investment could have an adverse effect on the environment, which in turn could have negative consequences for the tourist industry. Inadequate waste disposal procedures have led to the discharge of untreated sewerage into the sea and wetlands. This poses a major health hazard and is the main cause of contamination of coastal waters, including in some tourism locations. The Ministry of Tourism, Culture, and the Environment has yet to implement a strategy to deal with environmental issues, but in 1995 the Government plans a public awareness campaign of environmental issues. Per capita income in Antigua and Barbuda was estimated at US$7,700 in 1994; there are no reliable estimates of the number ,of people living in poverty. The Government has taken the position that rather than implement programs specifically designed to assist low-income groups, it should provide substantial direct employment. Public sector employment, estimated at 9,500 in 1994, accounts for about one third of total employment in Antigua and Barbuda, which is high by the standards of other countries in the region. The authorities considered that their public employment policy had helped to maintain a low level of unemployment (estimated at 7 percent). Nevertheless, they agreed that a further sustained increase in employment would need to depend on growth in the private sector. 7. Statistical issues The mission urged the authorities to improve the quality and timeliness of the statistical base, in particular in the area of the public finances. The mission also stressed the importance of identifying intra-public sector arrears and establishing a mechanism to clear them. IV. Staff AppraisaJ After slowing in the early 199Os, output growth in Antigua and Barbuda has picked up in the past two years based on the recovery of tourism and related activities. Inflation has remained low reflecting the monetary discipline associated with Antigua and Barbuda's membership in the Eastern Caribbean monetary union. However, public savings have continued to deteri- orate and there has been a further large accumulation of external payments arrears. As a result, foreign financing has declined to low levels and forced a reduction in public investment. In the absence of major action to redress the country's serious imbalances, a disorderly process of adjustment will continue to fall on public investment, with serious consequences for infrastructure, the environment, and ultimately for tourism, the main source of economic growth. A comprehensive program is needed to increase public savings to begin dealing with the country's arrears problem and to raise investment. Such a program would help strengthen investor confidence and eventually restore access to foreign financing. Fiscal measures taken in late 1994 and early Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 10 - 1995 are a step in the right direction but fall well short of what is needed. Given the level of external arrears, the authorities also will need to use the proceeds from privatization to reduce overdue external obligations as part of a comprehensive effort to normalize relations with creditors. Stronger actions supported by a Fund arrangement and a Paris Club rescheduling would be the most advantageous route for the authorities to take, and in this context the staff has discussed with the authorities ele- ments of a comprehensive program with broad-based fiscal measures. Most of the additional fiscal adjustment should focus on cutting current expendi- ture, in particular, through reduction in public employment. There also is a need to strengthen the tax effort, in particular through the reintroduc- tion of the personal income tax. In addition, tax administration and tax enforcement must be improved, and tax exemptions must be curtailed. The operations of the public utilities should be improved by raising tariffs, strengthening collection procedures, and cutting overstaffing. Improved operations would help facilitate their privatization, and together with the sale of other public assets this would help mobilize resources that could be used for external debt reduction Continued growth in tourism and the economy requires that Antigua and Barbuda remains competitive. Wage restraint in the private sector will be key in this regard, given the peg of Antigua and Barbuda's currency to the U.S. dollar through memb'ership in the Eastern Caribbean monetary union. Strict adherence to the authorities' decision to freeze government wages would help curb the growth of the wage bill and encourage private sector wage discipline. In addition, maintenance of a liberal immigration policy for workers would help to preserve Antigua and Barbuda's competitiveness. As efforts to impro-ve the public finances will require some reduction in public employment, the authorities should promote labor market flexi- bility to ensure the needed creation of employment opportunities in the private sector. In this regard, proceeding with plans to establish a legal minimum wage could prove counterproductive. The authorities are encouraged to continue their efforts to diversify the economy. Such efforts will need to be underpinned by solid public finances that would provide for the upgrading of infrastructure to sustain private sector activity. Delay in implementing a comprehensive adjustment program will affect the economy negatively by forcing the country to resort to further accumu- lation of arrears and reduce spending, on infrastructure, with adverse consequences for economic activity. Attempts to put off the adjustment by earmarking revenues to attract additional borrowing will lead eventually to a situation where the Government will not be in a position to meet its mo.st basic obligations. It is recommended that the next Arti'cle IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:54 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - Table 1.

Outstanding statistical issues a. Real sector The availability of real sector data for publication in IFS is limited. At present, no data are reported to the Statistics Department on wholesale prices, production, employment, earnings, and trade indices. Among data series that are reported, GDP data are only through 1992. Two missions from the Statistics Department have visited Antigua and Barbuda to provide technical assistance on revising the CPI. A new set of expenditure weights based on import values (as household expenditure data were unavailable) and proposals for implementing tighter commodity speci- fications and collection procedures, were agreed to by the authorities and the major prospective users of the new interim CPI. The authorities will need to develop a household survey before final implementation of the CPI. a. Government finance Antigua and Barbuda has never reported GFS data to the Fund. The authorities are trying to implement a system for compiling and reporting GFS data to STA. The mission does not expect that the country would be able to produce information before the end of 1995. b. Monetarv accounts Due to difficulties encountered by the ECCB in receiving detailed information from banks, the consolidated commercial bank accounts are provided with a considerable lag. 2.
