Background  Recent economic performance has raised a number of concerns. While inflation is low and the economy has been partially insulated from the effects of the global financial crisis, lower oil prices and production are putting pressure on the fiscal and external accounts. The fiscal deficit is expected to reach a record 8–9 percent in 2009, and has relied on a range of extraordinary measures to generate sufficient domestic financing. The current account deficit is expected to increase to some 6 percent of GDP. Excluding the SDR allocations, central bank foreign exchange reserves declined by about one-fifth in the twelve months to September 2009.  Authorities’ views  The authorities are committed to fiscal adjustment, but recent political and security developments limit the room for bold measures. Efforts will be made to keep the 2010 budget deficit below 8 percent of GDP.  Monetary policy has been accommodative, including a reduction in the benchmark deposit rate from 13 to 10 percent during the first half of 2009. The authorities are reluctant to undertake further interest rate reductions for fear of higher dollarization.   The rial was allowed to depreciate slightly in response to falling foreign exchange reserves. Continued flexibility in the rial will likely be necessary, but should be gradual.  Staff recommendations  Given limited room for additional domestic financing, staff recommends bringing the budget deficit for 2010 to about 7 percent of GDP—through a combination of fuel subsidy reduction, wage restraint, prioritization of capital expenditure, and tax reform.  Over the medium term, further consolidation of the fiscal position is needed to contain the debt burden, and adjustment made more difficult by declining oil revenues.  Continued exchange rate flexibility will likely be necessary. There is no clear evidence of a significant misalignment, but given the expected depletion of oil reserves over the medium and long term, some adjustment through the exchange rate will be necessary to maintain external sustainability and boost competitiveness.

Changes could be gradual—watchful of the impact on the external accounts and dollarization—and go hand in hand with financial sector reform.  I.   CHALLENGES FROM WITHOUT AND WITHIN 1.      Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the region, and is confronted with a range of difficult economic, resource, and security challenges. A number of red flags have appeared with respect to macroeconomic balances in the past year—many of which related to underlying weaknesses identified in previous Article IV consultations. On the political and security fronts, tough challenges have emerged in the past 12 months—undermining nascent reform efforts and the ability of the government to take corrective action.  A.   Political, Security, and Resource Developments 2.      The past year has seen an intensification of underlying political and security pressures. On the political front, escalating conflict with Houthi rebels in the north has put pressure on the national government and created an humanitarian crisis for groups of internally displaced people (IDPs). Further pressure has come from increasing protests and civil unrest in the south of the country. Regarding security, a regrouping of Al Qaeda forces in Yemen has led to a number of incidents. The active presence of pirates in the Gulf of Aden has also been a persistent problem, as has a steady stream of refugees from fighting in neighboring Somalia.  3.      Water shortages have also exacerbated social and economic problems. Drought in several parts of the country has been a persistent problem—exacerbating the food-price shock in 2008, and in 2009 forcing water and sanitation companies in Yemen to adopt water rationing in major cities, including the capital Sana’a. Yemen’s groundwater resources are also under strain—prompting the adoption of a National Water Sector Strategy and Investment Program in 2004. B.   Recent Economic Developments 4.      While direct financial contagion from the global crisis has been limited, Yemen has suffered from a range of indirect effects. The financial sector, which remains small and isolated from international markets, was not affected by the global financial crisis. The slowdown in world growth, however, contributed to a slowdown in some areas of economic activity. Non-hydrocarbon economic growth in Yemen appears to have weakened, from 4.8 percent in 2008 to an estimated 4.1 percent in 2009—reflecting slower activity in such Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public6   areas as agriculture, construction, and real estate.15.      The most pronounced impact of the global slowdown has been through lower oil prices. Oil production continued to decline in 2009, and the start of LNG production was delayed until late October. Lower production, combined with the sharp drop in average prices and lower government share of output has resulted in a significant decline in government oil exports. During January–September 2009, government oil exports were only one-third the value of the same period in 2008.   Inflation has hit record lows, due largely to the sharp decline in international food prices.  6.      The loss of oil revenue may lead to a record fiscal deficit in 2009. Adjustment efforts have not kept pace with declining oil receipts. The civil service wage bill was contained through reduced hiring, a freeze on wage increases, and no Ramadan bonus. A December 2008 cabinet decree to slash nonessential current expenditure, however, was only partly successful due to commitment control problems. Non-hydrocarbon revenues have been stagnant. Full implementation of the General Sales Tax (GST) did not materialize, and the government has instead sought to increase tax revenues through penalties on those not formally registered for the GST, and a presumptive tax on output.2                                                 1 Timely data on national accounts is not available, but the perception of slower growth in construction and real estate is supported by substantially lower levels of private sector credit in these areas, and is consistent with a weakening of foreign direct investment flows in the region.  Barring fourth quarter 2 GST is not yet applied at the retail level, but only for importers and producers. Out of 6,500 eligible taxpayers, only 200 are compliant and pay GST. In the meantime, a temporary agreement has been reached with the private sector whereby compliant taxpayers pay 5 percent GST either at customs or at factory gate. Non-compliant taxpayers pay 10 percent at customs.

Box 1. Financing the Government Deficit The rapid increase in the fiscal deficit engendered a range of extraordinary financing measures by the government of Yemen, in conjunction with the central bank. Key among these measures were:  • The CBY repurchased the entire outstanding stock of central bank CDs (some Yrls 256 billion) held by commercial banks-- thus freeing-up resources to be invested in new government T-bills. This was revenue neutral for banks (the instruments have the same yield), but allowed for a significant increase in commercial bank budget financing. • Maturing T-bills held by pension funds (Yrls 317 billion) were swapped for lower yielding, longer maturity T-bonds (Yrls 380 billion).  • Direct financing from the CBY via an overdraft facility, which is effectively interest free. While these measures helped to close the financing gap in 2009, there were a number of detrimental side effects. The rapid increase in T-bill issuance to banks may have engendered some crowding-out of private sector credit. The placement of lower-yielding T-bonds with public pension funds accelerates the expected bankruptcy of these funds from 2029 to 2018.   The heavy use of domestic financing in 2009 has also squeezed room for new T-bill and T-bond issuance in 2010. Based on discussions with the authorities, staff estimates that market capacity to absorb new T-bill and T-bond issuance would likely be limited to about Yrls 235–260 billion. A sizeable fiscal deficit would—in the absence of new external financing—imply a heavy burden on direct budget support from the central bank (possibly exceeding the allowed limit of about Yrls 500 billion). Fiscal adjustment in 2010 is thus seen as essential not only to curtail the rise in public debt and create room for a resumption of private sector credit, but also to minimize the need for central bank financing—the cost of which would come in the form of either higher inflation or accelerated loss of foreign exchange reserves.

Pressure on the balance of payments was clearly visible. From September 2008 to September 2009, usable foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) declined by $1.6 billion,3 or roughly one-fifth of the initial reserve cushion. The sharp decline in oil exports was the driving force. However, strong import demand (especially for food and fuel, which together account for 60 percent of total imports) and an apparent slowdown in foreign direct investment and inward remittances also played a role.48.      The main focus of monetary policy shifted from containing inflation to providing liquidity. With single digit inflation, declining private sector credit, and a rapidly expanding fiscal deficit, CBY policy has been largely accommodative. In addition to reinjecting sizeable liquidity into the banking system through a repurchase of central bank CDs, the CBY also made the first adjustment to the benchmark deposit rate in nearly ten years—lowering the rate from 13 percent to 10 percent during January–May. The impact on broad money growth has been muted given the decrease in net foreign assets. However, the surge in credit to government may have contributed to lower private sector credit growth—which turned negative by mid-2009. Pressure may have eased in the last quarter of the year as oil prices rose, but the current account deficit is projected to widen from 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 6 percent in 2009. 5                                                   3 Not including the SDR allocation of $281.6 million at end-August and $36.3 million at end-September 2009 4 Estimates suggest that roughly 70 percent of Yemeni expatriates work in the GCC. Inward remittances were equivalent to about 5 percent of GDP in 2008. 5 Negative private sector credit growth is a concern, but should be kept in perspective. At less than 8 percent of GDP, private sector credit is the lowest in the region. Another significant element in the decline in private sector credit is trade finance (the value of which declined in 2009 due to the collapse in commodity prices). Abstracting from trade finance, private sector credit growth is still positive, but low by historical comparison. -20-10010203040Jan-08May-08Sep-08Jan-09May-09Sep-09Other Items NetNet Domestic CreditNet Foreign AssetsBroad MoneyYemen: Structure of M2(12-month growth, in percent)Sources: Yemeniauthorities; staff projectionsReserve moneyBroad moneyClaims on Private Sector-20-1001020304050Jan-06Dec-06Nov-07Oct-08Sep-09Yemen: Money Developments(12-month growth, in percent)Sources:Yemeni authorities; staff projections.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public9   9.      The CBY allowed moderate depreciation of the rial. Faced with falling reserves, the CBY reverted from an open window on foreign exchange sales (at a steady rate of about Yrls 200 per U.S. dollar) to periodic auctions that allowed some depreciation of the rial. Some aspects of the transition were not well planned. Banks were informed of the shift only a day before the first auction and money changers (responsible for a significant portion of daily turnover) were initially excluded. Concern over the availability of foreign exchange prompted a temporary spike in the rial/dollar exchange rate and pre-emptive purchases by commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers—leading to a large drop in foreign exchange reserves in June–July. Markets calmed thereafter and (including the SDR allocation6  in August) reserves climbed by $684 million in August–September.   10.      Financial sector soundness indicators continue to improve. While nonperforming loans remain high, they are declining. Capital ratios are also on the rise, in line with a legal requirement to increase capital by end-2009. However, dollarization (measured as foreign exchange deposits as a share of total deposits) appears to be rising after several years of steady decline.                                                  6 The authorities have, for the time being, opted to keep the SDR allocation in foreign exchange reserve to help offset reserve losses in the first half of 2009.

NEAR- AND MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES 11.      Yemen’s medium-term prospects are tied to the hydrocarbon sector. Oil production is expected to continue to decline, with exploitable reserves running out perhaps as early as 2021. The production and export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) via the Yemen LNG project will offer some cushion, but cannot compensate for the loss of oil given the government’s relatively small share in the LNG project. Indications of additional gas reserves may prolong the life of the hydrocarbon sector, and could possibly be used for power generation (reducing the need to import refined fuel products). The predominant trend, however, indicates that Yemen will shift from being a net fuel exporter to a net fuel importer within just a few years.  30354045505560Jan-06Dec-06Nov-07Oct-08Sep-09FX / Total DepositsFX Loans / Total LoansSources:Yemeni authorities; staff projections.810121416181416182022242628200420052006200720082009Yemen: Financial Soundness Indicators(In percent)Nonperforming loans to gross loansRisk-weighted capital adequacy ratio, right axisSources:Yemeni authorities; staff projections.Yemen: Dollarizationof Deposits and Loans(In percent)Fuel exportsFuel Imports0.01.02.03.04.05.020062008201020122014Yemen: GovernmentOil Balance(In billions of U.S. dollars)Sources:Yemeni authorities; staff projections.0.01.02.03.04.05.020062008201020122014Yemen: Hydrocarbon Export Revenues(In billions of Yrls)OilGasSources:Yemeni authorities; staff projections.Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public11   12.      Status quo policies are likely unsustainable. In the near term, the key problem is financing the 2010 budget deficit (given that the domestic debt market has already been squeezed and new external financing is unlikely). Over the medium term, continued declines in oil production will add additional pressure on the fiscal and external accounts. Continued high fiscal deficits—even if they could be financed—would lead quickly to unsustainable levels of public debt and/or an exhaustion of foreign exchange reserves. A resurgence of high inflation and a sudden shift in confidence could also be accompanied by sharp downward pressures on the rial. An illustrative macroeconomic framework, demonstrating the course of public debt and foreign exchange reserves under a non-adjustment scenario was discussed with the authorities.     13.      The need for a realignment of resources and expenditures (both on the fiscal and external accounts) was also highlighted through the debt sustainability analysis (DSA). The updated joint Bank-Fund DSA conducted as part of the mission found that, despite relatively low levels of debt-to-GDP at present, Yemen remains at a high risk of debt distress over the medium and long term.

Sustainable macroeconomic policies are necessary condition for higher growth and poverty reduction. Yemen remains one of the poorest countries in the region—both in terms of per capita income and natural resources. Progress on meeting the Millennium Development Goals has been limited. Infrastructure needs are many, and the ability of the government to meet pressing demands for basic social services is increasingly strained. Enabling a successful transition to a non-hydrocarbon economy and creating both the room and the incentives for accelerated private sector growth will be key to combating and preventing further rise in poverty.    III.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS 15.      Against this backdrop, discussions focused on three areas: (i) the need to make durable improvements in the structure of public finances in 2010; (ii) medium-term adjustment to ensure fiscal and external sustainability; and (iii) options for closer engagement with the IMF.  A.   Fiscal Policy 16.      A large budget deficit in 2010 poses serious risks. Preliminary figures provided by the government (using a budget oil price of $55 per barrel) suggested a deficit of nearly 12 percent of GDP. Even assuming an oil price of $75 per barrel8 the overall fiscal deficit would still approach 10 percent of GDP. With T-bill and T-bond financing already squeezed (Box 1), financing a deficit of this magnitude would imply sizeable additional central bank lending.9                                                 7 While sustainability indicators for external debt are somewhat more favorable than in the 2008 DSA due to higher projected oil prices and inclusion of LNG revenues throughout the long term, the high debt distress rating has been maintained given the low institutional capacity cited above and the high magnitude of required adjustment going forward.  The mission highlighted that this could lead either to upward pressure on inflation (through an increase in money supply) or an acceleration of the loss of foreign exchange reserves (if the CBY sterilized reserve money growth through foreign exchange auctions). Either scenario could lead to a deterioration in confidence in the fiscal position and/or the rial. The mission also highlighted the limited room such a deficit would leave for a 8 Consistent with the World Economic Outlook (WEO) projected international price of $76.5 per barrel, and incorporating a $1.5 discount for Yemeni crude oil. 9 The limit on the central bank overdraft facility for the central government is 25 percent of the average of the last three years of government revenue—about Yrls 500 billion. This facility was also envisaged to be short term, rather than a permanent feature of public finance.

The authorities indicated that efforts would be made to bring the budget deficit to about 8 percent of GDP. They noted restraint on public wages and salaries, efforts to curtail nonessential current expenditures, and a willingness to cut or delay capital expenditures. Work on measures to support a reduction in fuel subsidies (a public education campaign and a strengthening/better targeting of social welfare transfers) has advanced considerably. However, the authorities emphasized that the political/security situation would make bold measures difficult in the near term. On raising non-hydrocarbon revenues, they noted that full implementation of the General Sales Tax (GST) would be delayed pending an external review of the GST law. Optimism was high that revisions to the corporate income tax (a reduction in the tax rate from 35 to 20 percent in exchange for elimination of exemptions) would pass parliament soon. However, the authorities are also considering a decrease in the tax on public wages and salaries—which would likely lead to a decrease in income tax in 2010 and beyond. In the weeks following the mission, the authorities shared a revised budget proposal that suggested an overall deficit of about 7.5 percent of GDP (using WEO oil price), but some of the underlying assumptions regarding policy measures were unclear, and the proposal had yet to be submitted to parliament. B.   Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 18.      Yemen’s interest rate structure remains among the highest in the region, and the mission suggested further decreases in the benchmark deposit rate. While recent reductions in the benchmark rate were welcome, staff pointed out the large premium relative to other countries in the region,10 high real interest rates (given low inflation), and the need to facilitate private sector credit.11                                                 10 The staff argued that shifts in the relative supply and demand for foreign exchange in Yemen were predominantly driven by developments in the current account, and were thus less affected by interest rate premia than a number of other countries in the region where capital/financial account developments were more critical.   The authorities were not in favor of additional interest rate cuts at this time, and argued that an increase in interest rates might be undertaken in 2010 to reduce the outflow of reserves and a recent rise in dollarization. Given uncertainty regarding the impact on dollarization and the external accounts, the mission recommended that future reductions could be small—on the order of 25 to 50 basis points—and subject to careful review.  11 A strong recovery in private sector credit would likely be driven predominantly by stronger economic growth lower credit to government, but a reduction in interest rates could provide some tertiary impetus and is unlikely to have a negative impact on deposits given the low level of financial intermediation (only 5 percent of the population have bank accounts).

Exchange rate flexibility may be necessary to facilitate an orderly adjustment in the balance of payments. Rising oil prices, the start of LNG exports, and (as the global recovery takes shape) a resumption of foreign direct investment inflows and inward remittances should help to ease pressures on Yemen’s balance of payments. Nevertheless, given high population growth, the expected shift to being a net fuel importer, and continued reliance on food imports these pressures are unlikely to disappear. Staff’s econometric estimates (Box 2) suggest that the rial was somewhat overvalued at end-2008, and that adjustment in the real effective exchange rate will be needed to ensure medium-term sustainability. Some of this adjustment has already occurred, facilitated by lower inflation, some nominal depreciation, and a rise in oil prices. Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation, together with a willingness to allow the rial to move in response to fundamental shifts in the supply and demand for foreign exchange will help to enable adjustment in relative prices and minimize loss of foreign exchange reserves. 20.      The authorities concurred that the rial would need to adjust over time. They emphasized the desirability of a gradual path, and the need for the CBY to continue to intervene to reduce short-term volatility. They highlighted the inelasticity of import demand (a substantial portion of imports are basic commodities), and pointed out that fiscal consolidation would be key to easing pressure on the balance of payments.

Exchange Rate Assessment  There is no clear evidence to suggest that the exchange rate is significantly misaligned, but given the magnitude of adjustment implied by declining oil exports, some depreciation of real exchange rate over medium term will likely be needed to maintain equilibrium.  Staff’s econometric estimates suggest that the Yemen’s real effective exchange rate (REER) was overvalued at the end of 2008, but was trending back toward its estimated equilibrium in the first months of 2009. Notably, deviations from the long run equilibrium appear to be temporary and driven mainly by fluctuations in oil prices  Using a simple univariate regression and OLS methodology, it is estimated that an increase in oil prices by 1 percent results in appreciation of the Yemeni exchange rate by 0.17 percent. As the price of oil plunged in the last quarter of 2008, the degree of misalignment vis-à-vis the estimated equilibrium deepened, suggesting an overvaluation at end-2008 of about 20 percent (first panel of chart below).  Assessment of Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate   In addition to the simple regression of oil price on REER, a long run equilibrium exchange rate was calculated using cointegration methodology. Here again, due to downward shocks to oil prices during the latter part of the year, the degree of misalignment between the REER and its estimated long-run equilibrium level increased to around 20 percent (second panel of chart above). However, with the subsequent recovery in oil prices, the REER has trended back towards equilibrium in 2009. Results using the cointegration methodology suggest that 0.11 percent of deviation from the long-run equilibrium is adjusted for in one month.   Results from CGER-type econometric estimates were mixed—highlighting the weakness of these methodologies particularly where data quality is weak. Notably, all three methodologies (macro balance, external sustainability, and equilibrium real exchange rate – based on MCD coefficients for oil exporters) suggested a degree of overvaluation similar to that estimated by the simple regression and the cointegration methodology. Forward looking assessments were on both ends of the spectrum and largely inconclusive, ranging from an overvaluation of 2 percent to an undervaluation of 23 percent.   A qualitative assessment lends support to the view that the rial entered a period of overvaluation in 2008. As oil prices began to fall in the second half of the year, and the external current account deficit expanded, foreign exchange reserves of the CBY also began to decline—from a peak of $8 billion in September 2008 to $7.3 billion by end-December. This decline continued for the first part of 2009, but has gradually moderated as oil prices increased and the rial was allowed to depreciate. Looking ahead, however, pressures are likely to re-emerge as oil production and exports decline, suggesting that (together with fiscal consolidation) some adjustment in the real effective exchange rate will be necessary to maintain equilibrium. 8090100110120130140150Jan-00Jul-00Jan-01Jul-01Jan-02Jul-02Jan-03Jul-03Jan-04Jul-04Jan-05Jul-05Jan-06Jul-06Jan-07Jul-07Jan-08Jul-08Jan-09Actual REER Simple oil regression estimated REER Deviation from LR equilibrium with oil pricesCPI infl (12 month, core)-0.2-0.15-0.1-0.0500.050.10.150.20.250.3Jan-00Jul-00Jan-01Jul-01Jan-02Jul-02Jan-03Jul-03Jan-04Jul-04Jan-05Jul-05Jan-06Jul-06Jan-07Jul-07Jan-08Jul-08Jan-09051015202530Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public16   C.   Medium-Term Adjustment 21.      The nature of the challenges facing Yemen necessitates concrete reforms in 2010, followed by a sustained effort over the medium term. Immediate action is necessary to ensure stability in 2010, but against a steady decline in oil revenues, steps will also be necessary to preserve a sound fiscal position, maintain external sustainability, create room for social welfare and infrastructure spending, and enable economic growth and diversification over the medium term. A potential anchor for medium-term adjustment (incorporated into the macroeconomic framework presented here) is a fiscal strategy that centers on annual reductions in the non-oil primary balance (an average of 2 percent per year over the medium term) to keep public debt below 50 percent of GDP.12• Eliminate subsidies on diesel, kerosene, and gasoil in the near term; subsidies on liquid propane gas (LPG) phased out later in the medium term, after transfers through the Social Welfare Fund and other pro-poor spending have taken hold.   Key measures to achieve this objective would include the following: • Eliminate the government subsidy on electricity—through a combination of efficiency gains, tariff increases, and investment in new plant and equipment. • Streamline the public sector wage bill to about 8 percent of GDP by the end of the medium term.  • Increase the GST rate. Given likely initial difficulties in GST administration, gradual sequencing of rate increases will be important, as well as a cooperative process with the private sector to secure implementation. • Maintain strong central control over tax and customs exemptions. Exemptions should be avoided, in favor of other incentives such as accelerated depreciation. 22.      A range of structural reforms will likely be necessary over the medium term to ensure successful macroeconomic adjustment and bolster prospects for growth and poverty reduction. Key areas include: • Public financial management and pension reform. Rollout of the Automated Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) should proceed as soon as is feasible. In light of financial stress on public pensions through issuance of T-bonds,                                                  12 A ceiling of 50 percent for debt-to-GDP was considered broadly appropriate given current levels of debt, and the low level of institutional capacity. Under the current debt structure, this equates to an NPV of public debt-to-GDP of about 40 percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public17   the government should follow the planned actuarial analysis in 2010 with a strategic plan to ensure long-term pension fund sustainability. • Financial sector reform. Fiscal consolidation is the first step toward a greater private sector orientation in the financial sector. Eventual elimination of the benchmark deposit rate is another essential component. Measures over the medium term to facilitate financial sector development could include: (i) development of Islamic financial instruments (sukuk); (ii) an automated credit registry (underway); (iii) enforcing prudential regulations on concentration of credit; (iv) improving the functioning of commercial courts and judicial processes for recovery of bank and other debts; and (v) further encouraging microfinance. • Diversification and private sector growth. As oil production declines, new sources of growth will need to be found. The government has rightly focused on improving the investment environment. Recent initiatives include an overhaul of the income tax regime, streamlining GST administration and filing procedures, improving public procurement, and establishing an independent anti-corruption authority. Remaining bottlenecks include judicial reform, investor protection, property rights, and basic infrastructure.  23.      The authorities concurred that Yemen faces significant challenges, and that adjustment would need to proceed over a medium-term timeframe. They highlighted the efforts to rise to this challenge, including the introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework for the budget, the Third Socio-Economic Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (DPPR) for acceleration of economic growth, the Public Investment Plan (PIP), and the creation of a Ten Point Plan to enhance economic development prospects over the next two years. D.   Role for the Fund 24.      The mission discussed with the authorities the potential for closer engagement with the Fund. Given the many challenges ahead, including the need for short-term policy action to address the fiscal position, the authorities signaled interest in Fund support—possibly under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)—to support the design and monitoring of a Yemeni strategy to reduce macroeconomic and structural imbalances. It was agreed that program discussions could move forward early in the new year. IV.   STAFF APPRAISAL 25.      Risks to macroeconomic stability have risen. The decline in oil revenue resulting from the fall in oil prices and production have again highlighted Yemen’s vulnerability to external shocks, and the precarious position of both public finances and the balance of payments. Reforms that might have lessened this vulnerability were again delayed—albeit in the midst of the most serious domestic conflict since the 1994 civil war. Significant Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public18   challenges—water scarcity, peace-related and social welfare spending needs, and the inevitable decline in hydrocarbon resources—still lie ahead. 26.      It is critical to reduce the fiscal deficit in 2010. Fiscal policy pushed beyond prudent limits in 2009. The sizeable increase in domestic debt, use of central bank financing, and new financial instruments (T-bonds) that shortened the life of the public pension scheme were all red flags. While some increase in the deficit was to be expected given the sharp decline in oil prices, the lack of action to reduce rigidity in public expenditures and boost non-oil revenues is a serious concern. The outlook for 2010 and beyond will hinge on the authorities’ capacity to undertake long overdue measures in these areas—most critically fuel subsidies and implementation of the GST—and to sustain reform momentum into the medium term. The staff urges action on these critical issues, with a view to reducing the overall fiscal deficit to about 7 percent of GDP. This should minimize (although not eliminate) the need for CBY financing, stabilize public debt, and allow greater room for a resumption in private sector credit. 27.       Monetary policy should keep a wary eye on inflationary pressures, but also explore room for greater interest rate and exchange rate flexibility. In the staff’s view, the minimum interest rate on deposits (originally established to foster financial intermediation) has outlived its usefulness and now inhibits market signals. Further reductions in the benchmark rate should be explored, with a view toward eventually eliminating the benchmark rate in favor of market based mechanisms for monetary policy. In addition, staff’s econometric estimates, qualitative evidence (the loss of reserves), and the magnitude of structural adjustment implied by depletion of oil reserves strongly suggest the need for continued exchange rate flexibility over the medium term. The staff urges the authorities not to resist fundamental pressures in this regard. Recent experience with the reversion to foreign exchange auctions also highlights the need for the CBY to communicate effectively with both banks and money exchangers, and to ensure that the auction process runs smoothly on a technical level. 28.      Structural reforms to boost public financial management, encourage development of the financial sector, and promote non-hydrocarbon growth will be essential. As oil revenues decline and budget constraints become tighter, capacity to monitor and adjust fiscal policy on a timely basis will be an important element in maintaining macroeconomic stability. The mission welcomes the progress on AFMIS in this regard, and encourages continued efforts in this area. Work on financial sector reform and development is underway with the assistance of the World Bank, but the mission also urges the authorities to press ahead with plans to issue Islamic financial instruments (sukuk)—both to widen the range of financing instruments available and to engage the Islamic banking sector.13                                                 13 Progress in these areas is ongoing. Notably, the authorities have established an inter-ministerial committee to facilitate identification of projects that could be financed by sukuk.  Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:59 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public19   Promoting non-hydrocarbon sector growth will be indispensable in addressing poverty and reducing Yemen’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks. The mission urges a focus on key infrastructural bottlenecks, and close attention to contract, property rights, and judicial reform to boost Yemen’s investment environment—but to avoid ad hoc exemptions or other incentives that have a negative impact on government revenue. 29.      Data provision remains adequate for surveillance purposes, but work in a number of areas needs to be accelerated. The national accounts remains in a transition phase, and further work (supported by a forthcoming IMF TA mission) is needed to resolve outstanding technical concerns on the revised series. Timely publication of information on the fiscal accounts has also flagged somewhat in the past year, and efforts should be made to ensure that the quarterly financial bulletin is posted on the internet with a lag of no more than three months. Balance of payments data continues to lag well behind a number of countries in the region, and the staff urges closer attention in this area—particularly given the need for a timely understanding of external sector developments as an input to monetary/exchange rate policy. 30.      It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

DRAFT PUBLIC INFORMATION NOTICE (PIN) Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 10/xx FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January [xx], 2010   IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Yemen    On January [8], 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Yemen.1  Background  Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the region, and progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals has been slow. Crude oil output—the mainstay of government revenue and exports—has been in decline since 2000. Barring major new discoveries, exploitable oil reserves could be exhausted in a relatively short period. A new liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility that began production in late 2009 will provide some cushion for dwindling oil, and recent discoveries of natural gas may prolong the life of the hydrocarbon sector as a whole. Nevertheless, the magnitude of adjustment required by continued declines in oil output is substantial, even over the medium term. Generating strong and sustainable non-hydrocarbon growth, ensuring fiscal and external sustainability, and meeting Yemen’s pressing social and development needs will be key challenges.  Recent economic performance in Yemen has raised some concerns. While direct financial contagion from the global crisis has been limited, Yemen has suffered from a                                                  1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

The slowdown in world growth appears to have contributed to a slowdown in some areas of economic activity. Non hydrocarbon economic growth in Yemen appears to have weakened, from 4.8 percent in 2008 to an estimated 4.1 percent in 2009—reflecting slower activity in such areas as agriculture (possibly linked to Yemen’s growing water shortages), construction, manufacturing, and real estate. Inflation has hit record lows, due largely to the sharp decline in international food prices.   The heaviest impact from the global recession has come through lower oil prices. Lower production, combined with the sharp drop in average prices and lower government share of output between 2008 and 2009 has resulted in a significant decline in government oil exports. The loss of oil revenue has put pressure on the government fiscal balance. The authorities have sought to mitigate the impact through containment of the civil service wage bill and a cabinet decree to slash non-essential current expenditures, but overall the adjustment effort has not kept pace with declining oil receipts. Non-hydrocarbon revenues, meanwhile, have been stagnant. Full implementation of the General Sales Tax (GST), expected in 2009, did not materialize. The overall deficit is projected to reach 8–9 percent of GDP in 2009.  The main focus of monetary policy shifted from containing inflation to providing liquidity. With single digit inflation, declining private sector credit, and a rapidly expanding fiscal deficit, monetary policy by the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has been largely accommodative. In addition to reinjecting sizeable liquidity into the banking system through a repurchase of central bank CDs, the CBY also made the first adjustment to the benchmark deposit rate in nearly ten years—lowering the rate from 13 percent to 10 percent during January–May. The impact on broad money growth has been muted given the decrease in net foreign assets. However, the surge in credit to government may have contributed to lower private sector credit growth—which turned negative by mid-2009.  Pressure on the balance of payments was also visible. From September 2008 to September 2009, usable foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) declined by $1.6 billion, or roughly one-fifth of the initial reserve cushion (excluding allocations of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in August and September), but remain comfortable at $6.6 billion or about 9 months of imports. The sharp decline in oil exports was the driving force. However, strong import demand (especially for food and fuel, which together account for 60 percent of total imports) and an apparent slowdown in foreign direct investment and inward remittances also played a role. Pressure may have eased in the last quarter of the year as oil prices rose, but the current account deficit is projected to widen from 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 6 percent in 2009.

While nonperforming loans remain high, they are declining. Capital ratios are also on the rise, in line with a legal requirement to increase capital by end-2009. However, dollarization (measured as foreign exchange deposits as a share of total deposits) appears to be rising after several years of steady decline.  Given the many challenges ahead, the authorities signaled interest in Fund support—possibly under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)—to support the design and monitoring of a Yemeni strategy to reduce macroeconomic and structural imbalances. It was agreed that program discussions could move forward early in 2010.
