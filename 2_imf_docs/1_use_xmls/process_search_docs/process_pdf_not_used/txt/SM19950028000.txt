Western Samoa’s background of economic stagnation and macroeconomic vulnerability reflects continuing structural impediments to growth, notably inefficient public enterprises, a rigid land tenure structure, and an inadequate financial system. Private savings and investment have been extremely low. . Some efforts have been made in recent years to privatize or improve the financial performance of public enterprises, ease the land tenure problem, and promote the manufacturing and tourism sectors through fiscal incentives--with limited success. . Natural disasters and the financial crisis of Polynesian Airlines eroded macroeconomic performance in recent years, but policy adjustments since late 1994 have helped inflation return to the single-digit range as well as a recovery in the external position. Policy Issues . The discussions focused on the short-term policies required to maintain macroeconomic stability and broaden--where possible--the reform program in the period leading up to the 1996 elections. . The 1995/96 budget is key to this. At issue is the extent to which expenditures should rebound following their compression in 1994/95, forced by the rescue package for the airline. . The exchange rate has been managed in a flexible manner within a nominal peg system, and external competitiveness has been maintained. Staff Position . The staff saw the need for strengthening the 1995/96 budget, and recommended additional fiscal measures with a view to reducing the deficit Corn the budgeted 4 percent of GDP to no more than 2 percent and avoiding domestic financing. The authorities broadly concurred. . Stronger fiscal adjustment in 1995/96 will allow the economic recovery to be underpinned by adequate credit to the private sector, in the context of financial liberalization and a shift to indirect monetary control; and the maintenance of external competitiveness will require continued monetary control supported by caution in the proposed minimum wage adjustment. . While comprehensive structural policies will have to await the 1996 elections, immediate actions could include rationalizing liscal incentives as part of continuing tax reform and maintaining hard budget constraints for public enterprises; as well as implementing the first phase of the privatization program.

I. Background A. Economic Structure Whereas Western Samoa’s social indicators compare favorably with other Pacific island economies,’ its record of economic performance falls below the average of these economies. Thus, since the mid-1980s, Western Samoa’s output growth has stagnated, real per capita income has declined, and its vulnerability to shocks has remained high. This disappointing performance has stemmed From a number of factors central to the structure of the economy. The pattern of savings and investment has been one key factor--characterized by a high dependence on foreign resources, which has allowed domestic consumption to exceed output (Figure 1). Foreign resources have principally benefited--and helped maintain--a large public sector, in addition to the periodic financing of natural disaster-driven reconstruction (such as in 1991-93). Private investment has been very low and domestic private savings persistently negative.’ At the same time, economic development has been hindered by a number of Fiire 1.

The team met with the Prime Minister, the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture, the Financial Secretary, the Governor of the Central Bank of Samoa, and other senior officials. *As reflected in the basic social indicators, especially for health and education (Annex VI), ‘There are no national income accounts; savings-investment gaps estimated by the staff are indicative.

In addition, the unfavorable investment environment created by these factors has encouraged emigration of skilled labor which, while contributing to foreign exchange inflows on which the Western Samoan economy has been greatly dependent, has generated labor shortages domestically. Consequently, Western Samoa’s vulnerability to domestic and external shocks (Box 1) has been high. Progress in addressing these structural problems has been slow and sporadic. There have been efforts to sell or lease publicly owned land, and fiscal incentives were introduced to promote the manufacturing and tourism sectors. However, the impact of these measures on private investment has been limited to a few large projects. Under the structural reform programs supported by the Asian Development Bank in the late 1980s agricultural marketing boards were abolished and several enterprises privatized, including in the forestry and banking sectors. However, these programs were interrupted by two severe cyclones in 1990-91, which extensively damaged the agricultural sector and infrastructure and shifted the authorities’ attention toward reconstruction activities. Agricultural rehabilitation--focused on increasing copra yields and diversification into livestock--has yet to gain momentum. B. Macroeconomic Performance in 1994-95 The 1994 Article IV consultation with Western Samoa’ was held against a background of a weakening external position and accommodative financial policies in response to a series of natural disasters. Directors focused on the vulnerability of the external position and the need, in particular, for prudent fiscal management. They encouraged expenditure cuts and monetary restraint. Directors underscored the importance to macroeconomic stability of financial liberalization and more effective monetary management (including legislation that would enable control over nonbank financial institutions). They also reviewed the agenda for accelerating growth and urged further efforts toward structural reforms, emphasizing the need to energize the privatization program and make more efficient use of land. Macroeconomic performance in 1994-95 marks another period of volatility stemming, in part, from natural shocks and the need to address the financial crisis of Polynesian Airlines ‘These issues have also been discussed in Christopher Browne, Economic Development in Seven Pacific IslandCountries (Washington: International Monetary Fund, 1989) and Christopher Browne, Pac$c Island IMFMember Countries: Recent Economic Developments and Medium-Term Prospects (Washington: International Monetary Fund, 1995). ‘October 19, 1994 (SM/94/227, 8/23/94; and Supplement 1, I O/17/94) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3- Box 1.

However, praxsing activitia for car parts have come on stream, and tourism has expanded. . Ihe direction of cxuorts has also been very narrow. Two thirds of Western Samoa’s exports arc to Australia and New Zealand-among the highest concentration of the Pacific island counbics--and this concentration has incrcascd in the past decade . lmvortancc of trade taxcs Until 1993, over 40 percent of domcstic revenue in Western Samoa had stemmed from trade taxes; however, the replacement of import t&T‘s by the value-added and general sales tax in 1994 has reduced this proportion to about 2S percent, thereby reducing the anti-cxpai bias and volatility in budgetary revenue.

Real output contracted by almost 8 percent in 1994, owing to a taro leafblight and a slowdown in construction activity, but is estimated to rebound by a similar amount in 1995, attributable to the recovery of agro-business and a strengthening of tourism (Table 1 and Chart 1). After peaking at 18 l/2 percent in 1994, inflation fell to 5 petcent by August 1995, reflecting a recovery in food supplies and the tightening of monetary conditions (see below). The balance of payments haa, similarly, returned to a more comfortable position, with the adjustment occurring primarily through import compression, although remittances and transfers have remained strong. Merchandise imports and associated service payments fell sharply in 1994, reflecting the completion of rehabilitation and large construction projects, and have since remained low (Table 2 and Chart 2). Commodity exports in 1995 have recovered from an especially low base and poor performance in 1994, and service receipts from tourism and export processing activities6 contributed also to the turnaround. Consequently, the current account (including grants) has shifted from large deficits during 1991-93 to small surpluses. Declines in project financing, together with large repayments of Polynesian Airlines’ debt, led to overall balance of payments deficits--and reserve losses--during 1994 and early 1995, but a small overall surplus is projected for 1995. As of end-July 1995, international reserves stood at about USS49 million (equivalent to five months of imports of goods and services). Outstanding external public debt has risen significantly, reflecting the airline’s remaining debt, to about USS178 million (119 percent of GDP) by end-1995; the debt-service ratio rose sharply in 1994 and is estimated to remain at a relatively high level of 18 percent in 1995. The tala (pegged to a basket of currencies) has been adjusted periodically in order to maintain Western Samoa’s competitiveness. While the authorities have not adhered strictly to a real rate rule, the movement in the real effective exchange rate has been an important consideration in the adjustments. Since end-1990, the nominal effective rate has depreciated steadily by a cumulative 12 percent, while the real effective rate has fluctuated considerably and appreciated by 3 percent (Chart 3). Jn mid-1995, the basket to which the tala is pegged was modified to include the Fiji dollar, in line with recent changes in trade and payments patterns. The improved external current account reflected both a tightening of the underlying government finances (excluding support for Polynesian Airlines) and an adjustment on the part of the private sector. Fiscal tightening in 1994/95 was forced by the rescue package for the airline, which required the Government to assume its liabilities equivalent to about 6Refers to an automotive wire-harnessing factory, for which only the value added in foreign exchange is shown in the balance of payments.

Monetary policy and, with it, the private sector also shared significantly in the domestic adjustment. A restrictive private credit program was adopted in 1994 (based on bank-wise credit ceilings), limiting average monthly lending to the private sector within the outstanding level at end-1993.’ Although banks’ excess reserves remained large, and administered interest rates unchanged,9 actual lending contracted, reflecting banks’ cautious behavior in reaction to substantial penalties for ceiling infractions (Table 4 and Chart 5). Following the completion of several private construction projects, credit by nonbanks decelerated compared with the previous few years, but continued to account for more than 60 percent oftotal financial system credit to the private sector (Table 5). Thus, broad money growth in 1994, at 13 percent, reflected principally the financing need of the Government. With a view to supporting the incipient recovery of output and exports, the quantitative limits on bank credit to the private sector were relaxed in April 1995, allowing 10 percent average growth for the year. II. Report on the Discussions A. Near-Term Policy Stance A key focus of the discussions was the near-term policy stance that would best assure consolidation of the recent stabiliition gains. The mission endorsed the authorities’ objectives of keeping inflation in the 3-4 percent range and sustaining the positive growth momentum, while trying to re-energize structural reforms that would boost growth potential over the medium term ‘Polynesian Airlines’ external liabilities assumed by the Government in August 1994 is estimated at WS$SO million, excluding debt expected to be forgiven. More than half was settled in 1994/95; the remainder is expected to be repaid by 2001/2002. These payments by the Government are included in net lending in the fiscal accounts. *Previously, a deposit-linked credit expansion formula had been in effect ‘Since August 1992, the maximum lending rate has been set at 12 percent per annum and the minimum deposit rate between 3 percent and 7 112 percent per annum, depending on maturities. With the recent decline in inflation, most deposit and all lending rates have become positive in real terms.

Export diversification and growth were a task for the medium term, and requirements for imports of machinery and intermediate goods to support this goal could imply a greater trade imbalance in 1996. However, the authorities were confident that the expected rebound in imports could be more than offset by official transfers. Consequently, they have formulated near-term financial policy within the framework of an improved overall external surplus that would maintain gross international reserves at a relatively comfortable level, close to six months of imports of goods and services. 1. Budget for 1995496 The authorities agreed that fiscal adjustment was key to the realization of the macroeconomic objectives, and saw this being facilitated by the improved debt profile of Polynesian Airlines, the continued economic recovery, and sizable loan repayments by public enterprises. At the same time, they drew attention to the sharp--and unsustainable-- expenditure compression of the previous year, and the need to restore and to increase outlays for key infrastructure and social services in 1995/96. Thus, the budget makes provision for a considerable rebound in total expenditure, principally development spending (to 33 percent of GDP), focused on the tree crop and tourism sectors, education, and rural infrastructure; priority has been given to grant-financed projects. Current expenditures are to be restrained: no general wage increase is budgeted, and only allocations for land surveys, health care, senior citizen pensions, and computerization to strengthen the budget system are being raised. On this basis, and with an estimated fall in the tax ratio, the 1995/96 budget envisages a deficit of less than 4 percent of GDP, of which about half is to be financed domestically (Table 3). While acknowledging the need for additional expenditure support in key sectors, the staff team saw room for a more ambitious fiscal stance that would better nurture the emerging private sector recovery. Abstracting Tom the turnaround in budgetary net lending associated with the debt-service payments on behalf of Polynesian Airlines, the l995/96 budget stimulus is equivalent to 4 percent of GDP. Thus, the staff team recommended that policies aim at maintaining the tax revenue to GDP ratio at about the 30 percent level of 1994/95; this looked within reach with strengthened tax administration, especially of the value-added and general sales tax, although there could well be a need for tax policy measures. This would allow the budget deficit to be contained to no more than 2 percent of GDP in 1995/96. The authorities agreed to work toward this end. Risks to the budget--with implications for inflation and the external position--were discussed: pressures for additional spending ahead of the March 1996 elections could mount; the budgeted repayments by public enterprises might not materialize in full; and a substantial carryforward into 1995/96 of expenditures incurred in 1994/95 was likely to strain budgetary control. Accordingly, the staff team recommended that supplementary expenditures be firmly resisted; advances to public enterprises be strictly avoided; and unbudgeted privatization receipts, if realized, be set aside as reserves, The authorities affirmed that there would be no Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- supplementary budget this year, and that revenues from asset sales were not planned to be spent, They noted that, excluding past liabilities, the airline was operating at a profit, and that the performance of public utilities was to be closely monitored. 2. Monetary policy The authorities agreed with the staff team that restrictive monetary policy in the recent past had both crowded out the private sector and required excessive reliance on quantitative controls--hence delaying the shift to more market-oriented monetary management. With the more ambitious budget stance outlined above, the credit program for 1995--allowing a 10 percent average growth in bank lending to the private sector--would permit an expansion in private activity while maintaining overall monetary growth at about I4 percent.‘O This level of broad money expansion would adequately safeguard foreign exchange reserves and contain inflation in the targeted low single-digit range. Financial liberalization and a market-oriented approach to monetary control have been on the authorities’ agenda for some time and are now set to move forward.” By year-end, auctions for Central Bank securities are scheduled to be introduced, followed by the decontrol of interest rates, the elimination of direct credit ceilings, and a simplification of statutory reserve requirements and liquid asset ratios. The staffteam emphasized that, to achieve the intended purpose of absorbing present levels of excess liquidity, auctions needed to be Iidly representative of market interest rates, which were higher than the current yields of Central Bank securities. The mission raised the issue of an immediate increase in the lending rate ceiling as an interim measure to absorb the overhang of unsatisfied credit demand prior to the introduction of a more market-determined system. The authorities responded that, in order not to send the markets confusing signals as to the overall stance of monetary policy, they would prefer to introduce all liberalization measures at once. They expected competition among banks to increase once the third bank, which recently obtained a provisional license, was established. Another issue for monetary control has been the credit expansion by nonbank financial institutions. The Financial Institutions Bill (which would bring unspecialized nonbank financial institutions under the Central Bank’s supervision) is set to be submitted to Parliament by end-1995. The staff team viewed the exclusion of the National Provident Fund (NPF) from the proposed bill as inappropriate, so long as the NPF was engaged in direct consumer lending, and suggested that the NPF return to its intended role as a pension fund. While agreeing in principle, the authorities noted that, in practice, reliance on moral suasion with respect to the NPF’s credit expansion would continue for the time being. ‘hollowing four years when the real money stock declined, money demand has now strengthened, and the projections assume that velocity will fall fbrther in 1995. “Consistent with staff recommendations in the context of technical assistance, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 18- B. Medium-Term Prospects 1. External outlook The authorities and the staffteam agreed that the main challenge for the medium term would be to accelerate growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. In the context of Western Samoa’s economy this involves comprehensive reform across a wide spectrum, to address the long-standing obstacles to growth. The baseline scenario discussed with the authorities is one of sustained growth in the 3-4 percent range over the medium term, with inflation remaining in the low single digits (Table 6). Although export diversification and growth--into new agricultural products (such as fresh flowers, fruits, and vegetables) as well as small manufactures (especially agro-based industries)--would be a key focus of medium-term policies, the initial import requirements imply a rising trade deficit. Nevertheless, a gradually strengthening services sector (based on strong tourism receipts and t%rther development of export-processing activities), as well as the continued buoyancy of remittances and transfers, would result in small external surpluses that would maintain reserves at about the current level of about six months of imports of goods and services. The staff team pointed to the vulnerability of the external outlook to changes in external financing, especially with respect to private transfers, but the authorities were confident that the ongoing structural reforms would strengthen growth potential and serve to reduce vulnerability over time. In particular, they also believed that their continuing promotion of the export of Western Samoan labor would maintain workers’ remittances. They acknowledged, however, that over a longer period--and with the improvement in the investment climate in prospect--emigration could slow, and policy would eventually have to cope with reduced remittances. Maintaining competitiveness was also key to the external outlook. The authorities reiterated their intention to maintain the present exchange rate arrangement, whereby--within the system of a peg of the tala to a basket of currencies--some flexibility to respond to shocks was permitted through periodic small adjustments. During the past few years, a number of adjustments in the peg have led to a depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate and a broadly stable real effective rate. The staffteam agreed with the authorities that the primary task of maintaining a competitive economy in the period immediately ahead would fall on restrained financial and wage policies, supported by the successful implementation of structural reforms that would crowd in the private sector. In this context, the staffteam was concerned about certain proposals within the Government for raising the minimum wage in private establishments by 50 percent and the resulting impact on the entire wage structure and on Western Samoa’s overall competitiveness. A smaller adjustment, up to 25 percent, would be more appropriate, as it would avoid upsetting the balance with government wages. However, the authorities believed that the adjustment would serve to bring the statutory Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 - Thk 6. weacm smKu: MC&m-Term scmuim, ,99c*Mo Pmj. hj.

Given that Western Samoa’s export commodities currently face zero or small tariffs, exports are unlikely to be directly affected by the recent Uruguay Round agreement. However, there may be indirect effects requiring strengthened adjustment on the part of Western Samoa to the more open global trade environment that is in prospect. The authorities’ planned reduction of tariff protection over the next two years (Corn the current rate of 35 percent on most items) would be an essential part of the adjustment, supported by continuing and broader structural reforms. 2. Fiscal adjustment The baseline medium-term outlook is predicated on strong fiscal adjustment making progressively greater room for private activity. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal program envisages a restructuring of both revenues and expenditures, aiming for overall fiscal surplus by 1998. On the revenue side, within the next two years, corporate income taxes are to be lowered tInther, and the excise and import tariff structures are to be rationalized and reduced on average. On the expenditure side, performance budgeting and institution strengthening systems introduced this year will be extended to all departments in 1996/97 as a first step toward a comprehensive public sector reform over the next five years, A more rational tax system is warranted and, in view of the relatively high tax ratio, there is scope for some reductions in its rates. The staffteam noted the distortionary effects of the prevailing system of discretionary tax exemptions, and expressed the view that private investors would generally be more attracted by a stable investment environment, including transparent and consistent regulatory and incentive regimes, than by tax advantages. The authorities acknowledged that a rationalization of the tax incentive scheme would need to be an integral part of the tax reform, The staff team expressed concern that a systematic plan was still lacking for lowering expenditures to match the proposed tax cuts and to support the goal of budgetary surpluses. The authorities agreed that substantial scope existed for improving the medium-term fiscal position by trimming the size of government employment (accounting for more than one fourth of formal employment and half of total current expenditures), including through more 12The statutory minimum wage for the private sector is currently WS$l.OO per hour, and is not binding in most establishments, the minimum pay for public employees is WS$I .I0 per hour.

The staffteam proposed that government spending should also be curtailed through cuts in transfers to public utilities, supported by raising tariff charges as necessary. The authorities confirmed the intention to privatize enterprises engaged in commercial activities within the next few years, and secure self sufficiency for the remainder. The importance of a strong fiscal adjustment program for Western Samoa’s external viability is demonstrated in an alternative medium-term scenario prepared by the staff team (Table 6). The scenario assumes incomplete fiscal adjustment: while the tax cuts are carried out as planned, offsetting reductions in current expenditures are inadequate. Consequently, the fiscal balance would remain in deficit throughout the projection period, forcing the Government to continue drawing down its bank deposits. In order to sustain private sector activity broadly at the same level as in the baseline scenario, monetary expansion would become necessary. Such policies are likely to result in higher imports, a deterioration in the external current account, and a decline in international reserves to a less-than-desirable level-- equivalent to four months of import cover by the year 2000. 3. structural rf!forms Creation of a dynamic private sector is the goal of structural reforms. Over time, their pace has been influenced inter aha by the need to be sensitive to social traditions and, in the period ahead, are unlikely to gain significant momentum until after the 1996 elections. Discussions focused on three key areas. A strategic privatization plan has been formulated for divesting, over the next ten years, the majority of government shares in public enterprises (Annex I). The first phase--over the next IS months--involves the sale of selected commercial enterprises, for which separate agreements on two cases have already been reached; the authorities look to this phase to bring in foreign exchange and technical know-how. The second phase calls for the establishment of a unit trust to invest in remaining government holdings, aimed at tapping small Western Samoan investors, domestic and abroad, in parallel with efforts to develop a capital market. The third phase involves the sale of public utilities and transportation services. The staff team encouraged some key steps to be implemented in the coming months, and possible acceleration of the subsequent phases following the 1996 elections; the staff team also pointed to the importance of increasing enterprises’ net worth prior to their sales through improved tinancial performance. The land tenure system continues to limit productive land use. Customary land ownership (communal-based, applicable to 80 percent of total land) has slowed the development of tourist resorts and commercial agriculture and restricted use of land as collateral for obtaining credit. Efforts have been made to introduce some flexibility into the system, such as selected sales or leases of publicly owned land, the right of leaseholders to continued use of land when customary ownership changes hands, and subleases by the Government. The staff team encouraged expeditious implementation of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - these measures and, while cognizant of social and cultural limitations, suggested that other options also be explored that would further alleviate this problem--including the recommendation by the Committee to Review the Alienation of Customary Land Act to permit any Western Samoan (instead of only village chiefs) to lease land. These are under consideration. The price control system covers a large number of consumer products and is intended to provide consumer protection in view of the relatively few importers. The staff team argued that the system not only tended to reduce supply and restrict competition, but was also costly to administer. It recommended that these controls be removed. The authorities, however, maintained that the controls were enforced in a flexible manner and designed only to prevent excessive profiteering. C. Statistical Issues Available statistics are provided to the Fund on a regular basis and are published by the Central Bank (Annex V). Monetary and balance of payments accounts are up-to-date and of reasonable quality; and a number of improvements in the compilation of fiscal and real sector statistics have been made in recent years. Technical assistance is being provided to Western Samoa--through both headquarters and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre--to compile national income accounts and strengthen balance of payments and government finance statistics. The mission also encouraged an update of the CPI basket; the current index is based on a 197677 expenditure survey, III. Staff Appraisal Western Samoa’s economy is recovering from several years of weak macroeconomic performance, brought about in part by a succession of natural disasters and the financial crisis of Polynesian Airlines. The authorities are to be commended for steering the economy through these difficulties and returning it to a more comfortable situation characterized by positive growth, low single-digit inflation, and adequate international reserves. The recent stabilization was achieved through considerable expenditure compression as well as monetary restraint. Much of this adjustment was forced, and some of it is already proving unsustainable. Thus, government spending is set to rebound in the 1995/96 budget and private sector credit limits have been relaxed. Domestic demand will need to be carefully managed in the coming year for the stabilization gain to be sustained-- indeed, consolidated--and a more robust foundation of macroeconomic stability created for medium-term growth. This will undoubtedly be a challenge ahead of the March 1996 elections. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23- Most important is the 1995/96 fiscal stance. The budgeted deficit, at 4 percent of GDP, will likely place an excessive burden on domestic financing, one that will risk jeopardizmg the macroeconomic balance. The staff recommends that this be avoided through efforts to raise tax revenue, with a view to containing the fiscal deficit within 2 percent of GDP. There is room for this, in both tax policy and, especially, in tax administration. At the same time, it will be imperative to resist pressures for supplementary expenditures and to set aside any privatixation receipts as reserves. The staff is greatly encouraged by the authorities’ assurances in these areas, which will be supported by the ongoing strengthening of budgetary management and the intended move to accrual-based fiscal accounting. The fiscal stance recommended by the staff would allow a reasonable expansion in private sector credit and limit monetary growth to within 14 percent in 1995 and 11 percent in 1996-consistent with inflation remaining in the 3-4 percent range. Fiscal control and macroeconomic stability are also necessary conditions for the liberalixation of the financial system. The staff supports the planned replacement of quantitative credit and direct interest controls by more market-oriented instruments--namely, the start of auctions of Central Bank securities--by end-1995, and recommends early implementation of institutional reforms, including the necessary adaptation of the analytical framework for monetary targeting and of the regulatory regime. In this context, it will be important that the Financial Institutions Bill extend regulatory oversight equally over the nonbank financial institutions, as an essential part of overall credit control and monetary management. Restructuring the still large public enterprise sector will be another challenge for the authorities, as much for the near-term policy objectives as for medium-term growth. The authorities’ decisive action to restructure the management of Polynesian Airlines and reschedule its liabilities is commendable, but the rescue package has left a considerable-- and unfortunate--budget burden over the medium term. To avoid adding to this burden, a number of initiatives will be required. In particular, it will be important that the fmancial performance of public utilities be improved, if necessary through higher charges, so as to avoid the need for continued government subsidies. Privatixation also needs to move ahead; the staff supports the present phased approach to privatize public enterprises and recommends significant progress be made even in the coming year. The medium-term outlook is difficult, and the authorities need to focus on policies to raise domestic savings and address the constraints that have long shackled growth. In this context, the staff endorses the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives to attain budgetary surpluses and reconstitute cash reserves that would help provide a cushion against contingencies,. and make room for private sector growth. However, the planned tax reform should incorporate the rationalization of discretionary tax exemptions, and it should be matched by specific policies to reduce. the size of the Government and cut subsidies to public enterprises. The programmed financial liberalixation will be key to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - fostering private savings. There are a number of other actions necessary to strengthen growth performance over the coming years; among these, the staff places particular emphasis on measures to ensure more efficient use of land and the removal of price controls. Although the present exchange rate arrangement has served Western Samoa well, and helped maintain external competitiveness in the face of several recent supply shocks, the staff nonetheless cautions against relying too closely--in practice--on a real rate rule in the management of the exchange rate. In the near term, the staff is concerned about the possible impact on competitiveness of proposals to raise the minimum wage and recommends that a more restrained increase be implemented. Over the medium term, it will be only through the determined implementation of structural reforms that broad-based productivity improvements can be secured and competitiveness sustained. Western Samoa’s economic statistics are. accessible to the Fund and the public. While significant progress has been made, further efforts are necessary to improve the coverage and quality of data that would facilitate sound policy decisions including, as a priority, the compilation of the national income accounts. It is recommended that Western Samoa remain on the standard 12-month cycle.

Since independence, the public enterprise sector has played an important role in the economic development of Western Samoa and the provision of formal employment in both urban and rural areas. By the mid-1980s, its activities had expanded into tree crop plantations, manufacturing, construction, public utilities, transportation, marketing and distribution, and other services. The largest enterprises were the Cocoa and Copra Marketing Boards, the Electric Power Corporation, the Western Samoa Trust Estate Corporation (WSTEC), and the Special Project Development Corporation (SPDC, a construction company). However, reflecting inefficient operations, the enterprises as a group experienced losses which were financed by bank overdrafts, government advances and, at times, payments lIlTearS. The policy to rational&e and privatize selected government departments and public enterprises was first adopted in 1985. Significant progress was made between 1987-91. During 1987-89, with technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), the Government sold some assets of the SPDC, closed down a few loss-making small enterprises, and contracted out the transport pool of the Public Works Department. In 1990, the Government embarked on a structural adjustment program with financial and technical support from the AsDB, under which the State-Owned Enterprises Monitoring Unit (SOEMU) was established in the Treasury Department to monitor public enterprises’ performance and formulate recommendations regarding their future disposal. In 1990-91, the Cocoa, the Copra, as well as the Produce Marketing Boards were dismantled; the Samoa Land Corporation (SLC) was established to take over most of the land owned by WSTBC, for leases or sales to the private sector; half of the 50 percent holding of the Government in the Bank of Western Samoa (BWS) was sold; and a few small enterprises were either sold, leased to the private sector, or liquidated. Privatization efforts came to a slowdown during the cyclone rehabilitation years (1991-93); the lack of private capital was also a contributing factor. During this period, three enterprises were leased on a long-term basis; and the Water Authority became separated from the Government. Altogether, about 20 enterprises have been disposed of since 1987, raising approximately WSIEl4 million in revenue and eliminating close to WS$S million (1% percent of GDP) in annual budgetary subsidies. At end-1994, 3 1 public enterprises remained wholly or partly owned by the Government, employing more than 2,200 persons.’ Available ‘See further details in forthcoming Western Samoa--Statistical Appendix.

In 1994, reflecting the Government’s renewed commitment to the privatization program, the SOEMU prepared a lo-year strategic plan, which aims at an eventual divestiture of the majority of Government shares in public enterprises. The plan will be implemented in three phases. The main objective of Phase 1 (12- 18 months) is to generate sufficient revenue and foreign exchange; it involves sales of 11 enterprises, mostly in the manufacturing sector, and about three-fourths of land owned by the SLC. In late 1995, agreements were reached to sell the remaining Government’s shares in the BWS to a foreign bank, and to sell the Post Office Savings Bank to local investors. Phase 2 (18-36 months) focuses on the development of a capital market. A unit trust is to be established as an equity investor in profitable enterprises; its shares will be sold to small domestic and offshore investors, including Western Samoans overseas. Seven enterprises have been chosen to be initially placed in the unit trust, including a 30 percent equity of Polynesian Airlines, It is planned that by the end of Phase 2, the Government will have divested all shares or reduced its equity position to a minority status in all commercial activities. Phase 3 (3-10 years) aims at raising timds for infrastructural development; it targets the privatization of the natural monopolies, namely, water, power, and telecommunications enterprises both through the unit trust and directly to foreign investors, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the PublicI.

Since then, 25 loans totaling USS89.9 million for 22 projects and technical assistance totaling US$9.4 million for 49 projects have been provided. The AsDB has been the largest source of loans to the country and about half of Western Samoa’s outstanding public external debt is accounted for by AsDB loans. The AsDB’s operational strategy study supplements the overall thrust of the Government’s development &airs. This includes policy actions in the agricultural and agro- industrial sectors, reform and privatization of public enterprises, and the strengthening of institutional capabilities and manpower training. During 1993, the AsDB approved one loan of US%2 as additional &ding for the tililo hydroelectric project. No loan projects were processed for approval in 1994-95. The AsDB approved four technical assistance (TA) grants of USS775,OOO in 1994 and one TA grant of US%SO,OOO in April 1995 for assessment of the effectiveness of Bank assistance in capacity building. Four more TA grants for 1995 have been scheduled.

However, Western Samoa’s economic database remains deficient, primarily reflecting staffing constraints. Statistics on money and banking and balance of payments are current and reported regularly to the Fund through Central Bank of Samoa’s publications; however, no information on national accounts is available, the price index needs updating, and government finance statistics are not reported on a regular basis. 1. National Accounts and Prices There are no official national accounts statistics; data reported in Board documents are estimated by the staff, based on sectoral indicators. A plan is under way to review and expand the index of industrial production (compiled by the Central Bank) to reflect changes in the production structure. A similar update of the agricultural index should also be carried out. Technical assistance from the Fund to compile national accounts statistics has begun; progress to date has been limited to the preparation of a business survey. Monthly data on the overall CPI, as well as five sub-indices, are regularly reported by the Central Bank’s Department of Statistics; the weights, based on a 1976-77 household expenditure survey, need updating. No wholesale price index is currently available. 2. Government Finance The government accounts provide comprehensive information on central government revenues and expenditures; however, they are in a nonstandard format and on a cash basis, making analysis difficult. The Treasury has moved closer to the standard presentation, and a shiA to an accrual-based accounting system is envisaged over the next few years. There is no published information on actual expenditures, which are audited with a significant lag; efforts are being made to remedy the situation. No data on government finance statistics have been reported to STA since 1985; there is no country page for Western Samoa in the Government Fjnunce Sfutistic; and technical assistance in this area is planned for FY 1996. 3. Money and Banking Comprehensive quarterly data on the monetary sector are provided in the Cenfrul Bank ofsumou Bulletin. More current, albeit limited, information is available in the Central Bank’s monthly Monetuty Survey Report. However, data on nonbank financial institutions, the dominant source of private sector credit, are reported with a long lag. 4. Balance of Payments Statistics on the balance of payments, composition of exports and imports, and external public debt are comprehensive and regularly reported to the Fund. A strengthening of the balance of payments accounts through the refinement of various components, especially in the capital account, would be desirable. The PFTAC is providing technical assistance toward this end.
