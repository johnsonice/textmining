INTRODUCTION 1. A staff team comprising Mrs. Ter-Minassian (Head), Messrs. Schwartz, Ramos, and Paiva (all WI-ID), de Mello (FAD), Rossi (PDR), and Mrs. Karkas (Assistant, WHD) visited Brazil from July 19 to August 4,200O to conduct the 2000 Article IV consultation discussions and discussions on the Sixth Review Under the Three-Year Stand-By Arrangement that was approved by the Executive Board on December 2, 1998 for the equivalent of SDR 13,024.S million. Mr. Loser joined the mission on July 3 l-August 1. The Fund Senior Resident Representative in Brazil, Mr. Perez, assisted the mission. The mission met with the Chief of Staff of the President, the Ministers of Finance; Budget and Planning; Social Security; Development and Industry; and Energy; the Board of the Central Bank of Brazil; and officials in these and other institutions, as well as representatives of the private sector. Mr. Portugal, Executive Director for Brazil, attended most of the meetings. Subsequent to the delayed release in October 2000 of the national income accounts for 1999 (which was originally expected for August 2000), follow-up contacts with the authorities were required to revise the program targets for the remainder of 2000. 3 I. The First and Second Reviews under the Stand-By Arrangement were completed by the Board on March 30,1999; the Third Review on July 28,1999; the Fourth Review on November 29, 1999; and the Fifth Review on May 3 1,200O. The applicable performance criteria and indicative targets for March, June, and September 2000 were met, with two exceptions: the net debt of the consolidated public sector slightly exceeded its indicative ceiling for September 2000; and the 12-month rate of consumer price inflation in September 2000 exceeded the limit requiring consultations with staff. The indicative target on net international reserves for end-October 2000 was also met. Most of the reforms covered by the structural benchmarks have been carried out, although in some cases with a delay (Table 1). 3. Brazil’s gross purchases under the program to date amount to the equivalent of SDR 7,869.15 million (259.2 percent of quota), of which the equivalent of SDR 6,512.4 million were under the Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF), and the equivalent of SDR 1,356.75 million in the credit tranches. All purchases under the SRJ! were repaid by April 12,2000, partly ahead of schedule. The total amount available for purchases over the remainder of the Stand-By Arrangement amounts to the equivalent of SDR 2,550.69 million (Table 2), but in April 2000 the authorities indicated their intention to treat the arrangement as precautionary henceforth. 4. Brazil has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2a, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The 1999 Article IV consultation was concluded on July 28, 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-7- 5. At that time, Executive Directors welcomed -the better-than-projected performance of the economy following the completion of the first and second reviews under the Stand-By Arrangement in March 1999, and considered that the authorities’ demonstrated commitment to the program supported under the arrangement-along with the strong official international support and the constructive voluntary involvement of the private sector-had been instrumental in securing a quick rebuilding of confidence, after the floating of the real, correcting the initial overshoot of the exchange rate, and facilitating an early recovery of activity with relatively low inflation. Directors urged the authorities to sustain the fiscal adjustment effort, including through adequate progress in pending structural reforms of the public finances, and to maintain a prudent stance of monetary policy within the newly established inflation targeting framework. They also welcomed the substantial improvement in competitiveness, which would facilitate a progressive strengthening of the external accounts over the short to medium term. II. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSAND SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS' A. The Domestic Economy 6. The economy continues to recover at a sustained pace. Real GDP grew at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 4.8 percent in the first half of 2000, compared with the second half of 1999, and by 3 -6 percent with respect to the first half of 1999 (Table 3 and Figure 1). On the supply side, the recovery was led by the industrial sector, where production rose by 7.3 percent in January-August 2000, compared with the same period of 1999 (Figure 2). The increase was especially marked in the consumer durables (21.8 percent) and capital goods (8.7 percent) industries. Although the continuing lack of quarterly national accounts on the demand side2 prevents a detailed analysis of recent developments in aggregate demand, available indicators point to a marked rebound in the consumption of durables (especially automobiles) from the low levels reached in 1999, and to a more moderate recovery of consumption of nondurables and investment, with continuing substitution of domestic production for imports in both sectors. ’ This section focuses on developments to date in 2000, and on prospects for the rest of the year. Developments in the second half of 1999 were covered in the staff report for the Fifth Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement (EBS/00/82) of May 3,200O and are summarized in Appendix I. Box 1 discusses the implications of the preliminary national accounts for 1999 recently published by the National Institute of Statistics (IBGE). ’ IBGE is working on quarterly national accounts on the demand side, which are expected to begin to be published in 2001.

The National Accounts for 1999 In early October this year, the National institute of Statistics (IBGE) released the conntry’s preliminary national income accounts for 1999, and the revised national income accounts for 1997-98.’ ‘The release entailed various updates compared to the preliminary data for 1997-98, and the unofficial previous working assumptions for 1999, which are summarized below. Brazil: Gross Domestic Product, 1997-99 I997 1998 Previous I/ Revised Previous I/ Revised 1999 Previous 2/ Revised Nominal GDP (RF billion) 864.

I 0.2 I.1 0.8 8.3 4.2 47 Il.4 4.3 I/ According to the national income accounts yearbook for I998 that w+s released in mid-1 999. 21 Working assumption on the basis of the gencml price index (IGP-DI) and quarterly real growth rates. While the revisions for 1997-98 are relatively small, those for 1999 are substantial compared to the working assumptions that had been used earlier this year. In particular, the real growth rate for 1999 was revised slightly downward-from 1 percent to 0.8 percent-but, more importantly, the implicit GDP deflator rose by much less than general price index (domestic supply) (IGP-DI) that had traditionally been used by the Central Bank of Brazil as a proxy for estimating the nominal GDP in the period prior to the official release of the annual data by the IBGE. The large difference between the actual GDP deflator for 1999 and the IGP-DI based proxy reflected the large depreciation of the exchange rate in 1999 and the substantial deterioration in Brazil’s terms of trade. These two factors, leading to increases in import and export prices of 50 percent and 30 percent, respectively, resulted in a GDP deflator substantially below the proxy based on the IGP-DI. As a result of these revisions, nominal GDP for 1999 is now some 5 percent lower than previously assumed, and the various ratios to GDP that had been reported in previous staff documents’ have changed as well. For example, while nominal values have remained unchanged, the 1999 primary surplus of the consolidated public sector is now higher relative to GDP (3.24 percent compared to previously 3.10 percent), and the ratio of net debt to GDP (evaluated at end-December 1999 prices) is also higher relative to GDP (49.7 percent compared to previously 47.0 percent). Similarly, the 1999 current account deficit is now higher relative to GDP (4.7 percent compared to previously 4.4 percent), and so is the outstanding total external debt at year-end (45.6 percent of GDP compared to the previously estimated 43.3 percent of GDP). Moreover, the lower nominal GDP base for 1999 has also resulted in a reduction of the projected nominal GDP for subsequent years, and in increases of the ratios of the above variables to GDP in those years. However, these changes, while significant, do not affect the qualitative results of the various dynamic simulation exercises, nor do they change the basic thrust of macroeconomic and. in particular, fiscal policies. ’ At the same time, and for the first time ever, the IBGE released quarterly nominal GDP data, with a series that currently ranges from the first quarter of 1990 through the second quarter of 2000; previously the IBGE had only released quarterly real GDP growth rates. * See, in particular, EBD/00/82 of May 3,200O and earlier staff reports.

For 2000 as a whole, GDP growth is expected to average 4 percent, with positive growth in all components of demand. Investment is likely to increase its share in GDP, supported by a significant rise in national savings, especially of the public sector (see Basic Data table). 8. The recovery of economic activity has been reflected in a strong growth of employment (4.4 percent on average during January-September 2000 compared to the same period of 1999). At the same time, however, labor participation rates have risen sharply, as prospects of finding jobs improved. Still, the rate of unemployment (seven-day measurement period) fell moderately from 7.4 percent of the labor force in September 1999, to 6.7 percent in September 2000 (Figure 3 and Box 2). Average real wages declined by about 1.4 percent in the first eight months of 2000, compared with the same period of 1999, albeit with significant variations across sectors. For the year as a whole, real wage rates are likely to show only a slight increase. 9. Inflation has remained subdued, notwithstanding a temporary acceleration in July and August, reflecting the combined impact of a spate of adjustments of administered prices (notably electricity and transport tariffs, and domestic oil prices)3 and of adverse weather conditions which damaged seasonal crops in mid-year in a number of states. Consumer prices (as measured by the national IPCA index) rose by a cumulative 4.9 percent in the first three quarters of 2000. On a 12-month basis, the rate of IPCA inflation declined from 8.9 percent in December 1999 to 7.8 percent by September 2000. The general price index (IGP-DI, a composite of consumer, wholesale and construction prices, which gives a higher weight to the prices of tradable goods) increased by 8.1 percent in the year through September 2000, and by 14.4 percent over the 12 months to September 2000, suggesting a continued increase in the relative prices of tradable goods, albeit at a significantly more moderate pace than in 1999 (Figure 4). 10. The consultation mechanism envisaged in the program (see attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding) was activated in September 2000, when the 12-month rate of consumer price inflation (IPCA) reached 7.7 percent, thereby temporarily exceeding the 7.5 percent threshold requiring consultations with the Fund staff (see Figure 4 and Section III below). Against the background of a continuing firm stance of monetary policy, inflation is expected to revert to a moderate pace in the fourth quarter of the year, facilitating a decline in the 12-month rate of increase in consumer prices to around 6?&6% percent 3 The (still regulated) ex-refinery prices of fuel products were raised in March and July 2000 by the following percentages: 7 percent and 15 percent, respectively, for gasoline and diesel oil; 18 percent for GPL (in July only); and 23 percent and 34.5 percent for aviation fuel; the prices of nafta and fuel oil have been liberalized. The total weight of utilities and fuel products prices in the consumer price index (IPCA) is about 13 percent.

Labor Market Developments and Reforms Recent developments The steady recovery of economic activity has helped to improve labor market: from September 1999 to September 2000, the unemployment rate declined by 0.7 percentage points to 6.7 percent; the average job-search time fell by 3 weeks to 20’/2 weeks; and employment grew across all metropolitan regions and in all sectors of the economy, increasing in total by 5.1 percent. Employment growth has been strongest in the informal sector (11 percent, compared to 2 percent for official work contracts). Employment in the manufacturing sector, which had been declining since 1995, also grew strongly, reflecting both import substitution and the recent dynamism of manufacturing exports. Improved employment prospects also helped long-term unemployment to decline significantly. Average real earnings in August 2000 were 1.2 percent higher than in August 1999, the third consecutive monthly increase after 18 months of negative growth of real wages. Notwithstanding rapid employment growth, the average unemployment rate in 2000 has declined only marginally--to 7% percent for the first nine months of 2000, versus 7.7 percent for the same period in 1999- reflecting a strong increase in the labor force. The participation rate in the six largest metropolitan areas in September 2000 reached 58% percent, returning to the average level observed in 1997 and surpassing the 57 percent recorded in September 1999. This increase has been geographically broad-based, with gains occurring in every metropolitan area, and stronger among women, with the participation rate rising approximately twice as fast among females than among males during the last 12 months. While better prospects for finding a job might have attracted people into the labor force, the increase in participation rates is likely to have also reflected the decline in average real earnings observed throughout 1999 and the first half of 2000, since this decline may have forced more family members to enter the labor market searching to complement falling household income. This is suggested by data showing that the participation rate among spouses increased four times faster than among heads of households until May 2000, and that in the last four months the fluctuations in the labor force have generally been inversely related to fluctuations in average real earnings. The composition of the labor force in the last 18 months has continued to show the trends observed throughout the 1990s in terms of increasing level of education and lower participation rates among youth between the ages of 15 and 17. Labor reforms Since 1997, the government has proposed several measures and laws seeking to address some of the problems in the Brazilian labor market. The main objectives of these proposals were to: (i) correct existing contradictions between the current labor legislation and the workers’ rights specified in the Constitution; (ii) alter severance laws that make hiring expensive and provide incentives for workers to induce their dismissal; (iii> limit the capacity of special “labor courts” to set policies and rules regarding issues which are left unclear by ordinary legislation and the Constitution; (iv) change the law which imposes a single labor union per sector of activity, and thereby precludes the possibility of collective bargaining at the plant level; (v) increase labor market flexibility by reducing the work week that defines a fill-time work contract; (vi) speed up the resolution of labor disputes that do not exceed 40 minimum wages; (vii) allow temporary work contracts and the differentiation of minimum wages by regions of the country; and (viii) eliminate the link between the minimum wage and public sector wages. Of these proposals, only the last two have already been implemented; the others depend on measures and draft legislation still under consideration in congress.

B. External Trade and the Balance of Payments 11. External trade developments in the first nine months of this year have been characterized by a strong performance of exports in volume; a marked acceleration of imports of intermediate goods; and an only modest recovery of the terms of trade. Brazil’s competitiveness, as measured by the real effective exchange rate (in terms of relative CPIs and, even more so, relative ULCs) improved substantially in 1999, following the floating of the real. It has deteriorated somewhat in the course of 2000, reflecting some nominal appreciation of the real vis-a-vis the dollar, the strength of the latter vis-8vis other major currencies, and a domestic rate of inflation higher than in Brazil’s main trade partners (Figure 5). Nevertheless, export volumes rose by 14.4 percent during the first nine months of 2000, compared to the same period in 1999. By contrast, export prices rose by only 2:6 percent over the same period, and the terms of trade improved by 2.5 percent. Reflecting the marked rebound in industrial output, imports of intermediate goods rose by 30 percent in volume in the first nine months of 2000, more than offsetting a continued decline in most of the other import categories. On the whole, import volumes were up by 13.0 percent in January-September of this year (see Appendix I for details). The trade balance shifted from a deficit of US$774 million in the first three quarters of 1999 to a surplus of US$717 million in the corresponding period of 2000. The accumulated trade surplus is likely to decline in the fourth quarter, to around zero for 2000 as a whole (Table 4). 12. The deficit in the services account of the balance of payments in the first nine months of 2000, at around US$18.0 billion, was slightly lower than in the same period of last year, with a deterioration in the nonfactor services account, and a small increase in net interest payments abroad being more than offset by a decline of US$500 million in net profit and dividend remittances abroad. On the whole, therefore, the current account deficit declined from around US$17.3 billion in January-September 1999 to US$l5.9 billion in the corresponding period of 2000. For the year as a whole, the current account deficit is projected at around US$25.3 billion (4.2 percent of GDP), compared with US$25.0 billion (4.7 percent of GDP) in 1999. 13. Despite a substantial slowdown in the privatization program, net FD14 has continued to increase, reaching US$2 1.3 billion in the first nine months of this year. For 2000 as a whole, net FDI is projected at around US$26.2 billion, once again exceeding the expected current account deficit.’ Approximately three-fourths of FDJ inflows so far in 2000 have 4 See Section IX of the Selected Issues Paper for an analysis of FDI in recent years. 5 The nonprivatization related component of FDI amounted to about 87 percent of total in January-September 2000, compared with 65 percent in the same period of 1999.

Spain heads the ranking of origin of new FDI, followed by the United States and France. 14. As regards the rest of the capital account, net portfolio investments have continued on a moderately positive trend, reaching US$2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2000; and there was a substantial (about US$6.0 billion) net inflow of medium- and long-term debt (Tables 4 and 5). From July 1999 to March 2000, spreads on Brazilian debt declined by over 400 basis points, more than the composite emerging market bonds index (EMBI+).6 Spreads rose again in April, and, since May, have followed closely the EMBI+. In October 2000, Brazilian spreads were on average about 100 basis points above their March 2000 level (Figure 6). 15. The authorities intensified their liability management policy focusing on building up the yield curve and improving the liquidity of Brazilian sovereign instruments. In this context, they successfully implemented debt exchanges totaling some US$6.1 billion so far during the year.’ The total external debt declined to US$232.4 billion (40.8 percent of estimated GDP) at end-August 2000, from 241.5 billion (45.6 percent of GDP) at end-l 999, and the public sector component of it to US$89.2 billion from US$97.4 billion at end-l 999. These declines mainly reflected the repayment in April 2000, partly ahead of schedule, of most of the international support package of late 1998. As of August 2000, the short-term component of the external debt, measured on an original maturity basis, remained basically unchanged at US$27.4 billion, compared to December 1999 (Table 6), but declined in relation to NIR, from 115 percent at end-1999 to 92 percent in August 2000. 16. The short-term capital account registered a US$4.7 billion deficit in January- September 2000, reflecting the reduced incentive to speculative inflows entailed by the decline in domestic interest rates, and a substitution of domestic bank credit for foreign credit. The overall balance of payments registered a surplus of around US$6 billion during the same period. NIR increased to US$29.5 billion by end-October (about US$4.5 billion above the program floor for the second half of 2000). Gross international reserves declined from US$35.7 billion at end-1999 to US$3 1.2 billion at end-September 2000 (equivalent to 5.3 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services, and 59 percent of estimated short- 6 Spreads on Brazilian bonds declined from an average of 1,061 basis points in July 1999 to 653 basis points in March 2000, while the EMBI+ dropped by 373 basis points, to 772 basis points, over the same period. 7 In August 2000, a variety of outstanding Brady bonds was replaced with a 40-year global bond (with a 15-year call option), for a total of US$5.2 billion, with significant gains in net present value (NPV) and reduced debt service over the next ten years.

C. The Public Finances 17. The fiscal performance in the first nine months of 2000 was strong at all levels of government. The primary surplus of the consolidated public sector (measured from below the line) reached R$35.3 billion (4.4 percent of estimated period GDP) during that period, R$6.3 billion above the floor in the program for the first three quarters of the year (Tables 1 and 8). This result reflected surpluses of the central government, the states and municipalities, and the public enterprises equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP, 0.7 percent of GDP, and 0.9 percent of GDP, respectively. The overall deficit (PSBR) of the public sector declined to the equivalent of 3.8 percent of estimated period GDP, compared with 10 percent of GDP in 1999 as a whole.’ 18. At the central government level, the improvement reflected primarily expenditure containment efforts, as revenues declined in relation to GDP, as a result of the disappearance of some temporary tax increases and nonrecurring nontax revenues, mainly from concessions of public assets. The most buoyant taxes in the first nine months of 2000 were the financial transactions tax (CPMF), the turnover taxes, and the social security contributions which were boosted by the strong growth of employment and by successful efforts to improve enforcement. On the spending side, the absence of general wage adjustments for civil servants, and restraint in new hiring have helped keep payroll expenditures constant relative to GDP. Expenditures on social security benefits declined in relation to GDP, notwithstanding the initial impact of the 11 percent increase in minimum pension benefits in April and a 5.5 percent increase in other pensions in June. The favorable performance of the Social Security System reflected the initial effects of its reforms in recent years, as well as improvements in the administration of contributions and pension benefits (Appendix I). Discretionary current and capital spending was restrained during the first five months of the year by the delayed approval of the 2000 budget, which limited new spending commitments, but has begun to pick up in the more recent months. 19. The fiscal performance of the states also improved significantly (with the primary surplus increasing by the equivalent of 0.35 percent of estimated period GDP) in the first nine months of 2000, compared to the same period in 1999. The continued enforcement of their debt-refinancing contracts with the federal government which, in combination with reduced access to new financing, require the states to generate primary surpluses to service their debt, has been instrumental in promoting the sustained adjustment of the states’ finances over the last couple of years. The states’ performance so far in 2000 has also been helped by the * About 4 percentage points of the deficit in 1999 were accounted for by the impact of the depreciation of the real on the public sector foreign exchange-indexed debt.

The municipalities’ primary surplus has declined only‘marginally in the fast nine months of 2000 (to 0.14 percent of estimated period GDP), notwithstanding the municipal elections that took place in October. The federal government has now concluded debt restructuring agreements with about 180 municipalities (including those of Sgo Paul0 and Rio de Janeiro) which should henceforth help to maintain fiscal discipline also at this level of government. 20. Finally, the position of the public enterprises also improved (by the equivalent of 0.2 percent of GDP) in the first three quarters of 2000, compared to the same period in 1999. The improvement was largely concentrated at the state level. The favorable impact of the high level of international oil prices on the profits of the federal oil company Petrobr&s was partly offset by sharply higher investment by the latter in oil exploration and upgrading of existing capacity. 21. The net public debt declined in relation to GDP in the first nine months of 2000, to 48.5 percent of estimated GDP at end-September 2000 from 49.7 percent of GDP at the end of 1999. The indicative ceiling on the net debt in the program for September 2000 was, however, missed by a small (0.3 percent) margin, reflecting a larger-than-initially projected depreciation of the real (to R$1.84 per US. dollar) compared with the R$1.75 per U.S. dollar assumed in the program. Significant progress was made in improving the structure of the public debt. The share of the domestic federal securitized debt placed at fixed rates increased to 15.7 percent by September 2000 from around 9 percent at end-1999, while the share of debt linked to the overnight (SELIC) rate declined from 61 percent to 53.2 percent over the same period. At the same time, the average maturity of this debt increased by 2% months since February this year to 29 months in September (and to over 14 months for securities placed through auctions). The authorities also reduced the share of the foreign exchange- indexed debt from 24 percent at end-1999 to 20.5 percent by September 2000 (Figure 7). 22. Progress in structural fiscal reforms and privatization fell somewhat short of initial expectations, partly reflecting factors outside the government’s control. On the positive side, an important step forward was taken with the enactment in May of the Fiscal Responsibility Law’ which, among other things, mandates the setting of limits on personnel expenditures and on debt of each level of government, eliminates the scope for bailouts of subnational governments by the federal government, and increases transparency and accountability in the management of the public finances. On the other hand, congress has not yet given final approval to the last two remaining pieces of implementing legislation for the administrative reform -a law regulating dismissals of tenured public employees for inadequate performance and a constitutional amendment that establishes remuneration limits ’ See Box 8 of the Staff Report for the Fifth Review under the Stand-By Arrangement (EBS/00/82) for details.

Also, little progress has been made in the reform of indirect taxation, except for the presentation to congress in early August of the constitutional amendment establishing an explicit system to tax domestic oil products, to replace the implicit taxes embodied in the petroleum account of the Treasury by, at the latest, the beginning of 2002, when the domestic oil market is expected to be fully liberalized (Table 1). 23. The privatization process (Box 3) also slowed down in the first half of this year, as the government decided to revise the privatization models for the three major electricity generation companies (Furnas, Eletronorte and Chesf), to garner the needed political support, and also (in the case of Fumas) with a view to expanding popular ownership of shares in the company, as a contribution to the development of the capital market. The government continued its efforts to restructure the remaining state-owned banks. In October, it successfully privatized the state bank of Parani (BANESTADO) for a total of R$ 1.6 billion, more than three times the minimum offer price (which represents the largest privatization of a state bank so far). The auctions of the former state Bank of Sgo Paulo (BANESPA), one of the largest financial institutions in Brazil, and of the Brazilian Reinsurance Institute (IRB) were delayed by repeated court challenges. Following a recent favorable decision by the Supreme Court, the auction of BANESPA has been set for November 20,200O; the minimum bid has been set at R$1.9 billion. Six other state banks, currently under federal administration, are expected to be privatized in the course of 200 1. D. Monetary and Financial Developments 24. The central bank (BCB) has continued its cautious conduct of monetary policy within the inflation targeting framework established in mid-1999. After keeping the overnight (SELIC) interbank rate broadly unchanged at 19 percent from late September 1999 to mid-April 2000, it reduced the rate in steps in subsequent months, to 16.5 percent by mid- July. Since then, it has kept the rate unchanged in the light of the pickup in inflation during July-August and, more recently, renewed unsettled conditions in international financial markets, Reflecting the evolution of expectations of future inflation, the term structure of interest rates, which was quite steep at the end of 1999, flattened out markedly in the first several months of 2000. It has steepened somewhat once again since mid-year, albeit at a lower level (Figure 8). 25. While moving cautiously with respect to the benchmark overnight rate, the BCB has sought to promote a more pronounced reduction in bank lending rates by addressing some of the factors responsible for the relatively high levels of banking spreads (Box 4). In particular, it has reduced in steps the substantial reserve requirements on bank deposits to 45 percent for sight deposits (from 65 percent in October 1999). It has also increased transparency requirements for banks’ lending rates, with a view to promoting greater competition within the banking system.

The Privatization Program Overview Over the last 10 years Brazil has privatized 128 companies for a total amount of USS91.7 billion, which represents an average of 1% percent of GDP per year in privatization receipts. Approximately 20 percent of this total corresponded to the companies’ debts assumed by the new proprietor, and out of the remaining 80 percent that constituted new inflows to the public sector, 45 percent (US$32.9 billion) came from foreign investors. The participation of foreign capital has been fairly concentrated among few countries, with the U.S. responsible for 34 percent, followed by Spain with 27 percent, and Portugal with 15 percent. One-third of privatization receipts came from telecommunications services, including the sale of existing public enterprises and the concessions auctioned to cellular service providers; one-third came from electricity generation and distribution; and most of the remaining receipts stemmed from the sale of companies involved in production activities including steel (9 percent), mining (8 percent), and petrochemicals (4 percent). Almost two-thirds of total privatization receipts were obtained from the sale of federal enterprises, and the remaining amount came from enterprises which had been under the control of state governments. The process Privatization in Brazil has been a gradual process, with some divestments already taking place in the early 1980s. During that entire decade, however, total privatization proceeds amounted to only US$723 million, limited by the exclusion of foreigners, the difftcult macroeconomic conditions, financing constraints of domestic agents, and a lack of government commitment to increasing private ownership and the degree of openness in the economy. The new government that took office in 1990 gave renewed impulse to privatization efforts, and introduced an integrated privatization program that allowed the participation of foreign capital subject to various restrictions: foreigners could buy a maximum of 40 percent of a company’s voting shares; foreign capital had to remain in Brazil for a minimum of 12 years; and shares purchased in privatization auctions could not be sold for two years. After 1992, these restrictions were gradually lifted and, currently, complete foreign-ownership of privatized companies is permitted. The approval of legislation eliminating public monopolies and regulating the granting of concessions in some key utility sectors in 1995, allowed the privatization program to be extended to areas such as telecommunications and the generation, transmission, and distribution of energy. The gains from privatization Privatization has resulted in both financial and efficiency gains. While the gains from privatization cannot be viewed in isolation from other reforms, a rough indication of the financial savings obtained, in addition to the US$9 1.7 billion in receipts, is provided by the following considerations: the fiscal accounts of public enterprises went from a deficit of about 2% percent of GDP in 1989 to a surplus in 2000; direct subsidies from the Treasury to public enterprises, which averaged 2 percent of GDP in 1987-89, have been virtually eliminated; the public sector financing and debt cancellation that stemmed from privatization receipts led to implicit lower public debt. In addition, privatization has yielded efficiency gains. For example, in the energy sector, electricity companies privatized until 1998 increased their investments, on average, by approximately 60 percent in the year immediately following privatization, and total supply interruption time decreased by 36 percent between 1996 and 1999. Also, in the telecommunications sector, the number of fixed telephone lines and public telephones increased by 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively, between 1997 and 1999; the startup cost for a regular phone line decreased by 60 percent in the same period. Finally, data from 50 companies privatized between 1980 and 1994 show that statistically significant gains regarding real sales, profits, investments, and productivity were observed after privatization.

Progress in Reducing the Cost of Bank Credit The BCB has been actively seeking to reduce the cost of bank credit. While, to some extent, high bank lending .ates have been due to tight monetary policies as reflected in high overnight interest rates, for the most part they lave been the result of large spreads between the funding interest rates of banks and the rates banks have been :harging to fmal borrowers (bank spreads). In October 1999, the BCB announced 2 1 measures intended to .educe bank spreads, and thereby stimulate lending and borrowing operations (see EBS/99/205 for details). While the cost of credit remains high, the BCB has been successful in reducing bank spreads significantly, as ;hown in the table below.

The decrease in bank spreads reflects measures aimed at: reducing intermediation costs; improving fmancial system transparency; and facilitating the efficient operations of the financial system. To reduce intermediation costs (and stimulate the supply of credit), the BCB, among other things, reduced the ninimum reserve requirement on demand deposits 6om 65 percent in October 1999 to 45 percent in June 2000; already in October 1999, the government had reduced the financial operations tax (IOF) for credit operations fol Individuals from 6 percent to 1.5 percent. To improve financial system transparency, and, thereby, foster competition, the BCB now publishes on its website (www.bcb.gov.br) detailed information on individual bank lending rates and fees, as provided by the banks to the BCB on a daily basis. The information banks are required to provide to the BCB has been made more comprehensive, and includes detailed rates for different credit operations and maturities. To facilitate the efficient operations of the financial system, the BCB has been working on overhauling risk assessment systems, including the loan classification system, the central risk information system (Cenrral de Riscas), and the Brazilian payments system. Regulations establishing an improved risk assessment through a forward-looking loan classification system went into effect at end-March 2000 for all loans with outstanding balances exceeding R$500,000, and, at end-July 2000, for all loans with outstanding balances between R$50,000 and R$500,000; operations below RS50.000 may be classified according to bank-internal risk classification systems. The risk information system has been reformed alongside the loan classification system, and the capacity of the system has been enhanced to allow for information to be processed in a more comprehensive and systematic fashion. To safeguard privacy rights and legal protection of debtors under the new risk information system, the BCB is considering to establish a complementary law, which is expected to be sent to congress in the near future. The coverage of the risk information system was increased by reducing from RS50,OOO to R$20,000 the minimum credit operations that have to be reported. The BCB has also worked on strengthening the legal basis for different efficient credit instruments, including for IOUs and electronic credit contracts, and proposals have either already been sent to congress or are expected to be sent shortly. Finally, the new payments system, which will allow for a more efficient execution of operations, is in the process of being established, alongside various reforms in the system of banking supervision, and is expected to become operational in the first quarter of 200 1.

The National Monetary Council also lowered the rate on long-term loans for investment by the National Development Bank (BNDES)-the TJLP-from 12.5 percent at end-l 999 to 9.75 percent as of August 2000. 26. The decline in lending rates. albeit to levels which are still high in real terms, has facilitated a pickup in various components of bank credit to the private sector in recent months (Figure 9), although total bank credit has grown by only 4.5 percent in the 12- months to September 2000.” The share of nonperforming loans in total loans remained stable at around 8.5 percent from end-1999 to end-February 2000; that of loans overdue more than 180 days declined from 9.8 percent in March 2000 to 6.5 percent in September 2000.” Bank provisions at end-September 2000 amounted to R$23.9 billion (12 1 percent of all loans overdue more than 180 days, and 96 percent of all loans overdue more than 120 days), with private-sector institutions as a whole exceeding minimum provisioning requirements, and public sector institutions still falling short (Table 9). 27. The narrow monetary aggregates have expanded strongly since late 1999, reflecting both temporary factors, such as the buildup of liquidity due to Y2K concerns, and more permanent factors, such as the liberalization of short-term investment funds in 1999, and the reductions in minimum reserve requirements, which have led banks to offer incentives to their customers for holding more funds in demand deposits. By contrast, the broader lo Due to various structural breaks in the series of loans outstanding, that reflect a broadening of the definition of loan aggregates to include, among others, leasing operations and credit card debt, and the introduction in March 2000 of a new system for provisioning for credit risk, it is difficult to accurately ascertain credit growth. ” These numbers are not fully comparable, as the introduction in March 2000 of new systems for loan classification and credit risk provisioning led to a break in the series for credit and nonperforming loans. In general, the new system provides for a gradual increase in bank provisions, primarily based on the time loans have been overdue; the previous provisioning system lacked gradualism and had more judgmental elements.

The indicative NDA ceiling in the program for June 2000 was met with a sizable margin (Table 1). III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS A. Overview 28. The Brazilian authorities noted that the performance of the economy under the program, supported under the Stand-By Arrangement from the Fund, had exceeded expectations on most counts. Looking ahead, they recognized that it would be important to ensure that the economy remains on a moderate, but sustained growth path, facilitating further declines in both unemployment and inflation, as well as a further gradual improvement in the external accounts. The simultaneous achievement of these objectives over the short to medium term would require a relatively benign external environment, and the continuation of sound macroeconomic policies, and structural reform and privatization efforts, aimed at improving the efficiency and productive potential of the economy. The authorities stressed that it would also be important that the benefits of economic growth with financial stability be more equitably distributed, a goal that would facilitate the maintenance of adequate social support for the government’s economic policy program. This would require a careful balancing of priorities in public spending, as well as continued efforts to improve the cost-effectiveness of social spending. 29. While generally agreeing with the authorities’ views, the staff noted that the challenges ahead for economic policy making in Brazil remained significant. While in many ways improved from the late nineties, the international environment continued to be fraught with uncertainties regarding, in particular, oil prices, exchange rates among major currencies, and international developments in financial markets, which inevitably affected the short-term outlook for the Brazilian economy. At the same time, there were signs (in particular the growth of certain categories of credit and of imports in recent months) that the recovery in domestic demand was rapidly gathering momentum, a fact that argued for caution in short-term macroeconomic management. Finally, market perceptions-albeit not entirely fair-were that the structural reform and privatization efforts were stalling; _ these perceptions were contributing to the maintenance of still relatively high spreads for Brazilian debt, constraining the scope for further sustained reductions in domestic interest rates. ” For example, while Ml rose by 26 percent in the twelve months through September 2000, broad money, defined as Ml plus savings deposits and time deposits, grew only by 1.9 percent over the same period. Notwithstanding strong growth rates, the narrow monetary aggregates remain relatively small in size: Ml, for example, amounts to only about 5.4 percent of GDP.

Against this background, discussions focussed on the appropriate stance of macroeconomic policies for the rest of 2000 and-2001; the medium-term prospects for, in particular, the public finances, the balance of payments, and monetary policies; and the prospects for the ongoing structural reform and privatization efforts. B. Fiscal Policy and Reforms l The outlook for the rest of 2000 31. The authorities noted that the fiscal improvement so far in 2000 had exceeded expectations. This was mainly a reflection of, on the one hand, the stronger-than-expected recovery of the economy, which-in combination with improvements in the enforcement of taxes and social security contributions-had boosted revenues, and, on the other hand, a strong expenditure containment effort, partly related to the delayed approval of the federal budget which had constrained the pace of expenditure commitments in the first months of the year. Looking ahead to the last few months of the year, the authorities expected the primary surplus of the federal government to decline in relation to GDP, as the pace of commitment of budgetary authorizations picked up as usual in the last quarter of the year, the full impact of the adjustment of social security benefits was felt, and some revenue items (e.g., the financial transactions tax) were adversely affected by rate reductions or other exogenous developments. At the time of the discussions, the petroleum account of the Treasury was expected to shift from the R$545 million deficit recorded in the first half of the year to a surplus of R$800 million for the year as a whole, as a result of the increases in domestic fuel prices enacted in early July. Since then, however, the weakening of the real and the persistence of high international oil prices have made it unlikely that, in the absence of further domestic fuel price increases before year-end, a surplus will indeed be recorded in the oil account for 2000 as a whole. 32. At the time of the discussions, a target for the primary surplus of the consolidated public sector of R$36.7 billion (equivalent to 3.25 percent of the then estimated GDP) for 2000 as a whole was tentatively agreed between the authorities and the mission. Following the publication by IBGE of the national accounts for 1999, and a revision of the GDP estimate for 2000, the authorities have agreed to maintain the same target in absolute terms, which is now equivalent to about 3.4 percent of the projected GDP for this year. The authorities agreed with the staff that a somewhat higher primary surplus relative to GDP was warranted, given the fact that (as noted in Box 1 above) the new GDP data have also led to a significant upward revision of the ratio of the net public debt to GDP-albeit leaving it on a clear downward trend (Table 11). 33. Given the performance to date, and the prospects for the rest of this year for the finances of the states, municipalities, and their enterprises, the proposed target for the primary surplus of the public sector appears consistent with the floor set by the budget framework law for the combined primary surplus of the federal government and its enterprises, (R$30.5 billion, or 2.8 percent of the currently projected GDP for this year). The Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public\ -3o- staff calculations suggest that such a surplus is achievable, but that, in the absence of further increases of domestic fuel prices, it will likely require a tight control on discretionary primary spending of both the federal government and the federal enterprises in the last months of the year. Preliminary staff calculations also suggest that, assuming a broad stabilization of the exchange rate around its current level of about R$1.90 per U.S. dollar and no further declines in the SELIC interest rate until the end of this year, the overall public sector deficit would decline from 10.0 percent of GDP in 199913 to 4.6 percent of GDP in 2000. On the fUrther assumption that recognitions of contingent liabilities (net of privatization revenues) would add the equivalent of about 0.5 percent of GDP to the net public debt this year (see Box 5 for details), the net public debt to GDP ratio would remain broadly unchanged from its end- ! 999 level (just under 50 percent of GDP). l The 2001 budget 34. The proposed federal budget for 2001, submitted by the government to congress in August 2000, is based on a macroeconomic framework that includes a projected growth of real GDP of 4.5 percent, and a decline of inflation to around 4 percent by year-end (5.9 percent on average), assumptions that appear on balance realistic, in the absence of substantial external shocks. The proposed budget targets a primary surplus of the federal government of R$28.! billion, equivalent to 2.3 percent of the projected GDP. Given projected primary surpluses of the states and municipalitiesand the public enterprises equivalent in all to 0.7 percent of GDP, the proposed budget appears broadly consistent with a primary surplus of the consolidated public sector equivalent to about 3 percent of the projected GDP. 35. The budget envisages a significant increase in revenues relative to GDP in 2001. This mainly reflects additional receipts from concessions of new telephone frequencies and from the petroleum account. The surplus of the latter (projected in the budget at around R$6.5 billion) is predicated, however, on an assumed substantial decline in international oil prices, to under US$25 a barrel, which currently appears unduly optimistic, and on an average exchange rate of R$1.82 per U.S. dollar, which would imply a significant appreciation from its current level.14 A shortfall in net revenues of the petroleum account as a result of deviations from these assumptions could be partly offset by higher surpluses of the oil company Petrob&; it could also be prevented by timely adjustments of domestic oil I3 About 4 percentage points of the overall deficit (relative to GDP) in 1999 are accounted for by the increase in the foreign-exchange linked component of the domestic public debt due to the depreciation of the real. I4 A rough rule of thumb suggests that each US$l per barrel increase in crude oil prices, or a depreciation of about 3 percent of the real against the U.S. dollar, entail a loss in revenue to the petroleum account of about R$ 1 billion over a twelve-month period.

Recognition of Contingent Liabilities The federal government has made a substantial effort in recent years to improve fiscal transparency and recognize many of the contingent liabilities inherited from opaque fiscal practices in the past. In this vein, the recently approved Fiscal Responsibility Law and the Budget Guidelines Law require that budget proposals submitted to congress should include an appendix of fiscal risks with a candid assessment of contingent liabilities. The federal budget proposal for 2001 complies with this requirement and presents a detailed description of the liabilities to be recognized during the next fiscal year. Since 1996 the Federal treasury has been recognizing a substantial amount of liabilities originated in past off- budget items (known asfiscal sticelerons). While the economic (aggregate demand) impact of these liabilities mostly occurred in the past, their impact on the public debt statistics is only recorded at the time they are securitized (recognized). In order to preserve the information content of the nominal fiscal deficit (PSBR) for a given year, the securitization of these past liabilities has been excluded from the PSBR, with their impact on the public debt recorded as a stock adjustment. The converse procedure is adopted for privatization receipts (reduction of net public debt through a discrete negative stock adjustment, leaving the PSBR unaltered) (see Table). Most of the liabilities being recognized today, and potential others currently under judicial review, derived from less transparent or unorthodox fiscal practices, or from the temporary suspension of the widespread indexation mechanisms under previous stabilization plans.

FX rate A 0.1% 0.3% 0.3% 3.1% There are past liabilities the government will recognize over time (since the legal process has run its course), and a few others that might materialize in the future depending on the outcome of claims still being reviewed in the court system. Apart from the obligation to explicitly recognize losses related to the recapitalization of the workers severance payment fund (FGTS) and the liquidation of the liabilities accumulated by the housing- mortgage insurance/subsidy fund (FCVS) during the past three decades, there are a few other contingent liabilities that could materialize in the near future. These relate mainly to: the recapitalization of federal banks; the loss incurred by a few sectors due to past, government-imposed price freezes; the monetary correction to be applied to savings accounts frozen in March 1990; and the interest penalty paid on tax arrears since 1996. Regarding the FGTS ‘, the Supreme Court has recently ruled, after more than a decade of legal questionings, that the individual account balances of the FGTS were under-corrected for past inflation during two failed stabilization plans in 1989 and 1990. The government, as the ultimate guarantor of the fund, is liable for the difference between the amount of correction granted at the time and the higher correction due; the precise index ’ The FGTS is a mandatory severance pay scheme funded by an 8 percent employer contribution on wages that yields a real rate of return of 3 percent per year. The funds are typically intermediated to municipal basic infrastructure projects.

Despite the difficulty in assessing the potential loss from this judicial decision (since the correction to be granted is still to be determined), the gross liability could reach around R$39 billion (or around 3.6 percent of estimated year 2000 GDP). However, the liability is not due immediately-it has an actuarial nature-since account holders are only entitled to draw funds from their accounts under special circumstances, such as the loss of employment status, permanent disability, death, etc. As such, this liability will come due over 20-25 years and the government will be able to trim down its impact on the public debt by using some of the assets of the FGTS, which amount to close to 1 percent of GDP. Therefore, the impact on public debt can be spread out over a long period, and the magnitude of the loss can potentially be further reduced by changes in the way the FGTS fund operates and intermediates funds from now on, that is, in the next 20 years, additional assets can be gained. The FVCS fund was created in 1967 with the objective of insulating workers’ mortgage payments from macroeconomic volatility and the loss of purchasing power of wages. With the financial and economic crisis of the 1980s (high interest rates, inflation, and recession) the FCVS ended up accumulating more liabilities than assets. This situation was further worsened by measures taken between 1984-90 granting subsidies to mortgage contract holders. The FCVS deficit is in essence the accumulated subsidy on mortgage indexation to variations in the wage of the mortgage taker. This insurance/subsidy scheme created a liability to the financial system that, according to government estimates, reached around RS59 billion (around 6.1 percent of GDP) at end-1999, with federally-owned CEF (the main provider of housing credit in the country) as the main creditor. In 1996 the government decreed that the FCVS liabilities would be paid through the issuance of public securities to the creditors during a period of 30 years, starting in January 1997. Around R$4 billion were issued during 1997-99 (of the remaining R$55 billion to be recognized, around RS30 billion refers to mortgage contracts that have already expired, and the remaining to the present value of expected future claims) with another R$4 billion expected during the year 2000. In 2001 around R$10 billion is expected to be recognized. Apart from these two main sources, there are other potential liabilities still going through the usually slow and uncertain judicial process. They are: 1. Claims against the use of the Selic (overnight) reference rate since I996 as the reference interest penalty charge to update back-dated taxes. The plaintiffs claim that a lower rate should be used instead. A final ruling on this questioning is probably some time away and the government can appeal an unfavorable decision to the Supreme Court. Two individual lawsuits were settled in favor of the government, which gives confidence that the probability that a higher jurisdiction court will uphold the plaintiffs’ case is very small. The potential loss to the government from an adverse decision, while hard to quantify, is estimated to be small. 2. Demands for inflation correction for assets frozen in March 1990 (Collor plan) according to a higher inflation index. A lower court has already ruled in favor of the government, but claimants have appealed to the Supreme Court. The impact could be significant, around R$30 billion, but it is still unclear who is the liable entity: The central bank or the financial system. The chances of an adverse ruling for the government are perceived as low. 3. Recapitalization offederal banks. The BCB is determined to level the playing field between private banks and federal banks by making the latter subject to the same loan risk classification, provisioning rules, and capital requirements as their private sector peers. Since the federal banks are underprovisioned and undercapitalized, it is expected that the Treasury will be called upon to recapitalize these institutions. Reliable estimates of the cost to the budget of such a recapitalization are not yet available (see also Box 6). 4. Lawsuits demanding financial compensation for losses imposed by underindexation rules and price controls during the high inflation years (mainly airlines and the sugar and alcohol industry). Previous lower court rulings have been mixed. Additional losses could reach 1 percent of GDP, but are, not likely.

The combined revenue from taxes and social security contributions is projected to drop by about 0.4 percent-of GDP. This reflects the net effect of the disappearance of some once-off revenues and the assumption in the budget that congress would approve by mid-2001 both the return of the rate of the financial transaction tax to 0.38 percent, to fund, in conjunction with increases in selected excises, the proposed Poverty Fund (see EBS/00/82 for details), and the constitutional amendment instituting an 11 percent social security contribution for retired civil servants. The budget specifically conditions certain expenditures to the enactment of these measures.” 36. Assuming the latter, the proposed budget envisages a small (0.1 percent of GDP) increase in primary spending relative to the projected outcome for 2000, concentrated in purchases of goods and services and investments, especially in the social areas (health and education, as well as selected social assistance programs), and in infrastructure (telecommunications and tran~port)‘~ (Tables 12 and 13). The authorities noted that the sharp (24 percent) increase in expenditures on health reflected the impact of a recent constitutional amendment earmarking certain budgetary receipts to expenditures in this area. They also emphasized the effort that was being made (in particular through the new so-called Alvorada Program) to focus the increased social spending on the states and municipalities with human development indices (HDI) lower than the national average, which are largely, but not exclusively, concentrated in the north and northeastern regions of the country (Appendix I). The proposed budget makes no allowance for a real increase in the minimum wage and minimum pension benefits, a subject of considerable debate currently in congress. It also makes no allowance for the impact of a recent Supreme Court decision granting a retroactive 12 percent wage increase to the Electoral Tribunal staff, a decision that could be extended to the rest of the judiciary. 37. Based on the assumption of a significant decline in the benchmark overnight (SELIC) interest rate (to an average of 14.2 percent in 2001) the proposed budget projects an overall deficit of the central government in 2001 equivalent to around 1.4 percent of the currently estimated GDP. The staffs own preliminary scenario, based on the assumptions of a more gradual decline in interest rates,17 a more depreciated exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, and a consolidated public sector primary balance equivalent to 3.0 percent of I5 In addition, the government has begun to explore the possibility of taxing capital gains of private pension funds. However, prospects in this regard remain uncertain. I6 For a detailed analysis of social spending in these areas, see Sections III and IV of the Selected Issues Paper. ” Staff calculations suggest that, as a rough approximation, every percentage point increase in the SELIC rate entails, ceteris paribus, an increase of the overall deficit equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - GDP, points to overall deficits of 2.2 percent of GDP for the central government, and around 3.5 percent of GDP for the consolidated public sector (PSBR). As usual, virtually all financing of these deficits is expected to be provided by the domestic financial market. The ratio of the public debt to GDP is expected to decline slightly from around 50 percent of GDP in 2000 to around 49.7 percent of GDP in 2001 (Table 11). l Structural fiscal reforms and medium-term prospects 38. The authorities noted that, while the pace of structural fiscal reforms had somewhat decelerated in recent months, it had not stopped (see Table 14 for details). Following the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law in May, the government had moved ahead in its implementation, with two proposals to congress for limits-as required by the law-on the gross federal securitized public debt (equivalent to 6.5 times the government’s net current revenues) and on the net debt of each level of government (equivalent to 3.5 times net current revenues for the federal government; 2 times for the states; and 1.2 times for the municipalities).18 These limits were projected to be consistent with gradually declining primary surpluses of the consolidated public sector equivalent to (as stipulated by the budget framework law for 2001) 3 percent of GDP in 2001; 2.7 percent in 2002; 2.2 percent in 2003; and 1.8 percent in 2004 and 1.5 percent thereafter. 39. The staffs own calculations (presented in detail in Section II of the Selected Issues Paper) suggest that, even in a central scenario based on middle-of-the-road assumptions, slightly higher primary surpluses than those projected by the authorities would be needed over the medium term to secure a continued gradual decline of the net public debt in relation to GDP in the rest of this decade. These surpluses would have to be even larger if the external environment required the maintenance of significantly higher real interest rates. thereby dampening growth prospects (Figure 10). 40. As regards other structural fiscal reforms, the authorities noted that significant progress had been made in addressing the problems of the social security system (Appendix II). The deficit of the system for private employees was projected-on relatively cautious assumptions-to begin falling in relation to GDP already in 2000, and to remain on a slowly declining trend over the medium term (more or less pronounced depending on the expec.ted impact on retirement ages of the introduction of actuarial criteria in the calculation ‘* The limits are immediately binding for the federal government; for states and municipalities whose net debts are currently above the respective limits, a gradual convergence process is mandated; states and municipalities which are currently below the limits are subject to additional limitations on the contracting of new debts. The limits in the proposal are subsidiary to those established in the contracts stipulated between the federal government and most states and large municipalities for the refinancing of their debt.

As concerns the pension system for public employees, which continues to show larger deficits (around 2 percent of GDP), and to be fraught with significant inequities, the government was trying to contain the deficits in the near term through the introduction of the social security contribution for public retirees. Over the long term, the problem would be progressively reduced by the scope afforded by the administrative reform to recruit new civil servants in most careers under the same labor and pension regimes as private employees. 41. Concerning, in particular, the tax reform, the authorities noted that a number of bills had been proposed to congress this year to broaden the tax base and improve enforcement; these included a bill modifying the existing bank secrecy legislation; a new tax code limiting the scope for tax avoidance and excessive tax litigation; and a bill transforming the rural property tax into a special contribution to finance land reform. These bills were now at various stages of consideration in congress. As for the reform of indirect taxation, the government had made substantial progress in securing agreement by the states on the unification across the country of the base and rate structure of the state level VAT (ICMS), a step which would be important to end the proliferation of tax incentives; and the consequent erosion of the base of this tax. Political agreement on the phasing-in of the replacement of the existing cascading contributions on enterprise turnover (COFINS and PIYPASEP) with a federal VAT-type multistage tax, or a single stage tax, remained elusive, however. In this respect, a careful balancing of efficiency objectives with the need to safeguard federal revenues was essential. The government had also submitted to congress in August a proposed constitutional amendment establishing an explicit tax on fuel products to replace the implicit cross subsidization embodied in the petroleum account, thereby paving the way for the scheduled full liberalization of the domestic oil market by end-2001. C. Monetary and Financial Policies and Reforms 42. The authorities expressed satisfaction with the operation to date of the formal inflation targeting framework for monetary policy. They noted that-despite significant, partly unexpected, supply shocks, such as the impact of adverse weather conditions on food prices-the rate of IPCA inflation had remained well within the tolerance interval around the central target since the inception of the framework in mid-1999. With the exception of the recent small excess in September, it had also remained within the narrower band stipulated in the program as a threshold for informal consultations with the Fund staff (Table 15). 43. The authorities noted that the BCB was continuing its efforts to refine the analytical tools it had developed to predict inflation, including a small structural model, vector- autoregression (VAR) models, leading indicators of inflation, and surveys of market Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 37 - expectations.” Although, in the quarterly inflation reports, emphasis was being placed on the projections of the structural model, the other tools were also utilized by the BCB’s Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM), at its monthly meetings, to form judgments about the appropriate course of interest rate policy. 44. While regretting the small excess over the threshold in September, the authorities emphasized that: (a) the significant monthly increases of consumer price inflation (IPCA) in July and August (of 1.61 percent and 1.3 1 percent, respectively) had been largely due to the above-mentioned supply shocks, which already abated in September when the monthly inflation rate was 0.23 percent; (b) core inflation had remained relatively more subdued (1.6 percent cumulatively in the third quarter); (c) both the model projections and market surveys pointed to a sustained further decline of inflation through end-2000 and in 2001, to rates close to the central targets; and finally (d) with hindsight, it may have been preferable to stipulate in the program a target path for inflation that better took into account the timing of likely supply shocks, rather than the linearly declining path that had been inc.luded for 2000. 45. The staff, while agreeing with these points, noted that the model projections were based on the assumption of broadly unchanged interest rates; this suggested that the room for maneuver to lower interest rates in the rest of this year and in 2001 would be rather limited. The staff also noted that, although available evidence pointed to continuing moderation in some of the determinants of core inflation, in particular labor costs and non-oil import prices, the indications of a significant pickup in demand in recent months, and the narrowing of spare capacity in important industries, pointed to the risk of pressures on prices from a rebuilding of profit margins, thus reinforcing the case for caution in the management of monetary policy. In this respect, the growth of bank credit required close monitoring, as it could potentially fuel a consumption boom. The authorities, for their part, noted that, although credit to households was indeed growing fast, it was doing so from a low basis; it represented still a relatively small (16 percent) share of total bank credit; and its growth was more related to the improved employment prospects, and to increased consumer confidence, than to the decline in interest rates on consumer credit, which remained quite high. The authorities also were of the view that risks of a consumption boom remained low, assuming a continued moderation of wage rates. 46. The staff agreed with the authorities that health and resilience of the Brazilian financial system remain relatively strong, but noted that the recent assessments of the Base1 core principles for effective banking supervision and of the code of good practices on transparency in monetary and financial policies had pointed to some areas where further improvements may be needed, such as banking supervision and the remaining public sector l9 See Section VII of the Selected Issues Paper for an analysis of the predictive record of some of these forecasting tools.

The authorities indicated that the implementation of the new loan classification system had gone smoothly, and that substantial progress was being made in further strengthening the regulatory framework for financial institutions; in particular, regulations on marking-to-market bank assets had been prepared, and circulated to the public for comments by end-October; regulations aimed at ensuring the conformity of bank accounting procedures with international standards, as well as those for liquidity risks, would be made public by end-November, for enforcement in the course of 2001. The authorities were also strictly enforcing the requirement of consolidated reporting by banks (including of offshore operations). Work was also continuing on reforms to promote the healthy development of domestic capital markets; the authorities considered the proposed law on corporate governance, which, among other things, substantially strengthens safeguards for minority shareholders, a very important element in promoting a deepening of the stock market. This law is currently under consideration in congress, and the government is making strong efforts to secure its passage before the end of this year. Also, the authorities noted their intention to present to congress in the first half of 2001 legislation strengthening the independence of the central bank. 47. With respect to the federal banks, the implementation of the new loan classification system brought to light the inadequacy of provisions and capital of the Caixa Economica Federal (CEF) (see Box 6 for details). The government was currently considering the options with regard for CEF and the other federal banks, outlined in a recent consultants’ report, which had been made public with a view to stimulating an open public debate on the sensitive issue of the future role of these banks. The authorities noted their interest in participating in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) once their strategy for the federal banks is in place. D. External Policies and Medium-Term Prospects Exchange rate policy 48. The authorities expressed satisfaction with the working of the floating exchange rate regime so far. They noted that they had continued to conduct a clean float, virtually abstaining from direct interventions in the spot market since the middle of last year, apart from providing liquidity in the context of Y2K-related concerns at the end of 1999. In line with the commitments under the program, they had also eschewed any intervention in the futures exchange market since April 1999, when the last of the BCB’s outstanding futures contracts expired. While maintaining a declining trend in the stock of foreign-exchange indexed debt, and continuing to lengthen its average maturity, they had set the rate of rollover of foreign-exchange-indexed securities on a case-by-case basis, with a view to avoid further pressuring the foreign exchange market during temporary turbulence periods. 49. The authorities viewed the real appreciation of the exchange rate this year as a correction of the initial overshoot of the depreciation in 1999, and one that still left the exchange rate at an adequately competitive level, as evidenced by the continuing strong Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - Box 6. The Federal Banks At the request of the federal government’s managerial coordination committee for federal public financial institutions (COMIF), consultants from Booz-Allen and Hamilton (BAH) tid the Economic Research Institute of the University of Sao Paulo (FIPE) recently undertook an assessment of banks owned by the federal government (federal banks), with the goal to advise on options for a strategic reorientation of these banks and their operations. The final report has been published by the Ministry of Finance on its web page for public consideration.’ The group federal banks includes five institutions: Banco do Brasil (BB), Caixa EconBmica Federal (CEF), Banco National de Desenvolvimento Econbmico e Social (BNDES), Banco do Nordeste (BNB) e Banco da AmazBnia (BASA). With the exception of BNDES, these are all deposit taking institutions. In total, the five banks have assets equivalent to RS356 billion, roughly equal to 37 percent of Brazil 1999 GDP, or about 40 percent of the country’s total banking system assets. BB and CEF are, respectively. the first and second largest banks in Latin America; BNDES is among the ten largest Latin American banks. An overview is provided in the attached table. Federal banks are the predominant lenders in several sectors, accounting for 54 percent of rural credits, 84 percent of housing credits, and 54 percent of deposits. As federal financial institutions, these five banks have had to juggle both commercial and developmental objectives, and have been burdened with a significant number of quasi-fiscal operations that have adversely affected overall transparency, as well as efficiency and competitiveness of these institutions, particularly when compared to private financial institutions. As a result of quasi-fiscal losses, the federal banks already received gross capital injections of RS10.0 billion over the last five years, of which RS6.7 billion represented net resources from the federal government. Although the specific problems of each institution are different, the case of the CEF may be used to illustrate the problems faced by the federal banks. CEF has traditionally been Brazil’s dominant provider of housing credit, a sector which has been characterized by high default rates that are, in part, due fo moral hazard issues resulting from excessive borrower protection. With its weak and highly concentrated credit portfolio, CEF has been unable to comply with either the new credit provisioning rules or the standard capital adequacy rules. By CEF’s own account, as published in its financial statement for the second quarter of 2000, this has created a total “financial shortfall” of some R%13.8 billion (about 1.2 percent of GDP). CEF has only provisioned some R$6. I billion for its credit portfolio, instead of the RLF17.2 billion that the new credit rule would have required. Also, CEF’s total equity of RU.9 billion at end-June, was lower than the R$6.6 billion that BCB regulations would require for a bank with total assets of R$124.3 billion.’ The financial outlook of the federal banks remains unclear. The BAH-FIPE report projects low operational profits for 2000-02. and negative operational profits after 2002. This reflects, among others, high credit risk of the “developmental” loan portfolio (which represents around 44 percent of total loans of these banks, and also includes the agriculture and housing credits of BB and CEF), holdings of highly illiquid assets, insufficient reserves for bad loans (which amount to about 7.5 percent of total credits), pending lawsuits against the banks, and high operational costs. The report suggests that a major turnaround would be required to put the federal banks back on a financially sound basis, and it argues that this will not happen without significant changes in the operations of the federal banks. The BAH-FIPE report can be viewed as part of the first three steps in a five-step strategy that includes: an assessment of the current situation; the development of alternatives; presentation and public discussion of alternatives; decision on the preferred alternative with further elaboration of the economic and legal framework; and implementation of the preferred alternative. The BAI-I-FIPE report discusses five alternative general approaches for the strategic reorientation of the federal banks: . Retain both the commercial and developmental roles of the federal banks, while attempting to improve the financial performance of each institution. . Retain the commercial and developmental roles of the federal banks but introduce more radical changes, including, among others, eliminating the overlap between institutions, and redesigning the institutional setup. . Retain the developmental role of the federal banks, but not the commercial role; this would be complemented by measures to improve the financial performance, and would involve a partial divesture of the federal banks. . Reduce the direct participation of the state in the financial sector; the state would still have a developmental role but operate through private sector agents, and, more generally, assume a coordinating role. This option would involve the privatization of the various federal banks. . Reduce the participation of the state in the financial sector to regulation and supervision. This option would also involve the privatization of the federal banks. * “Institu@es Financeiras P6blicas Federais-Altemativas Para a Reorienta@ Estrategica; Audi&ncia Pliblica” by Booz- Allen & Hamilton-FIPE, available at hnp://www.fazenda.Rov.br/portugues/audienciapublica/~resenta.htmI. ’ Also see BBA Icatu, “Banking Monthly” of September 29,200O for further detail.

The decision on the appropriate model will be taken after the comprehensive public discussion, currently underway, is concluded. Table 1.

Looking ahead, they agreed with the staff that, within the framework of a continued clean float, the maintenance of an appropriate level of the real exchange rate would be facilitated by a balanced policy mix, with a continued firm fiscal management that would support a gradual further reduction in interest rates, without significant risks to the achievement of the inflation target. 50. The authorities also underlined that further improvements in competitiveness would be brought about by the productivity gains and cost reductions engendered by the substantial investments that were taking place in key sectors such as energy and telecommunications. They were also hopeful that a contribution to improved competitiveness would be made over the medium term by a reduction of distortions in the tax system, in particular the progressive replacement of cascading taxes (nonrebatable to exporters) with a VAT-type federal tax. Trade policy 51. The staff noted that a more rapid pace of reduction of tariffs, especially on imports of capital goods, would facilitate the technological upgrading of domestic capacity in a broad range of sectors-with foreseeable gains in productivity-and, more generally, promote efficiency gains in domestic industries through increased competition. In this respect, the staff noted that, as the largest partner in Mercosur, Brazil should take the lead in promoting a progressive reduction of Mercosur’s common external tariff (CET), beginning with the elimination in 200 1 of the temporary 3 percent surcharge on the CET, introduced in 1997. While agreeing, in principle, with the staffs view on the medium-term benefits of a more open trade policy, the authorities stressed that Brazilian exports (especially of agricultural goods) continued to face substantial barriers from industrial countries, including the United States and the European Union. Therefore, in their view, the desirable dismantling of trade restrictions should take place through broad-based bilateral, regional, and multilateral negotiations. In this respect, they noted that Brazil was actively engaged, within the Mercosur framework, in a range of negotiations with other countries and regional blocs, both within and outside the western hemisphere, as well as being an active participant in multilateral negotiations within the WTO (Box 7). 52. Specifically with respect to intra-Mercosur relations, the authorities recognized that significant tensions had arisen in sensitive sectors, especially affected by the depreciation of the real, but that constructive efforts had been, and continued to be, made by all parties to resolve them through negotiations. The authorities also stressed the importance the government attaches to deepening integration within Mercosur, and to progressively including in it other countries (in particular Chile and Bolivia). It was increasingly recognized by the relevant governments that these objectives required closer macroeconomic policy coordination within the region, and substantial progress had already been made in harmonizing macroeconomic and fiscal statistics, as a step toward the adoption of mutually agreed targets in these areas in 2001.

Trade Policy’ Over the last decade Brazil has pursued a program of reforms that over time has led to substantially more open trade and investment regimes. In particular since 1996, deregulation of state monopolies and prices, investment liberalization and privatization have fostered a market-oriented business environment. Brazil has strengthened its institutional capacity to address trade issues and has pledged to continue to act in accordance with WTO rules and agreements. It has also enhanced legislation and enforcement of intellectual property rights, developed further the insurance sector, and improved sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. Brazil set up an insurance company specialized in export credit insurance in 1997. The Seguradora Brasileira de Credit0 a Exportac~o (SBCE) is a private company established by three Brazilian insurance companies and one foreign specialized company. Within Mercosur, Brazil’s trade policy had been geared toward improving the customs union through the inclusion of new sectors, the progressive consolidation of the Common External Tariff, further harmonization of government procurement policies and technical standards, and deeper coordination of macroeconomic policies. Beyond Mercosur, Brazil aims at establishing, by the end of 2001, a broader economic area within South America-Brazil’s main trading partner-through the conclusion of free trade agreement between Mercosur and the Andean Community. Within the western hemisphere, Brazil is participating in the negotiations to establish the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which are scheduled to be concluded in 2005. Also, Mercosur has started negotiations with the EU with the aim of improving trade relations between the two trade blocks. Brazil’s main trade instrument is the tariff, whose structure and level are largely determined by a program of convergence toward Mercosur’s Common External Tariff (CET). Since 1996, the average MFN (Most Favorite Nation) tariff has increased to 13.7 percent from 12.5 percent. A temporary 3 percentage points increase introduced in 1997 is due to be removed in 2001. Although dispersion has fallen, escalation is still present: Brazil has bound its tariff but mostly at rates higher than applied rates. Closing this gap will further improve predictability. Brazil has simplified import procedures through the implementation of SISCOMEX, a computerized system for customs clearance. Import financing rules were imposed in 1997 but removed in 1999. Still in force are lighthouse fees, applied only to foreign flag vessels, and the Merchant Marine Renewal Tax (AFRMM) on imports transported by sea. Brazil’s import licensing regime has been the subject of consultations between Brazil and some WTO members, and is currently under review. Brazil actively uses contingent, mainly anti-dumping, measures: there are some 46 anti-dumping measures in force. Brazilian products have also been the target of several anti-dumping investigations in foreign markets. Brazil supports negotiations on the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement. Brazil has focused also on export promotion, partly to offset domestic inefficiencies such as still relatively poor infrastructure, high financial intermediation margins, and a cascading tax system. Several export financing programs and export guarantee funds are available including PROEX, an export credit program, some applications of which have been disputed in the WTO. Brazil makes extensive use of fiscal incentives, including tax and duty exemptions for selective activities, notably the automotive sector. ’ Source: Brazil: Trade Policy Review, WTO, September 2000.

Under these assumptions, exports are projected to continue to score further gains in market shares, albeit at a more moderate pace than in 2000; the cyclical recovery of imports in 2000-01 is projected to moderate in subsequent years, and the trade balance to show slowly rising surpluses, both in absolute terms and in relation to GDP. By contrast, the net services and transfers deficit is expected to increase, mainly reflecting higher net factor payments abroad. The current account deficit would increase modestly in absolute value, to under US$27.5 billion through 2003, before beginning to decline thereafter. In relation to GDP, however, the current account deficit would decline steadily, to around 3% percent of GDP by the middle of this decade. Net investment flows are projected to cover almost fully the current account deficit, contributing, together with declining external debt amortization, to a steady reduction of external borrowing requirements over the next several years. The total external debt and debt service would decline both in relation to GDP and, more pronouncedly so, in relation to exports. Coverage of the short-term external debt (on a residual maturity basis) by gross international reserves would also improve. 54. Clearly, this relatively reassuring scenario is subject to vulnerabilities. To help gauge these vulnerabilities, the staff has simulated the impact on Brazil’s current account of a fiscal expansion (a 1 percent per year faster increase in current public expenditure than in the baseline scenario) and of some external shocks (higher U.S. interest rates, and a terms-of trade deterioration) (Figure 1 1).20 The more expansionary fiscal stance and attendant increase in the risk premium on Brazilian paper would be reflected in lower net national savings and higher current account deficits. Higher U.S. interest rates would dampen growth in Brazil through its impact on domestic interest rates. Although both shocks would impact negatively *’ For details on these and other scenarios, see Section X in the Selected Issues Paper.

In the first scenario, Brazil’s external financing requirements, as a share of private savings of the rest of the world, would double by 2010, compared with the baseline. A one percent-a- year loss in the terms of trade, compared with the baseline scenario, would reduce Brazil’s trade surplus by 0.34 percent of GDP on average vis-a-vis the baseline, and would keep the current account deficit above 4 percent of GDP throughout the first half of this decade. E. The Program Under the Stand-By Arrangement 55. The program for the Sixth Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement proposes a set of performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks for the period ahead up to end-December 2000, entailing only rather minor changes compared with the ftih review under the Stand-By Arrangement (Tables 17 and 18). In general, the previous indicative targets for December 2000 were reestimated on the basis of the updated macroeconomic framework, and, where required, established as performance criteria; the structural benchmarks were revised and updated as well. 56. In the fiscal area, the revised macroframework implies a performance criterion for the primary surplus of the consolidated public sector for December 2000 that is slightly lower in nominal terms than the previous indicative target, but, given the revisions in the GDP deflator, slightly higher relative to the projected GDP. Similar adjustments were made to the indicative target for the net debt of the consolidated public sector, which was updated using revised paths for the relevant parameters, such as the accounting exchange rate, the overnight interest rate, privatization receipts, and the recognition of previously unregistered liabilities. 57. In the external area, the previous indicative targets for December 2000 were established as performance criteria without changes, with the exception of the stock of external debt of the nonfinancial public sector, for which the December 2000 ceiling was tightened by US$ 1 billion, reflecting developments in the year to date and the revised plans of the external borrowing sector for the remainder of the year. 58. In the monetary area, the consultation bands for deviations from the central target for the year-end inflation target (6 percent) were retained unaltered; the indicative target for the net domestic assets in the BCB was eliminated after June 2000, as indicated in the fifth review under the program supported under the Stand-By Arrangement.*’ 2’ See EBS/00/82.

In the context of the Article IV consultation, the mission carried out a technical consultation with the authorities, reviewing recent technical assistance from the Fund, and assessing likely future technical assistance needs. The authorities agreed with the staffs general description and overall evaluation of the assistance provided by different Fund departments, as summarized in the report on the technical consultation (Appendix VII), and they expressed their sincere appreciation in this regard. The authorities also stated their interest in continued technical assistance from the Fund, in a number of high-priority areas. These include, among others, social security reform and social security administration, banking supervision, financial sector statistics, national income accounts compilation, and the creation of a producer price index. A more detailed review of future technical assistance needs is provided in Appendix VII. IV. STAFF APPRAISAL 60. The Brazilian economy has continued this year to reap the fruits of the strong macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform efforts undertaken in the wake of the crisis of late 1998-early 1999, which were supported by large-scale short-term official financial assistance, and by a constructive, voluntary involvement of the private sector. GDP recovered quickly in 1999 from the downturn of the latter part of 1998, and has been growing at a rate in excess of 4 percent so far in 2000. Employment has rebounded, and unemployment is steadily declining. Core inflation has remained subdued, and overall inflation in consumer prices is expected to decline by end-2000 to around 6’/2 percent- slightly above the official central target, but well within the official tolerance band-despite significant unanticipated supply shocks. The fiscal performance has remained strong, with the consolidated public sector expected to register a primary surplus for the year of 3.4 percent of GDP. The central bank has gained substantial credibility through its skillful and successful implementation of the inflation targeting framework for monetary policy, and through the conduct of a generally clean float of the exchange rate. 61. To be sure, significant vulnerabilities remain. The authorities are fully conscious of them, and striving to reduce them over time. As many other emerging market countries, the risks to the continuation of sustained, noninflationary growth stem first and foremost from the external environment, especially a hard landing of the U.S. economy, with severe repercussions on the growth of world trade and the flow of foreign financing to emerging markets; or a further escalation of oil prices; or a crisis of market confidence vis-a- vis other important countries, in the region or elsewhere. Brazil is certainly better placed now than before the 1998 crisis to withstand most of the above-mentioned potential shocks, given its enhanced competitiveness, its quite diversified-albeit still too small in relation to the size of its economy- export base; its steadily diminishing dependence on imported oil; the fairly limited reliance of its public sector on foreign financing sources; and the fact that little speculative foreign capital remains in the country. Nevertheless, the still relatively high levels Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-47 - of its current account deficit, overall gross external financing requirements and external debt, as well as the still rather fragile nature of its regained market credibility, suggest that substantial external shocks could impact Brazil strongly, and, if they were to occur, would require a prompt and forceful policy response, in particular a tightening of fiscal and monetary policies, with an inevitable short-term toll on the growth performance of the economy. 62. For the domestic economy, in the staffs view, the main risk is that of an acceleration of domestic demand growth to rates that, given domestic short-term supply constraints, could put significant pressures on prices, and/or the balance of payments. To be sure, there are so far no significant indications of wage pressures, with available information on wage settlements suggesting that they remain moderate; and, as indicated above, the latest price indicators point to a renewed deceleration of inflation, following a temporary spike in July-August. Nevertheless, the high level of capacity utilization, and the acceleration of imports, and of consumer credit in recent months bear watching closely, as they could be leading indicators of emerging excess demand pressures. 63. If the external environment remains relatively benign, and there are no clear indications of excessive demand pressures, the proposed fiscal policy stance for 2001 appears broadly appropriate. The central government budget currently under discussion in congress targets a primary surplus (2.3 percent of projected GDP) broadly similar to that expected for 2000, entailing little, if any, fiscal stimulus. If, however, the external environment were to deteriorate, or if developments in domestic demand were to advise a tighter fiscal stance, the authorities should move quickly to restrict spending commitments below budgetary authorizations. Failure to tighten the fiscal stance would place an undue burden on monetary policy, significantly reducing the scope for a further decline in interest rates, with likely adverse consequences on investment, and the public sector deficit and debt. 64. The proposed budget relies on substantial revenues from the petroleum account which, given the outlook for international oil prices and recent developments in the exchange rate, are unlikely to materialize in the absence of significant further increases in domestic oil prices (although a shortfall in these revenues could be partly offset by a higher primary surplus of the federal oil company Petrobras). Therefore, the staff would urge the authorities to give early consideration to a moderate further increase in domestic oil prices. 65. Significant pressures on expenditures are emerging in the congressional debate of the budget, and also of a result of recent judicial decisions. The staff fully supports the authorities’ efforts to resist these pressures, or at least insist on offsetting cuts in other proposed spending, so as to ensure that the targeted primary surplus for 2001 is indeed maintained in the approved budget. Should these efforts be less than fully successful, the authorities would need to rely on a combination of additional revenue raising measures (such Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-48 - as a steeper increase in domestic oil prices) and underexecution of the proposed budget in lower-priority programs. 66. The outlook for other components of the public sector, namely the state and local governments and the public enterprises, remains favorable for 2001, following a stronger- than-expected performance this year. In this respect, the benefits of the government’s ongoing efforts to ensure adequate budget discipline at the subnational government level are becoming increasingly evident. These efforts have now a strengthened institutional base with the implementation of the fiscal responsibility law, which mandates limits on the payroll spending and the indebtedness of each level of government, and substantially increases the transparency requirements for public entities. 67. To ensure continuing declines in the ratio of the net public sector debt to GDP (a key indicator of intertemporal fiscal sustainability), Brazil will need significant (probably equivalent to over 2 percent of GDP a year) primary surpluses of the consolidated public sector beyond 2001. This underlines the importance of continuing the structural fiscal reform efforts, especially of the social security, the tax system, and the management of public spending and the public debt. Further tangible progress in these areas will promote a further strengthening of market confidence, and help reduce the risk premium on Brazil’s debt, as well as its vulnerability to external shocks. 68. The banking sector as a whole appears fundamentally sound, with relatively low ratios of nonperforming loans and high provision levels. The regulatory framework and banking supervision are steadily improving, and the authorities have made substantial progress in the resolution and restructuring of state banks. They are also working on a strategy to address the remaining significant weaknesses of the federal banks, weaknesses which reflect an inappropriate use of these banks as instruments of public policy in past decades. The staff urges the authorities to conclude this work as soon as feasible, with a view to begin implementing this strategy in 2001. The staff welcomes the authorities’ cooperation with the Fund and the World Bank in assessing compliance with Base1 Core Principles, and, more generally, in identifying needs for financial sector reforms, as well as in designing and implementing such reforms, and recommends that they undertake a full FSAP at the earliest convenient date. 69. Further progress in other structural reforms, including the development of capital markets, the labor market legislation, and a more rapid pace of reduction of tariff and nontariff barriers to external trade, within the Mercosur framework, would be instrumental, in the staffs view, in enhancing productivity and competitiveness and, therefore, the growth potential of the Brazilian economy over the medium term. 70. Progress in the implementation of the government’s privatization program has slowed down in recent months, partly for reasons beyond the government’s control. This has been reflected in the nonobservance of some structural benchmarks in the program. The staff supports the authorities’ request to reschedule these benchmarks, as outlined in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - Table 18 of the report, and urges them to make every effort to ensure that no further slippages occur. 71. As the authorities noted, it is also important to ensure that the benefits of the macroeconomic and structural adjustment effort be more equitably distributed in the years ahead. This will help broaden the constituency for responsible macroeconomic management and for further structural reforms, thereby promoting their sustainability over time. Significant progress has been mad.e in a number of social indicators, especially in the education and poverty alleviation areas, in recent years. This has reflected, inter alia, the government’s efforts to give priority to, and safeguard from cuts, spending on primary education, basic health care and other core social programs, as well as to improve the efficiency of spending in these areas. Social spending (especially on health) is targeted to increase significantly in relation to GDP in the proposed federal budget for 2001, and the government is continuing its efforts to better target such spending and increase its cost- effectiveness, (as well as improve its regional distribution) inter alia, by introducing explicit indicators of results in the monitoring and future allocation of resources to social programs. The staff welcomes these developments. 72. Brazil’s statistical base is generally adequate for surveillance. The authorities have made substantial progress toward meeting the requirements of the SDDS, to which they aim to subscribe by end-2000. Further improvements in the national accounts statistics-in particular the compilation of quarterly accounts on the demand side-remain a short-term priority, which is expected to be fulfilled in 200 1. 73. In summary, Brazil has continued to perform strongly under the program supported under the Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund, meeting to date all the quantitative performance criteria, most of the indicative targets, and a number of the structural benchmarks under the Stand-By Arrangement. The overall stance of macroeconomic policies remains appropriate, and the staff is confident that, as demonstrated on previous occasions, the authorities would modify policies quickly and appropriately in response to adverse external or domestic shocks. The staff also trusts that the authorities will make best efforts to speed up the implementation of their structural reform and privatization programs. Accordingly, the staff recommends the completion of the Sixth Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement. It also recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Brazil take place on the standard 1Zmonth cycle.

In 1999, the Brazilian economy showed far greater than expected resilience to the crisis it experienced in the aftermath of the Russian crisis in August 1998. GDP began already in the first quarter of 1999 to recover from the 2’% percent decline it had recorded in the second half of 1998, and for the year as a whole grew by 0.8 percent on average, accelerating markedly in the fourth quarter. Economic growth was mainly supported by import substitution, in the wake of a sharp real depreciation of the real, after the currency was floated in mid-January 1999. Export volumes rose on average by 7.7 percent, but at an accelerating pace through the year, increasing by nearly 23 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter in 1998. The recovery of output was reflected in increased labor market participation and employment, both of which grew by 2.5 percent in the course of 1999; as a result, the average unemployment rate in 1999 remained unchanged at 7.6 percent, although in the second half of 1999 it was already slightly lower than in the second half of 1998. The recovery of employment was helped by average real wages declining by 8 percent in the year through December 1999. 2. 1999 saw a major fiscal adjustment effort. The primary balance of the consolidated public sector moved from equilibrium in 1998 to a surplus equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP. This reflected improved performances at all levels of government, but particularly for the federal government, whose primary surplus strengthened by 1.8 percent of GDP, due to a strong increase in tax revenues and a sizable decline in expenditures. These fiscal improvements were accompanied by advances in important structural reforms, including the reform of the social security system for private sector workers, and strong privatization efforts. 3. Inflation in 1999 reflected substantial changes in the relative prices of tradable and nontradable goods.’ The general price index (IGP-DI), in which tradables have a large weight, rose by 20.0 percent in the course of the year, while the consumer price index (IPCA), in which nontradables have a larger weight, rose by 8.9 percent. The increase in the IPCA, which is also used for the inflation targeting framework, exceeded the official central target of 8 percent by less than 1 percentage point, remaining well within the tolerance band of *2 percentage points around the target. 4. The substantial improvements in the real trade balance more than offset a large (13 percent) loss in the terms of trade that reflected in part weaknesses in prices of export commodities, and the sharp increase in oil prices. Brazil’s current account deficit declined from US$33.6 billion in 1998 to US$25.1 billion in 1999; in relation to GDP, the deficit rose ’ See Section V of the Selected Issues Paper for an updated analysis of the passthrough from the depreciation of the real to wholesale and consumer prices. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 73 - APPENDIX I from 4.3 percent in 1998 to 4.7 percent in 1999, reflecting the sharp decline of GDP in U.S. dollar terms. The improvement in the current account deficit was largely due to the decline in the trade deficit from US$6.6 billion in 1998 to US$l.2 billion in 1999, but was also helped by improvements in nonfactor services, especially tourism, and net profit and dividend remittances, which had been boosted in 1998 by uncertainties about the exchange rate. The 1999 current account deficit was more than financed by net foreign direct investment, which reached a record level of US$30 billion (5.7 percent of GDP), notwithstanding some slowdown in the pace of privatization. 5. Net international reserves (NIR) declined by US$10.5 billion in the course of 1999 to US$23.9 billion at end-December 1999. Gross international reserves at end-1999 stood at US$35.7 billion, equivalent to 7.4 months of imports, and 49.1 percent of short-term debt on a residual maturity basis. After an initial overshooting that followed the floating of the real, the exchange rate strengthened through May 1999, and then weakened again during June- October 1999, largely on market concerns on economic reform prospects. It began to rebound in November, with a strengthened export performance, improved market perceptions about the sustainability of the fiscal adjustment, and a tighter monetary policy. At end-1999, the real stood at R$1.79 per U.S. dollar, which amounted to a nominal depreciation of about one-third relative to end-1998. In the second half of 1999, the central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market on only a few occasions and with small amounts, apart from addressing liquidity issues in the context of Y2K concerns. B. Export and Import Performance in 2000 6. Brazilian exports grew by 18.2 percent in value terms in the first nine months of 2000 compared to the same period in 1999;* despite depressed international prices, the export performance was supported by strong volume increases (Table Al .2). The export price index improved by only 2.6 percent, because of depressed commodities prices, whereas the volume index of Brazilian exports increased by 14.4 percent. Exports of manufactured goods posted the largest (volume) increase-23.9 percent -reflecting the progressive shift of Brazilian exports toward higher value-added products, and enhanced competitiveness as a result of the flexible exchange rate regime and increased investments. Export volumes of semi- manufactured goods, however, fell by 3.7 percent in the period January-September owing to low sales of soybean oil and sugar, some domestic transport disruptions, and capacity constraints in the paper and cellulose sector. Exports of basic goods grew by 9.8 percent, in particular in the meat and mining sectors. 7. With regard to the destination of Brazilian exports (Table Al .3), the most buoyant markets were Mexico, Switzerland, and Australia, with growth rates in excess of 80 percent. Exports to Latin American countries in general grew substantially (about 27 percent overall * See EBS/00/82 for an account of export performance in the aftermath of the floating of the real in January 1999. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 74 - APPENDIX I including Mexico, and 18.8 percent to Mercosur) as did exports to the U.S. (over 21 percent). Since the floating of the real, Brazilian exports-have faced increased scrutiny by other cowtries with regard to state subsidies to key export sectors, including the aircraft industry. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has recently upheld Canada’s complaint against Brazil for irregular subsidies to Embraer. The ruling will allow Canada to impose some US$l.3 billion in trade sanctions against Brazil or obtain trade benefits until 2005 to compensate for sales Bombardier, the Canadian regional jet maker, lost to Embraer, its Brazilian competitor. Also, Argentina has adopted anti-dumping measures against Brazil’s poultry exports, potentially triggering a Brazilian complaint to the WTO. 8. Over the period January-September 2000, imports grew by 13.6 percent in value terms with respect to the same period in 1999 (Table Al .2). The increase in imports was due almost entirely to higher volumes. The import price index was flat, reflecting a 94 percent increase in fuel prices and decreases in all other import categories. Import volumes rose by about 12.5 percent, with intermediate goods showing the only, but large, positive variation- 3 1 percent-among all categories. Imports of intermediate goods have increased to satisfy higher demand in both domestic and export sectors-in particular manufacturing. Imports of consumer goods, both durables and nondurables, and capital goods declined rather homogeneously across individual categories through the first half of the year, but have begun to pick up in the more recent months. 9. Imports from Latin American countries increased by about 28 percent, in particular reflecting higher fuel imports. Imports from Asia grew by 32.6 percent, on account of stronger demand for electronic goods, and those from Eastern Europe and the Middle East- mainly imports of oil products and fertilizers- rose by 57 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Imports from the European Union fell by about 6 percent, in particular those of capital goods, which, by contrast, accounted for most the 9.2 percent increase in imports from the U.S. (Table Al .3).

C. The Evolution of the INSS Deficit in 2000 10. The finances of the Social Security System for private sector workers (INSS) have posted a marked improvement in the first nine months of this year, compared to the same period in 1999. Several factors explain the improvement. 11. Current contributions have grown strongly so far this year, establishing consecutive monthly records during May-August, mainly on account of a substantial increase in formal employment, with around 775,000 new jobs having been created just in the formal sector of the economy in the year through September. Similarly, many of the measures taken recently to close legal loopholes and enlarge the base of contributions have also helped to strengthen revenue. Furthermore, managerial and operational improvements have led to a sizable recovery of contribution arrears during the first seven months of the year. Initiatives to bring back into the contribution base delinquent taxpayers-such as the REFLY program, which allows those delinquent taxpayers that start making current contributions on time, to pay Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 76 - APPENDIX I down their old stock of arrears based on a fixed proportion of current revenues-have had a positive impact on the flow of current revenues tid the stock of contribution arrears. Finally, the recently concluded debt renegotiations between the Treasury and around 180 municipalities has caused municipalities with contribution arrears to become current with their social security levies, thereby improving the current flow of contributions. 12. At the same time, benefit expenditures have been growing in nominal terms, but below the nominal expansion of GDP. This reflects the combined effects of the social security constitutional reform approved in late 1998; stricter audits on the concession of new benefits; and the initial, albeit small, impact of the actuarial coefficient (AC) which introduced actuarial criteria into the calculation of the retirement benefit, such as the length of contributive history and life expectancy at the retirement date. The introduction of the AC in December 1999 reduced the benefit value for those opting for earlier retirement, and may have led to some postponements of the decision to retire. These improvements happened against the background of a 5.1 percent real increase in the minimum benefit payment in April 2000 and a 5.8 percent nominal increase of all other benefits above the minimum in June, i.e., in line with past inflation. 13. Reflecting these developments, the INSS deficit amounted to R$5.9 billion during the first nine months of 2000,7.4 percent lower in real terms than the deficit posted during the same period of 1999 (see Table Al. 1 and FigureA 1.1). Current projections for the year 2000 point to a deficit below the 1 percent of GDP observed during 1999 (see Figure Al .2), with the possibility of even lower deficits as a percentage of GDP in the medium term (see Appendix II on Social Security Reform).

Recent Developments in Social Policies: The Alvoruda Program3 With a score of 0.74 in the UNDP’s human development index (HDI) in 1999, Brazil is among those countries with medium human development.4 However, the national average hides sizable differentials in human development indicators across regions (Figure Al .3).5 While all regions experienced an upward trend in their HDI scores since 1980, those with Figure A1.3.

Inequality in human development also exists within the states, where some poorer municipalities have lagged behind the regions with higher HDI scores in the states where they are located. 14. There has been growing recognition that these positive trends in human development, as well as a faster catch-up for the laggards across and within the states, can only be sustained through a concerted policy effort. With the exception of cash transfers such as 3 Also see Section III of the Selected Issues paper. 4 Among Latin American countries, Brazil’s HDI score is comparable to that of Peru (0.74) but is lower than those of Chile (0.84), Argentina (0.83), and Uruguay (0.83), for instance. See the UNDP’s 1999 World Development Report, for more information. ’ The HDI scores for 1999 are not strictly comparable with earlier ones, because of a change in methodology in 1997. Under the old methodology, Brazil scored 0.83 in 1996, against 0.73 in 1980. In 1996, the scores of more developed states like Rio Grande do Sul and S2o Paul0 (0.87 each) came close to the industrial country average (0.91). Less developed states like MaranhGo (0.55) and Piaui (0.53) fared poorly, with HDI scores below the developing country average (0.58). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 79 - APPENDIX I pensions and unemployment insurance, for instance, most existing social programs in Brazil are not designed to address these regional inequalities in human development. Regional development programs often benefit regions that are considered poor within the state where they are located, rather than relative to a national poverty benchmark. As a result, poorer regions in richer states often benefit from these programs although they may be more prosperous than richer regions in poorer states. Past experiences-the creation of regional development agencies and banks, for instance -have been largely unsuccessful in dealing with regional inequalities in human and economic development. 15. The Ahorada Program was originally named IDH-14 Program, given its focus on the 14 states with HDI scores below the national median6 The program was subsequently enlarged to benefit poorer regions within richer states that would not be eligible for assistance under the IDH-14 program.’ The Alvorada Program consists essentially of focusing social policies and public outlays on existing social programs in these states and regions (Table Al .2). The priority programs are in the areas of preventive health care, basic education, and income support. A large share of spending on priority programs will be devoted to infrastructure development, including sanitation. Funding for these programs has been scarce in light of the ongoing consolidation of fiscal adjustment since late-1998. 16. Most financing needs will be met by the federal budget (R$7.4 billion out of the total estimated budget of R$l3.3 billion between 2000-02). A large share of total financing (R$5.0 billion) is already programmed in the multiyear budget framework (PPA). Additional funding will come from Poverty Fund resources in 2001-02. Subnational governments will also contribute, particularly in counterpart funds for foreign-financed projects.8 Enlargement of the original IDH-14 Programs will cost the federal government another R$0.2 billion between 2000-02, in addition to the R$0.9 billion already programmed in the PPA. 6 These states are: Acre, Alagoas, Bahia, CearB, MaranhZio, Par& Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Rondonia, Roraima, Sergipe, Tocantins. About 3 1 million people, living in 186 microregions and 1,797 municipalities, would benefit from the program in these states. 7 The additional states are Amazonas, Amap6, Espirito Santo, Goias, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul and Sgo Paulo. These states have HDI scores above the national median but, nevertheless, contain 8 1 microregions and 389 municipalities with I-ID1 scores below the national median. Extension of the IDH- 14 program to these microregions will benefit an additional 5 million people. ’ The subnational share in financing may be underestimated in the case of health care because of the recent institutional changes requiring the states and municipalities to earmark1 2 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of their revenues (net of intergovernmental transfers) to finance outlays on health care.

These targets are defined in terms of output indicators such as coverage of the sanitation and water network, school enrollment rates, and a number of beneficiaries of income support programs. The impact of these programs on the relevant social and human development indicators is to be more closely monitored than in the past, and the authorities have approached the World Bank and the IDB for assistance in this respect.

Social security reform in Brazil has focused mainly on the social security system for private sector workers (RGPS). The combined effects of the constitutional reform of 1998, several initiatives to broaden the contribution base, the approval of the actuarial coeficient (4 C) in November 1999, and managerial and operational improvements, have helped to make the system sustainable.’ The annual deficit of the RGPS amounts to around 1 percent of GDP2 and assuming real GDP growth of 4 percent per year is likely to remain below 1 percent of GDP during this decade, even assuming the current average retirement age of 52 years and 33 years of contributive history (‘AC; 52-33” in the charts below). Moreover, since the AC provides incentives for delaying retirement, the average retirement age is likely to increase, which would cause the deficit to remain below 1 percent of GDP throughout the end of this decade even under a more conservative assumption of real GDP growth (see chart, line AC, 54-35). With higher real GDP growth and the retirement-delaying inducement effects of the AC (average retirement age of 60 years) the deficit could even turn into a small surplus in the near term (reverting, however, to a deficit in the long rurQ3. 2. The relatively favorable outlook would even allow benefit payments to grow moderately in real terms, without deteriorating or inverting the medium-term declining trend, if accompanied by efforts to increase formal employment and reduce the exemptions and preferential treatments currently granted to particular sectors and groups. In contrast to the RGPS, the problems of the pension system for public sector workers remain to be addressed. While the deficit of around 4 percent of GDP in 1999, including the federal, state, and municipal governments, is not getting larger, reforming the RJU remains a priority on fiscal, equity, and efficiency grounds, 4. A solution to the large RJU imbalance should address both stock and flow problems. The stock problem-encompassing the current stock of retirees and working civil servants- could be addressed by a three-pronged strategy: increasing the contribution rates on active civil servants and the military; imposing contribution rates on retired civil servants (which was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in September 1999, but where a constitutional amendment allowing for such levies is currently under review in congress); and the creation of dedicated asset funds to finance future pension payments. The flow problem of new workers entering the public sector could be addressed by hiring new civil servants under the rules of the RGPS, as provided for by the administrative reform law. This would cap monthly pension payments, currently at R$1,328 (around US$700), and the AC would also apply. To complement the retirement benefit under the RGPS ceiling, public employees could, voluntarily, contribute to a defined-contribution complementary pension ’ For details see Appendix II of EBS/99/205 of November 15,1999. ’ This includes various social assistance benefits, which are many times paid out of the general budget. 3 World Bank Report 19461 -BR (June 19,200O) “Brazil: Critical hues in Social Security.” Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 82 - APPENDIX II -- Brazil: RGPS Deficit Simulation (percent GDP) I Brazil: RGPS Deficit Simulation (percent GDP) I Real GDP growth of 3.5 percent, 2001-20 20 I ! -Baseline: no reform 6 AC; 52-33 e AC; 54-35 source SPWAS Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 83 - APPENDIX II plan. Legislation in this regard is pending in congress. The proposed legislation stipulates that publicly-sponsored complementary pension. plans should observe: a maximum ratio of employer to employee contributions of 1: 1; an expected maximum combined benefit (RGPS plus complementary pension) equal to 100 percent of the worker’s final year salary; and stricter guidelines for investing the funds under their management. 5. Also, the recently approved Fiscal Responsibility Law should help address the imbalances of the RJUs of the state and municipal governments over the medium- to long- run since it mandates: more transparency regarding actuarial liabilities; periodic actuarial evaluations of the current systems; stricter regulations for state and municipal asset funds; immediate identification of offsetting sources of revenues each time new exemptions and subsidies are granted, or benefits are increased in real terms; and stricter limits for personnel expenditures (wages and pensions) as a percentage of net revenues. 6. However, hiring all new entrants into the civil service under the general RGPS rules that apply to private sector workers would also have an immediate negative fiscal impact, since under the RGPS rules, employees would only contribute 11 percent up to the ceiling of the INSS (while in the RJU they will contribute 11 percent of the entire wage) and the government would, in addition, have to contribute 8 percent to the workers’ severance pay fund (FGTS). States and municipalities would also have to transfer the 22 percent employer contribution to the federally-run RGPS. Nevertheless, these extra fiscal costs during the working life of civil servants would be more than compensated by lower benefit disbursements during their retirement. Projections for the federal government (only for the civil servants of the executive branch) show that the current deficit of around 1.2 percent of GDP would be broadly stable until 2010, drop to around 0.6 percent of GDP in 2030, and practically vanish around 2060, assuming an increase of real wages of 1.5 percent per year. Alternative scenarios for the deficit assuming no real wage increase and with a 3 percent real wage increase are plotted below.

Exchange Rate Arrangement On July 1, 1994 the Brazilian authorities introduced a new currency, the real, with a floating exchange rate subject to a floor of parity with the U.S. dollar. On March 6, 1995 the authorities adopted a system of adjustable exchange rate bands consisting of a wider band (adjusted once a year) and a more narrow band (adjusted several times a month). The operational band was the miniband until January 12, 1999, and the maxiband thereafter. On January 12,1999 the miniband was R$1.1975-R$1.2115 per U.S. dollar. On January 13, 1999 the miniband was abolished and the exchange rate was allowed to fluctuate within the wider band (maxiband). Also on January 13,1999, the maxiband was widened from R$l .12- R$1.22 per U.S. dollar (established on January 20, 1998) to R$1.20-R$1.32 per U.S. dollar. On January 15, 1999, the wider band was also abolished and the red left to float for the day. On January 18,1999, the floating of the real was confirmed as the new foreign exchange regime. Through November 1999, Brazil continued to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, although it no longer maintained restrictions under this Article. The dual exchange rate arrangement-consisting of an official (or “commercial”) market for most current and capital transactions and of a “fluctuating” market for tourism, some nontrade related services, private unilateral transfers and nonregistered capital account operations- was eliminated as of February 1, 1999. Still, two issues-the rate of the financial operations tax (IOF) on exchange operations carried out in relation to credit card purchases abroad by residents, and the requirement that importers enter into forward FX contracts for the payment of imports financed under certain conditions-had been giving rise to restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. With a letter dated November 11, 1999, the Brazilian authorities informed the Fund that they had decided to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, effective November 30, 1999. Subsequently, they abolished, as of October 30, 1999, the requirement for importers mentioned above; the other remaining restriction was removed on February 1,2000, when the IOF rate on exchange operations carried out in relation to credit card purchases abroad by residents was lowered to 2 percent. VIII. Last Article IV Consultation The last Article IV consultation with Brazil was concluded by the Executive Board on July 28, 1999 (EBS/99/115). Brazil is on the standard 12-month cycle. IX. Technical Assistance in 1998-00 The F&al Affairs Department (FAD), in September 1998, provided technical assistance to Brazil on estimating the extent of evasion of social security contributions and improving the collection of social security contributions. A mission from FAD, with the participation of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 86- APPENDIX III World Bank staff; visited BraziI in January 1999 to provide technical assistance for complementary social security reforms. In February 1999 FAD provided technical assistance on social safety nets while participating in the area department mission; FAD staff also did follow-up work in the same area while participating in area department missions in March 2000 and July/August 2000. Brazil has also received technical assistance from FAD on reforming the social security administration through various visits by an FAD staff member. The Brazilian authorities have a good track record in implementing technical assistance recommendations in the fiscal area. A mission from the Sfatistics Department @TA) visited Brazil in March 1998 to provide technical assistance on money and banking statistics. A follow-up mission visited Brazil in May 1999, as part of the STA multisector statistics mission. Brazil is working towards the subscription to the SDDS as soon as technically feasible, and a multisector mission from STA visited Brazil in May 1999 to advise on the status of the statistical system vis-a-vis the SDDS requirements. The mission conducted a detailed evaluation of Brazil’s economic statistics, examined the legal and institutional framework for compiling and disseminating statistics, and assessed Brazil’s data dissemination practices. A mission to assess progress toward the SDDS subscription and to continue the ongoing work with the BCB in strengthening the compilation of money and banking statistics visited Brazil in March-April 2000; another mission to assess progress in the compilation of quarterly GDP estimates and to discuss a work program for the implementation of a producer price index visited Brazil in April 2000. In the context of Fund surveillance, a mission from the Legal Department (LEG) and the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department (MAE) visited Brazil in October 1999 to review exchange regulations and discuss issues related to Brazil’s acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. As mentioned above, Brazil consequently accepted, effective November 30, 1999, the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and abolished the two remaining restrictions that were identified. Two missions from MAE visited Brazil in January and February 2000, respectively, to assess compliance with the Base1 Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, and to assess the observance of the Code of Good Practices and Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies (Code). The former mission was carried out jointly with the World Bank.

The latest Brazil Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to the Bank’s Board on March 30. At the same time, two special adjustment operations were approved, the Social Security Reform II S/SECAL (US$500 million plus 1 percent) and the Fiscal and Administrative Reform S/SECAL (US$500 million plus 1 percent) both single tranche operations, and, following Brazilian Senate approval, were fully disbursed on June 30. A follow-up Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan may be presented to the World Bank Board toward the beginning of CY 200 1. This operation could be complemented by a Technical Assistance Operation covering budget, financial and debt management reforms, as well as by a Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loan covering banking and corporate reforms and also accompanied by Technical Assistance support in these areas. The World Bank has also continued with its investment lending program, both through approval of new loans, and equally importantly, implementation of existing operations. New operations approved by the Board in the World Bank’s FY 2000 include the following (no loans were yet approved in FY200 1 through November 1,200O): Prosanear 2 Energy Efficiency Cearh Water Resource Management National Environment Project 2 INSS Reform LIL NE Microfmance Development US%30.3 million US$43.4 million US$136.0 million LJS$l5.0 million US$5.0 million US$50.0 million In the analytic and advisory services area, the World Bank has continued to cooperate with the Brazilian Federal Treasury and the BCB in the area of public debt management, and with the Ministry of Social Security on various aspects of social security reform. The Bank has recently completed a draft study of urban poverty issues based on analysis of recent survey data, another study on the impact of the economic crisis on the poor, and the effectiveness of alternative government social protection policies. Work has been completed for studies of rural poverty, fiscal issues covering fiscal sustainability, federal expenditures, tax reform issues, and budget institutions, and three State Economic Memoranda on growth and poverty reduction in the states of Bahia, Cearh, and Pemambuco.

Both of the loans approved in 1999 have a repayment period of five years and a grace period of three years. The interest rate is LIBOR + 400 basis points and a 0.75 percent commitment fee and a single service charge of 1 percent applies. There is no national counterpart requirement. The basic features of each operation are described below: Sectoral loan for social protection and reform This program includes support for programs currently being implemented and is aimed at improving the efficiency and targeting of social spending-programs which constitute Brazil’s social safety net-as well as funding for new reforms in health, education, labor, and social welfare. The conditionality of the tranches is based on the continued satisfactory execution (material and financial) of the selected programs, and on progress in implementing social policy. This program receives partial funding from the World Bank. After an extended analysis by its Social Affairs Committee, the Federal Senate approved this loan in October 1999. The contract was signed on November 5, 1999 and disbursement of the first tranche (US$l .122 billion) took place immediately after. The second tranche (US$660 million) was disbursed on April 2000. The third and last tranche (US$418 million) is scheduled for disbursement during the last quarter of 2000. ’ Prepared by the staff of the IDB. Reflects information as of mid-August 2000.

The loan contract for this program was signed on July 28, 1999 and as of end-August 2000, US$SS 1.2 million had been disbursed. Existing investment program and activities The ongoing lending program of the IDB in Brazil consists of 54 loans, with a total committed value of US$13,330.5 million, including the two emergency loans. There are also 62 technical assistance projects, with a total budget of US$74.9 million; 22 microprojects (with associated technical assistance) totaling US$10.9 million, and 14 operations of the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) for US$27.3 million (including a capital support of US$8 million). The IDB’s strategy in Brazil comprises four areas for action: (1) public sector reform and modemization of government at all levels; (2) opening up the economy and modemization of the productive sectors, and reduction of Brazil cost; (3) poverty reduction and provision of basic social needs; and (4) the environment and natural resources. The basic sectoral composition of the lending program is set out below, in accordance with the four strategic areas. It should be noted that the majority of the programs contribute to progress in more than one of the strategic areas.

A mission by the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) in March-April 2000 assessed progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Multisector Statistics Mission (MSM) of May 1999, and reviewed and updated the metadata and action plan of the Brazilian authorities in anticipation of Brazil’s subscription to the SDDS. In general, Brazil’s statistical base is broadly adequate for surveillance. Nevertheless, weaknesses in some areas hamper policy analysis and formulation. In particular, the national accounts suffer from inadequate data on the aggregate demand components. The quality and timeliness of public sector statistics outside the federal government need to be improved. Although statistics on money and banking, balance of payments, and external debt are generally good, the classification of data, particularly on money and banking, and the balance of payments, need to be improved. National Accounts The Brazilian authorities compile national accounts in accordance with the &stem of National Accounts recommendations from 1993 (SNA 2993). The annual GDP estimates are generated from supply and use tables, which ensures that the estimates are consistent. A main problem of these estimates is a lack of basic time series data, which requires compilers to rely extensively on extrapolation techniques using levels from the 1985 base year, the last year for which economic censuses were conducted. With these data, there is a strong possibility of price assessment errors due to the high inflation that prevailed until mid-l 994, that may affect the accuracy of current-price GDP estimates. Quarterly estimates of GDP (both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted), are compiled in constant prices using the production method with estimates disaggregated by sector of origin; these estimates are not fully consistent with the annual GDP estimates from the national accounts. The authorities have published annual national accounts through 1999, and these are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS). A mission by STA in April 2000 assessed progress in improving the compilation of quarterly estimates of GDP; in October 2000, the National Institute of Statistics (IBGE) published, for the first time, nominal GDP on a quarterly basis. Prices There is no official consumer price index (CPI). The IBGE, the private Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), and the University of Sao Paulo all prepare their own consumer price indices with a different coverage of regions and population groups. The CPIs produced by the IBGE-the National Consumer Price Index (INPC) and the Expanded Consumer Price Index (IPCA)--use the same methodology but cover different income groups in 11 major metropolitan areas. The weights of both indices have been updated in August 1999 on the basis of the 1995-96 household survey. The IPCA has the broadest geographical and population coverage; this index is used by the BCB for the purpose of inflation targeting. Wholesale price inflation data are published only by the FGV. Wholesale and consumer price indices are reported regularly for the IFS. The export price data reported for the KS are total unit values of exports and unit values and wholesale prices of coffee exports.

A follow-up mission is planned for November 2000. Government Finance Statistics Data on public sector operations suffer from problems of coverage and timeliness, which diminish their usefulness for surveillance. Summary data on revenue and expenditure of the national treasury are reported regularly for publication in the IFS, albeit with some delay. However, no details on the financing of government operations have been reported. Data on Brazil’s government finance statistics for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are provided with a lag of 2-3 years. Monetary and Financial Sector Data STA’s May 1999 MSM found that recommendations of an earlier mission in 1998 had been implemented only partially due to a shortage of human resources. The mission also found that some problems remained in the sectorization of certain financial system accounts, which undermined the accuracy of the monetary aggregates and the consistency with external and fiscal accounts. The mission agreed with the authorities on an action plan to improve the monetary accounts classification by sector and by instrument. The mission also highlighted the importance of expanding the coverage of banking survey data to include financial investment funds and cooperatives, and to expand the coverage of the financial survey to include supplementary pension funds and insurance companies. The authorities are currently reviewing the national definitions of different monetary aggregates. A mission by STA that visited Brazil in March-April 2000 followed up on implementation of the recommendations of the May 1999 MSM, and advanced the ongoing work with the BCB to improve the sources of information and methodology used in compiling monetary and financial statistics. The mission also conducted a training seminar for BCB staff on the main aspects of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFShf). Balance of Payments The balance of payments compiled and published by the authorities presents methodological and classification discrepancies as compared with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPMS). STA’s May 1999 MSM formulated a set of recommendations to improve the quality and timeliness of balance of payments statistics. Some of the recommendations to be implemented immediately have already been implemented. Main recommendations that are still to be implemented include: the adjustment of international reserves data to exclude external assets that are not readily available for use in case of balance of payments need; the exclusion of claims against residents (holdings of Brady bonds issued by the government) from the international reserves data; the use of market prices instead of face values for the recording debt conversions undertaken by Brazil in 1997 and 1999; and the introduction of accrual accounting for interest on foreign assets and liabilities of the BCB. The mission also recommended the overall revision of the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 94 - APPENDIX VI classification of transactions in the exchange record to bring them closer to the standard components of the BPM5. Most of the recommendations of the May 1999 MSM still remain to be fully implemented. For example, some of the historical problems of double counting in the transportation sector are being investigated, and will be eliminated beginning with the release of final data for 1999. The questionnaire on a transport survey has been prepared, and the survey is expected to be conducted in the second half of 2000. For international reserves, valuation adjustments arising from exchange rate changes are now excluded from reserves, and monetary gold is valued at the London market price on the day of the transaction. Brazil does not compile data on the international investment position (IIP); however, work has been started in compiling data in this regard. Quarterly balance of payments data are reported regularly for publication in the IFS, albeit with considerable delay. Statistical Benchmarks The current review under the SBA includes various statistical benchmarks through the end of this year; these were originally established on the basis of the recommendations of STA’s May 1999 MSM. These benchmarks aim at helping Brazil to subscribe to the SDDS. The list will be reassessed and amended as necessary during future reviews of the program.

OVERVIEW This technical consultation note was prepared for the technical consultation with Brazil that took place in the context of the 2000 Article IV consultations in July-August 2000. The note includes a factual summary of recent technical assistance (TA) activities, a brief assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of the TA provided, and a summary of future TA needs, as discussed with the Brazilian authorities. II. RECENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY FUNCTIONAL DEPARTMENTS A. Fiscal Affairs Department The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) has provided technical assistance to the Brazilian authorities on an ongoing basis, through short-term missions on specific fiscal issues. In recent years, assistance has focused on the public pension system and on tax policy and administration, Ten missions have been fielded in the last three years; the recommendations have generally been well received by the authorities, and implementation of reforms based on programs and strategies proposed by FAD missions has been generally successful. Social security reform The first FAD TA mission to Brazil in the area of social security took place in mid-1992. The mission provided a broad assessment of the existing systems for private and public sector workers, identified a number of problems, and made recommendations for reform. After several attempts at reform, measures taken in late 1998 and early 1999 have helped contain the large financial imbalances of the system and narrow inequities. Another FAD mission in January 1999, in which a World Bank staff member participated, recommended a number of further steps to strengthen reform efforts, including levying a contribution on private sector pensions; phasing-in a minimum retirement age for old-age benefits; eliminating eligibility based on length-of-contribution period; and eliminating the last monthly wage for computing. pension benefit for government retirees. Bills incorporating some of these recommendations-the proposed laws on complementary pension funds, and a constitutional amendment introducing a social security contribution for retired civil servants-are now before the congress. ’ Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department, based on inputs received from the Fiscal Affairs, Monetary and Exchange Affairs, Legal, Policy Development and Review, and Statistics Departments, and as discussed with the Brazilian authorities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 97 - APPENDIX VII Social security tax administration A mission from FAD in September 1998 conducted an assessment of revenue administration of the social security system. The mission recommended a number of measures to curb widespread evasion, including tightening audits, targeting enforcement to large taxpayers, strengthening the National Institute of Social Security (INSS), and developing a strategy for implementation of new computerized systems. Subsequent staff visits (December 1998, April and October 1999) provided follow-up advice on the mission’s recommendations related to organizational changes and information systems, which are being implemented by the authorities. Tax policy In early 1992, a mission from FAD advised the authorities on a comprehensive tax reform, aimed at modemizing and simplifying the system of indirect taxation. Assistance was also provided on more specific tax issues: reform of enterprise profits taxation in May 1995; treatment of nonperforming bank loans in June 1996; and taxation of remittances abroad in July 1997. In January 1998, a mission provided further advice on indirect taxation and made a proposal to consolidate and streamline the indirect federal and state taxes into a federal VAT (with only one or two rates and a few exemptions), with revenue to be shared by the two levels of government. The VAT would be complemented by a local retail sales tax, with a low rate, and by selected excises at the federal and state levels; the local retail sales tax would replace an existing municipal tax on services. Follow-up visits took place in March and May 1998. In late 1998, the authorities announced their intention to move forward with a comprehensive reform of the system of indirect taxation. In addition, legal changes were introduced that aimed at reducing the scope for tax avoidance and limiting revenue losses resulting from excessive litigation by taxpayers. State-level resistance initially slowed progress with the tax reform initiative. However, in 1999, congress took the lead and produced a draft proposal for a comprehensive reform of the current indirect tax system. With strong objections to the original text by the government and some states, a tripartite proposal aimed at harmonizing the state VATS across the nation was drafted earlier this year by representatives of the federal government, congress, and the states. Progress was however hindered by resistances of the business community that wanted to see the principle of noncascading social contributions anchored in the federal constitution. The government, fearing inordinate litigation and substantial losses of revenue in the short term, would like to see this principle spelled out in ordinary legislation, and to benefit from a transition period of at least five years. Further progress in this area will require a number of political issues and concerns to be resolved first. Tax administration Between 1992 and 1995, FAD fielded several missions in tax administration. Advice focused on defining a comprehensive strategy for strengthening tax administration and improving Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-98 - APPENDIX VII audit and collection procedures. The most recent missions followed up ‘on the same subjects (Strengthening of Federal Tax Administration, June 1995; Further Recommendations for Improving Tax Administration, April 1996). Most FAD recommendations in this area have been implemented. B. Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department TA by the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department (MAE) covered a broad range of topics. MAE TA advice has been appreciated by the Brazilian authorities, and the implementation record has been very good. Inflation targeting When Brazil became the first country to pursue inflation targeting in the context of a Fund program, MAE and the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) organized jointly in May 1999 a seminar on inflation targeting, that was financed under the World Bank’s Central Bank Technical Assistance Loan. Presentations were made by experts from the central banks of Australia, Canada, Chile, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and representatives from the BCB, the Fund, and Brazilian academia. After this seminar MAE staff continued to collaborate with WHD and other departments in advising the authorities in the design and implementation of the inflation targeting framework. The BCB has successfully implemented the inflation targeting framework. Following the floating of the real in early 1999, this framework has been instrumental in anchoring inflation expectations, and contributed, along with the strong fiscal adjustment, to moderate the passthrough of the large depreciation of the real to prices. The analytical tools for the inflation targeting framework have been refined, and the BCB now utilizes a fairly broad range of such tools in shaping monetary policy decisions. The inflation rate was contained within the announc.ed targets in 1999 (a central rate of 8 percent with a band of *2 percent) notwithstanding a sizable nominal depreciation of the real. Also, the inflation rate is expected to be contained within the announced targets in 2000 (a central rate of 6 percent with a band of *2 percent). Success in the implementation of inflation targeting has allowed a gradual reduction of the benchmark overnight interest rate (SELIC). Base1 care principles for effective banking supervision (“Principles”) In January 2000, a joint World Bank-MAE mission undertook an assessment of observance of the Principles. In general, the mission found that, while the BCB has a strong core competency in banking supervision, its overall effectiveness is hindered by a lack of adequate staffing and budgetary resources for onsite inspections and offsite surveillance. The report of this mission was issued in July 2000. The authorities have requested and management has acceded to the publication of the assessment by the authorities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 99 - APPENDIX VII Code of good practices on transparency in monetary and financial policies (“Code”) In February 2000, a MAE mission assessed Brazil’s performance vis-a-vis the Code. The mission found that general governance and the attitude of policy makers toward improving transparency has improved significantly, but there were important areas that still require further improvement to achieve full observance of the Code. A revised report was sent to the Brazilian authorities at end-June, 2000. C. Policy Development and Review Department High-frequency debt monitoring system (DMS) In October 1998 and February 1999, staff of the Policy Development and Review Department (PDR) (jointly with MAE) assisted the authorities in putting in place a high- frequency DMS that captures most of the foreign lines of interbank credit to resident financial institutions. The BCB had been collecting these types of data (for example, short- term export, import, and other lines of credit from nonresident banks) only on a quarterly basis, and the system did not allow to verify creditor bank claims that they were maintaining their total exposure to Brazil (since many institutions were not covered by the system). The Fund staff designed several templates to help the BCB collect and analyze information on lines of credit. The new weekly monitoring system was designed to capture gross flows in and out of the nonbank sector, broken down by creditor banks and aggregated across creditor countries. The DMS covers bank, private nonbank, and public enterprise debt, and provides information on medium- and long-term nonbank registered debt; loan transactions related to unregistered debt (that is, debt not included in the debt statistics) where the counterparty abroad is a bank; and rollover and exposure data by debtor codes (which helped to analyze rollover and served as an input to work on the foreign currency exposure of banks). Also, the frequency of data updates on exercised put and call options was increased from occasional to monthly. This TA helped the BCB to significantly enhance its ability to monitor debt and debt-related flows. However, the effectiveness of the exercise was limited by several issues. Private foreign bank exposure to Brazil includes both lending and holdings of tradable bonds and notes. The latter-which in stock terms exceeded bank loans by almost 100 percent at end- October 1998-could not be tracked on a meaningful basis; this limited the effectiveness of the exercise compared to other countries. Another shortcoming related to short-term trade credit extended directly to corporations, which was measured from data compiled from exchange control returns. The relaxation of exchange controls that governed the minimum maturity of trade credit (which until Spring 1999 had been one year) led to a shortening of the maturity of such credits toward normal commercial practice (typically 180 days). As credits with a maturity of less than one year were not being captured by the exchange control data, the debt monitoring system underestimated the net flow of capital into Brazil.

Statistics Department Following a multisector statistics mission (MSM) in May 1999, and in continuation of the work started by previous money and banking missions, a multitopic mission (MTM) visited Brazil in March-April 2000 to assess the ongoing technical assistance program and evaluate the progress toward subscription to the SDDS. Subsequently, in response to urgent requests by the authorities, two missions were fielded in May: a one-week money and banking statistics mission to assist in compiling a revised set of government accounts; and a two-week real sector statistics mission to assist in compiling quarterly GDP accounts. Progress in implementing MSM recommendations The March-April 2000 MTM found that, in general, significant efforts had been made to improve the quality. coverage, and timeliness of data in virtually all statistical areas. However, several recommendations of the 1999 MSM remained pending, and a new action plan for their implementation was agreed with the authorities. A brief summary of the findings in each of the broad macroeconomic areas follows. l External sector statistics For the first time, Brazil has reported to STA for publication quarterly balance of payments statistics (for 1999) according to the fifth edition of the BaEance of Payments Manual (BPM.5). Several accounting problems have been resolved and various questionnaires and surveys (for example, for transportation and communications) are currently being prepared. The double-counting of certain services in the balance of payments has been eliminated. Improvements have been made regarding the proper coverage of international reserves and treatment of valuation from exchange rate changes; better delineation between resident and nonresident accounts; consistency in the valuation ofmonetary gold; recording of interest on an accrual basis; and separation of interest from capital gains and losses. Also, work has been started in compiling data on the International Investment Position, l Government finance statistics The May 2000 mission assisted the authorities in separating the data pertaining to central government operations (above and below the line) from those of the BCB. Also, the mission. recommended to dissemination of data on central government debt by maturity and bolder. In addition, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has started collecting data from a representative sample of local governments (composed of 660 municipalities accounting for 70 percent of all local government revenues) for constructing a general government series. Quarterly data on the operations of all federal government and nonfinancial public enterprises should become available in the near future. l Money and banking statistics While good progress has been made in improving the sources of data and methodology in compiling monetary and financial statistics. only part of the MSM recommendations have Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 101 - APPENDIX VII been implemented. However, a new action plan has been developed to expedite the implementation of the pending recommendations. As regards the specific measures to improve timeliness of the data, the BCB issued a circular to reduce the time period allowed financial institutions for submitting their balance sheets. The new action plan also envisages measures to improve the institutional coverage and classification of accounts by economic sector and by financial instrument, and to foster consistency in interbank positions. Both initiatives are expected to reduce the level of net unclassified assets. The MSM also took this opportunity to conduct a seminar for high level officials on the new Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and on the Fund’s recent work in the areas of external vulnerability, macroprudential indicators, and data dissemination. l Real sector statistics Real sector data are being improved by broadening the source data, such as the new monthly surveys of domestic trade and national consumption indicators. Significant progress has also been made toward developing quarterly national accounts at current prices, using the production approach. As regards the annual national accounts, revised estimates will be provided for private consumption expenditure and changes in inventories. Also, the sample coverage for the household expenditure survey is being revised, and a system has been installed that would provide annual updates of reporting entities and products for compiling the industrial production index. Data dissemination In view of the Brazilian authorities’ commitment to subscribe to the SDDS by the end of this year, the mission revised the existing metadata and identified specific areas where the SDDS requirements are not being met. Despite recent progress in disseminating information, work remains to be done to ensure observance of the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the following SDDS data categories: central government operations; consolidated operations of general government; and analytical accounts of the central bank. No data are currently disseminated on the international investment position, nor on international reserves with the degree of detail required in the data template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity. Moreover, the SDDS-prescribed practice of advance release of publication dates has not yet been institutionalized for all the sectors. In these circumstances, an action plan covering each sector and corresponding data category was developed to assist the authorities in their endeavors to subscribe to the SDDS in the near future. III. IDENTIFIED FUTURE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS A. Fiscal Affairs Department The Brazilian authorities have reaffirmed their determination to reform the public pension system; in this context, additional technical assistance is likely to be required, particular with Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 102- APPENDIX VII respect to evaluations of the short- and medium-term fiscal impact of the policy reforms and of the measures to strengthen social security tax administration that have recently been undertaken. As regards the reform of indirect taxes, it seems difficult to introduce the reform in the near future, unless rapid progress can be achieved in the months ahead. Implementation of this reform will require a considerable administrative effort, in particular to strengthen audit and improve coordination between central government and the states; further technical assistance may be required in this context. Finally, the authorities remain committed to further regional integration in the context of Mercosur. Technical assistance on tax harmonization, and on implementation of generally accepted WTO practices in customs valuation and other related areas might also be required. B. Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department In recent conversations with MAE senior staff, BCB officials from the Fiscalization Department expressed interest in a long-term advisor to work on banking supervision issues, in particular the implementation of the rating system for banks (noted above) and the strengthening of offsite surveillance. In this regard, a decision on a Fund-sponsored advisor will be coordinated with other technical assistance efforts underway, including those involving the World Bank.* The Fund and the World Bank continue to collaborate closely in financial sector work in Brazil. C. Statistics Department In the area of government finance statistics, the authorities have requested further technical assistance from the Fund to assess the methodology and criteria to be followed in compiling separate statistics for central government and BCB operations. A follow-up STA mission was fielded in May 2000, but additional follow-up work may be required. The authorities have also expressed interest in receiving further technical assistance to refine the methodology for preparing the analytical accounts of the financial system, and to analyze various conceptual and methodological proposals for redefining monetary aggregates. In the area of real sector statistics, further technical assistance from the Fund will be required to tinalize the quarterly national accounts, in particular at the stage of compiling quarterly GDP estimates by expenditure categories, as well as in implementing the PPI program. In this regard, a mission has been scheduled preliminarily to take place in November. *In 1997, the World Bank approved a US$20 million loan for technical assistance toward modernizing the BCB, with particular emphasis on banking supervision functions.

That letter, and our subsequent letters requesting the completion of the periodic reviews under the SBA-the fifth of which was completed by the IMF Executive Board on May 3 1,200O-had attached a Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) describing the government’s program of economic policies that has been supported under the SBA. The government remains fully committed to the thrust of that program. The MEP attached to this letter outlines the progress to date in implementing the government’s economic policies and discusses its current economic program and the economic outlook for the remainder of this year. As usual, also attached is a Technical Memorandum of Understanding that sets out the specific quantitative targets (in the form of performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks) through the end of this year, that are to be observed under the SBA. Reflecting the success of the policies that have already been implemented, Brazil’s economy has continued to perform strongly this year, with the economic recovery accelerating, inflation declining, the external accounts improving, and the fiscal performance strengthening further. We believe that the reforms that are currently underway and which are detailed in the attached MEP will be instrumental in promoting sustainable, noninflationary economic growth, lead to further improvements of Brazil’s external accounts, and help to address Brazil’s priority social needs. The government stands ready to take additional policy measures, as needed to ensure the achievement of its overall objectives. We look forward to continued support from the Fund to these policies. During the period of the arrangement, we will maintain the customary close policy dialogue with the Fund on the implementation of the program under the SBA. Yours sincerely; /sJ Pedro Sampaio Malan Minister of Finance /s/ Arminio Fraga Neto President--Central Bank of Brazil Mr. Horst Ktrhler Managing Director International Monetary Fund Washington, D.C. 2043 1 United States of America Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 104- ATTACHMENT I BRAZIL-MEMORANDUMOFECONOMICPOLICIES Brazil has successfully completed the first five reviews under the Three-Year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) from the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) that was approved by the Fund’s Executive Board on December 2, 1998. This Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) reviews the performance of the Brazilian economy so far in 2000, and outlines the proposed program framework for the remainder of this year, in light of the updated economic and policy outlook. ECONOMICPERFOFCMANCETODATEIN 2000 Brazil’s economy continued to perform strongly to date in 2000, with the economic recovery accelerating, inflation declining, the external accounts improving, and the fiscal performance strengthening further. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3 6 percent on average in the first half of 2000, compared with the same period in 1999, reflecting a seasonally adjusted annualized growth rate of 4.8 percent compared with the second half of 1999. Employment expanded by 5.1 percent in the 12 months to September 2000. Due to significantly improved prospects for finding a job, the increase in employment was accompanied by strong reentry into the labor market. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate declined from 7.4 percent in September 1999 to 6.7 percent in September 2000. Inflation remained subdued, with consumer prices, as measured by the broadest national index (IPCA) that is the yardstick for the inflation targeting framework, increasing by just 1.6 percent in the first half of the year. It accelerated temporarily in July and August, reflecting increases in administered prices and the effects of adverse weather condition on food prices, but has resumed a clear downward trend since September. The 12-month rate of increase in the IPCA declined from 8.9 percent in December 1999 to 6.5 percent in June 2000-significantly below the 7.0 percent central target for that month in the program-, picked up in July-August, but slowed down again to 7.7 percent in September, 0.2 percentage points above the upper limit of the inner band in the program. The general price index (IGP-DI), in which prices of tradable goods have a substantially larger weight than in the IPCA, rose by 8.1 percent in the first nine months of 2000, reflecting a further increase in the relative prices of those goods, Brazil’s external trade performance continued to improve, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than initially projected. The trade balance shifted into a surplus of 0.7 billion in the first three quarters of 2000, from a deficit of US$O.8 billion during the same period of 1999, with exports rising by 18.2 percent in value terms, well in excess of the 13.6 percent growth in imports during the same period. The strong export performance was led by manufacturing exports, which grew by almost 23 percent in volume terms in January- September 2000, compared with the same period in 1999. Average export prices grew by 2.6 percent over the same period. The recent increase in imports mainly reflected a strong rebound in the volume of intermediate good imports and the high international prices of oil products, which account for over 10 percent of total imports. By contrast, imports of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 105- A-ITACHMENT I consumer durables and capital goods declined in volume terms in the first nine months of 2000, compared to the same period in 1999, pointing to continued import substitution. The services account of the balance of payment posted a cumulative deficit of US$l8.0 billion in the first three quarters of 2000, only marginally lower than in the same period of 1999, with a small increase in net interest payments abroad and a decline in net transfers from abroad being more than offset by lower profit and dividend remittances. As a result of these developments, the current account deficit of the balance of payments declined to US$lS.9 billion in January-September 2000, from around US$l7.3 billion in the same period of last year. The deficit was more than fully financed by net foreign direct investments (FDI), which reached US$21.3 billion during the first nine months of 2000, notwithstanding a slowdown in the pace of privatizations. The continued strengthening of market confidence in Brazil’s economic performance was also reflected in improved access to foreign financing, with net issues of medium- and long-term debt inflows reaching a total of about US$5.7 billion through September. Sovereign debt issues in international capital markets, at declining spreads, amounted to US$l 1.4 billion-f which US$6.1 billion reflected exchanges to retire outstanding Brady bonds-in the first three quarters of the year. The total external debt has declined to US$232 billion (40.8 percent of estimated GDP) in August 2000, from about US$241 billion (45.6 percent of GDP) at end-l 999, also reflecting the repayment (partly ahead of schedule) of most of the international support package of 1998. Only 12 percent of this debt, consisting mostly of trade financing, is of original maturity of one year or less. All the quarterly ceilings in the program on the external debt of the nonfinancial public sector were observed with ample margins. Fiscal developments at all three levels of government have been substantially better than programmed through the first nine months of this year. The accumulated primary surplus of the consolidated public sector in January-September 2000 amounted to R$35.3 billion (4.4 percent of estimated period GDP). In the 12 months to September, the primary surplus reached a record R$35.8 billion (3.4 percent of estimated period GDP), compared with a program target for the year as a whole of R!$36.7 billion, equivalent to 3.4 percent of projected GDP. As a result of the substantial primary surplus, the declining trend of domestic interest rates, and a relatively stable exchange rate, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) declined from 10 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3.8 percent of GDP in the 12 months to September 2000. The net public debt at end-September 2000 stood at R$548 billion (equivalent to 48.5 percent of estimated GDP), marginally above the indicative target in the program. At the central government level-defined to include the treasury, the social security system and the central bank (BCB)---the strong performance in the first nine months of the year (a primary surplus, measured above the line, equivalent to 2.6 percent of the estimated period GDP) mainly reflected the maintenance of tight limits on discretionary expenditures. Despite continued growth in the combined revenue from taxes and social security contributions, overall central government revenues declined slightly in relation to GDP, reflecting, among Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 106- ATTACHMENT I others, reduced receipts from-concessions, reductions in the rate of the financial transactions tax (CPMF), and the disappearance of the surplus in the petroleum account of the Treasury, In order to arrest the erosion of the surplus of the petroleum account, the government increased in July the ex-refinery prices of gasoline and diesel oil by 15 percent, and reduced the subsidy to liquefied gas (GPL). The deficit of the public social security system for private sector workers (INSS) has remained basically unchanged in nominal terms in the first nine months of 2000, compared with the same period in 1999, reflecting the favorable impac.t of the strong growth of formal employment on social security contributions, improved enforcement, and the initial effects of the social security reforms enacted in recent years. The consolidated primary surplus of the states and municipalities in the first nine months of 2000 rose significantly, to the equivalent of 0.7 percent of estimated period GDP, from 0.4 percent of GDP in the corresponding period of 1999. The financing constraints embedded in the debt agreements negotiated with the federal government, as well as a strong revenue performance, contributed to the improvement in the finances of the states. The federal government has recently concluded similar debt restructuring agreements with about 180 municipalities, including the largest ones. The public enterprises also performed strongly in the first nine months of 2000, posting a primary surplus equivalent to 0.9 percent of period GDP, led by the federal enterprises, in particular the state oil company (Petrobr~), which has benefited from the continued high level of international oil prices, since its production is equivalent to three quarters of the domestic consumption of petroleum products. The government has also made significant further progress in structural fiscal reform. As a major step toward fiscal sustainability, the Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted in early May, after being approved by congress with a large majority. This law, among other things, prohibits financial support operations among different levels of government; sets limits on personnel expenditures of federal and local governments; and requires that limits also be set by the senate, upon proposal by the President, on the indebtedness of each level of government. Such limits have been proposed by the President. The law also requires substantial improvements in transparency and accountability for the management of public resources. Complementary legislation on penalties for violations of the requirements of the law by public officials (the “fiscal crimes” law) has also been approved by congress recently. In June, the senate approved the Multi-Year Plan for 2000-03 (PPA), which outlines the government’s strategy for allocating federal budget resources among spending programs over the same period, and aims at enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency in federal budgetary spending. The government’s efforts to protect core social programs and improve the quality and efficiency of social spending in recent years have begun to bear fruit, as reflected in the improvements in social indicators that were revealed by the preliminary results of the 1999 household survey (PNAD99) that were released by the National Institute of Statistics (IBGE) in July 2000. The PNAD99 showed, among other things, important advances in education and health care, and some improvement in income distribution.

However, several state energy companies (CELPE, CEMAR), a state gas company (G&s Sul), a state sanitation company (Manaus Saneamento), and the state bank of Parana (BANESTADO) were successfully privatized this year, generating total receipts of R$4.7 billion. In addition, substantial private sector involvement in the energy sector is already being achieved through joint ventures, with minority participation of Petrob& and Eletrobras, for the new thermoelectric power plants and electricity transmission lines. Also, the government carried out as scheduled the sale of a large noncontrolling stake of Petrobr&, for a price of R$7.2 billion. The BCB has continued to successfully implement its inflation targeting framework for monetary policy, with a view to anchoring price expectations to a gradually declining target path for inflation. As reported in the BCB’s quarterly inflation report of September 2000, on the basis of the interest rates that prevailed at the time, annual inflation was projected at 6.7 percent by end-2000 (slightly above the 6 percent central target, but well within the 4-8 percent target range for end-2000), and at 3.7 percent by end-2001 (compared with a central target of 4 percent). To minimize risks of a more significant excess over the target for end-2000, the BCB has kept the annualized overnight interest rate (SELIC) unchanged at 16.5 percent since July 19,200O. The BCB also has continued its efforts to improve the functioning of credit markets, and facilitate a narrowing of intermediation spreads in the banking system. From October 1999 to September 2000, average spreads have been reduced by 15.5 percentage points. In part, this reflects the lowering of minimum reserve requirements for demand deposits, from 65 percent in October 1999 to 45 percent as from June 2000. This has promoted a sustained recovery in bank credit to the private sector in recent months. In addition, the regulatory prudential framework has continued to be improved, particularly through the implementation of a forward looking loan classification system and of a new system of capital charges related to interest rate risk. The capital base of domestic banks has also been strengthened, a fact which has supported the recovery of credit to the private sector in recent months. The BCB has further strengthened banking supervision, including through the creation of separate departments for onsite and offsite supervision, and the hiring and training of new staff. Continued efforts to improve public debt management and the secondary market for government debt, together with the strengthened market confidence and declining inflation expectations, have allowed the government to increase the average maturity of total domestic securitized federal debt outstanding in the market to 29.3 months (14.3 months for securities placed through auctions) at end-August 2000. The average maturity of new issues has also increased from 16.8 months in February 2000 to 24.8 months in August 2000. At the same time, the share of fixed-rate securities has risen from 9.2 percent at end-1999 to 15 percent at end-August 2000.

Assuming continued moderation in wage adjustments, the strong growth of output should be reflected in a sustained further growth of employment, and a continued decline in unemployment in the rest of this year and beyond. Following the above-mentioned temporary acceleration in the third quarter, the rate of inflation is expected to resume its downward trend in the fourth quarter, to 6X--6% percent by year-end. The external trade balance is projected to be in broad equilibrium for the year as a whole, as the continued strong growth of manufacturing exports is expected to be offset by the persistence of high international oil prices, relatively depressed prices of some important agricultural exports, and the pickup in imports. The current account deficit is likely to rise slightly in value terms from the US$25 billion recorded in 1999, but to decline in relation to GDP. fi-om 4.7 percent of GDP in 1999 to under 4% percent of GDP in 2000. This deficit is projected to continue to be fully financed by FDI. Other medium- and long-term (MLT) capital inflows are expected to show a sizable positive net balance, reflecting, in particular, a decline of MLT debt amortizations, and improved access to international capital markets by both official and private borrowers. Overall, Brazil’s external public debt at year-end is projected to be well under the US$95.5 billion proposed ceiling in the program, of which at most USS4.0 billion would be of original maturity of one year or less. The overall balance of payments is expected to show a moderate surplus, allowing some rebuilding of net international reserves (NIR), which will therefore remain comfortably above the US$25 billion floor in the program for the rest of this year. On the assumption that, as is the government’s intention, no further purchases are made under the SBA, gross international reserves at end-2000 are projected to be equivalent to 5.3 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services, and to over 56 percent of short-term debt on a residual maturity basis (about 140 percent if trade credits are excluded). For 2000, the program envisaged an increase equivalent to about 0.2 percent of GDP in the primary surplus of the consolidated public sector from its 1999 level (equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP). It is therefore proposed that the cumulative primary surplus target for 2000 in the program be set at R$36.7 billion, equivalent to about 3.4 percent of projected GDP. Given the current prospects for the finances of state and local governments and their enterprises (see below), this target appears to be consistent with the revised budget framework law for 2000, approved by congress in June, which mandates a combined primary surplus of the central government and the federal enterprises of at least R$30.5 billion for this year. Current projections put the central government surplus at around R$23.5 billion (2.2 percent of GDP). A reduction in revenues relative to GDP-partly reflecting the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 109- ATTACHMENT I disappearance of once-off revenues recorded last year-will be largely compensated by the ongoing efforts to contain and rationalize primary spending, while safeguarding priority programs, especially in the social areas. The decline of the central government primary surplus in the latter part of this year reflects a number of factors, in particular the 0.08 percentage points reduction in June in the rate of the CPMF; higher expenditures on pensions, following the adjustment of minimum pensions in April and of other benefits in June; and an acceleration of spending on current and capital goods and services, following the approval of the budget in May. The good performance of the states’ and municipalities’ finances so far in 2000 is expected to be largely sustained in the rest of the year, reflecting the effects of the debt restructuring agreements mentioned above, and also continued strength in revenues. Current projections put the consolidated primary surplus of these governments at around R!$5.6 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) in 2000. The fiscal performance of the public enterprises is also expected to remain strong, with a projected primary surplus of around R$7.6 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) for the year. This reflects in particular, the favorable impact of still relatively high international oil prices on the finances of Petrobras. Taken together, these projections lend confidence that the targeted primary surplus for the consolidated public sector in 2000 will be achieved. Under the working assumptions of a broad stabilization of the overnight interest rate and the exchange rate around their current level, the PSBR is projected to decline to 4.6 percent of GDP, and the net public debt not to exceed RS584.5 billion (about 50 percent of GDP), after allowance for privatization revenues and the planned recognition of previously unrecorded liabilities and other debt adjustments, as set out in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The government also intends to continue its efforts to increase the share of fixed-rate securities in the domestic public debt, further raise the average maturity of its domestic debt, and gradually reduce the foreign-exchange indexed debt outstanding. The government is also improving the composition of its external debt by extending duration, smoothing the amortization profile, and diversifying the currency mix. The government intends to sustain its structural fiscal reform effort in the rest of this year and into 2001. Efforts will continue to be made in particular to secure as early as possible approval of the last two remaining pieces of implementing legislation for the administrative reform; the pending bills for complementary pension funds for private and public employees; and the proposed social contribution for retired civil servants. The government is also continuing its efforts to secure the necessary political support for reforms of the tax system. These reforms include: (i) a bill to modify the existing bank secrecy legislation, aimed at facilitating tax enforcement; this bill has been approved in the senate and is now being considered in the Lower House of Congress; (ii) a new tax code, including provisions to limit the scope for tax avoidance, erosion of the tax base, and excessive tax litigation; (iii) a bill transforming the rural property tax into a special contribution to finance land reform; and (iv) a new proposal for the reform of indirect taxation, that envisages, inter alia, the unification across the federation of the base and the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- llO- ATTACHMENT I rate structure of the state-level VATS (ICMS), a provision which will help end the current proliferation of tax incentives under this tax; and the progressive replacement over a three- year period of the current cascading social contributions (COFNS and PLY-PASEP) with single-stage ones, or the introduction of deductions or credit mechanisms aimed at eliminating the cascading and its attendant distortions. The government has also recently submitted to congress a proposed constitutional amendment establishing an explicit system for taxing oil products, to replace the current cross-subsidy arrangement embodied in the petroleum account of the federal government, and to offset the potential adverse impact on federal revenues of the scheduled liberalization of the oil market, at the end of 2001. Despite the above-mentioned delays, for the most part outside the government’s control, the government will continue its privatization efforts in the remainder of this year and in 2001, In particular, it will press ahead with its efforts to privatize BANESPA, the sale of which is scheduled to take place on November 20,2000, and the national reinsurance company (IRB), and will also continue preparations for the privatization of the remaining state banks in 2001 and the privatization of the large electricity generation companies. The government submitted to congress in August a budget proposal for 2001 envisaging a central government primary surplus of R%28.1 billion, which would facilitate the achievement of a consolidated public sector primary surplus equivalent to at least 3.0 percent of projected GDP. At the same time, and with a view to signaling its commitment to sustained fiscal discipline through the end of the current administration, the government announced a target of 2.7 percent of GDP for the consolidated public sector primary surplus for 2002. The proposed budget for 2001 will allow the federal government to address priority spending needs, especially in the social areas, while safeguarding fiscal sustainability, as the public sector net debt is expected to continue to decline. Among recent initiatives in the social areas are intensified expenditure efforts in health, education, and income support programs in regions with social development indices below the national average (Programa Alvorada), and in anti-crime and civil protection (Plan0 Seguranqa). Monetary policy will continue to be conducted within the inflation targeting framework, the institutional basis of which the government intends to strengthen in the course of next year by proposing to congress a revised organic law for the central bank. In this context, the actions of the BCB, and, in particular, changes in the SELIC will continue to be guided by the inflation outlook. The inflation target for 2002, which was announced in June, envisages a further decline in consumer price inflation to 3.5 percent, again with a tolerance interval of &2 percentage points. On the basis of the periodic discussions between the BCB and the Fund staff, the latter will report to the Executive Board of the Fund on the conduct of monetary policy and its assessment thereof during each scheduled review of the program. These discussions supplement the consultation mechanism on deviations of the actual 12-month rate of inflation from the target path established in the context of the fourth review of the program, and together they replace the traditional ceilings in the program on net domestic assets (NDA) in the BCB. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:57 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lll- ATTACHMENT I The BCB is setting up a real-time gross settlements system to improve payments arrangements and significantly reduce default risks. The BCB will also continue its efforts to further strengthen its banking supervision functions, in cooperation with the various supervisory authorities; improve the functioning of domestic financial and capital markets; and further enhance transparency of its own operations. The BCB is also carrying out an in- depth audit of the federal banks, which follows an assessment made by external consultants that has been made available to the public; these inputs will be used to define, as rapidly as possible, an appropriate strategy for strengthening these banks. Substantial further steps were taken to promote dialogue, and enhance macroeconomic and policy convergence within Mercosur. The 3 percent temporary surcharge on the common external tariff that was agreed in 1997 is envisaged to be eliminated in 2001, and a number of items that have been kept in exception lists will converge to the common external tariff. Only a limited group of items will remain in exception lists and full convergence will occur gradually until 2005. As a first step in improving macroeconomic coordination within the region, efforts are being made by the Mercosur members to harmonize macroeconomic and fiscal statistics. Mercosur member countries have also agreed to announce harmonized fiscal targets by March 2001. The government remains committed to further multilateral trade liberalization, in the context of negotiations that include agricultural products. It is already pursuing discussions with a number of countries and regional blocks toward mutual reductions of trade barriers. Progress continues to be made in the statistical improvements that are needed for Brazil’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which is planned by end-2000. The publication, for the first time in early October, of quarterly estimates of nominal GDP through the second half of the year 2000 represents an important step in this direction; these quarterly estimates will be updated each quarter. In sum, Brazil has continued its successful economic performance into the second year of the program. The government remains fully committed to the policies and targets in the program for this year, but is requesting some modifications in the timetable for certain structural benchmarks of the program, to reflect delays, largely out of government control, in some of the envisaged structural reforms and in the privatization program. The policies and targets for the third year of the program supported under the Stand-By Arrangement will be discussed early in 200 1.

The cumulative primary balance of the consolidated public sector is defined as the sum of the cumulative primary balances of the various entities that make up the public sector. The public sector is defined to comprise the central government, state and municipal governments, and the public enterprises (including federal, state and municipal enterprises); the central government includes the federal government, the social security system, and the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB). For any given month, the primary balance of the consolidated public sector is measured, in Brazilian reais (R$), as the total net interest (i.e., net interest accrued on the consolidated net domestic debt of the public sector, plus the net interest due (compethzcia contratual) on the net external debt of the public sector) minus the borrowing requirement of the consolidated public sector, where the public sector is defined as above. For foreign-exchange indexed government securities, the interest rate is the accumulated rate of change of the U.S. dollar vis-&vis the R$, plus the fixed coupon rate. The fixed coupon rate applies to the nominal value of the security revalued by the rate of change of the U.S. dollar vis-A-vis the R$ from the issuance date to the relevant date. For any given month, the borrowing requirement of the consolidated public sector is defined as the change in the nominal outstanding net domestic debt plus the change in the net external debt, converted into R$ at the actual period average R$/US$ exchange rate.’ The stock of the U.S. dollar-indexed domestic debt is revalued at the end of a given month to reflect any change in the value of the real vis-Lvis the U.S. dollar that has taken place during the month.
