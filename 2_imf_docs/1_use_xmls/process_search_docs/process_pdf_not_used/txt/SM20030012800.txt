Namibia’s central policy challenge continues to be to achieve higher rates of growth to alleviate poverty and raise living standards. This requires continuing attention to the structural impediments to growth, but it is also vital that the country strengthens its fiscal position to maintain its otherwise enviable record of macroeconomic stability. . Over the last five years, economic growth has averaged only 3.2 percent a year, too little to produce a significant rise in living standards. At the same time, private sector growth outside the primary sectors has strengthened to 4.6 percent a year. 0 After declining to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2000/01 (April-March), the fiscal deficit rose to 4.5 percent in 2001/02 and may reach 4.0 percent in 2002/03. These figures exceed the government’s deficit target of 3 percent and in the absence of corrective measures would result in an increasing debt ratio over the medium term. Monetary policy has been strongly influenced by developments in South Africa, reflecting the peg of the Namibia dollar to the rand in the context of the Common Monetary Area (CMA). l One of the causes of the large deficits has been government financial support for troubled public enterprises, which in 2002/03 is likely to exceed 2 percent of GDP. In addition to changes in management and strategy in the troubled institutions, new high-level committees to strengthen oversight and formulate divestiture policy have been established. 0 The size of personnel expenditures, which are substantially higher than in most neighboring countries, requires close attention to the size and remuneration of the civil service. 0 Namibia’s immediate prospects are broadly favorable, owing to peace in Angola, new trade opportunities under preferential arrangements, and higher mining output. In a medium-term context, the growth prospects depend critically on the adoption of measures to strengthen the fiscal position and advance the structural reform agenda. 0 Main issues to be addressed on the structural side include the privatization of public enterprises, labor market rigidities, and access to land ownership. l A critical constraint is the shortage of skilled labor, which is putting a premium on the efficient creation of human capital. At the same time, existing human capital is being eroded by the suffering and death associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The international community appears to be prepared to provide financial assistance to meet part of the associated outlays, but the government will also need to economize on other expenditures to be able to cover the remaining costs. l As a member of the Southern African Customs Union, Namibia is part of the largest market in sub-Saharan Africa, and the country will benefit from the increasing openness of the customs union to the international economy.

At that time, Executive Directors noted that, while macroeconomic conditions had been stable in recent years, real GDP growth had been insuflicient to reduce the high incidence of unemployment and poverty. Directors expressed concern over the sharp increase in the budget deficit in 2001/02 (April-March) and stressed the need to contain wage expenditure and curtail financial support to public enterprises, as this would make it possible to reorient expenditures to social and economic services. They welcomed the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) and recommended a broadening of the tax base to reduce high tax rates. Directors also endorsed the peg of the Namibia dollar to the South African rand. 2. Consistent with Fund policy advice, which has been concentrated in the fiscal area, the Namibian authorities are taking a number of initiatives to strengthen fiscal planning. These include the adoption of a medium-term expenditure framework, the establishment of a streamlined governance framework for parastatal enterprises, and the development of broader public sector reforms to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services. At the same time, several initiatives are under way to reduce the structural impediments to growth. It will take some time to see the extent to which these initiatives result in better policy implementation. II. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS 3. Namibia’s per capita income (US$2,000) is among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, but its income distribution is highly skewed,’ and the unemployment rate exceeds 30 percent. This inequality in the distribution of income is primarily due to the fact that large sections of the population lack access to educational opportunities, land, physical assets, and bank credit. Moreover, landownership is limited to a small proportion of the population. The income inequality also reflects the existence of a dual economy, where a sophisticated modem sector based on highly capital-intensive mining activities and commercial farming exists side by side with a large subsistence and informal sector in which most of the population seeks to earn their livelihood. Since independence in 1990, some progress has been made in redressing the social imbalances that had previously characterized the country. Ethnic differences in income distribution have become less marked, and there have been significant gains in education and access to water and sanitation.2 However, the rise of HIV/AIDS, with more than 20 percent of adults infected, has reduced life expectancy. ’ The Gini coefficient in 1998 was 0.67, the highest in the world. 2 Gross secondary school enrollment rate has risen from 44 to 61 percent, and the illiteracy rate has dropped from 25 to 18 percent. In both respects, Namibia’s rates continue to be about twice as favorable as those for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.

The ties are particularly close with South Attica 2.6 0.8 2.1 3.4 2.2 2.0 South Africa, thanks to the long historical Swaziland 3.8 3.2 3.5 2.0 1.8 2.7 relationship and the fact that the Namibia dollar is pegged at par to the South African rand, which remains legal tender in Namibia. 5. From 1997 to 2001, the annual growth rate of Namibia’s GDP IO averaged 3.2 percent a year (Table l), 9 down slightly from the 3.6 percent 8 recorded in the first seven years of 7 independence (1990-96). With a 6 population growth rate that has averaged 5 2.4 percent a year since independence, 4 the rise in per capita income has not been 3 substantial. In the earlier period, 2 however, the expansion of government 1 was a major factor, and fishing and ’ diamond production were also substantial contributors to growth.

I3 - Private nonprimary GDP 1997 1998 1999 2000 200 I 2002 these sectors slowed in 1997-200 1, but the average growth of private nonprimary production has increased substantially to 4.6 percent a year, suggesting that the economy may be gradually moving toward a more sustainable, though still unambitious, growth path (Figure 1). 6. Real GDP growth slowed to 2.4 percent in 2001, with primary production dropping by 8.4 percent on account of weather-related declines in agriculture and fishing and the slump in the world market for diamonds. Growth increased slightly to 2.7 percent in 2002, as the production and processing of primary commodities stabilized. At the same time, after reaching 7.0 percent in 200 1 because of a construction boom, private nonprimary growth appears to have slowed to about 4.0 percent in 2002.

Investment in Namibia has averaged 22 percent of GDP since independence-a level that might have been expected to result in higher growth rates. Reasons for the relatively low output response, besides possible statistical problems, could include the high capital intensity of mining investments, the costliness of infrastructure projects (partly for social purposes) in a country with low population densities, and inefficiencies in public sector investments, as reflected in the public enterprise problems discussed below. At the same time, the uneven income distribution is likely to have contributed to a relatively high savings rate, which averaged 25 percent of GDP over the same period. Private capital outflows have been significant, owing in part to the higher stage of development of capital markets in South Africa and more attractive investment options available in that country.3 8. With the Namibia dollar tied to the rand, inflation in Namibia has been broadly in line with that of South Africa (Figure 2). After remaining at 9 percent for three years, Namibian inflation rose to 11.3 percent in 2002, the highest rate since 1992. This increase reflected the lagged effect of the sharp depreciation of the rand against major currencies in the second half of 200 1, as well as the regional food shortage. 14 12 IO 8 6 4 2 0 Figure 2.

After narrowing to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2000/01 (April-March), the government budget deficit rose to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2001/02, exceeding the original target of 3.6 percent of GDP. Revenue declined markedly because of lower SACU receipts, and total expenditures rose above 36 percent of GDP, with overruns in most areas. In particular, net lending, which largely represents support for public enterprises, increased to almost triple the original budget provision. As a result, government debt rose by about 3 percentage points of GDP to 25% percent of GDP at the end of 200 l/O2 (Table 2). 3 To encourage investment in Namibia by local firms, insurance companies and pension funds are required to invest 35 percent of their assets domestically.

The 2002/03 budget aimed to reduce the government deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP through expenditure restraint. In particular, the budget did not contemplate a general salary increase, and most ministries were provided with no more than 90 percent of the previous year’s allocations for goods and services. The government deficit was financed through placements of treasury bills and bonds with the private sector at rates that rose by about 300 and 175 basis points during the year, reaching 11.9 percent and 13 percent, respectively, by year’s end. 11. Preliminary indications provided in a revised budget suggest that the deficit could be on the order of 4 percent of GDP in 2002/03, or somewhat lower than in the original budget. Government revenues are projected to exceed budget projections by at least 10 percent, owing to the strong performance of the VAT and taxes on mining activities, while expenditures have increased relative to the original budget, partly because of the unexpected need to provide drought relief.

With the Namibia dollar pegged to the rand, monetary policy in Namibia closely tracks that of South Africa. Broad money grew by about 7 percent during 2002 (Table 9), Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- with credit to the private sector rising by more than 20 percent, mainly on account of a marked increase in consumer credit. In view of the sharp depreciation of the rand (and the Namibia dollar) toward the end of 2001 and the rise in inflation during 2002, the authorities adjusted the bank rate (the rate charged by the central bank to banks for short-term liquidity purposes) upward by a total of 350 basis points during 2002. As a result, the bank rate had reached 12.75 percent by September 2002, remaining unchanged at that level thereafter (Figure 3). 13. The Namibia dollar depreciated against the U.S. dollar by over 30 percent in the second half of 200 1, owing to the weakening of the rand, but by the end of 2002 the cumulative decline had narrowed to 20 percent because of the rand’s subsequent appreciation.

Traditionally, Namibia has recorded a surplus in its external current account, reflecting its positive private savings-investment balance.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS 15. As noted above, Namibia’s economic growth has been reasonably steady and is expected to be higher over the medium term; however, in the absence of substantial structural and institutional reforms, it still would not be high enough to make a major dent in unemployment or to raise per capita incomes substantially. In addition, in the last two years the country has experienced substantial fiscal deficits and rising government debt. Against this background, the discussions with the authorities focused on how to achieve higher growth rates and move toward a sustainable fiscal position. The challenges in both areas are intensified by the suffering and economic strains associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 16. Based on the discussions, the immediate prospects for the Namibian economy are broadly favorable. l Peace in Angola will alleviate pressures on Namibian resources from refugees, make the country a more attractive destination for tourists, and generate new trade opportunities. l The U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and access to the European Union (EU) under the Cotonou agreement will provide favorable opportunities for exports.5 l New direct investment hold the promise of higher mining output. l Regional food prices are declining, and the recent strengthening of the currency will promote lower inflation. l Although the Namibia dollar strengthened during 2002, on a net basis the currency depreciated in real effective terms in 200 l-02. Notwithstanding the above favorable factors, the downside risks currently facing the world economy also entail some risks for Namibia. 4 The prices of Namibia’s resource-based exports are largely determined in world markets, but 85 percent of its imports come from South Africa. ’ One major response to the AGOA is the recent establishment of the Ramatex Textile mill which already provides about 1,500 jobs. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 11 - 17. In the medium term, the achievement of higher rates of growth will require the adoption of measures to strengthen the fiscal position and to accelerate structural reforms. It should be recognized, however, that one possible factor contributing to slow growth is the relatively high country risk attributed to southern Africa, a perception that is difficult to alter quickly and sustained implementation of sound economic and social policies will be critical in this regard. A. Fiscal Policy 18. The mission welcomed the government’s adoption of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). This framework sets out the authorities’ view that budget deficits of the magnitude registered in 2001/02 are not sustainable, as borrowing and interest payments would increase over the medium term, threatening economic stability. As noted above, the government has begun the process of reducing the deficit, which is still expected to reach 4.0 percent of GDP in 2002/03. The authorities recognized that additional efforts were needed to strengthen the fiscal position and indicated that their objective was to reduce the deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP over the medium term, in order to bring the debt back down to 25 percent of GDP. 19. The mission supported the government’s fiscal objectives. Namibia’s debt ratio is lower than most other countries, but given the need to stimulate private-sector-led growth and the government’s general policy of avoiding external borrowing on commercial terms, the authorities’ goals seem appropriate. Moreover, the overall deficit target, which implies a primary deficit on the order of 0.5 percent of GDP, appears to be consistent with the objective of stabilizing the debt ratio.6 20. Reducing the deficit to the target level would require budgetary restraint. To illustrate this point, the staff has prepared a scenario based on the continuation of current policies, which is shown in Table 3. Under this scenario, revenues are likely to decline relative to GDP over the medium term, as SACU receipts would continue to diminish gradually in relative terms.7 On the expenditure side, two critical areas need to be addressed: 6 The debt and deficit objectives may be linked as follows. At a growth rate of 4 percent and a real interest rate of 2 percent (approximately its current level), maintenance of the debt ratio at 25 percent of GDP would be consistent with a primary deficit of 0.5 percent GDP. If the nominal interest rate on debt averages 10 percent, the interest bill would be equal to 2.5 percent of GDP; this in turn implies that the overall deficit (including the primary deficit and interest payments) should not exceed the authorities’ target of 3 percent of GDP. 7 There has been a rapid reduction in average customs duties in SACU, from around 30 percent in 1990 to 7 percent at present, in part because of free trade arrangements with the European Union and the Southern African Development Community. Moreover, further declines are expected as a result of reductions in the common external tariff and new (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- Table 3.

Personnel expenditures have moderated in recent years but are still higher than in other countries in the region (Table 4), while net lending (mainly budgetary support for public enterprises) has increased sharply to about 2 percent of GDP in 2002/03. The scenario based on current policies shows that, if personnel expenditure were to rise again relative to GDP and the ratio of net lending to GDP were not reduced, the deficit could increase to 7 percent of GDP within five years, with the government debt ratio exceeding 40 percent of GDP.* Moreover, government guarantees have increased as the preferential arrangements. A new SACU agreement initialed in 2002 changed the formula for revenue sharing among member states to give more resources to the poorer members through a development component; the impact on Namibia’s share is not yet clear. ’ Debt levels of this magnitude could lead to uncertainties regarding the link of the Namibia dollar to the rand and to increasing risk premiums. In addition, interest payments would rise, and the government’s ability to support its social and economic objectives would be increasingly compromised.

Support for Air Namibia and Transnamib (the national railways company) has been large in the last two years.’ The financial problems of these companies have been building over time, but the authorities were confident that recent changes in management and commercial strategies would turn their financial situation around. A major problem for Air Namibia has been its purchase of a Boeing 747 aircraft, which is not justified by the volume of long-distance travel. In this regard, the authorities indicated that negotiations aimed at achieving a more suitable mix of aircraft were underway. The mission welcomed the recent establishment of high-level committees aimed at strengthening the performance of parastatals (see below). 22. Regarding personnel outlays, one factor Table 4.

The authorities indicated that they had begun to implement a Performance and Effectiveness Management Program (PEMP) aimed at improving the quality of government and determining staffing needs, but they recognized that it would take some time to establish a link between wage increases and productivity growth. Looking ahead, the cost of treatment for HIV/AIDS would have a significant impact on personnel expenditure. In this connection, the mission supported strongly the authorities’ decision to include such costs in the medical plan for government employees, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also to avoid a catastrophic loss of skilled employees. 9 See the staff report for the 2001 Article IV consultation (SM/02/06, l/25/02, pp. 17-18). The main support received by Transnamib in 2002/03 was the forgiveness of arrears on payroll deductions of income taxes in an amount equal to about 0.5 percent of GDP; if that support had taken the form of an equity injection, net lending would have increased to 2.6 percent of GDP, with a corresponding increase in income tax revenues. lo Since the mid-1990s the number of government employees has increased by 17 percent to above 75,000 in 2002/03, a slight decline from the previous year. This increase is more than accounted for the categories of defense, police, and prisons, where the number of employees has more than doubled. By contrast, the number of employees in education, health, and other social ministries has remained almost unchanged.

Under this scenario, personnel expenditures are assumed to be contained through restraint in government employment and salaries (the real growth of personnel expenditures is limited to 2 percent a year), and net lending is reduced to the levels prevailing prior to the last three years. The scenario also incorporates a modest reduction in capital expenditure, in line with the government’s intention to rely increasingly on private investment as the engine of growth. Based on these policies, the government deficit would be reduced to 2’S percent of GDP over the medium term, with the debt ratio declining gradually toward the government’s target. Table 5.

The authorities indicated that a tax study initiated late in 2001 was close to completion, and that they would draw on its conclusions to broaden the tax base, lower some tax rates, and simplify the tax system. In the meantime, the special 30 percent VAT rate on luxury goods has been eliminated to simplify tax administration. In addition, the government is strengthening budgetary procedures by linking expenditure allocations more explicitly to the achievement of developmental objectives . More generally, the government intends to continue with the process of decentralizing the provision of public services by shifting them to autonomous public agencies. The mission cautioned that such a move would require strong supervision of the agencies. 26. Budget implementation is also being strengthened through the development of better management systems in the Ministry of Finance, where an Accountant-General has been appointed. In particular, expenditure control would be enhanced through the establishment of a public finance management system. The mission indicated that, as a general principle, supplementary budgets should be rare events, designed to deal with genuine emergencies that could not be accommodated within the contingency provision. The 2002 drought was such an event, and a supplementary budget was an appropriate response. Unfortunately, however, the supplementary budget allowed for additional expenditures in other areas. B. Financial and External Sector Policies 27. The authorities indicated that monetary policy in Namibia was strongly influenced by South Africa’s because of the peg to the rand under the CMA. In this context, changes in the monetary stance, as signaled by adjustments in the bank rate, usually occurred soon after changes in the corresponding South African rate. Since August 1998, the bank rate has been set at least % of 1 percentage point below that of South Africa’s, with the purpose of persuading commercial banks to lower their lending rates to support economic activity. The mission questioned the benefits of this policy, as the associated lower deposit rates hurt small Namibian savers and gave large savers additional incentives to place funds in South Africa. l1 A pilot study on the efficiency of government spending on health and education is under way. A 1996 study by the World Bank suggested that educational efficiency, as measured by dropout rates and the time taken for students to graduate, was substantially lower in Namibia than in countries such as Botswana and Zimbabwe. (It is possible that part of the difference is accounted for by institutional factors that do not necessarily reflect education quality.) ‘* The share of defense and public order and safety, by contrast, has risen from 13 percent to 17 percent. The authorities indicated that the increase reflected both Namibian involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo war (now terminated) and a serious crime problem. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Moreover, the mission noted that credit extension to the private sector had been excessive and encouraged the central bank to tighten credit conditions, including by increasing the bank rate, in order to strengthen the official reserve position. 28. Because of the small size of the Namibian economy, the cost of financial intermediation is somewhat higher than in South Africa, an issue of concern to the authorities. The mission noted that interest spreads had been declining (from almost 8 percent in 1998 to about 6 percent in 2002) and that the proximity of South Africa meant that large customers of banks could shift between the two markets with relative ease, thereby enhancing competitive pressures on banks. The authorities indicated that consideration was being given to permitting branches of international banks to operate in Namibia (not just full subsidiaries), but that there was concern in some quarters that these branches might not be fully committed to lending in Namibia. The mission supported the proposal, noting that additional competition should contribute to further declines in interest margins. More generally, the mission observed that Namibia appeared to be benefiting from financial innovation, including the development of microlending, financing for small and medium- sized enterprises, and special agricultural financing and unit trusts. 29. The authorities indicated that the banking system had been strengthened in recent years, with the proportion of nonperforming loans declining from over 11.3 percent in 1998 to 3.1 percent in June 2002 and total bank capital increasing to twice the prescribed minimum of 8 percent of risk assets. The Bank of Namibia has continued to strengthen its supervisory capabilities13 and intends to begin applying stricter supervisory requirements, based on new international standards. To that end, the authorities expressed interest in further technical assistance from the Fund. The authorities have established the Namibia Financial Institutions Supervisory Authority (NAMFISA) as a supervisory body for nonbank institutions, and they are working on developing its full capacity to carry out its functions at a reasonable cost. The mission welcomed the progress made in drafting legislation to combat money laundering and corruption and urged the authorities to submit it to parliament as soon as possible. There was also a need to monitor banks’ loan portfolios closely in light of the recent expansion of credit to the private sector. 30. There has been some real depreciation of the Namibia dollar in recent years, particularly with respect to export markets, and the strong performance of nontraditional exports also suggests that external competitiveness is appropriate. The authorities noted that Namibia’s participation in the CMA had served the country well by encouraging responsible macroeconomic policies. Namibia’s membership in SACU was also beneficial, as it meant that the country was a partner in the largest market in sub-Saharan Africa. The authorities felt that the evolution of these institutions, particularly the increasing openness of l3 The largest banks in Namibia are subsidiaries of South African banks, and as such receive guidance from their parent institutions and the South African supervisory authorities, as well as the Bank of Namibia. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17- SACU as it moved toward greater integration with other countries in the region and free trade with the European Union, should enhance growth. The structures of the two institutions are being revamped to give their smaller members a larger role in decision making, which would give Namibia a greater voice in shaping its future.i4 31. The authorities indicated that a levy on the export of live animals to encourage additional meat processing in Namibia had been mooted. SACU did permit infant industries to be protected by temporary, declining levels of protection, but the mission argued that meat processing was hardly an infant industry in Namibia. The mission noted that such restrictions would not only raise the costs of meat products to consumers but would also reduce the returns to the primary producers. The authorities were aware of this issue; they also expressed concern that the measure could lead to a loss of market share in South Africa, which was a principal export destination. 32. The authorities indicated that they had been studying the question of the appropriate level of international reserves, which currently stood at a level equivalent to 2.1 months of imports. They noted that the main purpose of international reserves in the Namibian context was to help demonstrate the central bank’s capacity to defend the peg of the Namibia dollar to the rand. In this regard, the authorities observed that at present currency issue was fully backed by rand, and that in case of need the Bank of Namibia could draw on credit lines under the CMA. Moreover, the reserve coverage of short-term debt is higher than in most emerging-market economies (Box l), although in relation to imports it was lower than the usual standard of 3-4 months. The mission suggested that a strengthening of the reserve position would be prudent, but noted that Namibia’s commitment to sound macroeconomic policies was the best assurance of exchange rate stability. 33. In February 2003, the authorities hosted a conference on Namibia’s second national development plan, which covered the period 2001/02-2005/06. They indicated that prior to the conference they had received donor commitments amounting to the equivalent of US$120 million, but that they were seeking additional commitments of about US$l billion (equivalent to about 6 percent of GDP per year). The problem of HIV/AIDS figured prominently in the discussions, as did Namibia’s need for technical assistance, given the shortage of technical skills resulting from inadequate educational opportunities prior to independence. The authorities also emphasized their need for additional assistance to finance land reform. They noted that Namibia’s per capita income was relatively high, so that the country was often not eligible for concessional assistance. Nonetheless, given that the large majority of the population was poor, the authorities had asked donors to treat them “as if’ l4 In contrast with the previous SACU agreement, under which tariff schedules were set virtually unilaterally by South Africa, the new agreement (initialed but not yet ratified by parliaments) gives decision-making power to a regional tariff board that includes representatives from the smaller member countries.

Box 1. Namibia: International Reserves Namibia has maintained international reserves at levels consistent with the requirements for members of the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The CMA agreement requires members to provide partial backing of currency issues by central banks with foreign exchange. In fact, the Bank of Namibia has maintained its reserves at more than 100 percent of its currency issue. It also has automatic access to lines of credit under the CMA, which provide a secondary backing for its currency. In the case of a fixed exchange rate regime, such as Namibia’s reserves are needed to provide confidence that the rate can be protected in the event of balance of payments shocks, such as export shortfalls or capital outflows. A close coordination of monetary policy with that of South Africa has been the primary instrument for defending the rate. Given the strong integration of Namibia’s financial markets with South Africa’s, and the fact that the rand continues to be legal tender in Namibia, a slight increase in interest rates would, in normal circumstances, be sufficient to offset any pressures on the exchange rate. Two common standards for determining reserve adequacy are to measure reserves in relation to imports, and in relation to capital flows.’ By the first measure, Namibia’s international reserves at the end of 2002 were equivalent to about 2.1 months of imports,* somewhat below the goal of three-four months of imports that commonly serves as a standard; at the end of 2000, the average coverage among the Fund’s membership was four months of imports. Within the CMA, Namibia’s holding of international reserves has also been low. Gross International Reserves of CMA Countries, 1997-2001 (In months of imports) 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Lesotho 11.1 8.9 7.6 7.4 7.6 Namibia 1.4 1.6 2.0 1.7 1.6 South Africa 2.0 2.0 2.9 2.7 2.9 Swaziland 2.7 2.9 3.0 2.8 2.5 Measured in relation to the capital account, however, Namibia’s reserves are stronger than the international average. The ratio to short-term debt was 300 percent in 2000, compared with an average of 180 percent for emerging market countries. Moreover, Namibia’s external debt is relatively low, at about 5 percent of GDP, and most of the loans are on concessional terms, with long payback periods and low interest rates. The fact that most of the reserves are held in currencies other than the rand helps to insulate the country from the wealth effects of changes in the exchange rate ‘SM/O1/311 (10/16/01), “Issues in Reserves Adequacy and Management.” ‘This ratio would be significantly higher if customs and excise duties collected by SACU, and reflected in the f.o.b. value of the 85 percent of Namibia’s imports that come from SACU members, were excluded from the value of the imports (as would be the case if Namibia collected its own duties).

The discussions on structural issues focused on privatization, the labor market, the government’s plan to address the issue of land ownership, and the possible impact of HIV/AIDS. 35. The authorities indicated that they planned to continue the commercialization and privatization of public enterprises, but that the process could take time because of the need to build political consensus. Although some members of the government felt that commercialization alone would be adequate, the general policy was to move to full privatization.15 The mission urged the authorities to move ahead with privatization as quickly as possible to promote efficiency, improve the quality of services, and generate budgetary resources. In particular, privatization could reduce government support for inefficient public enterprises. It also emphasized the need to pay attention to the introduction of appropriate regulatory frameworks. 36. The authorities indicated that high-level governance and divestiture committees had been created. The mission stressed that an important role of these committees would be to help develop a public debate about privatization-to help the country make an informed decision on the way forward. There were delays in establishing the executive agency that will support the work of these committees and implement the eventual decisions, and it was important that these delays be overcome as quickly as possible. 37. Preliminary indications from the latest labor market survey are that the unemployed continue to account for one-third of the labor force. This situation reflects in part the rapid increase in the labor force, which is expected to ease over time with declining fertility rates. The pattern of unemployment also suggests that there are imbalances in the demand and supply of skilled labor. The unemployment rate for the 5 percent of the labor force with some technical or professional training beyond the secondary level is only 4 percent, in marked contrast to the rate of over 30 percent that applies to the rest of the labor force. 38. Labor market rigidities may also be a factor in high unemployment and low growth. Wage levels are significantly higher than in countries such as Botswana and Zimbabwe, particularly at the lower end of the salary scale. In this connection, an earlier labor market survey indicated that Namibia’s formal sector had one of the highest unionization rates in the region. The authorities noted that draft legislation on industrial dispute resolution seeks to l5 The policy of commercialization seeks to manage public enterprises on a business basis for profit. With the government as the controlling shareholder, however, other considerations can affect the performance of an enterprise. It was noted in this regard that the decisions that resulted in the inappropriate mix of aircraft operated by Air Namibia had been taken after the airline had been commercialized.

In addition, a recent agreement between commercial farmers and the farm workers union is expected to provide a basis for legislation on minimum wages. A welcome development is that the new standards would pay due attention to the need to encourage employment creation. 39. Since independence, the government has been working to address historic injustices in the distribution of land ownership. A key aspect of economic empowerment is that those using land be given proper title, so that they can confidently carry out capital improvements and obtain financing for this purpose. Legislation has been introduced recently to deal with this problem in the communal land areas. In addition, the affirmative action program under which qualified farmers are able to obtain concessional financing for land acquisition has resulted in the purchase of 2 million hectares.16 At the same time, a new land tax seeks to encourage owners of multiple farms to reduce their holdings and would provide resources for land acquisition. The mission agreed with the emphasis of the authorities on ensuring that new farmers have adequate financial and advisory support. 40. The authorities said that they were pleased with the progress that had been made since independence in reducing Namibia’s “social deficit,” but they emphasized that this progress was being threatened by HIV/AIDS (Box 2). Current estimates are that about 13 percent of Namibia’s population is HIV positive, and the infection rate is likely to rise in the years ahead. AIDS is not only a humanitarian issue, but also a major threat to growth and poverty alleviation, since it means that a large proportion of the resources devoted to education do not achieve the objective of raising productivity and earning power over long lifetimes. 41. In addition to efforts to reduce the spread of the infection, the allocation of resources for antiretroviral treatment could greatly increase the productive lifespan of those suffering from AIDS. To that end, the government is beginning to offer treatment to its employees under its medical plan, in line with developments in the private sector. Most AIDS sufferers, however, do not qualify for such support, and the government is developing a modest pilot program that would offer treatment to 1,000 sufferers. The authorities also indicated that they had been able to reduce the cost of treatment for a patient to about US$l,500 annually, and that prices for antiretroviral medicines were likely to decline further. l6 This is about 5 percent of commercial farm land, which amounts to 36 million hectares. This land is mainly used for cattle ranching. Land acquisition for resettlement purposes has amounted to only about 500,000 hectares, as the government, which has the right of first refusal of any land coming onto the market, has considered properties to be generally overpriced. The mission noted that one mechanism for ensuring fair pricing, following a model that had been applied in some places, would be to give the government not only the right of first refusal, but also the right to match the terms of any other offer accepted by the seller.

HIV/AIDS in Namibia HIV/AIDS prevalence among adults (ages 15-49) in Namibia is estimated at 22.5 percent. This places the infection rate among the highest in the world, albeit below that of some of Namibia neighbors. While recent surveys HIV Prevalence in SACU Countries suggest a decline in the infection rate among young adults (In percent) (ages 15-19), the overall rate has continued to trend upward. Botswana 38.8 Urban centers such as Windhoek and Walvis Bay have been Lesotho 31.0 Namibia 22.5 the hardest hit, with infection rates near 30 percent. In the South Africa 20.1 rural areas, infection rates are now approaching 20 percent. Swaziland 33.4 Cumulative HIV/AIDS-related deaths amounted to 13,880 by the end of 2001, a nearly tenfold increase since 1995, and are projected to exceed 23,000 by 2006. Life expectancy at birth has declined to about 44 years from 60 in 1991, and may fall to 40 years by 2006. The number of orphans is also increasing. In 2002, they numbered 83,000, about 5 percent of the population, and more than half resulted from the death of one or both parents from AIDS. This number could reach over 140,000 by 2010. The government’s efforts to combat the AIDS crisis are coordinated at the cabinet level by the National AIDS Committee (NAC), and at the operational level by the Namibia AIDS Coordinating Committee (NAMACOC). NAC comprises ministers of key line ministries, with the Ministry of Health and Social Services as the lead agency, and NAMACOC comprises all permanent secretaries, regional governors, heads of parastatals, and civil society representatives. NAMACOC has an operational arm called the Executive Committee. Through this broad organizational structure, the government seeks to involve the social partners-ministries and agencies, the private sector, and civil society, as well as the donor community-in a coordinated effort to combat the disease on all fronts. The main focus of the ongoing efforts are prevention, including through education and communication, provision of care and support for persons with HIV/ AIDS, and effective monitoring of the disease. In the area of care provision, the government recently launched an antiretroviral treatment program on a pilot basis aimed at combating mother-to-child transmission. Government employees currently have access to antiretroviral treatment under a separate program, and some private firms are planning to introduce similar programs for employees. An Orphans’ and Vulnerable Children’s’ Fund has been established, which the Government proposes to support through an orphan tax that will come into effect in the fiscal year beginning in April 2003. Namibia is receiving international support for its efforts in areas such as capacity building, research, and the effective coordination of ongoing programs. Major financial assistance was announced recently by the Global Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - Namibia has recently qualified for assistance from the Global Fund, which could provide anti-HIV/AIDS financial support in excess of US$ZO million a year; other donors are also increasing their efforts in this area. A comprehensive treatment plan would cost much more than these contributions,i7 however, thereby providing another compelling argument for restraint in other fiscal expenditures. D. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook 42. The staff has prepared a medium-term outlook presented in Table 11, which is consistent with the illustrative fiscal adjustment scenario discussed in paragraph 23. Such a scenario envisages a rise in real GDP growth to 4.3 percent, on average, in 2004-07.‘8 The balance of payments would strengthen with increased output from new mines (mineral production is expected to grow by about 8 percent a year over the next five years), an expansion of nontraditional exports, such as leather and table grapes, and continued export diversification facilitated by industrial country trade preferences. As a result, the external current account surplus would rise from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.4 percent in 2007. In the capital account, outflows of portfolio investment to South Africa would continue, although at a declining rate. As noted above, improving the prospects for investment and achieving higher rates of growth would require bolder structural and institutional changes, including privatization of public enterprises, substantial additional foreign assistance, and a significant change in risk perceptions. E. Statistical Issues 43. Namibia has continued to strengthen its statistical capabilities, but much remains to be done. The assessment of macroeconomic developments is still hampered by long reporting lags in fiscal and labor market data, large revisions in balance of payments data, and the limited scope of the consumer price index. A recent Fund ROSC (report on the Observance of Standards and Codes) in the statistical area has resulted in a program of wide- ranging improvements. l9 In particular, progress is being made in developing a countrywide consumer price index, which is almost ready for publication. In addition, the Fund is providing technical assistance on balance of payments statistics. Namibia participates in the l7 Assuming that the proportion of the population that eventually develops AIDS can be limited to the 13 percent of the population that is currently HIV positive, the cost of universal treatment (at current prices) would rise over the next 10 years to as much as 8 percent of GDP. l8 The scenario does not take explicit account of the impact of AIDS. A 2001 World Bank study suggested that AIDS was already reducing Namibia’s potential growth rate by 0.8 percentage point, an impact that would double over the next 15 years. i9 SM/02/285 (9/3/03) and Sups. 1 and 2.

STAFF APPRAISAL 44. Namibia’s per capita income is among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, but the country has a skewed income distribution and a high rate of unemployment. Over the last five years, real GDP growth has averaged slightly above 3 percent, the external current account has remained in surplus, and inflation has increased somewhat to the low double digits, owing to the depreciation of the currency vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar during the second half of 2001 and the regional food shortage. At the same time, the fiscal position has deteriorated significantly. 45. The immediate prospects for the economy are broadly favorable, owing to peace in Angola, new trade opportunities, and new mining developments. In addition, the recent recovery of the South African rand (to which the Namibian dollar is pegged), together with the prospect of an alleviation of the regional food shortage, suggests that Namibia’s inflation rate should now begin to retreat from its recent highs. Looking towards the medium term, however, the central policy challenge continues to achieve higher growth to alleviate poverty and raise the living standards of the majority of the population. This requires continuing attention to the structural impediments to growth, as well as the adoption of policies consistent with maintaining the country’s enviable record of macroeconomic stability. To some extent, however, the perception of high country risk that also affects other countries in the region constrains the additional investment needed for higher growth. 46. The government deficit increased over the last two years, owing to a decline in SACU revenue and significant increases in most expenditure areas, including support provided to public enterprises. Moreover, the deficit is expected to increase over the medium term in the absence of corrective measures, and thus lead to a growing debt ratio. In these circumstances, the staff supports the government’s medium-term objectives of reducing the deficit to no more than 3 percent of GDP in order to achieve a sustainable fiscal position. 47. Fiscal support for public enterprises substantially exceeded budget projections over the last two years, mainly because of past inadequacies in strategic and managerial decisions. In this regard, the authorities should move ahead vigorously with the ongoing reforms being introduced in some enterprises. These reforms, together with the establishment of high-level supervisory committees, are expected to eliminate the need for further government assistance. 48. Personnel expenditure has been declining relative to GDP but remains substantially higher than in most of Namibia’s neighbors, partly because government employment of ex- combatants has added to the number of personnel. The staff welcomes the authorities’ assurance that there will be little need for additional hiring in this category, and that such positions will not be refilled when the current incumbents retire. More generally, the staff would urge the government to pay close attention to the size of the public service and the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 24 - levels of remuneration. The establishment of a Performance and Effectiveness Management Program within the government should enhance policy formulation in this area. 49. Once progress is made in the areas of support for public enterprises and personnel expenditures, the government should be well placed to achieve its fiscal objectives over the medium term, even if SACU revenues continue to decline, as expected. On the revenue side, the completion of the tax study initiated in 2001 will help the government broaden the tax base and simplify the tax system. It will also be important to reverse the recent decline in the share of fiscal resources allocated to health and education. 50. The staff urges the authorities to avoid using supplementary budgets other than to meet critical unforeseen needs that exceed the budgetary contingency allocation. Other expenditures should be evaluated in light of competing demands and the government’s medium-term fiscal objectives. As for budget implementation, the development of a public finance management system to enhance expenditure control is welcome. 51. Namibia’s membership in the CMA and SACU appears to be serving the country well. The region’s dependence on primary commodity exports and vulnerability to swings in international confidence does result in currency fluctuations, but the link to the rand means that Namibia shares the broad financial stability that South Africa maintains through its prudent policies. In addition, the real effective depreciation experienced by the Namibian dollar since the mid-1990s has helped strengthen external competitiveness and has stimulated the growth of nontraditional exports. 52. The staff welcomes the study of options regarding international reserves that is being carried out by the Bank of Namibia. The main support for the Namibia dollar will come from prudent fiscal and monetary policies, but as international reserves are somewhat lower in relation to imports than elsewhere in the region, the country may wish to consider a gradual buildup of reserves. In this connection, the staff would encourage the authorities to tighten credit conditions in order to strengthen the reserve position. 53. Namibia’s banking system has been strengthened in recent years, with the proportion of nonperforming loans declining markedly. At the same time, financial intermediation is becoming more efficient because of financial innovation. The staff welcomes proposals for increasing competition in the financial sector and encourages the authorities to press ahead with their plans to further strengthen supervision and begin applying stricter requirements based on new international standards. Banks’ loan portfolios should be monitored closely in view of the recent expansion of credit to the private sector. 54. On the structural side, the financial problems of some public enterprises have affected adversely service delivery in key sectors of the economy. The staff welcomes the strengthened oversight of these enterprises through the creation of high-level governance and divestiture committees and urges the authorities to press ahead with privatization while persevering with efforts to build political support for it.

In this regard, the introduction of more effective mechanisms for resolving labor disputes should enhance labor productivity and market flexibility. The voluntary agreement on minimum wage standards in commercial farming can, if it does not inhibit employment, also play a positive role. 56. Historic injustices make the problem of land reform a sensitive issue in Namibia, and one that needs to be addressed in a way that promotes growth and poverty alleviation. The recent legislation for the empowerment of farmers in the communal areas through enhancement of property rights should help in this regard. 57. The shortage of technical skills is clearly a major problem, with additional efficient investment in human capital one of the most critical requirements for higher growth. Moreover, existing human capital is being eroded by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and it is essential that the government move quickly, not only to stem the spread of the disease but also to treat the current victims. Formal sector employers, including the government, have begun to offer antiretroviral treatment, but there is a need to extend this treatment to other members of society. The declining cost of antiretroviral drugs and the financial support expected from the Global Fund will help in this regard. Freeing fiscal resources for this purpose is another important reason for government restraint on expenditures in other areas. 58. Membership in SACU means that Namibia is integrated into the largest market in sub-Saharan Africa. Looking ahead, SACU’s shift to more outward-looking trade policies should help Namibia to take fuller advantage of the region’s growing integration with the world economy. 59. An increase in donor support is needed not only to improve HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, but more generally to meet Namibia’s developmental objectives. While Namibia’s per capita income is higher than in many other African countries, a large proportion of the population has incomes little higher than subsistence levels. Additional aid could help Namibia deal better with the challenge of achieving both higher growth and greater equity. 60. Namibia’s data are generally adequate for surveillance purposes, although there are substantial weaknesses in some areas. The staff supports the authorities’ plans for improvements in light of the recommendations made in the recent ROSC report and welcomes Namibia’s participation in the General Data Dissemination System. 61. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Namibia be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Namibia joined the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1990. Current World Bank involvement in Namibia focuses on providing technical assistance to support the government’s efforts to reduce poverty, build local capacity, and enhance management of water resources. There are no IBRD loans to Namibia. With a GDP per capita of $1,960 (2001), Namibia is not eligible for International Development Association (IDA) assistance. The Bank Group’s involvement is mainly through economic and sector work. The main economic and sector studies completed include the following: l Poverty Strategy (1998); l Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (1999); l Emerging Pension System: Evaluation, Challenges and Options (2000); and l Selected Development Impact of HIV/AIDS (2001). 2. A study on human capital development and knowledge management for economic growth has been under way and will be completed by the end of 2003. It focuses on analysis of primary, secondary, and tertiary education subsectors; cost and financing of education; assessment of capacity for knowledge creation and management; linkages among labor markets, education, and skills development; and as analysis of sources of growth, employment creation, and equity. The Bank is supporting the government’s request to conduct a public expenditure- tracking survey through an Institutional Development Facility (IDF) grant. In the environment area, the Bank is supporting Namibia’s Integrated Ecosystem Management through the National Conservancy Network Program, and the Namibia Coast Biodiversity Management and Conservation Project (NACOMA) through Global Environment Facility (GEF). 3. In fiscal-year (FY) 2004, the World Bank Group will launch a multiyear study to examine sources of sustainable growth and employment . An urban support project that would deal with subnational governments and service delivery through fiscal decentralization is under preparation. 4. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) of the IFC is involved in improving Namibia’s investment infrastructure. The IFC has a loan investment in a fishery project (Pescanova); an equity investment in Namibia’s first indigenous life insurance company (Namibia Life); and approved in 1999, a loan of US$1.4 million to help finance a US$6.5 million 120-room Best Western hotel in northern Namibia. Early in 1999, IFC also worked with the Namibian Agronomic Board to raise trust funds that helped fund a feasibility study of a cotton ginning industry. Namibia joined MIGA in 1990, but no guarantees have been made to date. MIGA has, however, launched the AFRI-IPA support program, headquartered in Namibia, to provide technical assistance to African countries.

Some of the core data for surveillance-the exchange rate, international reserves, reserve money, and interest rates-are available on a monthly basis with reasonable promptness. Although the reliability, quality, and coverage of these data are generally satisfactory, some weaknesses remain that need to be addressed. The core real sector data and the balance of payments and international investment position data are reported on an annual frequency only. Real sector 2. The authorities do not report any real sector data to STA; data published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) are taken from publications of Namibia’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The present consumer price index covers only the capital city of Windhoek. Two STA missions in May-June and September 2002 provided technical assistance to the CBS in compiling a nationwide consumer price index. It is planned that the new index will be published in January 2002, with historical indices starting in December 2001. 3. The failure to collect systematically data on the labor market, including labor force, employment, and wages, impedes the analysis of labor market developments. Actions are being taken to rectify this situation with the creation of the capacity in the Central Bureau of Statistics required to collect and analyze labor market statistics. In addition, a Labor Market Information System is to be established within the Ministry of Labor and Employment to monitor labor market trends. Government finance 4. After a long absence, the authorities resumed reporting of fiscal data to STA. Central government budgetary data through 2000 were reported for publication in the 200 1 Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook, and the same data are being published in IFS. However, no data were reported for publication in the 2002 GFS Yearbook. 5. Actual expenditure data of line ministries are not available soon after the end of the fiscal year, and are also subject to frequent revisions. The system for expenditure information needs to be strengthened: provisional information on the cash expenditures of ministries should be available more speedily; and exercises to reconcile the above-the-line estimates with financing data should be conducted more frequently. Monetary accounts 6. Following the introduction of an IFS page in 1994, reporting of monetary data has been timely and comprehensive. However, the January 2002 data module Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission found that data sources used to compile the Bank of Namibia accounts did not permit adequate classification, owing to the lack of necessary detail. Therefore, the follow-up monetary and financial statistics mission in July 2002 Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-35 - APPENDIX III assisted the authorities in establishing a bridge table for compilation of the central bank’s monetary accounts. In accordance with the data module ROSC mission, the Bank of Namibia has developed a migration path for the implementation of the methodology and data presentation formats envisaged in the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The action plan provides for production of a complete set of monetary statistics in the framework of the Depository Corporations Survey, to be taken in the months ahead. Balance of payments 7. Until 200 1, Namibia reported balance of payments and international investment position data on an annual frequency. Since then, the Bank of Namibia has been reporting quarterly balance of payments data with a lag of one quarter. However, the quarterly data are subject to substantial revisions. The methodology underlying the balance of payments is broadly consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance ofPayments Manual. The Bank of Namibia is currently receiving Fund technical assistance, focused mainly on improving the data collection for, and compilation of, capital and financial account transactions and international investment statistics.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Namibia On [April 18, 20031, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Namibia.20 Background Since 1997, production in Namibia has been shifting away from the primary and government sectors, and growth in the rest of the economy has risen to 4.6 percent a year. However, the overall growth rate of 3.2 percent a year has not been sufficient to produce significant gains in per capita income or a substantial reduction in poverty. Exports of primary commodities were relatively weak during this period because of climatic conditions and adverse developments in world markets, but nontraditional manufactures grew by 14 percent a year, albeit from a very small base. After slowing to 2.4 percent in 2001 because of declines in the production and processing of primary commodities, real GDP growth increased slightly to 2.7 percent in 2002. Inflation exceeded 11 percent in 2002, the highest rate since 1992, reflecting regional food shortages and the weakening in 2001 of the Namibia dollar, which is pegged to the rand. Namibia’s exports increased in 2002 because of improved climatic conditions and stronger world markets, and the external current account surplus 2o Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [April 18, 20031 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

In the course of the year, the Namibia dollar strengthened in real effective terms, reversing part of its earlier depreciation. After declining to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2000/01, the fiscal deficit rose to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2001102 and the ratio of government debt to GDP rose above the government’s medium-term target of 25 percent. The deficit is estimated to have declined to 4.0 percent in 2002/03, in part because government salaries were frozen in 2002/03 and the expenditure allocations for goods and services in most ministries were reduced. However, the deficit still remained above the authorities’ medium-term target of 3 percent of GDP. One of the main factors behind these relatively large deficits has been the need to provide substantial support for troubled public enterprises. Namibia has close ties with neighboring countries through the Common Monetary Area (CMA), which provides access to South African financial services and, through the tie to the rand, promotes sound macroeconomic policies. In addition, as a member of the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), Namibia participates in the largest market in Sub-Saharan Africa. SACU is becoming more open over time, enhancing Namibia’s access to the global economy. As SACU reduces its tariff barriers, however, customs receipts are declining relative to other sources of revenue. Given the peg of the Namibia dollar to the rand under the CMA, the scope for an independent monetary policy is limited. In line with developments in South Africa, during 2002 the bank rate (the interest rate charged by the central bank to banks for liquidity purposes) was raised to 12.75 percent. Monetary growth increased moderately to 6.9 percent, and credit to the private sector rose by 20.4 percent. Namibia’s short-term economic prospects are broadly positive, reflecting peace in Angola, increasing access to international markets, and new mining developments. Moreover, its high rate of savings means that the availability of domestic resources is not a constraint on growth. However, HIV/AIDS is taking an increasing toll, with infection rates exceeding 20 percent of the adult population.
