The growth rate is now well below the government’s target of 8 percent annual growth needed to reduce poverty significantly. Some progress was made with structural reforms but fiscal consolidation has proven elusive, and large deficits and debts remain a significant drag on growth. l During 2002/03, macroeconomic developments were mixed. Growth slowed to less than 4% percent from 5% percent in 2001/02, and fiscal imbalances were unchecked, with a general government deficit and debt of about, respectively, over 10 percent of GDP and 84 percent of GDP. On the positive side, export growth was strong, the current account remained in surplus, interest rates fell to their lowest level in several years, and international reserves reached an all-time high. Inflation has picked up in recent months primarily due to supply-side factors, but is now coming down. The 2003/04 budget is heavily slanted toward attempting to stimulate growth rather than fiscal adjustment. l Medium-term prospects depend critically on the pace of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation. Growth is projected to rebound to 5% percent in 2003/04 and, with modest fiscal consolidation and other gradual reforms, to accelerate to 6 percent over the medium-term. In this scenario, the debt stock would only stabilize in 2008/09, with various stress tests illustrating the precarious state of public finances and the limited room for maneuver in the face of shocks. l The pending passage of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill offers an opportunity to announce a time-bound plan to restore fiscal sustainability. A credible plan would include the early introduction of medium-term fiscal planning, the adoption of clearly-specified fiscal rules, and a strong commitment to the medium-term targets. Reports produced by the government in recent years on tax and expenditure reforms could be used to draw a roadmap for fiscal reforms with explicit timetables. l Urgent action is needed to correct state government fiscal imbalances. Notwithstanding recent reform efforts, state finances have shown only limited improvement. In this regard, the priority is to develop the necessary consensus to implement the VAT within the current fiscal year. l Maintaining an easy monetary policy stance is appropriate, but greater flexibility is needed in managing the exchange rate. An easy monetary policy stance is appropriate in light of the still weak economy and subsiding inflation. The continued strength in the external accounts presents an opportunity to allow greater flexibility in the exchange rate and further liberalize external transactions. l Steady progress is being made in strengthening the financial sector, but stronger efforts are needed to accelerate agricultural, industrial, and labor market reforms.

India’s impressive economic growth of the mid-1990s-fruits of the reforms of the early 1990s-slowed significantly in recent years. The slowdown reflects a prolonged period of weak investment demand. Although cyclical and exogenous factors played a role, GDP Growth Since 1991/92 the persistent weakness suggests that economic (In percent) activity was also held back by the large fiscal 8 imbalances and structural impediments. 2. The last several Article IV consultations were dominated by discussions of policies to reinvigorate the momentum of ;!p& t o ~~ -~-I ---,I~ II, -1 growth so as to reduce poverty. Executive 91192 93194 95196 97198 99100 01102 Directors endorsed the program of “second , generation” reforms that was laid out in the January 200 1 report of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council.’ This report explicitly recognized that simultaneous progress is needed on the intertwined tasks of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Key policy recommendations in the report included a reduction in the fiscal deficit by raising revenues and reducing subsidies; financial sector reforms; trade liberalization; further liberalization of industry and agriculture; reforms of the labor market and bankruptcy laws; and reducing government ownership in the economy. 3. Many significant reform milestones were achieved in recent years. Steady progress was made in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework for the financial sector; the trade regime was liberalized through the removal of quantitative restrictions and reduction of tariffs; cautious capital account liberalization was implemented; the administered price mechanism for petroleum products was dismantled; administered interest rates were lowered and linked to market rates; and, in the first half of 2002, good .- progress was made with the privatization proe passing reform legislation, including laws that facilitate the resolution of banks’ nonperforming assets (NPAs), modernize the competition regime, and allow greater competition in the power sector. 4. However, fiscal consolidation remains elusive. The authorities recognize fiscal consolidation as the critical policy priority-as mentioned in several official am. Significant headway was also made in 7 I India: Central Government Fiscal Deficits (hpercenro,GDP, ~u,hont,rs'delinrnonl) ’ See Box 5 in SM/O1/156 for a summary of the policy recommendations.

However, it has been difficult to generate the necessary consensus for the specific actions required to put the deficit on a downward path. Only limited progress was made in addressing the critical need to raise revenue and to reorient public expenditure towards addressing India’s acute infrastructure needs. The general government deficit has been close to 10 percent of GDP for the past four years. Consequently, the size of adjustment needed to restore fiscal solvency is now significantly larger than in 2000/01 ,2 when the fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) bill (Box 1) was first proposed.3 5. This year’s consultation took place against a backdrop of preparations for important state-level elections. These elections are seen as a bellwether for the upcoming national elections (due by October 2004). Market sentiment is that progress with reforms could be hampered as preparations for the national elections move to center stage. In recent weeks, there have been some protests against reforms, especially trade liberalization, tax reforms, disinvestment, and labor market reform. II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS 6. Economic activity in 2002/03 was uneven across sectors. Growth is estimated to have slowed to 4% percent in 2002/03 from 5% percent in 2001/02, with the sharp drought-induced decline in agriculture (by 3 percent) offsetting the recovery in industry and the strong growth in services. Infrastructure-related industries led the industrial recovery, on the back of the national highways development project (Table 1 and Figure 1). Capital goods production picked up but production of consumer durables remains weak. 7. Headline and underlying inflation increased in recent months. WPI inflation rose from under 2 percent in April 2002 to about 6l% percent in end-March 2003 before subsiding again to around 5 percent in early India: Contributions to Real GDP Growth India: WPIInflation and Components 2 The fiscal year runs from April to March. 3 The FRBM was passed in the lower house of Parliament in May 2003 and is expected to pass the upper house in July-August.

India: Fiscal Responsibility Legislation The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) bill was first tabled in Parliament in December 2000 and was expected to be brought to vote in the fall of 200 1. ’ Following a parliamentary standing committee review, the bill was revised and resubmitted in December 2002, and passed by the lower house of Parliament in May 2003. It is expected to be considered by the upper house of parliament in July/August 2003. The bill establishes formal deficit targets. The central government revenue (current) deficit is to be eliminated by March 3 1 2008 and an “adequate” surplus is to be built up thereafter. The government is required to set annual targets on the revenue deficit and on the overall fiscal deficit, outstanding guarantees and the total liabilities of the central government (all as a percent of GDP). The annual targets on the revenue and overall deficit can be waived for reasons of national security; natural calamity, and on any other grounds the central government may specify. Parliament has to be notified of the grounds on which the targets have been exceeded. Central government borrowing from the RBI, other than for smoothing cash flow, is to be phased out by April 2005 and prohibited thereafter. The bill mandates greater transparency in the central government fiscal operations and introduces various mechanisms to strengthen budget implementation. Three documents are to be presented annually to Parliament outlining the government’s fiscal and macroeconomic strategy. The first, a Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, assesses the sustainability of the revenue balance and use of capital receipts for investment within a framework of three-year rolling targets. The second, the Fiscal Strategy Statement, articulates the government’s tax, expenditure, investment and borrowing polices and evaluates fiscal performance relative to the annual targets. The third, the Macroeconomic Framework Statement assesses growth prospects, the balance of payments, and fiscal performance. The government is required to report quarterly to Parliament on budget implementation. In the event of deviations from the target (actual or expected) the bill authorizes the government to take corrective action on revenue or expenditure (excluding statutory obligations). l/ See SM/01/156 for the provisions of the original FRBM.

The pickup was due mostly to supply side factors-higher global oil prices and a drought, which affected edible oil prices. More recently, various measures of underlying inflation-e.g., nonfood manufactured goods prices-have also risen from 2 percent on average in the second half of 2002 to 4% percent by end-May 2003.

Notwithstanding the relatively strong growth in non-oil imports (13 l/4 percent in 2002/03), another year of current account surpluses was recorded in 2002/03 (Table 2 and Figure 2). The capital account was also in surplus, with inflows driven by expectation of a rupee appreciation in the face of a weakening dollar, a highly favorable interest rate differential, and changes in international banking practices (Box 2). As a result, reserves rose to over $82 billion in mid-June. sector undertakings (PSUsj reflected events specific to India. After rising as a result of the strong momentum behind disinvestment, the abrupt stop to privatization in September forced a sharp correction in the PSU index. Since then, strong profits in public sector banks (PSBs) have driven the index up again. 9. Financial markets were characterized by general weakness in equity prices, coupled with a sharp rise in bond prices, mirroring developments in global and regional markets.

India: The Foreign Reserves Buildup Between September 2001 and May 2003, India’s foreign reserves grew by more than $36 billion. This box analyzes the factors underlying the reserve buildup by examining the behavior of balance of payments flows relative to the average of flows in the three years before September 200 1. The analysis is based on data through December 2002-the latest available balance of payments data-but the same trends appear to have continued thus far in 2003.

For the first time since 1949, the current account has been in surplus for five consecutive quarters. During September 2001- December 2002, the cumulative surplus was $5.6 billion, an improvement of $9.0 billion compared to an average deficit of $3.4 billion in the three years before September 2001. The shift in the current account balance primarily reflects an improved goods and services trade balance and buoyant net private transfers. Valuation changes on the stock of reserves also contributed to the measured reserves buildup. Capital inflows- especially, banking capital and, to a lesser extent, nonresident Indian (NRI) deposits, and FDI-have also increased compared to the previous trend.

India: Interest Rate Spread and Nondehverable Forward ii India’s competitive advantage in IT-enabled services exports: In the last two years, these exports have increased by $3.3 billion (an average of about 24 percent a year), reaching $9.5 billion dollars in 2002/03 and explaining part of the improvement in the current account balance. Interest rate differential: The spread between global (especially, U.S. dollar) and rupee interest rates could also be encouraging inflows, particularly with expectations of a steady or appreciating rupee (see below). NRIs and corporates (who may normally hold dollar deposits) have found it advantageous to switch to rupee deposits and, for corporates and banks, to borrow abroad. Expectations of rupee appreciation: Although the rupee appreciated by about 3% percent versus the U.S. dollar in the year to end-April, it depreciated by about 6 percent in real effective terms during the same period and about 10 percent since mid-200 1. A number of market analysts have suggested that the rupee is currently undervalued, because the rupee is below its long-run average in real effective terms. With a strong current account, the market now expects the rupee to appreciate or at least remain stable, in contrast to historical trends. This expectation, along with the interest rate differential, has led exporters to remit proceeds more quickly, importers and other corporates to reduce hedging against a rupee depreciation, and banks to increase external borrowing (up to regulatory limits) and reduce investments aboard. Ongoing liberalization: A confidence boost from ongoing capital account liberalization, including related to the repatriation of NRI deposits, may explain part of the increase in capital inflows. In addition, the increase in FDI inflows is partly attributable to investment in the recently liberalized telecommunications sector and buyback of equity shares by multinational companies. Changes in banking regulations and practices: Some foreign banks may have brought in additional capital to meet the RBI’s new guidelines on exposure ceilings for foreign banks (these were now to be set based only on capital funds in India instead of both capital funds and external commercial borrowing). In addition, due to concerns about money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, industrial countries have been attempting to increase disclosure rules for international bank accounts. This may have induced funds, previously held overseas, to be remitted to India.

Monetary and exchange rate policy was aimed at maintaining easy liquidity conditions while also attempting to limit volatility in the rupee and stem its appreciation. Since April 2002, the bank rate-the key policy signaling rate-has been reduced by 50 basis points (bps) to 6 percent, the repo rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 1 percentage point India: Deposit and Lending Rates Prrcmr per annum to 4% percent. At the same time, the RBI continued to mop up foreign exchange through sterilized intervention out of concern about the impact on competitiveness. In the year to April 2003, the rupee appreciated by 3 % percent against the U.S. dollar, but depreciated by 6 percent in real effective terms. The authorities also further opened up the capital account and prepaid $3 billion in external debt to the World Bank and AsDB. More recently, the government announced its intention to prepay additional external debt, India: Bank Credit to Commercial Sector step up its efforts as an aid donor, and write-off the dues of a number of HIPCS.~ 11.

India: Factors Underlying Recent Interest Rate Behavior In recent years, interest rates in India have undergone a secular decline across the maturity spectrum despite the fact that fiscal imbalances have remained unchecked. Between 1997/98-2002/03, the bank rate and the repo rate were lowered by 425 bps and 280 bps, respectively, with yields on the 91-day and IO-year government securities falling by nearly 150 bps and 600 bps, respectively. In addition, the weighted average maturity of government securities issued increased from 6% years in 1997/98 to almost 14 years in 2002/03. As a result, the average maturity of the outstanding stock rose by two years to 8% years, while the weighted average yield fell by 450 bps to 7% percent. Structural and cyclical factors could explain these developments: Structural factors: Interest rates have been pushed down by the move to more flexible and market determined rates, greater competition in the financial sector, increasing use of securitized and variable-rate loans, and a deepening of the government securities India: Interest Rates Percen1perannrm market (aided by the development of 15 , , 15 benchmark government securities and consolidation of new issues in key maturities and by reissuing existing loans). Capital controls on inflows have been eased and nonresident Indians’ foreign currency accounts have been made fully repatriable. This has resulted in larger inflows and a closer link between domestic and foreign interest rates. The prospect of a soft interest rate regime in India became more credible with the strengthening of the balance of payments. Trade liberalization and the large food grain stocks have helped lower inflation and dampen inflationary expectations. Cyclical factors: A weakening of global output and consequent monetary easing has pushed down interest rates in both India and abroad. This has been reinforced by a softening of inflation worldwide. In addition, declining equity prices around the world have caused funds to shift to bonds and further lowered yields. Although it is difficult to quantify the impact of these factors on interest rates, on balance, the easy liquidity conditions coupled with weak domestic investment demand appear to be a major factors contributing to the sharp fall in interest rates. Going forward, the behavior of interest rates will depend on the timing and magnitude of changes in underlying cyclical conditions in India and in global markets. While structural improvements are likely to have yielded a permanent reduction in the level of interest rates, a recovery in private sector investment and credit demand could put upward pressure on interest rates and end the unusual set of circumstances that have allowed growing government financing needs to coexist with falling interest rates.

However, lending rates have not fallen commensurately.6 Nonetheless, nonfood credit growth rose to over 17 percent (y/y), mainly reflecting a sharp increase in mortgage lending (Table 3 and Figure 5). Large corporates appear to have shifted to the commercial paper and corporate bond markets as its major funding sources. 12. Central government fiscal imbalances in 2002/03 were worse than expected in the budget. The provisionally estimated deficit (including privatization receipts in revenues) is 5.9 percent of GDP, compared with the budget target of 5.3 percent of GDP (Table 4).7 The deviation reflects significant shortfalls in Selected Fiscal Indicators (In percent of GDP) I/ I99W9 I 2000/01 2”“1/“2 2002/03 2003/04 Actual Actual Pro”.

The outcome for the subnational governments in 2002/03 is also likely to be worse than budgeted. The staff estimates the deficit at 4% percent of GDP, compared with a budget target of 4 percent of GDP. Revenue shortfalls, on states’ own tax sources and on transfers from the center, are expected to be the main factors underlying the weaker outcome. Consequently, the general government deficit in 2002/03 is estimated to be about 10 percent of GDP and debt at about 84 percent of GDP (Table 5 and Figure 6). 6 The prime lending rate (PLR) has fallen by only 50 bps since early 2002. However, with a larger amount of lending taking place at sub-PLR rates, effective lending rates have fallen by somewhat more. 7 Using the staffs definition with privatization receipts below the line, the equivalent comparison would be 6 percent of GDP relative to the budget target of 5.8 percent of GDP.

As outlined in the April WEO, the economy is projected to grow at 5% percent in 2003/04, broadly in line with consensus forecasts but below the authorities’ forecast of 6 percent. The projection incorporates a recovery in agriculture, assuming a normal monsoon, and some deceleration in the growth of industry and services, taking into account the lagged negative impact of the drought. WPI inflation is expected to moderate to around 4 percent by end-2003/04. The external current account is projected to remain in surplus. 15. India’s medium-term prospects depend critically on the pace of reforms and fiscal consolidation (Annex I).The baseline scenario has growth reaching 6 percent-a rate that most observers agree is feasible with a modest policy effort, provided normal weather conditions prevail (Table 6). It should be noted that this scenario is premised on a somewhat stronger fiscal adjustment effort than has been achieved in recent years. Nonetheless, the general government deficit would decline only by around % percentage points by 2008/09, and the debt stock would remain high and would not stabilize within the forecast period. 16. Although the growth rate may appear satisfactory from an international perspective, it falls short of the authorities’ own target of 8 percent and implies a slow catch-up to advanced country income levels. Amongst a group of 118 developing countries, India ranked 15th in terms of per capita GDP growth during the period 1992-97. In the most recent three years, with per capita growth of 3 percent, India fell to 39th place. At this rate, it would take nearly 100 years for India to reach the 2002 per capita GDP (on a PPP basis) of the United States. The achievement of the plan targets for poverty reduction under the 10th Five Year Plan (2002-07)-the poverty rate is to be reduced from 26 percent to 21 percent by 2007 and to 11 percent by 2012-would be at risk. 17. Moreover, in the baseline scenario, India’s public finances would remain in a precarious state and there would be little room for maneuver in the face of adverse shocks. Despite the apparent ease with which the fiscal deficit has been financed in the past two years, capital spending has been crowded out and resources for private investment are How Are Household Financial Savings Used? l! (In percenr of householdjinonctal savingx, being preempted. Indeed, more than 90 percent of household financial saving is now being used to finance the gap between public sector investment and saving, up from 65-70 percent in the mid-1990s. The fiscal situation is also hampering the government’s ability to advance the structural reform agenda and play a leadership role in driving the states’ reform process. Stress tests of the fiscal situation (Table 7) assume (1) lower growth in the next two years; (2) higher interest rates, with a reversal of some of the factors that have contributed to the recent fall in interest rates; and (3) an increase in the debt ratio possibly as some contingent liabilities in the form of central Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15- and state governments guarantees devolve as actual liabilities.8 In each of these cases, the debt stock would rise sharply and the economy could come under severe stress (including from the impact on banks’ balance sheets of an increase in interest rates). 18. The mission discussed an alternative scenario in which the economy could become entrenched in a cycle of slowing growth. If the lack of progress in reducing the primary deficit continues into the medium term, the general government deficit would rise by over 2 percent of GDP in the projection period. Higher interest rates would keep private investment at a depressed level, with growth slowing to below 5 percent. In this scenario, general government debt would rise to around 100 percent of GDP and there would be little progress with poverty reduction 19. In contrast, strong fiscal consolidation and accelerated structural reforms could trigger a virtuous cycle of higher growth and improving public finances. In this scenario, fiscal adjustment is assumed to take place along the lines required by the FRBM. Confidence effects, increased public saving, and a reorientation of public expenditure toward productive infrastructure spending would together drive down interest rates, boost investment, and raise growth to around 7% percent-a rate that is potentially well within India’s reach. 20. India’s vulnerability to an external crisis is limited by its large reserves and the low level of external public debt (Table 8). Nevertheless, a combination of weak growth, large fiscal imbalances, a closely managed exchange rate, and financial sector weakness, in an environment of freer capital account movements, might set the stage for a buildup of vulnerabilities that could eventually become severe in the event of exogenous shocks, IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 21. Despite the signs of strength in the economy, the trend slowdown in growth is a serious concern. Even in the face of a weak global environment and a severe drought, an industrial recovery is underway, corporate sector performance is improving (Box 4), exports have grown strongly, inflation is under control, interest rates have fallen sharply, and the external position is very comfortable. However, growth remains far below potential. The discussions thus focused on the policy requirements for sustained high growth, with emphasis on the urgent need for a sustainable fiscal adjustment strategy, and a strong push on structural reforms in various sectors to fully unshackle the economy’s potential. A. Fiscal Policy 22. The authorities stressed that, in framing the 2003/04 budget, their aim was to balance the need for fiscal consolidation with the need to support growth.

India: Corporate Sector Performance Recent signs point to some improvement in corporate sector performance largely owing to cost containment. Facing more intense competition, the corporate sector began to take steps in the mid and late 1990s to reduce costs, restructure debt, and rationalize output. The slump in industrial activity from 2000 has reinforced the need for cost-cutting measures. Based on surveys of large private companies prepared by the RBI, overall finances have shown modest improvement since 2000/01. Despite declining sales growth, companies benefited from a moderation in the growth of material and wage costs and, more recently, a decline in borrowing costs. Focusing on the first half of 2002/03, the growth in sales outpaced expenses and was highest in heavy industry (iron/steel, automobiles, and electrical machinery), pharmaceuticals, and IT, as well as food processing (including sugar). Facing flagging domestic demand and reflecting improved competitiveness, large companies have been increasing exports as a share of sales since the late 1990s. The corporate sector has increasingly relied on internal rather than external sources (i.e., outside the firm) of funds to meet financing requirements. This situation initially arose out of the need to lower debt service burdens in the face India: Finances of Large Private Companies 199Y/OU 2000/01 2OOllO2 2001102 2002103 HI HI Large pubhc bmited compames Ii Debt to equty 69.2 Current ratlo 1.3 Sales 2, 12.2 Non-Interest 213, expenses 12.9 Gross pro!3 to sales 9.7 Interest payments 2/ 8.4 Return on equty 5.3 Pnvate corporate 41 samg 3.7 Private corporate l”“estment 6.5 68.0 68.8 .., 1.3 I.2 8.5 7.4 3.2 8.1 8.0 5.1 2.9 8.0 9.5 9.7 II 6 11.9 4.9 5.3 IO -10.6 6.3 6.4 4.1 40 4.9 4.8 of industrial slowdown and corporate restructuring. More recently, even though liquidity conditions have been relatively lax, banks’ preference has been to hold government securities. For all but the top corporates, which can place AAA-rated debt only 50-100 bps above government debt, borrowing costs remain high. To counter this, companies have become more efficient in inventory management practices (as evidenced by sharp declines in the ratios of inventory and of working capital to sales since the late 1990s) and consequently lowered their short-term financing needs. However, long-term financing needed to fund new investment remains a constraint to growth, especially for small- and medium-scale enterprises. Corporate balance sheets show a modest improvement, although this is not uniform across all industries. Debt to equity (D/E) ratios have declined slightly, with the notable exception of capital-intensive sectors like iron and steel, cement, textile, and fertilizer, where ratios have risen in recent years. D/E ratios have fallen faster and are considerably lower for manufacturing companies in the private (including joint ventures) versus the public sector. Liquidity indicators such as the current and quick ratios have stayed largely unchanged or, in the case of manufacturing, weakened to some extent. There is limited information on unhedged foreign currency exposure by companies, but recent anecdotal evidence suggests a sizable buildup owing to the interest rate differential and the steady appreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. In its monetary and credit policy statement for 2003/04 (April 2003), the RBI cautioned against the increased use of unhedged foreign currency borrowing arising from expectations of future exchange rate movements.

A central plank of the budget is the promotion of infrastructure projects worth Rs. 600 billion (2% percent of GDP) over the medium term through public-private partnerships, with the government expecting to contribute Rs. 20 billion annually. 23. Taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, the budget also aims to restructure the debt obligations of both the central and state governments. Over a three year period ending in 2004/05, all states’ debt owed to the central government with interest rates over 13 percent will be swapped for additional proceeds from small savings schemes and market loans, both of which currently have lower interest rates. In addition, the government also offered to buy back banks’ holdings of central government securities which carry high interest rates. These high interest but illiquid and thinly traded securities are to be bought back on a voluntary basis at a transparently determined price from banks that are in need of liquidity or that want to encash the premium on their bond holdings for making provisions on their NPAs. The authorities have allowed a tax deduction on the premium income if banks use it to increase provisions. 24. The budget for 2003/04 makes little headway in correcting fiscal imbalances. The mission welcomed the effort to base the budget on more realistic estimates of growth and revenue and the measures to improve tax administration. However, there were few other revenue-enhancing measures, and the budget does little to simplify the system and reduce the scope for discretion. Also, there were only a few measures on the expenditure side-the modest increase in fertilizer prices announced in the budget was rolled back early in the parliamentary debate. Consequently, downside risks to the achievement of the budget target are still present. These arise mainly from smaller revenues because of a lower base in 2002/03 than assumed in the budget, lower oil prices, an appreciating rupee, and smaller- than-expected privatization receipts. 25. The mission noted that the strategy of postponing consolidation while attempting to stimulate growth is fraught with risks. The budget is based on the premise that exemptions and tax breaks for certain industries and consumers and increased infrastructure 9 On the staffs definition, the deficit would be broadly unchanged in 2003/04 relative to 2002/03. lo In September 2002, the Finance Minister appointed two task forces-one on direct taxes and the other on indirect taxes-under the chairmanship of Dr. Vijay Kelkar.

Although there is an urgent need to improve infrastructure in India, the expected level of private sector participation is higher than has been seen in other countries. Since there is little room for the public sector to take on additional spending, the envisaged infrastructure investment may not materialize. 26. The mission noted that the debt swaps are largely zero-sum games and should not be a substitute for more fundamental reforms. The debt swap with the states will improve their financial balances. However, the center is using the funds received to repay its own debt held by the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), which in turn will face a higher deficit owing to the reduction in its interest earnings. The authorities agreed that this would be true, in principle, but noted that as long as strong growth of small savings deposits continues, deficits incurred by the NSSF can be paid for by new deposit inflows. 27. To restore fiscal sustainability, the key priority is to raise the revenue-GDP ratio coupled with a reorientation of expenditure to more productive uses. In this context, the mission strongly endorsed the diagnosis of the Kelkar task force reports that India’s tax system is characterized by a plethora of deductions and exemptions, and that simple, broad-based and low-rate systems are the fairest and most efficient revenue-raising mechanisms. Moreover, the least distortionary way to pursue social goals is to do so transparently on the expenditure side of the budget through targeted subsidies or direct income transfers, which would provide room to reorient public expenditure towards critical infrastructure needs. 28. The authorities stressed that fiscal consolidation remained an important policy goal. Serious consideration was being given to the Kelkar Task Force reports to improve revenue mobilization but given their far-reaching nature, the authorities would need time to build consensus for the reforms. On exemptions, the authorities noted that the only instances where exemptions were extended were for social causes or to promote key employment- and export-generating industries. On privatization receipts, they pointed out that with the sale of only a few big-ticket items, the privatization target could easily be met or even exceeded. 29. The authorities agreed that the states’ financial problems had reached a critical stage and need to be tackled with urgency (Box 5). They pointed to the range of actions that had been taken in the past 2-3 years including the signing of MOUs by 12 states with the center to carry out fiscal reforms and the introduction of fiscal responsibility legislation by three states.

India: The States Fiscal Quandary India’s fiscal system is among the most decentralized in the world. Over half of general government (GG) spending is via the states, a level comparable with Denmark and Canada. However, less than 40 percent of GG revenue is raised by the states, which rely more heavily on transfers than subnational governments elsewhere. The fiscal situation of the states India: Trends in State Finances deteriorated dramatically in the late 1990s.

Half of Source: RBI Study on State Budgets; World Bank States’ database; and staff estimates these have been for infrastructure projects and are likely to become a budget liability. States are prolonged users of short-term credit facilities; and overdrafts and arrears are rising. In May 2003, the supreme court ordered payment of overdue salaries in Bihar, and in Maharashtra treasury accounts were attached to honor guarantees. The health of state financial corporations (SFCs) and utilities is precarious. The SFCs’ capital adequacy ratio is negative, cost recovery rates on electricity have fallen, and combined power sector losses are 1 percent of GDP. Weaknesses in the system of inter-governmental fiscal relations underlie the recent deterioration. Central transfers have not kept pace with rising expenditure. State expenditure has grown by over 15 percent since 1998/99 due to three factors. Most important is rising debt servicing. Interest outlays now consume 40 percent of states’ own resources. Energy subsidies doubled. Pension and administrative costs have risen by over 20 percent due to the Fifth Pay Commission awards. In some states, unfunded pension liabilities are expected to rise sharply in the next 3 to 5 years. As spending became more rigid, the share of spending devoted to investment has fallen. States have little incentive to bridge the widening gap between expenditure and revenue. Own revenues have weakened as gap-filling transfers eroded the link between expenditure and revenue. Nontax revenue has fallen as user fees have lagged behind rising costs. Taxes also stagnated. Property values have not been reassessed and states have not levied taxes on agriculture and professional income. The states and central government (CG) are embarking on reforms. Fiscal reform programs, committing states to revenue balance by 2005 in return for additional transfers, are operating in 2 1 states. Kamataka passed a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) setting deficit and debt targets, including achieving revenue balance by 2005. Kerala, Maharashtra, and Punjab are also enacting FRLs. Twenty-one states are in Accelerated Power Development Reforms Program to cut losses and increase investment. So far, three states have cut losses and are eligible for matching grants. The 2003104 Union budget contained measures to relieve the states’ interest burden. States are to receive 100 percent of net small saving funds collections (compared to 80 percent before) and additional market loans to pre-pay CG debt with interest rates above 13 percent. State Electricity Boards’ arrears to power generating public sector undertakings worth 1% percent of GDP were cleared by 15-year tax-exempt state-government bonds paying 8% percent (60 percent of interest due was waived). There is a five-year moratorium on the redemption of these 3onds; subsequently 10 percent of these can be traded each year.

In addition, the RBI and the central and state government have taken steps to clamp down on the issuance of guarantees.” 30. Notwithstanding these efforts, state finances have shown only limited improvement to date suggesting that much more needs to be done. Moreover, there are likely to be additional demands on states’ finances, including servicing bonds issued as part of the restructuring of SEB arrears, and covering unfunded pension liabilities. In addition to tax and power sector reform and more aggressive disinvestment, the mission urged the authorities to implement the recommendations of an expert group which examined fiscal risks associated with state government guarantees, including the proposed methodology to classify states’ contingent liabilities, the introduction of a guarantee redemption fund by all state governments, and an escrow account by the borrowing entity. 31. Against the background of weak state government finances, the authorities acknowledged that the delay in the implementation of the VAT is inopportune. The proposed VAT (Box 6) is likely to result in substantial efficiency and administrative gains by Box 6. India: Subnational VAT Preparations to introduce a state-level VAT began in 1999 when State Finance Ministers agreed to replace the state sales tax regime with a VAT starting April 1, 200 1. In preparation, states harmonized the floor rate on sales taxes and prohibited new sales tax exemptions from 2000. The most recent deadline for implementing the VATP.Iune 1, 2003-was missed due to opposition in some states and technical problems, including lack of uniformity in legislation. The states have agreed on the broad parameters of the VAT. There will be five rates: a zero-rate for essential goods such a food; 1 percent rate of gold and jewelry; 4 percent rate on industrial inputs; raw materials and medicines; a penal rate on demerit goods; and, a standard rate of 12% percent on all other goods excluding petroleum products. Exports and interstate sales will be zero rated. Initially services are to be excluded from the VAT base, but under the constitutional amendment approved in May 2003, the central government will be able to delegate service taxes to state governments. The central government is also taking steps to ease the transition burden for states. It plans to phase out the Central Sales Tax (CST) on interstate sales between registered dealers over three years. The CST will first be reduced from 4 percent to 2 percent, then to 1 percent before it is eliminated. The states will also receive compensation for 100 percent of the revenue losses in the first year of operation, 75 percent in the second year, and 50 percent in the third year. Compensation will be determined by comparing a states net collections from the VAT, the CST, and service taxes, to sales tax collections (from sales, entry, sales surcharge, and contract taxes) in 2000/01 adjusted to current levels using the average annual real growth rate in receipts over five years and the average inflation rate. ‘i These include requiring a credit rating for guaranteed loans and tightening prudential norms to include a 20 percent risk rating for state-government guaranteed loans, and 100 percent provisioning for guaranteed loans that are in default for two months. Some states have also introduced caps on guarantees and have established sinking funds to meet the potential demand for guarantee redemptions. The authorities have also proposed a new set of accounting standards for exposure to both explicit and implicit government guarantees.

Together with the usual advantages of reducing cascading and distortions, the VAT will also promote interstate trade and the development of a single market, and help reduce tax evasion and administrative costs-features that are of particular relevance for India. Over the medium term, the VAT also has the potential to boost revenue directly through broadening the tax base and indirectly by promoting more efficient production and consumption decisions. 32. The mission stressed that the priority should be to develop the necessary consensus to implement the VAT within the current fiscal year. To move the process forward, the central government needs to continue to play a pro-active role in resolving differences in states’ legislations. In addition, to address opposition by vested interest groups, a concerted campaign could be launched to educate the public about the benefits of the VAT and debunk misconceptions about its detrimental effects. In this context, the mission welcomed the move to amend the constitution to allow the allocation of service taxes to the states-a critical step for expanding the tax net and eventually including services in the VAT. After some experience has been gained with the VAT, the authorities could consider further simplifications to the rate structure to increase administrative ease and efficiency. B. Monetary and External Policies 33. With inflation subsiding markedly, the mission agreed with the authorities’ intention to maintain easy monetary conditions. The recent cuts in policy rates and administered rates on saving schemes are welcome-these steps should allow banks to lower lending and deposit rates and narrow the rupee-U.S. dollar interest rate differential. The mission urged further cuts in administered interest rates so as to narrow the wedge with the benchmark market rate-currently at about 200-250 bps, up from 150 bps last year. The mission also suggested establishing a clearly specified link to market rates and more frequent than annual adjustments, so that administered rates do not remain out of line with market rates for prolonged periods. 34. With the scope for sterilized intervention narrowing, managing the monetary impact of the balance of payments inflows is becoming increasingly difficult. The mission pointed out that after nearly two years of rapid reserve accumulation and a broadly stable rupee, greater weight should be given to curbing any self-reinforcing trends in capital inflows induced by the perception of a one-way bet on the rupee in the presence of a positive interest rate differential. The risk is that the current strategy could inadvertently expose the system to vulnerability through the buildup of interest-sensitive inflows and in the increased unhedged foreign currency exposure in the corporate sector. 35. The mission reiterated the advice that greater flexibility is needed in managing the exchange rate. The authorities agreed in principle with the need for greater exchange rate flexibility, but pointed to the difficulty of introducing two way movements in the exchange rate in the current environment where expectations of dollar depreciation are well entrenched. In addition, the authorities remain concerned about the implications of an Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - appreciated rupee-dollar rate for export competitiveness, including in the IT services sector where much of the trade is U.S. dollar denominated. The authorities agreed that there is a need to sensitize corporates on the need for hedging, and pointed to the recent steps taken by the RBI to encourage and facilitate hedging. The mission noted that these measures are welcome but market players are unlikely to respond as long as they do not perceive a need to hedge their exposures. 36. The mission reiterated the recommendation that the strength in the external account presents a good opportunity to further liberalize external transactions. The mission welcomed the measures that have been implemented over the past two years to liberalize capital account transactions. Going forward, the mission noted that the focus should be on trade liberalization.‘2 Notwithstanding recent reforms, India’s trade regime remains highly restrictive and opaque. Nontariff barriers and a proliferation of incentive schemes and exemptions continue to be in use.13 The mission suggested that steps be taken to go beyond the currently envisaged tariff reduction plans, by simplifying the tariff regime, reducing exemptions, lowering tariffs further, introducing a more uniform duty structure, and eliminating administrative and nontariff barriers. C. Structural Policies Financial Sector Reforms 37. Banking soundness indicators continued to improve in 2001/02, but credit and interest rate risks remain significant. Gross NPAs declined and the risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of PSBs stood at close to 12 percent-above the statutory minimum of 9 percent (Annex II). However, at over 10 percent of advances, gross NPAs remain high by international standards. Also, because loan classification regulations do not fully conform to international standards, measured NPAs may not reflect the true extent of impaired assets. The improvement in profitability of the banking system from 0.5 percent of total assets in 2000/01 to 0.75 percent of total assets in 2001/02 largely reflects trading profits from banks’ sizable holdings of government securities. However, such large holdings of government securities also expose commercial banks to considerable interest rate risk. 38. The mission commended the authorities for the steady progress made in moving ahead with financial sector reforms. Particularly noteworthy steps include the passage of the Securitization Act and the issuance of the accompanying guidelines by RBI which enable the formation of asset reconstruction companies (ARCS); the introduction of a prompt l2 On the lMF’s IO-point index of trade restrictiveness, India’s trade system scores an 8, compared with an average of 4.4 in Asia. l3 See Chapter IV in “India-Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, ” IMF Country Report 021193.

The discussions also covered the following issues: l The authorities pointed out that all banks are to be treated uniformly under the PCA framework, regardless of their ownership. They agreed that introducing time limits for each remedial action would make the framework more effective, and said that they would consider such limits once some experience has been gained with implementing the framework as a supervisory tool. 0 Banks remain quite heavily exposed to interest rate risk, notwithstanding the investment fluctuation reserve (Annex II). The scope of the planned exchange-traded interest rate derivatives may be too limited as it only permits those with an underlying hedging requirement to participate and requires a one-for-one matching of the needs of different players in the market. The authorities said they would consider amending the draft regulations to allow participation of market makers once some experience has been gained with the derivative product. The mission also encouraged making available a mix of fixed and floating rate securities in the debt buyback from banks to allow greater flexibility in banks’ asset-liability management. 0 The mission urged that measures be taken to reduce the discretion available to banks in the timing of the invocation of state government guarantees, and to increase the risk weight on state government and government guaranteed loans. 40. The authorities agreed that there remain issues to be resolved before the full benefits of the Securitization Act can be realized. Even after the Supreme Court rules on the validity of some provisions of the Act, there remains potential for delays. First, although the Act permits setting aside the protection granted under the Board for Industrial and Financial Restructuring (BIFR), there could be grounds for legal challenges until the Sick Industrial Companies Act (SICA) is repealed. Second, the creation of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the amended Companies Act-which represents a significant improvement over the BIFR as a corporate insolvency framework--could be grounds for challenging some provisions of the Securitization Act. In particular, collateral enforcement under the latter could be delayed if borrowers are able to obtain unduly long protection under the provisions of the NCLT. The authorities noted that the passage of the Act has induced borrowers to come forward to settle their debts rather than risk seizure of their collateral. However, they stressed that they would be vigilant to these potential problems and would amend the relevant laws if they are found to be in conflict with each other.

The mission reiterated the recommendation to speed up the timetable of bringing India’s classification and provisioning standards in line with international best practice. The government’s offer to buy back debt from banks provides an opportunity to bring forward the deadlines for classifying loans as doubtful from March 2005 and for building provisions needed under the new norms from 2009. In addition, banks’ willingness to sell NPAs to ARCS may be greater if their capital position is strong enough to withstand the hit on account of gaps between the net book value and sale price. The authorities agreed to consider this recommendation. 42. The mission stressed that the best way to strengthen the performance and efficiency of the banking system is through disinvestment of PSBs and fostering greater competition. The first best option would be to reduce the government’s shareholding in the PSBs (the pending amendment to the Banking Companies Act calls for a reduction in the government’s share from 5 1 percent to 33 percent). Raising the FDI limit in private banks from 49 percent to 74 percent (proposed in the 2003/04 budget speech but subsequently postponed) and lifting the restrictions on voting rights would also be important to strengthen competition in the banking system. The authorities noted that banks have seen better profits this year, but agreed that continued efforts are needed to improve the operational efficiency, commercial orientation, and governance structure of PSBs. 43. The mission welcomed the progress being made in resolving issues related to UTI. The passage of the UT1 (Repeal) Act in late 2002 has enabled the bifurcation of UT1 into UTI-I (which includes all the assured return schemes) and UTI-II (which includes the net asset-value based funds). The authorities pointed to their intention to bring forward the closure of assured return schemes so as to expedite their resolution. They also noted that the choice of PSBs and financial institutions as sponsors of UTI-II was in the interest of speeding up the separation of the NAV-based schemes from the government. The authorities stressed that privatization of UTI-II was still their intention and that due diligence of its asset holdings was underway. 44. The mission encouraged the authorities to clarify their strategy for dealing with development finance institutions in India. Thus far, the strategy has involved significant government-orchestrated rescue packages and increases in contingent claims on the government. a The rescue package for the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI)-involving rolling over of overdue liabilities to other public sector financial institutions into 20-year government guaranteed bonds-appears to have been given with little conditionality. This raises concerns about the risks that are being introduced in the balance sheets of other public financial institutions through increasing and prolonging their exposure to IFCI’s weaknesses. 0 The authorities noted that decisions on the future of the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) hinge on the debate over the need for term lending institutions in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 25 - India. The mission stressed that regardless of the ultimate strategy chosen for IDBI, care needs to be taken to ensure that a situation similar to that arising from the IFCI assistance strategy does not materialize. A first step is to ensure speedy resolution of IDBI’s large NPAs. Beyond that, the authorities agreed that the strategy would need to involve corporatization of IDBI (which would require the repeal of the IDBI Act), diversification of IDBI’s portfolio, strict enforcement of exposure limits, timely monitoring of borrowers, and stringent evaluation of the risk-return characteristics of projects. Other Structural Policies 45. The mission noted that progress with agricultural and industrial sector reforms that are critical to generating growth has been uneven. 0 Recent positive steps in the agricultural sector include the partial decontrol of fertilizer distribution and the planned introduction of a new pricing system to discourage inefficient fertilizer producers. However, the budget was mostly silent on other important reforms in agriculture-seen as the lynchpin of the growth strategy for the period of the 10th Five Year Plan. The mission urged early action on reforming the public distribution system, minimum support prices, and fertilizer subsidies. Increasing investment in the agricultural sector hinges on the removal of restrictions on marketing and trading in agricultural products, including futures trading, revocation of the Essential Commodities Act, further dereservation of agro-based industries and lifting of restrictions on exports, 0 As for industry, positive steps include the continuing dereservation of small-scale industries particularly of those industries with the greatest export potential, the enactment of a more modem competition bill that focuses on market dominance rather than firm size per se, and the preparation of the groundwork to repeal the SICA and replacing the BIFR as a bankruptcy resolution mechanism. The mission also welcomed the enactment of the amended Electricity Bill, which allows the sector to be opened up to greater competition. However, further progress is needed on dereservation of small-scale industries and on reforming labor laws to allow flexibility in employment decisions in line with market conditions. 46. The mission urged greater efforts to revive the momentum of privatization. Apart from improving the efficiency of resource allocation, achievement of this year’s budget target rests critically on disinvestment receipts. However, given the potential for opposition from labor unions, and that the strategy for some big-ticket sales has been changed from strategic sales to sales of shares, it is not clear that the targets will be achieved. Continuing to publicize the benefits of previous disinvestments-highlighting the fact that there has been little retrenchment of labor and that, in some cases, wages and benefits have improved-may be a useful way to build popular support for this reform. The mission supported the authorities’ proposal to establish a fund for disinvestment receipts, which would be used for Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - debt reduction, and for spending to rehabilitate areas in which industries have been privatized, rather than including them in the funds available for recurrent spending. 47. The mission welcomed the smooth operation of periodic price adjustments for diesel and petrol in the post-APM environment. The mission reiterated the need for an explicit strategy to deal with episodes when oil prices temporarily move out of a normal range and stressed the importance of compensating oil companies for losses incurred on subsidized products. These efforts would also be helpful in maximizing the receipts from the planned sale of the two oil-marketing companies. D. Other Issues 48. India has completed assessments under most of the IMF’s standards and codes. The authorities agreed to convey their reaction to the Statistics ROSC report in the near future to facilitate its early finalization. Priority should be given to addressing shortcomings in timeliness and coverage of fiscal data to support the objective of fiscal consolidation. The mission suggested that it may be timely to update the FSAP. At this time, an assessment of the observation of the IAIS core principles for the supervision of the insurance sector (which was not done at the time of the FSAP) could also be conducted. The mission also encouraged the completion of the AMLKFT questionnaire. 49. The previously identified exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII remain in place. The mission urged the authorities to eliminate them as soon as possible. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 50. The resilience of the Indian economy during the past year is testimony to the benefits of the reforms undertaken since the early 1990s. Despite a weak global environment and a severe drought, the economy grew at 4% percent in 2002/03, a rate that compares favorably with other developing countries. The external position strengthened, reserves are at an all-time high, and inflationary pressures remained under control. Moreover, progress was made in some areas of structural reforms. 51. However, the trend slowdown in growth since the mid-1990s is of concern, especially because of its implications for the critical goal of poverty reduction. Despite the good progress that has been made in reducing poverty, India remains home to 400 million people living on less than $1 a day (one third of the world’s total). The policy requirements for restarting output and employment growth and reducing poverty are well known to the authorities and have been extensively discussed in past consultations. To make meaningful progress, the key imperative is for policymakers to capitalize on the success of the reforms to date by pushing ahead with fiscal consolidation and other critical structural reforms. 52. India’s large fiscal deficits and debt are exacting a cost on the economy in terms of foregone growth. Despite the apparent ease with which the fiscal deficit has been financed, capital and social spending are being crowded out, and resources for private Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - investment are being preempted. There is little room to provide funds to ease the infrastructure bottlenecks that are acting as a drag on growth and little scope for maneuver in the event of adverse shocks. In addition, the center’s ability to play a leadership role in driving the reform process is eroded. Furthermore, the fiscal situation has led to ad-hoc policy changes; in turn, this lack of clarity on policy direction creates uncertainty amongst investors. 53. It is disappointing that little headway has been made in correcting fiscal imbalances and that the 2003/04 budget does not advance this goal. Although the efforts to impart greater realism to the budget revenue estimates and to improve tax administration are welcome, there remain risks to the achievement of the revenue targets. Meaningful progress in revenue mobilization will require measures to widen the tax net and significantly simplify the tax system. In particular, the range of exemptions should be narrowed considerably and the scope for discretion reduced. 54. The strategy of postponing consolidation while attempting to stimulate growth is risky. Few countries have succeeded by attempting to grow out of such severe fiscal problems, without implementing a comprehensive reform program. The debt swaps are largely zero-sum games and would buy only a temporary reprieve in the absence of more fundamental reforms. Moreover, although the emphasis on infrastructure building is appropriate in light of the acute bottlenecks, the level of private participation envisaged in the budget may not occur. The envisaged infrastructure growth is thus likely to depend critically on whether room can be made for the public sector to take on the additional spending. 55. The pending passage of the FRBM bill offers a welcome opportunity to announce a time-bound and clearly specified plan to restore fiscal sustainability. International evidence suggests that credible fiscal rules, combined with improved fiscal institutions, can overcome a political bias towards higher deficits. The staff would urge the early introduction of medium-term fiscal planning, the adoption of clearly specified fiscal rules, and a strong commitment to the medium-term targets. The authorities are encouraged to use the recommendations in the various reports on tax and expenditure reform that have been prepared in recent years to draw up a roadmap for fiscal and structural reforms with explicit timetables. Priority should be given to significantly improving the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data to support policy reforms. The Fund is ready to extend any technical assistance required by the government in fiscal reforms. 56. The deteriorating finances of state governments need to be tackled urgently. The past few years have seen some important initiatives at the state level including the linking of transfers from the center to improvements in fiscal performance and implementation of power sector reforms, efforts to harden the budget constraint through a tightening of regime for government guaranteed loans, and the introduction of fiscal responsibility legislation by some states. Nevertheless, state finances have improved only moderately, suggesting that much more needs to be done. Key areas for decisive action are tax reform, disinvestment of public enterprises, reducing subsidies and losses in the power sector, increasing user charges for government services, and limiting the buildup of contingent liabilities. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - 57. Given the critical need to improve state government finances, the delay (now three years) in the introduction of the VAT is regrettable. The priority should be to develop the necessary consensus to implement the VAT within the current fiscal year. To move the process forward, the central government needs to play a pro-active role in resolving differences in states’ legislations and in launching a concerted campaign jointly with the states about the benefits of the VAT. ILn this context, the Constitutional amendment on service taxation is a welcome step in the process of including services in the VAT system. 58. The authorities’ intention to maintain easy monetary conditions is appropriate in the present circumstances. The recent welcome cuts in administered savings rates and policy rates should allow banks to lower lending and deposit rates and narrow the rupee/dollar interest rate differential. On administered interest rates, further cuts are needed so as to narrow the wedge with the benchmark market rate, and a clearly specified automatic link to market rates should be established to prevent prolonged misalignment between market rates and administered rates. 59. With the scope for sterilized intervention narrowing, managing the monetary impact of balance of payments inflows is likely to become increasingly difficult. Greater weight should be given to curbing any self-reinforcing trends in capital inflows induced by the perception of a one-way bet on the rupee in the presence of a positive interest rate differential. One way of achieving this is to allow greater flexibility in the exchange rate. This is especially important if there is the risk that the current strategy could inadvertently expose the system to more risk-manifested in the buildup in interest-sensitive inflows and in the increased unhedged foreign currency exposure in the corporate sector. The measures to facilitate and encourage hedging are welcome, but they may not be effective as long as market players do not perceive the need to undertake such activities. 60. The continued strength in the external accounts presents a good opportunity to further liberalize external transactions. The measures to liberalize capital account transactions are welcome. Going forward, there is scope to go considerably further than currently envisaged on trade reforms. In particular, the trade regime should be simplified by lowering tariffs while simultaneously reducing the proliferation of exemptions and incentive schemes, introducing a more uniform duty structure, and eliminating administrative barriers. 61. The steady progress made in moving ahead with financial sector reforms is commendable. To strengthen the steps that have already been taken, some additional actions are recommended. With respect to the PCA framework, the staff would urge the introduction of time limits for each remedial action so as to give the framework the “teeth” it needs to be effective. The authorities are encouraged to broaden the scope of the market for interest rate derivatives. Finally, measures need to be taken to tighten the regulatory treatment of state- government guaranteed loans. 62. A number of issues remain to be resolved before the full benefits of the reforms aimed at resolving and recovering NPAs can be realized. The staff welcomes the passage Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - of the Securitization Act, the issuance of the accompanying guidelines by the RBI, and the approval of the amendment of the Companies Act to create the National Company Law Tribunal. To give full effect to the Securitization Act and to the amended Companies Act, however, a critical step is the repeal of the SICA. Moreover, the authorities need to be cautious that effective collateral enforcement under the Securitization Act is not delayed by borrowers obtaining unduly long protection against collateral enforcement under the new tribunal. 63. The timetable of bringing India’s classification and provisioning standards in line with international best practice needs to be speeded up. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to conduct the buybacks of debt from banks in a voluntary and transparent manner. The government’s offer to buy back debt from the financial sector provides an opportunity to bring forward the deadlines for classifying loans as doubtful, and for building provisions needed under the new norms. Such a move would provide the incentive for banks to participate in the debt restructuring exercise while strengthening their balance sheets at the same time. 64. The best way to strengthen the performance and efficiency of the banking system is through disinvestment of PSBs and fostering greater competition. Continued efforts are needed to increase the operational efficiency, commercial orientation, and governance structure of PSBs. The staff would urge early passage of the amendment to the Banking Companies Act that would allow the government to reduce its shareholding in the PSBs. Raising the FDI limit in private banks and lifting the restrictions on voting rights would also be important to strengthen competition in the banking system. 65. The progress being made in resolving issues related to UT1 is welcome. The staff supports the intention to bring forward the closure of assured return schemes so as to complete the resolution of all assured return schemes under UTI-I, and would encourage early privatization of UTI-II. 66. The authorities’ strategy for the future of development finance institutions in India needs to be clarified. Thus far, the strategy for dealing with these institutions has involved government-orchestrated rescue packages, with little conditionality. Care needs to be taken to ensure that the resolution strategy chosen for the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) does not involve significant actual and contingent claims on government resources. A first step is to corporatize IDBI and ensure speedy resolution of IDBI’s large NPAs. Going forward, efforts are needed to diversify IDBI’s portfolio, and to undertake stringent evaluation of the risk-return characteristics of projects. 67. Sustained progress is needed with other reforms that are critical to generating growth. Recent positive steps include the partial decontrol of fertilizer distribution and the planned introduction of a new pricing system intended to discourage inefficient fertilizer producers. However, early action is needed on lifting restrictions on agricultural marketing and trade, and reforming the public distribution system, minimum support prices, and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - fertilizer subsidies. As for industry, positive steps include the continuing dereservation of small-scale industries, the enactment of a more modem competition bill, and the passage of a new Electricity Bill allowing the power sector to be opened up to greater competition. Early progress is needed on reforming labor laws to allow more flexibility in decisions regarding employment levels, reflecting market conditions. 68. Reviving the momentum of privatization is critically important. Publicizing the benefits of previous disinvestments may be a useful way to build popular support for this reform. The staff also supports the authorities’ proposal to create a fund for disinvestment receipts, to be used for debt reduction and spending to rehabilitate areas directly affected by disinvestment, rather than for recurrent spending. 69. The smooth operation of periodic price adjustments for diesel and petrol in the post-APM environment is encouraging. Going forward, it will be important to formulate an explicit strategy to deal with episodes when oil prices temporarily move out of a normal range. Transparent application of this strategy will be of particular importance to maximize the receipts from the sale of the two oil-marketing companies. 70. India has completed assessments under most of the Fund’s standards and codes. The authorities are encouraged to facilitate early completion of the Statistics ROSC report and, in light of the significant financial sector reforms that have been implemented, to consider undertaking an updated assessment of the financial sector, possibly in time for the next Article IV consultation. The priority given to formulating policies and laws to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities is welcome. The staff would encourage the authorities to complete and return the AML/CFT questionnaire. 71. The staff commends the authorities’ decision to write-off the debt of a number of HIPCs. 72. It is proposed that the next consultation with India take place on a standard a 12-month consultation cycle.

In this scenario, poverty reduction is modest with the number of people below the poverty line falling by about 21 percent during 200 l-20 15. ’ 0 The high growth scenario assumes an ambitious reform program to meet the goals specified under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management bill, along with accelerated structural reforms. Aggressive fiscal consolidation-averaging 0.8 percent of GDP per annum during 2004/05-2008/09-triggers a virtuous cycle of falling deficits, debt, and interest costs, and accommodates increased public sector investment. Moreover, accelerated structural reforms, in addition to increased public saving and lower interest rates, lead to higher private investment and productivity growth. Growth accelerates to 7-8 percent, and the number of people below the poverty line decreases by 37 percent during 200 l-20 15. 0 The low growth scenario assumes that the general government primary deficit remains at 4.4 percent of GDP over the medium term. Government finances enter a vicious cycle of rising interest cost, deficits, and debt. This crowds out both public and private investment, leading to weaker growth. With growth weaker, the support for structural reforms also decreases, resulting in little improvement in productivity growth and poverty reduction (the number of people below the poverty line declines by only 6 percent during 200 l-20 15). ’ Staff analysis of poverty in India (Chapter VII of the India-Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues, IMF Country Report No. 0 l/l 8 1) suggests that growth in highly conducive to poverty reduction in India-an increase of 1 percent in real per capita GDP growth lowers the poverty rate by 0.6 percent, with the strongest effects coming from growth in nonfarm output.

India has continued to make progress in strengthening its financial sector along the lines recommended in the 2001 Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA), although further progress is needed in some areas. This annex focuses on recent developments among the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), where reforms have been most significant since the last Article IV consultation. Most noteworthy are efforts aimed at resolving nonperforming assets (NPAs) and bolstering bank supervision. However, public sector banks (PSBs) still need to improve their overall efficiency and risk profile. In addition, the scheme to resolve NPAs at banks has been challenged in court, creating uncertainty about the speed at which impaired assets can be recovered. The Banking Sector: Performance and Risk 2. The performance of the banking sector continued to improve during fiscal year 2001/02 (April-March). Net profits of SCBs increased by 53 percent, despite higher provisions. Bank profits benefited from capital gains on bond trading, lower wage costs of PSBs from voluntary retirement scheme introduced last year, and diversification into fee- based activities by the subset of PSBs comprising the nationalized banks. However, at 0.75 percent of assets, before tax profits of the SCBs as a whole are still lower than foreign banks in India and banks abroad,’ owing partly to excessive reliance on interest income (Table I. 1). Low returns are also explained by the heavy burden imposed by NPAs. Provisions and contingencies increased 37 percent from the previous year reflecting a growing awareness by banks to set aside larger sums against impaired assets in the light of the gradual tightening of prudential norms. 3. During 2001/02, domestic banks remained exposed to sizable credit and interest rate risks, despite a relatively favorable macroeconomic environment. Moreover, as indicated in Figure 1, the level of NPAs appears positively correlated with interest rate risk, while low returns seem to be associated with higher risk. Most of the sources of risk in domestic banks can be traced to longstanding structural and institutional factors. The large stock of NPAs is an overhang from a period of directed credit with no independent risk assessments, an excessively borrower-friendly legal and judiciary systems, and inadequate incentives at PSBs to manage their risks. Interest rate risk arises mainly from banks’ sizeable holdings of government bonds. This creates a large positive duration mismatch, which exposes banks to potentially large losses in the event of an increase in interest rates.2 ’ Before tax return on assets (ROA) for foreign banks in India was 1.3 percent in 2000/01. 2 See Patnaik, Ila, and Ajay Shah, 2002, Interest Rate Risk in the Indian Banking System, ICRIER Working Paper No. 92 (December) (www.icrier.res.in), in which a large positive interest rate shock is simulated over a year for a sample of 42 major domestic banks in India. (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 49 - ANNEX II 4. The stock of NPAs increased by 10 percent in 2001/02, although the ratio to total outstanding loans fell from 11% percent at end 2000/01 to 10% percent at end 2001/02.3 Among the PSBs, in particular, reported NPAs (like total assets) are heavily concentrated, with the five largest banks (accounting for 53 percent of total assets) having 57 percent of total NPAs. For these live banks, NPAs ranged from 9-l 8 percent of total outstanding loans in 2001/02. The actual stock of NPAs is likely considerably higher. Currently, banks required to classify a loan as substandard only when it is more than six months overdue; based on new regulations reflecting internationally accepted standards, this changes to 90 days overdue effective March 2004. Some analysts have estimated the true level of NPAs to be in the range of 25-30 percent of outstanding loans. 5. Banks now have several ways to clean up their balance sheets, as follows: 0 The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Bill, passed by Parliament in November 2002, and accompanying guidelines prepared by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) create the legal framework to sell NPAs to securitization and reconstrnction companies (SC/RC) at market prices, without government intervention or support. The Securitization Act also introduces provisions to allow collateral enforcement without court intervention. l Banks can also pursue voluntary and out of court agreements under the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) mechanism and compromise settlements scheme. The CDR was established in August 2001 and applies to large India: Role of Securttization and Reconstruction Companies The new Securitization Act provides separate frameworks for securitizatlon and reconstruction. Under the securitization process, banks can segregate relatively homogeneous loans and sell them to a securitization company (SC). The SC can then issue securities (bonds and debentures) with a maturity of up to six years. The commitment of the SC is unconditional for the whole face value of the security and not linked to the realization of assets. Alternatively, loans can be sold to a reconstruction company (RC). The RC differs from the SC in that the former’s only purpose is the realization of assets. The RC can issue security receipts in exchange for the loans. With reconstruction, the payment to the holder of the security is linked to the recovery of the assets. SCs/RCs have up to one year for formulating a plan for the recovery of NPAs acquired for the purpose ofasset reconstruction. Banks can sell standard as well as NPAs to SCs/RCs. Standard assets can be sold when the loan is given by a consortium of banks and at least 75 percent of the value of the asset is classified as nonperforming in the books of other banks and at least 75 percent of the value of the banks in the consortium agree to the sale. Loans can only be sold ‘without recourse,’ meaning that all credit risk is transferred to the SC/RC and taken off the bank’s books. The price of the securities issued by SCs/RCs-which would not carry a government guarantee-will be decided by the parties involved in the transaction. When the price agreed by the parties is below the NPV of the asset in the bank’s balance sheet (i.e., the face value minus the loss provision), the difference will be recognized by the bank as a loss. When the price agreed by the parties is above the NPV of the asset, the difference will remain in the bank’s portfolio as a loss provision. SCs/RCs will be subject to regulation and supervision by the RBI. Minimum capital adequacy is set at 15 percent of risk-weighted assets. The risk weights in all cases are 100 percent, except on cash or government securities (zero-weighted). Twenty-five banks had ‘reverse’ exposures (i.e., they could lose between 25 percent and 105 percent of their equity capital); only nine banks were adequately hedged. 3 Excluding ICICI Bank (formerly known as ICICI, a large development finance institution, which merged with ICICI Bank Ltd. in 2002), NPAs grew by 3% percent in 2001/02.

The settlement scheme, created in July 2000 and recently extended until September 2003, provides a “nondiscretionary, nondiscriminatory” procedure with clear parameters for one-time settlements of chronic NPAs at PSBs under Rs. 10 crore. 0 Finally, recent steps have been taken to strengthen the bankruptcy framework. The Corporate Insolvency Law, or Companies (Second Amendment) Act, was approved in January 2003. The new law replaces the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) with the National Companies Law Tribunal (NCLT) as a way to rehabilitate or liquidate sick companies. The law tightens the definition of a sick company so that the resolution process can begin earlier than before and imposes a 24-month time limit (subject to extension by the NCLT) on resolution actions.4 6. However, the full benefits of some of these reforms may not be seen immediately for several reasons. Specifically: l Several legal issues are pending resolution before the Securitization Act can be fully implemented. The Supreme Court must decide a case related to banks’ rights to enforce collateral without court intervention; the nature of the legal debate surrounds provisions of the Companies Act seeking to avoid the stripping of assets of sick companies. Until a decision is reached, banks can seize collaterals but cannot sell them. The Act also needs to be fully harmonized with the amended Companies Act; and the BIFR can only be replaced with the NCLT by repealing the Sick Industrial Companies Act, which is expected in the near term. l Cleaning up banks’ balance sheets may require a capital injection that could prove difficult for many banks. Currently, there are no official estimates of the cost of resolving the stock of NPAs in India due, in part, to the lack of estimates of recovery rates for impaired assets. Staffs simulations applied different assumptions on recovery rates and on the time taken to recover collateral both to the current reported levels of gross NPAs, as well as to market analysts’ estimates of “true” NPAs.’ These simulations suggest that the cost of resolving NPAs in India could be as high as 8 percent of GDP. 4 A sick company is defined as an industrial firm that either (i) has annual accumulated losses greater than or equal to 50 percent of average net worth during the four years immediate preceding the current financial year; or (ii) has failed to repay its debts within any three consecutive quarters on written demand for repayment by creditors. 5 The recovery rates assumed in the illustrative scenarios for India range from 10 percent to 73 percent, while the time to recovery ranges from 2 years to 10 years.

Banks are also exposed to significant credit risk arising from loans to state- governments. States have resorted to issuing guarantees on behalf of public sector undertakings, especially in the power sector and in sugar and textile production. Recently, some states have asked for a loan restrnctnring in cases when the default of the underlying borrower triggers the guarantee. Guaranteed loans and bonds doubled to 8 percent of GDP between end 1998199 and end 2000/O 1. However, banks have become aware of states’ default risk, and guarantees were estimated to have fallen to 7% percent GDP at end 2001/02. 8. Prudential rules regarding loans covered by state government guarantees are not adequate. The risk weight for capital purposes is zero, as in the case of a risk-free asset. Provisioning requirements are lax since the loan covered by a guarantee becomes nonperforming and subject to provisioning only after being delinquent for at least 360 days (i.e., 180 days for the original borrower plus 180 days for the state that granted the guarantee).6 Exposure to the states is not captured by credit concentration limits since these are based on the exposure to the underlying borrower. Furthermore, under the current regulations, banks have few incentives not to make government guaranteed loans-the attachment of a guarantee reduces the incentive to assess the risk and monitor the loan and there are no capital requirements against these loans. 9. The RBI has resorted to a number of tools to control interest rate risk. Specifically, starting in January 2002, the RBI instructed banks to begin to build up their Investment Fluctuations Reserves (IFR). This is in addition to the requirement that banks assign a risk weight of 2.5 percent to cover market risk with respect of all securities outside the statutory liquidity requirement. By early 2007, each SCB is expected to hold an IFR equal to 5 percent of total investments in its trading account (i.e., assets either held for trading or available for sale). As of end March 2002, the PSBs had a cumulative IFR of 0.9 1 percent. However, the IFR may not offer suflicient risk protection-apart from focusing only on the asset side of the portfolio, it ignores the duration of traded assets, The RBI has also released draft regulations allowing banks to engage in exchanged-traded interest rate derivatives to hedge their interest rate exposure. So far, the only tool available to hedge interest rate risk has been the interbank swap market. However, given the uncollateralized nature of this over-the-counter market, only a few large banks (perceived to be low risk) have been able to use interest rate swaps. Exchange-traded derivatives will allow even small banks Asia (at end 2001) ranged from 8 percent of outstanding balances in Indonesia (plus 5 percent in interest and fees) and 25 percent in Thailand to 46 percent in Korea and 60 percent in Malaysia. 6 In many cases, this period is longer since banks do not immediately invoke the guarantee.

Lastly, the government has offered a debt buyback scheme, under which banks will be able to trade long-term and illiquid government bonds for shorter term and more liquid bonds. This debt swap, if correctly designed, may also help banks reduce their interest rate risk. Supervisory Issues: New Banking Regulations 10. The most important supervisory initiatives being developed at present in India are the implementation of the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework and risk- based supervision (RBS). Other initiatives by the RBI since the 2002 Article IV consultation, include: (i) issuance of consolidated prudential returns (in preparation for consolidated supervision); (ii) revisions to accounting standards to assure full compliance of banks with Indian Accounting Standards (following International Accounting Standards); (iii) issuance of new credit, market, and country risk management guidelines; (iv) drafting of credit derivatives guidelines (now with banks for comments); and (v) establishment of guidelines governing new offshore banking units. 11. The RBI has made considerable progress in implementing the PCA framework. The PCA framework sets a number of trigger points that can give rise to structured and discretionary actions by the RBI. The trigger points are defined as thresholds for the risk- weighted capital adequacy ratio (CRAR), NPAs, and return on assets (ROA). In particular, when the CRAR goes below 3 percent, the RBI can take steps to merge or liquidate a bank if the CRAR does not improve within one year or a period agreed by the RBI and bank. However, the PCA framework still lacks adequate provisions for enforcement, since there are no mandatory time limits addressing deficiencies related to NPAs and ROA when the CRAR is higher than 3 percent but lower than 9 percent. The RBI argued that the ability to merge/liquidate a bank when its CRAR goes below 3 percent is enough to make the PCA framework enforceable. In practice, the RBI has used the strategy of forced mergers (i.e., a sound bank is requested to takeover a low capitalized bank) out of concern that any bank closure leads inevitably to a lack of confidence in the system and to higher losses than if a forced merger is arranged. However, the RBI indicated some closures have already been decided and did carry out a few of cooperative banks in early 2003. 12. Progress has also been good in introducing RBS as a forward-looking approach for establishing supervisory priorities. The RBI is using at present both the performance- based CAMEL system and RBS until it develops a reliable RBS approach. Fifty-two banks have already completed the risk templates and eight banks have been selected to participate in the RBS pilot exercise. The summary outcome of the risk templates is a risk self-assessment undertaken by each bank. Together with the RBI’s own inputs, the self- assessments will be used to decide the frequency of examination of each bank and the areas in which each bank may require special attention.

The Bank’s program of support combines policy dialogue with a diversified lending program and economic and sector work. The latter includes formal reports and demand-driven policy notes as well as technical assistance on macroeconomic and state fiscal management issues; on sector-level reforms (governance, agriculture, education, finance, health, nutrition, and power); and on poverty. As outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of June 2001, and the December 2002 Progress Report on the CAS, lending from the Bank Group is targeted to poverty reduction, human resource and infrastructure development, and the state level reform process. Particular emphasis is being made on fiscal and governance reforms in leading reforming states. A multi-sectoral investment loan was approved in mid 1998 to support state-level fiscal reforms in Andhra Pradesh. Similar programs of assistance, comprising sub national adjustment loans and sectoral investment operations, supported reforms in Uttar Pradesh and Kamataka during 2000 and 200 1. Second phase operations in Andhra Pradesh and Kamataka were approved by the Board of Directors in March 2002.

The AsDB’s Country Strategy and Program for 2003-2006 was approved on April 30,2003. The theme of the new strategy-the first operational strategy for India since adoption of the AsDB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy in 1999-is mainstreaming poverty reduction. Poverty will be addressed primarily through high but also equitable, pro-poor growth. Growth interventions will also be complemented by social development interventions that deal with poverty reduction. The government has sought AsDB assistance for the next generation of policy reforms and to build capacity for improved governance by introducing international best practices. State-level operations, including support for improved delivery of pro-poor social services, will also be extended to a few more focal states that are poor but also have demonstrated their commitment to reforms.

India has an elaborate system for compiling economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering virtually all sectors of the economy. Despite the improvements in the publication of statistical data in recent years, important shortcomings hamper the timely analysis of economic trends. India subscribed to the SDDS on December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS. 2. Many key financial variables are available on a weekly or monthly basis, most of which are published in official documents or disseminated through press releases. Nevertheless, the statistical system suffers from a number of weaknesses, many of which were identified in the August 2001 Report of the National Statistical Commission. These weaknesses include: l Statistical methods are cumbersome, and reporting methods have not kept pace with the shift to a more market-oriented economy following the elimination of industrial licensing. Computerization of data systems is being introduced slowly. a Decentralization of data collection implies that the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) has little control over statistical techniques used in other agencies. This greatly complicates the task of achieving consistency across the sectoral accounts. l There are still shortcomings in the periodicity, coverage, and quality of many data series. 3. An STA mission that took place during May 13-30,2002 prepared the data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), which consists of three elements. The first element is an assessment of India’s data dissemination practices against the SDDS requirements. The second element is a summary assessment of the quality of six data sets based on the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA. The third element is a list of prioritized staff recommendations that, if necessary, could be used as the basis for a program on future statistical development. 4. Recent developments and existing shortcomings in major statistical areas are discussed below: l National accounts: The CSO rebased the annual national accounts statistics and began publishing quarterly data from early 2000. However, quarterly data are only available from 199642 and for production-based data. Information on major expenditure categories is only available with considerable delay (at least ten months after the end of the fiscal year), providing limited guidance for short-term policies. Saving and investment estimates are particularly weak, reflecting an outdated estimation method and limited information on activity outside the organized sector of the economy. Estimates of value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased upwards in recent years, as they are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 60 - ANNEX VI l Industrial production index (IIP): In May 2000, the CSO took the welcome step of releasing a completely revised time series for IIP, using the new WPI (base year 1993/94) series as a deflator. a Price statistics: The Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) are based on weights that are at least fifteen years old and do not fully capture price developments in the economy. There are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. The WPI is published weekly with a lag of two weeks. A new WPI series was published in 2000 with updated weights, new categories, and a revised base year (1993/94). However, the representativeness of the index may be undermined by the collection of prices from a relatively small sample of products and the infrequent updating of weights. 0 Balance of payments: A significant improvement has been made in the timeliness of the quarterly balance of payments data, which are now released with a lag of three months.’ However, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems. Further, data on trade prices and volumes are not regularly available on a timely basis. Starting January 2001, external debt statistics are now available on a quarterly basis with a six-month lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is made only occasionally (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The international investment position statistics currently do not cover the assets of the corporate or banking sectors and appear after a long lag. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) published international investment position data as planned in September 2002, but these data still need to be sectorized. a Monetary and Financial Statistics: The RI31 website and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide array of monetary and financial statistics, including interest rates, exchange rates, foreign reserves, the monetary survey, and results of government securities auctions. The frequency and quality of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years. However, some crucial data (e.g., RBI’s forward liabilities) are still published with lags of two to three months. India began disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of weekly statistical supplement on the RBI website. a Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance posts selected monthly fiscal data and quarterly debt data of the central government on its website. However, no monthly data on fiscal ’ The STA missions that visited India in November/December 1997 and February 1998 made comprehensive recommendations to improve the timeliness, scope, and classification of India’s balance of payments statistics.

Consolidated information is unavailable on local government operations. In addition, although data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag, the typical presentation of fiscal accounts does not provide a particularly useful classification for macroeconomic analysis. For example, classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with India On [July 18, 20031, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with India.’ Background Economic activity in 2002103 was uneven across key sectors. Growth is estimated to have slowed to 4’/2 percent in 2002103 from 5% percent in 2001/02, with the sharp drought-induced decline in agriculture (by 3 percent) offsetting the recovery in industry and the strong growth in services. Within industry, infrastructure-related sectors seem to have led the way, on the back of the publicly sponsored national highways development project. Inflation has picked up in recent months mostly owing to supply side factors. WPI inflation rose from under 2 percent in April 2002 to about 6’/2 percent in end-March 2003 before subsiding again to around 5 percent in early June. The pickup was mostly due to the higher global oil prices and a drought, which affected edible oil prices. Balance of payments developments have been favorable and foreign exchange reserves are being accumulated at an unprecedented rate. Goods and services export growth was l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities.

Notwithstanding the relatively strong growth in non-oil imports (13% percent in 2002/03), India registered current account surpluses estimated at % percent of GDP in 2002103. Capital account developments appear to have been driven by dollar weakness and expectation of rupee appreciation, a highly favorable interest rate differential, and changes in international banking practices. The result of these developments has been an unprecedented accumulation of reserves-reserves reached over $82 billion in mid-June-and an appreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar by 3% percent in the year to May 2003. Financial markets were characterized by general weakness in equity prices, coupled with a sustained rally in bond markets. Stock market developments in India have generally been weak and have mirrored those in global and regional equity markets. In contrast, bond markets have witnessed a sustained rally. Easy liquidity conditions coupled with weak investment demand and structural reforms that have deepened government securities markets resulted in a sharp decline in interest rates to historical lows, notwithstanding the large government borrowing needs. These conditions also allowed a lengthening of the maturity of government debt, and led to a flattening of the yield curve and a narrowing of spreads between government and corporate bonds, across the maturity and credit quality spectrum. Monetary and exchange rate policy was aimed at maintaining easy liquidity conditions while also attempting to limit volatility in the rupee and stem its appreciation. Since April 2002, the bank rate-the key policy signaling rate-has been reduced by 50 bps to 6 percent, the repo rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 1 percentage point to 4% percent. At the same time, the RBI continued to mop up the supply of dollars to limit the appreciation of the rupee out of concern about the impact on competitiveness. This intervention in foreign exchange markets was accompanied by sterilization operations. The authorities also used the opportunity provided by the strong reserve position to further open up the capital account, prepay some external debt, and offer debt relief to HIPC nations. General government fiscal imbalances in 2002103 are likely to be worse than expected in the budget. The provisional estimate is for a central government deficit (including privatization receipts in revenues) of 5.9 percent of GDP, compared with the budget target of 5.3 percent of GDP. The outcome for the subnational governments in 2002/03 is also likely to be worse than expected-the staff estimates a deficit of over 4’/2 percent of GDP, compared with a budget target of 4 percent of GDP. Revenue shortfalls were the main factors underlying the weaker- than-planned outcome, notwithstanding some expenditure compression. Consequently, the general government deficit in 2002103 is estimated to be about 10 percent of GDP and general government debt about 84 percent of GDP. Contingent liabilities in the form of central and state government guarantees stand at around 12 percent of GDP. The budget for 2003/04, announced in February 2003, makes little headway in checking fiscal imbalances. The deficit is to be reduced by only about 1/3 percent of GDP to 5.6 percent Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 65 - ANNEX VII of GDP in 2003104.’ On the revenue side, the budget includes some measures to improve tax administration, but does little to simplify the system and reduce the scope for discretion. The budget also expects to collect some Rs. 132 billion (1/2 percent of GDP) in privatization revenues, compared with about Rs. 30 billion actually realized in 2002/03. There were only a few measures on the expenditure side-the modest increase in fertilizer prices announced in the budget was rolled back early in the parliamentary debate on the budget. A central plank of the budget is the promotion of infrastructure projects worth Rs. 600 billion (2% percent of GDP) over the medium term. These projects are to be undertaken through public-private partnerships, with the government expecting to contribute Rs. 20 billion annually. The budget also contains several proposals aimed at taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to restructure the debt obligations of both the central and state governments. The central and state governments have agreed that, over a three year period ending in 2004/05, all states’ debt owed to the central government carrying interest rates in excess of 13 percent will be swapped for additional proceeds from small savings and market loans, both of which currently have lower interest rates. In addition, the government also offered a scheme to buy back banks’ holdings of central government securities which were contracted under high interest rates of the early 1990s. These securities are to be bought back on a voluntary basis from banks that are in need of liquidity or want to encash the premium on their bond holdings for making provisions on their nonperforming assets (NPAs). To provide the incentive for banks to do the latter, the authorities have allowed a tax deduction on the premium income if banks use it to increase provisions. The staff projects that the economy will grow at 5% percent in 2003104, broadly in line with consensus forecasts. The projection for 2003/04 incorporates a recovery in agriculture, assuming a normal monsoon, and some modest deceleration in the growth of industry and services, taking into account the lagged negative impact of the drought. Inflation is expected to moderate to around 4’/2 percent by end-2003/04. The external current account is projected to remain in surplus.
