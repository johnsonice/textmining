INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 1. Palau, like the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, is a small Pacific island economy with a narrow productive base, heavily dependent on grants from the United States to finance otherwise unsustainable fiscal imbalances. Given that the U.S. grants are scheduled to be phased out over the next decade, fundamental reforms are needed to achieve long-term sustainability. The burden of adjustment falls squarely on fiscal policy, as the U.S. dollar is used as legal tender. At the same time, structural reform is essential to attract foreign direct investment and to promote a dynamic private sector, led by tourism where potential for growth is clearly the greatest. 2. The need for corrective action has been made more urgent by a sharp worsening of the fiscal position in 1998199 (October/September). While U.S. grants are scheduled to fall by about 5 percent of GDP in 1998/99, tax revenues have been weakened by the economic . slowdown in the wake of the Asian crisis, and nontax revenues are expected to fall sigmticantly without the one-time factors that temporarily boosted revenues in the previous two years. As a result, the budget deficit (including grants) is expected to reach 12 percent of GDP in 1998/99, compared with surpluses in the previous two years. 3. Against this background, the discussious focussed on: (1) the need to achieve a large fiscal adjustment to prevent an unsustainable drawdown of government financial holdings; and (2) structural reform to promote a dynamic private sector and improve medium-term growth prospects. On the fiscal front, the authorities accepted the mission’s recommendation that it would be prudent to aim at eliminating the budget deficit over the next three years. As a first step, the government intends to incorporate measures in the 1999/2000 budget that would reduce the deficit (excluding grants) by 3-4 percent of GDP. 4. On structural reform, given the critical need for foreign direct investment, the authorities agreed with the mission’s recommendations to streamline and increase the transparency of investment approval procedures, and relax some regulations concerning foreign direct investment. The authorities also agreed to place a high priority on clari@ing land ownership and lease rights, which has prevented the effective use of real estate as collateral. 5. Palau’s macroeconomic statistics, including monetary and balance of payments, are weak and incomplete, hampering economic analysis and surveillance. The mission urged that the weaknesses in the statistical database be addressed and that core data be reported to the Fund on a regular basis. II. ECONOMICSETTING 6. Palau is an archipelago of over 200 islands, located in the Western Pacific about 500 miles east of the Philippines. It has a small population of about 18,000, but a relatively high per capita GDP of over $7,000 (Table 1). Palau faces many development constraints common among Pacific island economies: a narrow resource base; geographical isolation; large distances Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4- between the islands; a small domestic market; poor infrastructure; lack of skilled labor; and vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters.’ 7. Palau remains heavily dependent on grants from the United States, although aid from Japan has increased in recent years. Since October 1994, the relationship with the United States has been defined by the Compact of Free Association (the Compact),2 under which the United States retains responsibility for defense and provides grants totaling over $500 million during the first 15 years (about $2,000 per capita per year). Compact grants are heavily frontloaded (about 40 percent was disbursed in the first year) and programmed to decline over the 15-year period (Table 2). Specific amounts are earmarked for various purposes, including investment in infrastructure and the creation of a Trust Fund ($70 million), the proceeds of which essentially cannot be used until 2009/10 (see Annex II for details on the Compact Trust Fund).3 8. The Palauan economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounted for over 80 percent of GDP in 1998. Grants financed the growth of a large government, which is still by far the largest sector (22 percent of GDP), and imports, which fi.teled the expansion of wholesale and retail trade, and transport sectors (each 16 percent of GDP). Hotels and restaurants accounted for 11 percent of GDP in 1998, reflecting the growth of tourism. Agriculture, fisheries, and manufacturing together accounted for only 6 percent of GDP.4 III. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSANDNEAR-TERMOUTLOOK 9. The economy grew rapidly in the first years of the Compact (over 20 percent per annum in nornina terms or about 1 O-l 5 percent a year in real terms in 1995-96), reflecting the impact of grants on consumption and investment, and a two-thirds increase in tourists, primarily from Japan and Taiwan, Province of China (see Table 1 and Figure 1). However, economic conditions worsened markedly in the past two years, as the Asian crisis badly affected tourism, the main private sector activity. With the U.S. dollar being legal tender, Palau suffered a ‘Further background on Palau is provided in the membership paper, Republic ofPaZau- Calculation of Quota, EB/CM/Republic of Palau/97/1 (7/25/97). 2Palau was administered by the United States after WWII as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Palau became a sovereign state on October 1, 1994. The Compact has a duration of 50 years, but contains commitments to provide recurring grants only in the first 15 years. 3From 1998/99, annual early withdrawals of up to $5 million (indexed at 5 percent inflation) are allowed from the Compact Trust Fund for current #operations and maintenance. With early withdrawals, the Trust Fund is intended to provide annual distributions of $15 million after 2008/09. See Annex I of the membership paper for details on the Compact of Free Association. 4Fisheries has declined owing to climatic and oceanographic changes and depletion of stock.

While about half of this appreciation has since been reversed, tourists increased moderately in 1997 and fell by 11 percent in 1998 (data for the first months of 1999 indicate that the fall has continued, particularly for tourists from Taiwan, Province of China). As a result, real GDP stayed flat in 1997 and is estimated to have declined somewhat in the next 18 months. While real activity is expected to remain subdued for the rest of 1999, it should pick up in 2000 reflecting a rebound in the regional economy and the initiation of large investment projects (notably the $150 million Compact Road around Babeldaob). Inflation is not measured in Palau, but likely has been in the low single-digit range in the last few years in line with inflation in the United States and Japan. 10. Based on preliminary indications, the budget is expected to record a large deficit of 12 percent of GDP in 1998/99, compared with a 6 percent surplus in 1997/98 and balance in 1996/97 (Table 3). The abrupt worsening in the fiscal position, despite a significant cutback (from the budgeted amount) in needed capital expenditure, reflected partly the absence in 1998/99 of one-time gains that boosted revenue temporarily in the previous two years. In 1996/97, investments of Compact funds (excluding the Trust Fund) in the U.S. equity market performed particularly well, while in 1997/98, the government received a legal settlement pertaining to the collapse of the Babeldaob-Koror Bridge worth 10 percent of GDP. Without these windfalls, the budget would have been in deficit by around 4 percent of GDP in these years. 11. Other negative factors affecting the budget included: (1) weak tax revenues from the recession, even as measures were taken in 1998 to offset part of the revenue loss;’ (2) a scheduled step down in U.S. grants equivalent to 4% percent of GDP; and (3) a 5 percent of GDP increase in current expenditure, including a sizable contribution to the heavily underfunded Civil Service Pension Fund. Notably, subsidies to public enterprises have declined sharply from 7 percent of GDP in 1995196 to 1 percent in 1998/99, reflecting mainly the cessation of subsidies to the public utility corporation. 12. The large budget deficit for 1998/99 signals severe underlying problems: (1) low tax revenues (about 14 percent of GDP in recent years) reflecting a narrow tax base and tax administration problems; and (2) excessive current spending (45 percent of GDP on average in recent years, 90 percent of which on wages and salaries, and procurement of goods and services). By contrast, capital spending on infrastructure, which is essential for growth, fell from 14 percent ‘For example, import taxes were raised in January 1998 on (1) tobacco products and liquors, and (2) vehicles (from 3 to 5 percent), while exemptions were eliminated except for government imports. These measures are estimated to boost revenue by l-l.5 percentage points of 1998/99 GDP.

Excluding grants, the budget deficit is expected to rise to 30 percent of GDP in 1998/99 from 17 percent of GDP in 1997/98. 13. Although the government has prudently avoided foreign borrowing or drawing on the Compact Trust Fund, there has been a significant drawdown of government financial assets (excluding the Trust Fund) to finance the budgetary shortfall. The Trust Fund, managed by international fund managers, has grown to $140 million (13 percent larger than envisaged under the Compact by this time), as a part has been held in U.S. mutual funds that benefited from the strong bull market in recent years (see Annex II for details on the Trust Fund).6 14. The external current account has in recent years been characterized by large trade deficits that have been more than offset by sizable services account surpluses and grants (Table 4). The trade deficit declined from 47 percent of GDP in 1995/9696/97 to 40 percent of GDP in the last two years, as imports have been compressed by recession.’ With growing tourist receipts, the current account deficit (excluding grants) fell sharply to 6 percent in 1996/97 from 15 percent of GDP in 1995/96, but has since deteriorated with the Asian crisis (an 11 percent deficit is expected in 1998199). The current account after grants remained in surplus, but the size of the surplus is expected to drop to 4 percent of GDP in 1998199 from 17 percent in 1996/97. 15. Data on the external capital account are scarce, but changes in government financial assets (excluding the Trust Fund) provide an approximate indicator of changes in official foreign reserves, and indicate that the overall balance of payments moved sharply from a deficit of $12 million in 1995/96 to a surplus of $4 million in 1997/98, before moving back to an expected deficit of $19 million in 1998/99. The disparity between the current account surplus and the overall balance of payments, together with large negative errors and omissions, suggests a significant capital outflow from Palau. Such a movement is likely to reflect a pooling of resources by U.S.-based banks in their headquarters for reallocation elsewhere (more below). External debt is small, about US$5 million at end-September 1998, and will be fully repaid by 1999/2000. There are no off-balance sheet operations in the Trust Fund. The general investment strategy is to hold 60 percent of the portfolio in equities and the remainder in bonds and other interest- bearing assets. ‘Palau’s exports are small (about 17 percent of imports and 9 percent of GDP in the last three years) and consist almost entirely of fish.

Discussions focused on the outlook and policies for 1999 and beyond, centering on the adequacy and timing of the government’s nascent reform program, and the issue of fiscal and external sustainability.’ A. Fiscal Policy 17. The government fully recognixes that a drawdown in government asset holdings of the magnitude expected in 1998/99 cannot be sustained, and that the fiscal imbalances require early and substantial remedial actions. The government does not wish to repeat the experiences of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which demonstrate clearly the costs of delaying painful but necessary adjustment, and accepted the team’s recommendation that it would be prudent to eliminate the budget deficit over the next three years. As a first step, the government intends to incorporate measures in the 1999/2000 budget that would reduce the budget deficit by $4-5 million (3-4 percent of GDP). About half of the adjustment could be achieved from a 5 percent reduction of the wage bi11,9 and outlays on goods and services, while safeguarding priority expenditures on health, education, and maintenance, and allowing for adequate increases in capital spending to improve infrastructure. On the revenue side, the government intends to seek swift congressional approval of the new Tax Code (prepared with Fund technical assistance). This should increase tax revenue by $2-2.5 million in 1999/2000 by broadening the tax base and improving tax administration and enforcement.” In *The government’s long-term strategy is set out in a 25-year Master Development Plan (1996 2020), which the National Congress approved in late 1998. The aims are to: (1) shift economic activity from the public to the private sector; (2) strengthen government institutions, while reducing the size of government; and (3) identify financing strategies, including tax reform, to offset falling U.S. grants. Early reform actions have included the preparation of a new Tax Code and initiation of an output budgeting system in the Ministry of Administration. 9To be achieved mainly through a hiring freeze and attrition. On July 1,1999, the government changed the requirement for mandatory retirement to 30 years of service from 60 years of age, which immediately reduced the number of civil servants by 124 (about 5 percent). No incentive packages are being offered. “The new Tax Code aims to establish a modern, broad-based tax system, with appropriate and clear laws on administrative powers for tax and customs. It provides for: (1) a modem, simplified income tax; (2) an expanded customs duty structure with few rates and exemptions; (3) a new excise tax for alcohol, tobacco products, fuels, and motor vehicles; and (4) some special minor taxes (Hotel Room Tax, Departure Tax, Road Use Tax, Vessel Cabin Tax, and Fish Export Tax). The new Tax Code addresses a number of deficiencies in administrative powers under the current tax law, and is designed to be phased in over a period with the elements covering tax administration and collection, and duty and excise to be applied first. The draft Tax Code (continued.. .)

For fiscal years 2000/01-2001/02, the government agreed to consider: (1) expanding the ongoing effort to install an output budgeting system in the Ministry of Administration to other ministries;” and (2) further cost savings by outsourcing government services. The team encouraged the authorities to improve the financial performance of public enterprises, including the utilities and telecommunications companies, by increasing accountability of management. The team urged the government to refrain from foreign borrowing,” and supported the government’s strong intention to avoid early withdrawals from the Compact Trust Fund to protect the future income stream, .particularly given possible corrections in the U.S. stock market. The team also endorsed the government’s aim of improving over the coming years the finances of the heavily underfunded Social Security and Civil Service Pension Funds through a combination of increased contribution rates and reduced benefit payments, to the extent that resources could not be made available from the budget.13 B. Structural Reform 19. The government fully recognizes that substantial structural reform is needed to promote a dynamic private sector that could drive future growth.14 Given the critical need for foreign direct investment (FDI), and to complement government investment in infrastructure, initially contained a proposal for a value-added tax, which was removed by the authorities, in line with FAD recommendations, in view of concerns about complexity and its appropriateness for a small economy like Palau at this time. “Where output targets or performance goals are set for the different departments to allow better measurement of performance and to improve efficiency. 12Given its high per capita GDP, Palau is generally not eligible for concessional foreign financing. 13Actuarial calculations indicate that the Social Security Fund is underfunded by about $19 million (15 percent of 1998199 GDP), and the Civil Service Pension Fund ~underfimded by $23 million (18 percent of 1998199 GDP). The government has yet to formulate a formal plan for funding the Social Security Fund, but has presented to the National Congress alternative plans for the Pension Fund, contemplating budget contributions, increased payroll contributions and benefit reductions. “Tourism is the sector with the best growth potential by far, although there is some potential in fishing, handicraft and other light manufacturing, and agriculture. Completion of the Compact Road around the largest island, Babeldaob, should greatly enhance the prospects for tourism. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-9- the team pressed for a simplified regulatory framework with less restrictions on FDI and more streamlined investment approval procedures, ” I6 as well as steps to allow a more effective use of real estate as collateral. The government intends to quickly set up a joint task force with the National Congress to formulate recommendations for promoting FDI. In addition, in line with the findings of a recent World Bank report, the government intends to streamline and increase the transparency of foreign investment approval procedures, while relaxing some of the regulations concerning the minimum size of investment, share of local employment, and sectors in which foreigners can participate. Legislation based on the recommendations of the joint task force could be considered by the National Congress in 2000. 20. The inability to use land as collateral presents a major barrier to FDI (as well as local investment, as explained below). Local laws prohibit foreign ownership of land and, though leases are transferable and can be held by foreigners for up to 50 years, foreign banks and investors are reluctant to lend against leases, because of uncertainties concerning lease rights. For cultural and historical reasons,” there is a great deal of uncertainty in Palau about who owns land or has the right to a lease, which is manifest in a large number of unsettled claims registered at the Land Court. The authorities correctly placed high priority on making rapid progress in this politically charged area, so that real estate could more easily be used as collateral. The government recently increased the number of judges assigned to the Land Court from 3 to 7, while a new U.S. grant of $1.3 million is expected to facilitate the computerization of land mappings and certification of land titles. C. Financial Sector Policy 21. Discussions on the financial system focused on measures to enhance the role of banks in promoting private investment and bank soundness. ‘* The lack of monetary data “Some activities are currently reserved exclusively for Palauan citizens or businesses wholly owned by them, including wholesale and retail trade in goods, land transportation, and some tourism and travel activities. “At present, all foreign investors are required to apply to the Foreign Investment Board. All applications are required to be circulated to other relevant parties for comments, and the Board determines the terms and conditions for operating, including the scope of activity, scope of raw materials and natural resource use, use of local supplies and services, ownership or management participation by Palauans, employee training programs, and duration of operation. “Much of the land in Palau is owned by clans, and can only be given or sold to an individual by unanimous consent by clan members. At the same time, Japanese occupation during WWII and the subsequent redistribution of land created much confusion about who owned the land. ‘*Palau’s financial sector consists of eight commercial banks and a state bank, the National Development Bank of Palau. The three largest banks (accounting for over 80 percent of deposits) (continued. . . ) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- lo- makes it difficult to assess financial development, but a survey of larger U.S. 'banks indicated that deposits were substantially in excess of local loans, suggesting that fmancial capital tended to flow out of Palau through the banking system, as noted earlier.” At the same time, the banks tend to focus on smaller consumer loans, which are well secured by wage and salary deductions paid into bank accounts, rather than business loans. Discussions with bank managers revealed a perceived lack of investment opportunities. Commercial loans (especially for ‘business startups) were viewed as carrying significant risk, so that the banks preferred to.pool deposits at headquarters for investment elsewhere. Difficulties in using real estate as collateral presented another problem for foreign-owned banks. While the National Development Bank of Palau (NDBP) alleviated this problem to some extent by guaranteeing 90 percent of a loan for a fee (NDBP would assume the land tit:le in case of default), the NDBP was unable to provide guarantees in recent years, as its own balance sheet had deteriorated markedly partly because of poor-quality direct lending. The situation clearly adds urgency to the need for clarifying land ownership and lease rights, as noted above. 22. On the issue of bank soundness, the team emphasized that locally chartered banks, which are not subject to any banking regulation or supervision, presented a potential systemic risk to the economy. While deposits in U.S. based banks are insured by the FDIC and these banks are required to follow U.S. banking regulations, there are currently no banking regulations covering locally chartered banks, although they tend to follow some U.S. regulations to have a correspondent relationship with a U.S. bank.*’ Discussions with the locally chartered banks indicated that they were not burdened by significant nonperforming loans, as they also concentrated on small and well-secured consumer loans. Nevertheless, the team urged the government to put in place as soon as possible a regulatory framework for the operation of the banking sector in line with international standards, particularly regarding bank supervision. The authorities noted that technical assistance in this area would be welcome, as they are committed to making substantial progress in this area in the coming year, including the presentation of draft banking regulations to the National Congress in 2000. 23. The NDBP is heavily burdened by nonperforming loans and is currently in a consolidation mode. Because of poor lending practices and a lack of accountability, nonperforming loans accounted for 30 percent of the bank’s portfolio. New management has are U.S. based (Bank of Hawaii, Bank of Guam, and Guam Savings and Loan Association), while the others are smaller, locally chartered banks. 19For example, at end-February 1999, the Bank of Hawaii (the largest bank) recorded $62 million in deposits, of which $23 million was reflected in loans and $39 million in claims on headquarters. 2o There are no regulations or requirements regarding the concentration of ownership, standby credit lines in case of bank runs, related-party lending, and large exposure restrictions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-ll- been brought in from the outside to concentrate on loan recovery, as well as to improve record keeping and loan appraisal skills. However, the NDBP is not expected to resume new lending or issue new guarantees in the near term and loan recovery is expected to be a slow and difficult process. The team supported the government’s intention not to recapitalize the NDBP until its operational problems have been dealt with. D. Statistical Data and Other Issues 24. Economic statistics continue to be seriously deficient in Palau, and the team urged the government to improve quickly the institutional capacity to collect and disseminate basic data. As an initial step, the government intends to provide the Fund with the available core economic data on a monthly basis. With technical assistance from the UNDP (and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center), the authorities intend to provide consumer price and monetary data by end- 1999. On the Y2K problem, they noted that preparations are proceeding on schedule, with grant assistance by the World Bank. E. Medium-Term Outlook 25. The team prepared with the authorities two illustrative medium-term scenarios covering the period through 2008/09, when Compact grants end (see Annex I). In the baseline scenario, where no new measures are assumed, a large fiscal deficit persists, as the tax base remains narrow and current expenditures remain large. Government financial holdings (excluding the Trust Fund) are rapidly depleted, after which substantial foreign borrowing would be needed. Slow structural reform, and inadequate capital spending in infrastructure, would keep real GDP growth low, perhaps below population growth of about 2 percent per annum. In the adjustment scenario, the government is assumed to take corrective action, including adoption of the new Tax Code, while cutting back significantly on nonessential current spending, so that the budget deficit is closed in three years. Vigorous structural reform would stimulate an increase in FDI and growth in tourism, where the greatest potential clearly lies, and related activities (e.g., hotels and trade), so that much higher real GDP growth is achieved (6-7 percent per annum). The potential for merchandise exports remains relatively limited. Government financial assets remain at a comfortable level, while preserving the Trust Fund for future uses. Sustainability is achieved, as the gap left by the cessation of Compact grants can then be filled by the annual sustainable distributions from the Trust Fund. V. STAFFAPPRAISAL 26. Fundamental fiscal and structural reforms will be needed to prepare for the phasing out of U.S. grants over the next decade and to achieve long-term sustainability. As the U.S. dollar is legal tender, fiscal consolidation will be essential to achieve macroeconomic balance, while structural reform will be critical to fostering a dynamic private sector. While the government successfully maintained fiscal surpluses in 1996/97-97/98 (partly through good management of its financial holdings and reducing subsidies to public enterprises but also Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 12- because of windfall gains), the need for substantial additional measures has been made more urgent by the sharp deterioration of the fiscal position in 1998/99. 27. Against this background, the staff very much welcomes the government’s intention to incorporate in the 1999/2000 budget measures to reduce the fiscal deficit by 3-4 percent of GDP, and to eliminate the deficit within three years. The staff strongly supports the government’s intention to proceed with necessary cuts in nonpriority current expenditure, while safeguarding expenditure on health, education and maintenance, and ensuring adequate infiastructural investment. On the revenue side, the government should ensure the early adoption of the new Tax Code and facilitate its effective implementation through a comprehensive public education and training effort, thorough implementation planning, and improved monitoring of revenue collection. The authorities should adjust tax rates promptly, if needed. 28. The staff also welcomes the authorities’ intention to make rapid progress on much needed structural reforms, to streamline and increase transparency of investment approval procedures, and allow more effective use of land as collateral. In so doing, significant barriers to both FDI and the investment of domestic savings would be removed, which should boost private sector activity in the coming years. 29. Although the banks in Palau do not appear to be burdened by significant nonperforming loans (except the NDBP), the lack of banking regulation or supervision for locally chartered banks presents a potential systemic risk. The staff urges that proper banking regulation and supervision in line with best international practices be introduced as soon as possible to reduce this risk. The NDBP should substantially strengthen its loan appraisal and loan collection capacity, and be shielded from political pressures on lending decisions, before recapitalization. 30. Economic statistics continue to be seriously deficient in Palau, and the government should improve quickly data availability including through regular reporting to the Fund. 31.

The baseline scenario (Table I. 1) assumes that the government fails to follow through with the strong fiscal and structural reforms necessary to achieve long-term sustainability. The adjustment scenario (Table 1.2) assumes that fiscal actions are taken to close the budget deficit in three years, while significant structural reforms are undertaken to promote foreign direct investment and develop a dynamic private sector, led by tourism where the potential for growth is clearly the greatest. A. Baseline scenario (Table 1.1) Without the structural reforms needed to encourage foreign investment and private sector activity, and without adequate spending on infrastructure, real GDP growth should remain low (l-2 percent a year), although it could be somewhat higher in the next few years with recovery of the regional economy and some big construction projects including the Compact Road. Inflation is assumed to be in line with major partner countries at 3-4 percent a year. Fiscal sustainability On the expenditure side, both current and capital expenditures are assumed to be kept constant in real,terms over 1998/99-2001/02, ’ Current expenditure remains high at over 40 percent of GDP in 2001/02, while capital spending remains low at 8 percent of GDP. Thereafter, both types of expenditure are assumed to increase in line with. GDP (alternatively, with real GDP growing at l-2 percent per annum, real spending per capita remains relatively constant). On the revenue side, it is assumed that domestic (tax and nontax) revenues remain unchanged relative to GDP at about 25 percent. On these assumptions, the fiscal deficit excluding grants would fall to 23 percent of GDP in 2001/02 from 27 percent in 1998/99, and stay at that level through 2008/09. With the phasing down of U.S. grants, the fiscal deficit after grants would worsen from 10 percent of GDP in 1999/2000-2001/02 to nearly 16 percent of GDP in 2008/09. Palau would fail to achieve fiscal sustainability, as the fiscal gap in 2008/09 is significantly larger than the annual distributions that could realistically be expected from the Trust Fund (see Annex II). Large fiscal deficits excluding grants would quickly lead to the depletion of government financial holdings (excluding the Trust Fund), after which the government would need to resort to foreign commercial borrowing or drawing down the Trust Fund. ‘References in this annex to current expenditures in 1998/99 exclude the budget contribution of $4 million to the Civil Service Pension Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- ANNEX1 External sustainability Exports remain small, while imports continue to grow in line with nominal GDP, and the trade deficit stays large at about 40 percent of GDP. However, the current account deficit excluding grants deteriorates to 17 percent of GDP in 2008/09 from 11 percent in 1998/99, reflecting slow growth of tourism and falling investment income, as government financial holdings are depleted. After grants, the current account worsens to a deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 2008/09 from a surplus in 1998/99. With a lack of investment opportunities, large capital outflows continue, and large balance of payments deficits persist. Hence, external sustainability is not achieved. B. Adjustment scenario (Table 1.2) With the necessary structural reforms, a dynamic private sector led by tourism develops, driving much higher real growth. Real GDP growth of 6-7 percent per annum would seem feasible, in view of the rapid growth experienced in 1995-96 and given the potential for further expansion of the tourism industry. Inflation is assumed to be in line with major partner countries at around 3-4 percent per annum. Fiscal sustainability It is assumed that the budget deficit is closed within three years. On the expenditure side, current spending is assumed to be reduced by about 2 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 in line with the authorities’ intentions for this budget year, and held relatively constant in nominal terms during the following two years. This would bring current spending down to one-third of GDP by 2001/02. With savings from the implementation of output budgeting, contracting out of services, and eventual privatization, current spending should grow more slowly than nominal GDP thereafter. Capital spending is assumed to be accelerated to around IO percent of GDP. On the revenue side, the new Tax Code is assumed to broaden the tax base while improving tax administration, so that tax revenue grows at a somewhat faster rate than GDP. On these assumptions, the fiscal deficit excluding grants would fall to 3 percent of GDP by 2008/09. The fiscal balance after grants would turn to balance by 2001/02 and improve gradually to a small surplus of l-2 percent of GDP by 2008/09. Fiscal sustainability is reached, as the fiscal deficit excluding grants in the last year of Compact grants could easily be filled by sustainable annual distributions from the Trust Fund. Palau would also maintain a comfortable cushion of reserves. External sustainability Exports grow relatively strongly (6-7 percent per annum), albeit from a very low level, while imports grow at a slightly slower pace than nominal GDP with the development of domestic producers. The trade deficit still remains large at 40 percent of GDP, but the current account deficit excluding grants improves markedly to 7 percent of GDP in 2008109 from 11 percent in 1998/99, reflecting strong growth of tourism. Including grants, the current account shifts to Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:56 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 20 - a small deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 from a small surplus in 1998/99. However, with much greater opportunity for investment in Palau, the large capital outflows are reversed by substantial foreign direct investment, Hence, external sustainability is also achieved.

The only exception was that, starting in 1998/99, a maximum of $5 million (indexed at 5 percent inflation) could be withdrawn from the Trust Fund for current operations and maintenance purposes.* With an assumed rate of return of 12% percent, it was intended to produce an annual distribution of $15 million starting in 2009/10 to replace Compact grants, even if the maximum early withdrawals were made. The Trust Fund has performed well to date, as the investment strategy has been to maintain about 60 percent of the funds in the U.S. stock market, which has experienced a strong bull run in the last few years. At end-May 1999, the Trust Fund had grown to $141 million, about 13 percent more than had been envisaged by this time. Against this background, the level of drawings from the Trust Fund that could be sustained beyond 2008/09 will depend on: (1) the expected rate of return in future years; and (2) the extent of early permissible withdrawals made. Some numerical examples are tabulated below. Rate of return (in percent) Sustainable disbursement from 2009/10 (in million U.S. dollars) With early permissible withdrawals Without early permissible withdrawals 12% 10 8 6 37 23 15 9 51 33 23 14 . Given the strong performance so far, the Trust Fund is in a good financial position and should, with reasonable rates of return (perhaps in the 8-10 percent range), be able to provide annual disbursements after 2008/09 that will fully offset the cessation of U.S. grants. . The authorities’ have adopted a cautious approach to early withdrawals from the Trust Fund, particularly given the possibility of a reversal of recent capital gains, if there is a contraction in the U.S. stock market. A low-risk rate of return of 6 percent (in line with the current yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bills) would provide for annual distributions of $14 million if early permissible withdrawals are not made, and only $9 million if they are made. ‘The Compact Section 21 l(f) Trust Fund. $66 million was disbursed into the Trust Fund in 1994/95 and $4 million in 1996/97. *No early withdrawals were made in 1998/99 and the government does not envisage any such withdrawals at this time.

There are presently no official statistical publications at the aggregate level and data on national accounts, monetary developments, and the balance of payments are severely limited. At the conclusion of the first .Article IV consultation mission in July 1999, the authorities, however, agreed to begin providing to the Fund the available core economic data on a regular basis. A. Real sector Estimates of the national accounts have only been compiled on a sporadic basis since 1984. GDP data by economic activity at current prices for 1984-85, 1990-91, and 1992-93 were compiled by a UNDP consultant, the United Nations Economic and Social. Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and under a joint project by the University of Oregon and the US. Department of Interior, respectively. These GDP estimates are not comparable because of methodological differences in compilation. However, the 1992-93 GDP data were found to be the most adequate in coverage and quality; and a similar approach was followed, with some improvements, by the current UNDP consultant to produce a comparable set of GDP estimates for 1996 and 1997. The 1992 and 1993 and 1996 an 1997 GDP data were then used as benchmarks by the staff to estimate GDP for 1994 and 1995 and 1998 in line with available sector indicators for these years. The authorities now have the capacity to produce consistent official estimates of the national accounts on an annual basis, wlhich they have agreed to provide to the Fund on a regular basis. As a next logical step, the authorities intend to turn their attention to compiling a consumer price index for Palau. B. Government finance Extensive government finance statistics are compiled at both the national and state level as part of their respective annual budgetary processes. The authorities have agreed to provide these fiscal data to the Fund on a regular basis in a standard Fund-format usable for analysis. I Considerable technical assistance has been provided by the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) in Fiji, a long-term FAD advisor, and LEG for preparation of a new tax code. C. Monetary accounts Balance sheet data are not currently provided by banks to the authorities, and hence there is no official collection of a banking survey. At present, the banks only file quarterly tax forms to the Ministry of Administration on their operations. The authorities have, however, agreed to take steps to have banks report their balance sheet data by end- 1999.

Estimates of the balance of payments for 1992/93-1997/98 have been prepared by the staff based on official data on imports, interest income, official grants, debt service, and the financial holdings of the government, and estimates of exports, services, and private transfers. Compilation of the balance of payments is further complicated by a lack of commercial banking data, which the authorities have made a top priority in addressing.

In 1998, the Bank prepared an economic report entitled “Enhancing the Role of Government in the Pacific Island Economies,” which included a country economic profile on the Republic of Palau. The report analyzed the scope of government in the Pacific Island member countries, their spending patterns and priorities, and the budgetary processes that give rise to spending choices. The Bank has recently provided technical assistance in the health sector, involving a review of a draft health care plan and legislation, and the Bank Group’s Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) has carried out a diagnostic review of the investment environment. The Bank is also currently providing assistance on the Y2K problem and on the management of coastal resource areas.
