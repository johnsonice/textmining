INTRODUCTION 1. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation, Directors agreed that a determined implementation of the authorities’ policy agenda was needed to reverse the recent decline in growth and continue progress toward poverty reduction. They noted that the critical priority was to place the fiscal position on a sustainable path and to push forward broad-based structural reforms. Directors emphasized that a significant increase in the revenue ratio would be an essential prerequisite to successful fiscal consolidation. They also called for expenditure rationalization, prompt passage and strict implementation of the proposed fiscal responsibility legislation, and strengthening states’ finances. On structural reforms, Directors identified reforms of the financial sector, the power sector, labor and product markets, and trade liberalization as priorities. 2. This year’s consultation discussions took place against a backdrop of a modest cyclical recovery in the context of a slowdown in trend growth, and continued deterioration in the public finances. On the positive side, inflation is low, the external position is comfortable, with a large build-up in reserves, and there has been progress in the structural reform agenda, notably disinvestment of public enterprises. However, India’s impressive economic growth of the mid-1990s-fruits of the reforms of the early 1990s-has stalled in recent years. The trend slowdown reflects lower growth in agriculture and industry, and on the demand side, it is largely the result of lackluster business investment (Box l).’ Cyclical and exogenous factors-including recurrent weakness in the external environment, droughts, and natural disasters-contributed, but the slowdown also reflects weak business confidence, remaining structural distortions, severe infrastructure bottlenecks, and high real interest rates. The fiscal position has deteriorated markedly since 1997/98-the general government deficit and debt stock are now the same as in 1990/91, prior to the balance of payments crisis. 3. Market sentiment was volatile during the past year, reflecting economic and political factors. After falling during most of 2001, the stock market staged a rally in early 2002 largely reflecting the stepped-up pace of privatization (Figure 1). Since early April, however, the main stock market index has fallen by over 10 percent, and net foreign institutional investment (FII) flows have turned negative.2 Recent political developments- electoral losses by the leading party of the national coalition government, the escalation of border tensions, and the communal violence in Gujarat-have weakened sentiment, in part ’ An analysis of recent growth and investment trends is contained in the forthcoming background paper. 2 The forthcoming background paper contains an analysis of the determinants of FII flows to India.

The Economic Slowdown in India After a spurt of growth following the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms that were initiated after the 1991 balance of payments crisis, economic activity in India weakened substantially in the late-1990s.” The slowdown was broad-based, and structural factors played a role. Growth in agriculture slowed from an average of 4% percent in the mid- 1990s to 2 percent in the late- 1990s and in the industrial sector from 7% percent to 4% percent. Service sector growth has remained buoyant, but excluding government services, annual growth in this sector declined slightly from 92/93 93194 94195 95196 96197 97198 98199 99100 OOiOl 01102 8 percent to 7 % percent. While agriculture output was adversely affected by poor weather conditions, overall rainfall during the monsoon season has been considered normal (or within 10 percent of the long-run average) for the past 13 years. This suggests weakness in that sector also reflects limited agricultural diversification, weak rural investment, and continuing regulations on production, storage, and transport. Growth in the industrial sector was undermined, inter alia, by increasing infrastructure constraints and remaining industrial controls, including with small-scale industry reservations and on bankruptcy, restructuring, and labor market rules. The comparative strength of the service sector may reflect the limited applicability of product and factor market regulations on firms in the sector and greater progress with reform (e.g., deregulation of telecommunications and insurance), as well as India’s comparative advantage in providing IT services. Private domestic demand was particularly weak, while external demand and net exports have actually supported growth, notwithstanding the turbulent external environment.3’ In particular, private fixed investment growth plummeted from an average 15% percent in the mid-l 990s to only 3% percent in the late-l 990s-largely reflecting declines in business and investor confidence owing to the slowdown of momentum on reforms, including the uncertainty related to the growing stock of public sector debt. The growth rate of private consumption also fell by about a third to an average of 4 percent, and its contribution to the overall slowdown is comparatively large because it accounts for about 65 percent of GDP. In contrast, overall net exports contributed an average of % percentage point to GDP growth in the late- 1990s compared to - 1 percentage point in the earlier period and estimated real export growth (of goods and services) accelerated from 9% percent to over 16 percent. This in turn reflects gains in India’s estimated market share of services export-India’s market share in goods exports declined slightly. Increased public spending has only offset some of the slowdown in the private economy, perhaps reflecting the quality of the public expenditure. Growth in public expenditure increased substantially between the mid and late-1990s-in particular, annual public consumption growth accelerated from 4% percent to 10% percent. As this surge in expenditure had only limited spillovers to the private economy, it suggests that increased public resources were spent inefficiently-perhaps including capital expenditures-and also that public sector dissaving in recent years may have crowded out the private economy.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS 4. Economic activity picked up modestly during 2001/02 (April-March). GDP growth recovered from 4 percent in 2000/01 to around 5% percent during the first three quarters of 200 l/02, largely driven by strong growth in agriculture. In contrast, industrial growth continued to decelerate recording the lowest growth in a decade during 2001/02 (Figure 2 and Table 1). For the year as a whole, GDP growth is estimated to have been around 5% percent. 5. Inflationary pressures have subsided, WPI inflation, which peaked at over 8% percent (y/y) in early 2001, declined to 1% percent in April 2002-near the lowest rate in a decade. This reflected waning effects of earlier energy price hikes and flat 30 manufactured goods prices-which account for over 60 percent of the index-owing both to increased competitive pressures from trade liberalization and weak demand. In contrast, CPI inflation rose to over 5 percent in recent months, from under 2% percent earlier in the year, reflecting a - IV II iv II IV pick-up in food prices (accounting for nearly 60 percent of the index), which had been stable in recent years3 6. The external position remains comfortable. The current account deficit narrowed to near balance in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, notwithstanding the slowdown in export demand and the pick-up in non-oil imports. The oil import bill fell by $2 billion (about 3 During 2001/02, the pick-up reflected higher non-grain food prices Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-8- ‘/2 percent or CruY) in LuulIuL, rerlectmg aecnnmg woria on prices (rigure 3 anu raoie Lj, Transfers from Indians working abroad also remained buoyant and are reported to have increased after September 11. On the capital account, FDI inflows-especially in the telecom sector-grew strongly, albeit from a low base, and NRI deposit inflows picked up. Foreign exchange reserves rose by $12 billion during 2001/02, and stood at an all time high of $56 billion at end-May (over eight months of goods and services imports and five times short-term external debt) (Figure 4). i 7. The current monetary easing cycle began in early 2001 and an easing bias has been maintained, The bank rate-the key signaling rate-was reduced by 150 basis points and now stands at 6% percent, its lowest level since May 1973. In addition, repo rates were lowered by 200 basis points, Market interest rates on government securities fell sharply at all maturities (e.g., the secondary market yield on the lo-year treasury bill fell by about 290 basis points through April 2002). The cash reserve ratio (CRR) was lowered in stages by a total of 3 percentage points to 5% percent as part of a phased reduction toward the targeted level of 3 percent5 The exchange rate-which is closely managed- depreciated by about 5 percent against the U. S. dollar in the 12 months through end-April but was broadly constant in real effective terms. 8. Despite the cuts in the policy interest rate, lending rates did not fall commensurately and domestic credit growth continued to decelerate. Bank lending and deposit rates fell by only about loo-150 basis points, and the prime lending rate remained virtually unchanged. Factors contributing to the rigidities in the interest rate structure include administered small savings rates which push up the cost of bank deposits, and high levels of 4 Staff estimates suggest that a decline in oil prices by $5/bbl results in a narrowing of the current account deficit by % percent of GDP. 5 At the same time, the interest rate on eligible CRR balances was raised from 6 percent to the bank rate and most CRR exemptions were removed.

The growth of credit to the commercial sector declined from 20 percent (y/y) in December 2000 to about 12 percent (y/y) in recent months (Table 3 and Figure 5). This reflects the overall weakness in private sector demand as well as greater risk aversion on the part of banks given the uncertain outlook for the industrial sector. Thus, monetary easing resulted in commercial banks holding government securities far in excess of statutory liquidity requirements-currently 37 percent of deposit liabilities compared with the minimum of 25 percent. 9. Public finances deteriorated again in 2OOIlO2. Revised estimates announced in February with the 2002/03 budget indicated that the central government deficit (on the authorities’ definition, which treats privatization receipts as revenues) would reach 5% percent of GDP, compared with the target of 4% percent of GDP (Table 4). More recent data suggest that the central government deficit for 2001/02 is likely to have reached 6 percent of GDP. This reflects severe tax shortfalls, due to the industrial slowdown, and overly optimistic budget assumptions (on GDP growth and revenue buoyancy). While nominal spending was kept within the budget, there were overruns in food subsidies. There was, as in previous years, minimal recourse to external financing. Notwithstanding efforts to contain expenditures, the states’ deficit in 2001/02 is expected to be some 4% percent of GDP, above the budget target of around 4 percent of GDP, largely owing to shortfalls in revenue transfers from the center (Table 5).6 The general government deficit is thus estimated to be 10% percent of GDP, and general government debt surpassed 80 percent of GDP by end 2001/02 (Table 6). Including the public enterprises, the consolidated public sector deficit is estimated to have exceeded 11% percent of GDP. Public sector debt (excluding contingent liabilities, estimated to be in the range of 20-50 percent of GDP) now stands at over 90 percent of GDP (Table 7).7 6 To cover part of this shortfall, the ceiling on states’ market borrowing was raised in January 2002. Provisional estimates of the states’ finances in 2001/02 and the consolidated state governments’ budget target for 2002/03 will not be available until mid-2002. 7 General government contingent liabilities arising from government guarantees, arrears in payments to the power utilities from state electricity boards, and financial sector recapitalization needs are estimated to be of the order of 17-20 percent of GDP. Including unfunded pension liabilities, this figure could be around 50 percent of GDP. See background paper for details.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS 10. The staff projects that growth in India will continue at 5% percent in 2002/03. This projection incorporates a modest recovery in the industrial sector to 4% percent, reflecting the expected global recovery expected in the latest World Economic Outlook and a pick-up in demand resulting from stronger rural income growth. It also assumes that the agricultural sector returns to its historical trend growth rate of 3 percent, and that service sector growth levels off at about 7% percent. The consensus forecast for growth in 2002/03 is 5% percent, while the authorities announced a forecast of 6-6Y2 percent. Provided oil prices do not remain high on a sustained basis, inflation pressures are expected to remain subdued with both WI and CPI inflation remaining around 4 percent, and the current account deficit is expected to stay at about % percent of GDP. 11. While India’s growth compares favorably with other developing countries, it falls short of the authorities’ own goals. Achieving annual growth of 8 percent is considered necessary to significantly reduce poverty within a 5-10 year period. Notwithstanding the progress in poverty reduction in the past decade, some 400 million people (or 40 percent of the population) still live on less than $1 a day, compared with half that number in China. Measured by most economic and social indicators, India’s performance continues to compare unfavorably with other emerging markets in Asia (Figure 6 and Table 8). 12.

In contrast, in the staffs illustrative medium-term scenario (Annex I), slow fiscal adjustment and structural reforms imply that growth would remain in the range of 5X-6 percent and would not be sufficiently broad-based for sustained employment generation and poverty reduction8 Moreover, in the event of adverse shocks, the weak fiscal situation and the large government debt stock would leave little room for maneuver in macroeconomic policies. These conditions would hold additional risks for the outlook and could entrench the vicious cycle of decelerating growth, deteriorating fiscal balances, and a weakening financial sector (Box 2). For now, external vulnerability is limited by the relatively low external debt, the large stock of foreign exchange reserves and the controls on capital outflows. Nonetheless, the risks that prolonged domestic weakness could eventually lead to a loss in investor confidence, capital outflows, and balance of payments difficulties cannot be ruled out (Annex 11). IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Fiscal Policy 13. The authorities established a well-defined agenda for fiscal and structural reform last year but progress in key areas has been limited. A central element was the proposed Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) legislation which was seen as an important vehicle for achieving medium-term fiscal consolidation. The strategy was to eliminate the central government revenue deficit (corresponding roughly to the current deficit) by 2006, to reduce the overall central government deficit by at least % percent of GDP each year to 2 percent by 2006, and to reduce total central government liabilities to 50 percent of GDP by 2011. In the event, passage of the FRBM bill was delayed, and the timetable for its passage and its eventual content remain uncertain. 14. The authorities agreed that the key macroeconomic challenge facing India today is to reverse the trend deterioration in public finances that began in 1997/98. The general government deficit, at over 10 percent of GDP is among the highest in the world, and general government debt (excluding contingent liabilities) now stands at 80 percent of GDP. Most fiscal indicators in India now compare very unfavorably with other large developing countries that have recently experienced crises such as Argentina, Brazil and Turkey (Box 3).9 Key recent adverse developments include: ’ Staffs analysis of poverty in India (SM/O1/160: India-Recent Economic Developments and Selected Issues) suggests that growth is highly conducive to poverty reduction in India-an increase of 1 percent in real per capita GDP growth lowers the poverty rate by 0.6 percent, with the strongest effects coming from growth in non-farm output. 9 An analysis of public finances in India is contained in the forthcoming background paper.

At below 10 percent of GDP, it is amongst the lowest in Asia; general government primary deficits widened from 2 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to over 4 percent of GDP; with the large share of revenue going to finance interest spending, priority spending on building and maintaining public infrastructure has tended to be compressed; and the differential between the growth rate and interest rates-a key determinant of fiscal sustainability-narrowed considerably, even turning negative in some recent years, suggesting increasingly unfavorable public debt dynamics. 1.5. The authorities explained that exceptional factors lay behind the deterioration in central government fiscal balances in 2001/02. They pointed out that about half the difference between the budget target for 2001/02 and the revised estimates is explained by the lower GDP base and the other half due to revenue shortfalls, the latter partly the result of optimistic assumptions on revenue collections. In addition, the authorities attributed the weak revenue performance to the following factors: (i) customs revenue-the worst hit-was depressed by the fall in oil prices, lower import growth, and the removal of the 10 percent import surcharge; (ii) excise tax cuts; (iii) the major restructuring of the income tax department during the last fiscal year, which may have temporarily affected tax administration and collection; and (iv) the fact that growth occurred in the relatively lightly taxed agriculture and services sectors and that the industrial sector remained weak. On the expenditure side, the authorities highlighted the decision to pump prime by stepping up selected infrastructure spending in response to continued weakness in demand, as well as their successful efforts in ensuring that there were no overruns in total expenditures. 16. The budget for 2002/03 aimed to reduce the central government deficit to 5% percent of GDP. On the revenue side, key initiatives (Annex III) included an increase in the income tax surcharge from 2 percent to 5 percent, a rationalization of excise duties, and an extension of the service tax. On the expenditure side, the main initiatives were a modest cut in fertilizer subsidies and reductions in surplus manpower including through continuing limits on new recruitment of central government staff.

India, Argentina, Brazil and Turkey: Comparison of Key Fiscal Indicators In assessing India’s fiscal situation, it is instructive to compare key fiscal indicators with those of other major emerging market countries that have recently experienced financial crises. India has persistently run primary deficits, unlike Argentina, Brazil and Turkey, which have over the last decade, generally maintained primary surpluses both at the central government and overall public sector level, India has run public sector primary deficits averaging nearly 4 percent of GDP. General government tax revenue relative to GDP in India is relatively low. The average ratio for 1995-99 has been 14% percent, compared to around 20 percent in Argentina, and 30 percent in Brazil. The ratio of the stock of public sector debt to GDP is higher in India than in Argentina or Brazil, Total public sector debt relative to GDP in India is much greater than in Argentina and Brazil, while the ratio for Turkey recently shot up (during the crisis) to around that of India. The difference in public sector debt stocks may in part be due to the fact that privatization of the large utilities and other large state enterprises has not yet been undertaken in India. The essential ingredients for explosive debt dynamics are present in India-large primary deficits, slowing growth, and a growing debt stock (see Box 1). On the positive side, India’s external debt is relatively low, particularly compared with Argentina and recently, Turkey. Also, there is scope to increase government revenue (relative to GDP) towards the Argentina-Brazil-Turkey level (particularly as services come under the tax net); and for reducing public sector debt using revenues from privatization. 10 Public Sector Overall Balance 10 - Public Sector Primary Balance (percent of GDP) 30 - Brad IndIal/ 20 - 10 - 5 - 0 _ 0 1991 1998 1999 2000 2001 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Source: WE0 database and IMF country desk data (2001 data are provisional or staff estimates) l/ India data are m fiscal years ending March (e.g. 1999 relates to April 1999-March 2000) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- on budget of all oil taxes and duties as well as kerosene and LPG subsidies in the context of the dismantling of the Administered Price Mechanism (APM) for oil products. 17. The authorities stated that the 2002/03 budget was aimed at balancing the need to support a recovery in activity and to begin the process of fiscal consolidation. The authorities agreed that it would have been desirable to aim for a smaller deficit to make a stronger start on the necessary process of fiscal consolidation. However, they felt that the targeted deficit reduction was the most that could realistically be achieved in the present political and economic circumstances, Also, historically low inflation and interest rates, and the comfortable foreign exchange position serve to reduce their degree of unease with the size of the fiscal deficit. 18. The team cautioned that even the limited deficit reduction target for 2002/03 is at risk. In particular, factors that contributed to the revenue shortfall last year are likely to be repeated. The 2002/03 revenue estimates appear too optimistic because: (i) the authorities’ GDP growth forecasts are higher than staff and consensus forecasts; (ii) the elasticities used to forecast revenues are higher than historical trends;” and (iii) the base for the budget’s revenue projections-namely, the 2001/02 outcome-is likely to be overestimated. Adjusting for these factors and the impact of more recent policy decisions, l1 the staff estimated a net revenue shortfall in 2002/03 of the order of l/2 percent of GDP and an overall deficit of close to 6 percent of GDP (authorities’ definition).12 Assuming a modest decline in the states’ fiscal deficit by % percent of GDP to 4% percent of GDP, the general government deficit will again be over 10 percent of GDP. The authorities were more confident than staff about achieving their fiscal targets for 2002/03. They noted that the demand effects of last year’s tax cuts should have a positive impact on this year’s revenues, and income tax administration will be lo The elasticities are calculated abstracting from the impact of new measures and using as scale variables both GDP as well as other variables that more closely approximate the tax base of each of the four largest tax categories-corporate tax, income tax, excise duties, and customs duties. l1 Some proposals were modified in Parliament prior to the adoption of the budget. These include a partial reversal of the increase in LPG prices, a partial restoration of the tax rebates on savings instruments that had been removed, the removal of some newly introduced excise duties, and a partial reversal of deductibility at source of dividend income taxes. In addition, the government increased customs duty on dairy products from 30 percent to 40 percent, increased wheat procurement prices modestly, and introduced tax holidays for firms in Special Economic Zones (SEZs). l2 The recent escalation in cross-border hostilities is likely to complicate efforts to reduce the deficit, because of the potential for overruns on military spending.

The team strongly recommended that additional measures be taken to ensure that this year’s budget targets are overachieved. Given India’s relatively low tax-GDP ratio, the efforts should focus on raising revenues through base broadening measures such as rationalization of exemptions, widening the income tax net to cover Selected Countries: General Government Revenue agriculture and more services, and (In percent of GDP) expanding the service tax base. Tax administration could be improved through the establishment of a large taxpayer unit (LTU), which has proven effective in raising revenues in other countries. l4 In this context, the team noted that the Fund stands ready to provide any technical assistance requested by the government. On the spending side, the focus should be on reducing the size of the civil service, and food, fertilizer, and fuel subsidies-the Argentina (1995-W) Rra7il (1997) China (2001) India (1997.2002) Malaysia (1995-97) Romania Russia (1995.99) South Africa (1995.98) Thailand (1995-98) Umveighted average Sources: World Economic Outlook; and Gowxnmcnt 1;inancc Statntics. recent increase in minimum support prices goes against the objective of deficit reduction and risks further increasing the already large foodgrain stocks.‘5 20. The authorities stressed that they were not complacent about the fiscal situation In particular, additional efforts would continue in (i) improving tax compliance; (ii) increasing user charges; (iii) compressing low priority expenditures; and (iv) accelerating disinvestment, On subsidies, the authorities pointed out that LPG prices have been raised, albeit not by as l3 The one-by-six scheme is used to identify potential taxpayers by requiring those satisfying one of six criteria (owning a telephone or a mobile phone, using a credit card, being a member of a private club, owning property exceeding a certain size, owning or leasing a motor vehicle, and having traveled abroad) to file a tax return. The criterion of owning a landline telephone was eliminated as part of the modifications prior to the passage of the 2002/03 budget. l4 IMF Occasional Paper Improving Large Taxpayers ’ Compliance-A Review of Country Experience (May 2002) reviews the experience of about 40 countries and finds that the most effective LTUs are based on strong, centralized supervision of operations. l5 As of January 2002, the stocks of wheat and rice stood at 58 million tons, compared to the minimum buffer stock norm of 16.8 million tons, For the year 2001/02, the food subsidy is estimated at Rs. 17.6 billion, or % percent of GDP.

On food subsidies, the authorities stressed that there is acute political awareness on the need for reform in this area not only for fiscal reasons but also to encourage diversification and boost productivity in the agricultural sector. Pending the report of a high-level committee on foodgrain policy, efforts are being made to reduce food stocks through increased allocations for families below the poverty line, larger open market sales, and enhanced incentives for foodgrain exports. 21. In light of the slippage from the adjustment path outlined last year, the team urged that the government clarify its intentions on medium-term liscal consolidation. While acknowledging that the exact path of fiscal consolidation must take social and political considerations into account, the team suggested that the legislation and guidelines be as close as possible to the original FRBM bill. The team stressed that the strategy should be transparent, yield a sustainable outcome, and be accompanied by a credible set of measures and consistent implementation. Greater conservatism in revenue forecasts in preparing annual budgets would help bolster the government’s credibility. The team outlined two illustrative consolidation paths both aimed at achieving a reduction in the stock of debt in line with the objectives outlined in the draft FRBM bill. The first would require a reduction in the general government primary deficit by about 1% percent of GDP per annum for the first five years and the second-which would lead to an immediate stabilization of the debt stock-would involve a reduction in the primary deficit of about 2% percent of GDP in the first year, followed by smaller reductions subsequently (Box 4). Either scenario would require strong and consistent fiscal consolidation efforts at both the central and state levels. 8 Central Government Fiscal Deficits (Percent of GDP; authortties’ detinition) II 5 22. A Parliamentary committee has considered the draft FRBM bill and, in light of its recommendations, the authorities are considering including the quantitative targets in accompanying implementing guidelines rather than in the law itself They felt that this could prove a better option as it would allow the quantitative targets to be amended, if necessary, without Parliamentary approval. Pending passage of the FRBM bill, the authorities felt that it Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Box 4. India-Debt Dynamics and Fiscal Consolidation The conditions for debt sustainability have continued to worsen. During last year’s consultation, debt sustainability simulations indicated that continuation of large primary deficits implied explosive debt dynamics (SM/O 1 /I 56). Since then, the conditions for debt sustainability have worsened: (i) large primary deficits have continued; (ii) the debt stock (excluding contingent liabilities) has continued to rise; and (iii) the gap between growth and long-term interest rates has narrowed markedly in recent years. Generaland Central Government Primary Deficilr Ii (Percent of GDP) L Consolidation is clearly required, but by how much? There are no hard and fast rules, but two scenarios are discussed here, both based on achieving the draft fiscal responsibility bill’s target for central government debt of 50 percent of GDP or less by 20 11.” The size of the adjustment required depends on the assumed nominal GDP growth rate and the nominal interest rates on government debt-both scenarios are based on averages for the last 5 years (respectively 10.9 percent and 8.7 percent), and on general government debt in the base year of around 80 percent of GDP. Thefirst scenario assumes an even pace of adjustment. The general government primary deficit would need to be reduced by about 1% percent a year for around 5 years, although this path would still imply an initial increase in the debt stock for the first two years. Keduction in Primary Structural Balance of General Government Needed to Stabilize the General Government Debt Ratio by 2002/03 The second scenario assumes immediate stabilization of the debt ratio. The rationale for this path is suggested by the experience of countries that have undertaken successful consolidations. Immediate Steady state 8.3 Nominal interest 8.7 On Govt debt 9.0 Steady State Nominal GDP Growth 1.5 10.9 14.3 4.6 2.1 -0.2 4.9 2.4 0.1 5.1 2.1 0.3 stabilization of debt tends to bolster confidence and can actually give rise to sizable early gains in output, That is, large fiscal adjustments generate positive effects on expectations that can partly or wholly offset the negative Keynesian effect2’ Again using the base assumptions, debt stabilization implies an initial reduction in the primary deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP, after which a more gradual adjustment path can be pursued to achieve the debt ratio target. Simulations were also undertaken using the base assumptions on GDP growth and interest rates plus or minus 1% standard deviations (see table). I’ General government includes central government, states and the OCC. The authorities’ definition of fiscal balances (i.e., with privatization above-the-line as revenue) is used. Assuming the ratio of central to general government debt remains at around 0.8, then the implied target in terms of general government debt to GDP is 60 percent. ” See Giavazzi and Pagan0 (1990), Alessina and Perotti (1995) and McDermott and Wescott (1996).

The team welcomed the efforts being made to strengthen the states’ finances-a critical element of the fiscal adjustment strategy. The authorities’ strategy of greater conditioning of central funding on reforms and the efforts to harden states’ budget constraints are beginning to yield results. l6 Power sector reforms-where the situation of heavy losses and highly unreliable power supply has become critical in some states-will continue to be the focus, with the emphasis on narrowing the gap between cost and revenue through transmission and distribution reforms, l7 Reform-linked transfers will be expanded in 2002/03 to other areas including irrigation and rural infrastructure. Beginning in 2002/03, the proportion of the proceeds of small savings deposit schemes that are allocated to the states was increased from 80 percent to 100 percent. This additional financing is being provided to the states to enable them to prepay existing high cost loans from the center. At the same time, efforts are being made to impose greater discipline on states’ finances: some states are limiting the issuance of guarantees and making preparations to pass their own fiscal responsibility legislation. With the states contributing close to half the general government deficit, a transparent commitment to fiscal consolidation by the states is critical to the medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy. 24. Preparations for the introduction of a state-level VAT are at an advanced stage in most states, but implementation was postponed for one year to April 1,2003. The authorities viewed the VAT to be a watershed reform of the tax regime, especially in terms of imparting much-needed buoyancy to revenues. Agreement has been reached amongst the states on the rate structure. l8 Outstanding issues include the timetable for the elimination of the central sales tax levied on interstate trade, arrangements for the center to make up states’ revenue shortfalls from the introduction of the VAT, and jurisdictional issues related to the 16Beginning in 2001/02, states were required to achieve a minimum improvement of 5 percentage points in the revenue deficit as a proportion of revenue receipts during the previous fiscal year to access funds from the States Fiscal Reform Facility (SFRF). Twelve states (out of 28) have signed MOUs with the central government, and ten of these states have met the conditions to draw funds under the SFRF based on their performance in 2000/O 1, 17Combined power sector financial losses are estimated at Rs. 260 billion (or about 1 percent of GDP) per year. “The structure is likely to be as follows: zero for essential goods such as food, 1 percent for gold and jewelry, 4 percent for industrial inputs and raw materials, and a penal rate for demerit goods (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, etc.) with a floor of 20 percent. All other goods would be subject to a revenue neutral rate likely to range between 10 percent and 12% percent, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-2l- taxation of services. The team suggested that the breathing space gained from the postponement should be used to continue to press ahead with careful preparations so that the tax can be introduced as planned on April 1, 2003. In this context, the authorities agreed that it was sensible to implement a phased reduction in the central sales tax as recommended by expert groups, and, over time, to transfer to the states the authority to collect and retain some service taxes as part of a rational goods and service tax structure. B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy 25. The RBI has conducted monetary policy prudently in a difficult economic and policy environment. RI31 officials agreed that the task of conducting monetary policy is complicated by the persistently large fiscal deficits. A reduction in the fiscal deficit would impart much greater flexibility to interest rates and have a salutary effect on inflation expectations. RBI officials noted that, in 2001/02, the increase in the financing needs of both the center and the state did not put pressure on interest rates largely because of depressed private sector credit demand and ample liquidity. However, they expressed concern that banks’ large holdings of government securities may expose banks to risks from an increase in interest rates. Accordingly, the RI31 has introduced new rules that require banks to establish an Investment Fluctuation Reserve account to build a cushion against the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the value of banks’ holdings of government securities. 26. Looking ahead, the authorities agreed that the current supportive stance should be maintained until recovery in growth is assured. They noted that there is ample liquidity in the system to satisfy any revival in private sector credit demand and the recent 50 basis point cut in administered rates provides scope for banks to lower their lending rates. The staff concurred that there was little need to ease monetary conditions further, pointing out also that the global easing cycle has ended and that monetary policy in some countries has shifted to a tightening bias. In late April-subsequent to the mission-the RI31 released its monetary and credit policy statement for 2002/03 and outlined a monetary policy stance along these lines. The RBI kept the bank rate on hold but indicated that the situation will be kept under close review to ensure adequate liquidity to support credit growth while remaining vigilant about inflation. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) was cut further by a l/2 percentage point to 5 percent effective June 1, 2002. The RI31 also announced some measures to foster greater flexibility in commercial bank interest rates, including encouraging the introduction of new flexible interest rate deposit schemes, and requiring greater transparency in banks’ deposit, and maximum and minimum lending rates, 27. Management of the exchange rate and reserves during the past year has been broadly appropriate. The RBI took advantage of the balance of payments inflows to accumulate reserves while partially sterilizing the impact on domestic liquidity to contain inflation and maintain a relatively constant real effective exchange rate. The team noted that the strategy of building up reserves is sensible, especially given the expected hump in outflows in 2003/04 and 2005/06 under the Resurgent India Bond and India Millennium Deposit schemes, respectively. Moreover, the exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 22 - fundamentals-the current account is near balance and within estimates of the equilibrium saving-investment balance. l9 28. The team took the view that the favorable external position provides a good opportunity to begin to allow greater exchange rate flexibility and accelerate trade liberalization. Greater exchange rate flexibility will be more suitable for India in light of the welcome steps taken so far to liberalize the trade and capital accounts.2” Indeed, the external position provides scope for more rapid trade liberalization, and, in this context, greater exchange rate flexibility would facilitate the accompanying exchange rate adjustment. The authorities agreed in principle but noted that the timing and modalities of introducing such increased flexibility are constrained by the limited development of the domestic foreign exchange market. The team responded that allowing greater flexibility would itself enable the development of a deeper foreign exchange market, including for hedging instruments. C. Financial Sector Policies 29. Since the FSSA was completed at end-2000, the process of strengthening the financial sector has continued. The RBI has also tightened loan classification and provisioning regulations, gradually bringing them closer to best international practice.21 Foreign entry to the banking system has been further liberalized through the lifting of limits on FDI and FII investment. Key actions to strengthen capital markets include the adoption of net asset value (NAV)-based pricing by the largest mutual fund-Unit Trust of India (UTI), the phasing out of assured return schemes, and restructuring of UT1 to make it fully compliant with Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations, The successful switch to rolling settlement in the stock market has removed an important source of systemic risk in the l9 See Chapter 3, Callen, Reynolds and Towe eds., “India at the Crossroads,” IMF 2001. 20 The government’s general strategy on capital account liberalization has been to avoid a build-up of short-term debt, while gradually opening up to FDI and portfolio flows. Key steps taken since 2001/02 have included raising the FDI limit in private sector banks from 40 percent to 49 percent, liberalization of portfolio investment in private banks, introducing full convertibility of NRI deposits, and liberalization of outward FDI (Annex III). 21 Specifically, banks will be required to classify a loan as substandard on a 90-day overdue basis (from the current 1 X0 days) effective March 3 1, 2004. Banks were required to start making the provisions necessary to meet this tighter norm from the year ending March 3 1, 2002. Banks will also be required to classify a loan as doubtful if it remains in the substandard category for 12 months (from the current 18 months) effective March 3 1, 2005. For the doubtful loans reclassified on March 3 1, 2005, banks will be given until March 3 1, 2008 to make the additional provisioning consistent with this norm. For new doubtful loans emerging after March 3 1, 2005, the provisioning requirement will have to be met immediately. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-23 - financial system. The government has also announced plans to demutualize all stock exchanges.22 30. Notwithstanding this progress, weaknesses remain in key areas identified in the FSSA. Profitability of public sector banks (PSBs) continues to be low-falling slightly to 0.4 percent of total assets in 2000/01 and their efficiency needs to be improved (Box 5 and Annex IV).23 The stock of nonperforming assets (NPAs) has continued to rise albeit at a lower rate than total bank lending. At end-March 2001, gross nonperforming loans for PSBs stood at 12% percent of outstanding loans, down from 14 percent the year before.24 In contrast, NPAs of domestic private and foreign banks stood at 8% percent and 63/ percent, respectively. For the system as a whole, the average capital adequacy ratio stood at 11% percent. However, a few banks and financial institutions, albeit not systemically important, have been in serious financial distress. The urban cooperative banking system has also experienced episodes of instability and its supervision is in urgent need of strengthening. In light of these developments, the discussions focused on four areas-strengthening the performance of the PSBs, further tightening prudential regulation, dealing effectively with weak banks so as to minimize the risk of systemic problems, and putting in place sound mechanisms to deal with accumulated NPAs already in the system. 31. The authorities agreed that strengthening PSBs-the dominant segment of the banking system-was a priority. While welcoming the government’s plan to reduce its shareholding in the PSBS,~~ the team noted that it would be critical to relinquish effective control to private shareholders.26 The team thus took the view that the strategy should be focused on divestment of PSBs to enable them to better respond to market forces and achieve efficiency gains. The authorities responded that it was important to maintain the “public sector character” of PSBs because they also need to provide social functions, but agreed that 22 An analysis of the impact of demutualization of stock exchanges on capital market integrity is contained in the forthcoming background papers. 23 An analysis of the performance of Indian banks since the early 1990s is contained in the forthcoming background paper. 24 Private sector analysts believe that NPAs of PSBs could be as high as 20-25 percent of total loans if more conservative classification standards are adopted. 25 A bill that allows a reduction in the minimum government shareholding in PSBs from 5 1 percent to 33 percent was submitted to the Parliament in 2000. 26 At the present time, the voting rights of a private shareholder in PSBs is restricted to 1 percent regardless of the size of shareholding. The draft bill to reduce the government’s ownership share does not propose to change this feature of the law.

Developments in the Indian Banking Sector Since Liberalization During the past decade, the commercial banking industry in India was liberalized. Deposit and lending rates were deregulated. Rcscrvc requirements (CRR and SLR) were reduced. Reforms in the ownership structure and competition policies promoted the entT of new banks into the industry. Empirical analysis of bank level data from 1991/92 to 2000/01 suggests the following: l Public banks continued to dominate the commercial banking sector. In 2000/01, 80 percent of the total assets of the banking system belonged to public (nationalized and state) banks. During the liberalization period, nationalized and state banks lost 6 percent and 3 percent of their market shares, respectively, while new and old private banks gained 6 pcrccnt and 2% percent, respcctivcly. 9 Private banks had lower intermediation costs than public banks during most of the period. Since their entry in the mid- 1990s new private banks have had lower intermediation costs than state and nationalized banks. The median cost of intermediation of old private banks decreased significantly over the period and were lower than that of public banks. 9 Operational costs and priority sector lending play an important role in explaining the bank-level variation in intermediation costs. Banks with higher administrative costs have significantly higher interes margins. Higher levels of priority sector lending are associated with higher bank intermediation costs.

Their strategy consisted of two main elements-easing entry for private and foreign banks to increase competition; and making PSBs more accountable to market forces by requiring them to resort to the market for any future capital needs. The team noted that private investors may not be willing to take a stake in PSBs so long as the government retains a controlling share. The team also suggested that it may prove difIicult over time to reconcile “commercial orientation” with the performance of social functions. As an alternative, the strategy to ensure access to credit in rural areas could focus on strengthening the rural credit cooperatives, and other channels of micro-finance, while ensuring that all subsidies associated with these institutions are transparent and on budget. This would allow the rest of the banks to evolve into a modern, dynamic system necessary for efficient financial intermediation, 32. While welcoming the steps to bring regulatory standards closer to international best practice, the team suggested that the authorities consider advancing the timetable for their introduction. The team noted that while there may be a need for some lead time for the effective introduction of tighter classification and provisioning norms, the timetable currently envisaged is excessively long. Together with the fact that even under the tighter norms, the level of provisioning is likely to be inadequate in light of the difficulty in enforcing creditor claims and foreclosing on collateral, banks are likely to remain in a weak position for a long time. The team suggested that the new stricter regulations be implemented to a more rapid timetable. For those banks that are likely to face a serious impact on their capital positions, a longer lead time could be allowed for capital positions to be rebuilt, while subjecting them to heightened supervisory surveillance. 33. RBI officials responded that their strategy is to align Indian standards with international best practice at a pace that is sufftcient to ensure steady strengthening, but one that would not shock the banking system. Specifically, the authorities noted that a number of initiatives are being implemented at the present time, including the amortization of the expenditure related to the Voluntary Retirement Schemes implemented last year which successfully led to a reduction in the staff of PSBs by 12 percent. Because these initiatives could have sizable negative implications for banks’ earnings, it was felt that some lead time for the implementation of the new loan classification norms would be necessary to protect banks’ income positions. The authorities also stressed that they are using moral suasion to urge banks to reach the target of 50 percent provisioning against NPAs as soon as possible. 34. The team urged the authorities to resolve failing or “weak” banks and financial institutions in a prompt and decisive manner. In particular, the team noted that in some recent instances, ad hoc assistance for public sector banks and financial institutions facing difficulties has been orchestrated through credit rollovers and capital injections from other public sector banks and financial institutions, with little conditionality on strengthening Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - operations and business plans2’ Some institutions remain in distress even after receiving assistance. This leads to concerns about moral hazard, cross-contamination of risks in the financial sector, a repeated need for recapitalization, and a potential weakening of the public sector public sector banks and financial institutions as a whole. RBI officials emphasized that they had a policy of not using moral suasion to coerce public sector public sector banks and financial institutions to provide such support. In this context, the team stressed the importance of the early adoption of the proposed Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, and the imposition of strict limits for management changes and for implementation of capital restoration plans for PSBs. 35. To resolve the large stock of NPAs in the banking system, the authorities are planning to develop a market for impaired assets. A pilot asset reconstruction company (ARC) is expected to be set up by end-June 2002 with the participation of private banks, PSBs and other public sector banks and financial institutions. This ARC is to take over a small part of the NPAs in the banking sector and develop a market for securitized loans. The authorities recognize that, to be effective, the establishment of an ARC would need to be accompanied by laws to strengthen creditor rights and streamline bankruptcy procedures.28 They also agreed that the ARC should have operational independence and commercial orientation so that transfer and sale prices are market-determined. The authorities envisage that the establishment of the pilot ARC would proceed in parallel with the legislative process to provide the appropriate legal environment. In this regard, the government has drafted a Banking Sector Reforms Bill to strengthen foreclosure laws and creditor rights, D. Structural Reforms 36. The authorities reiterated their commitment to carrying forward structural reforms. A comprehensive roadmap for the “second-generation” reforms was laid out in last year’s budget. The authorities stressed that they intend to continue to push ahead with this agenda, but noted that it takes time to accomplish changes in a democratic system. The process was started in a number of areas, including through the preparation of a wide range of economic legislation. While expressing understanding for the political constraints, the team emphasized that it was important to achieve results sooner rather than later, as growing fiscal imbalances and structural weaknesses will make the eventual adjustment more costly and socially disruptive, and also risk marginalizing India in the global system. 27 Assistance provided through the budget or through public sector banks and financial institutions in 2001 and 2002 amounted to roughly about l/2 percent of GDP. At the present time, the team estimates that potential additional demands on public funds could amount to 4-5 percent of GDP. 28 An analysis of experiences with ARCS and lessons for India is contained in the forthcoming background paper.

Specifically, bold steps and a pragmatic approach have been taken to accelerate disinvestment, In particular, the team commended the authorities for the open and transparent procedures that have been adopted, and the pragmatic and conciliatory approach taken to ensure “buy in” from labor unions, The team encouraged the authorities to maintain the momentum that has been built up through these efforts, Another key achievement was the dismantling of the APM for petroleum products, together with bringing the remaining subsidies on budget and announcing a timetable for the elimination of these subsidies. A start was made in reforms in agriculture and industry through the removal of some commodities from the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and further reducing the scope of small-scale sector reservation, In the area of infrastructure, progress has been achieved in the National Highway Development program. 38. Nevertheless, a sizable unfinished agenda remains to be tackled. l On petroleum pricing, the team endorsed the principle that pump prices should be adjusted to reflect movements in international prices. The sharp increase in global oil prices since the APM was dismantled presented an early test to the system. The team noted that while there could be a need for a mechanism to reduce the impact on pump prices when oil prices temporarily move out of a normal range (e.g., the OPEC’s notional target of $22-$28 a barrel), the present weak fiscal situation limits the scope to lower taxes, Steps that weaken the finances of the oil companies are also not desirable, particularly, in light of their planned privatization, More generally, the government needs to announce a strategy for dealing with volatility in international oil prices. In early June, the government announced an increase in petrol and diesel prices of around 9 percent, while reducing excise taxes on these products, The government has also announced that oil companies will be compensated for lost revenues in the first two months of the new regime. Henceforth, oil companies would be allowed to revise retail prices of petroleum products every 2 weeks, if necessary, while the government would review trends in global crude prices on a quarterly basis with a view to making changes to the taxation structure in the event of significant swings in prices. l On trade liberalization, the team welcomed the reduction in statutory peak tariffs and the announcement of a move to a two-tier rate structure in the medium term. However, the team noted that the budget also calls for an increase in tariffs on a number of goods. Together with the remaining nontariff and administrative barriers on imports and exports, the trade regime may be effectively more restrictive than suggested by the basic tariff rate and contributes to an anti-export bias.29 The authorities responded that they were 29 India’s trade regime gets a rating of 8 on the IMP’s trade restrictiveness index scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most restrictive.

As for the items on which quantitative restrictions were eliminated in April 2001, the authorities stated that the only new conditions are that these goods are now being subject to safety and quality standards, some of which also apply to Indian manufacturers. l The authorities recently announced EXIM policy aims to further open up the economy, including by establishing Special Economic Zones (SEZs) so as to provide world-class facilities for export-oriented manufacturing and to attract FDI. Offshore banking units will be established in the SEZs. These units would be exempt from reserve and liquidity requirements, and could provide credit to SEZ units and developers at internationally competitive interest rates. The team noted that experience with SEZs in other countries has shown that they could be helpful in attracting FDI and promoting exports, if enterprises in SEZs develop close links with domestic enterprises to maximize productivity spillovers. A key lesson is the need to avoid complex and biased tax incentive systems that could lead to substantial revenue losses. The authorities agreed on the need to put in place strong prudential measures to prevent offshore banking units from becoming conduits of short-term capital that could increase the vulnerability of the domestic financial sector. l The authorities fully recognize the critical need to put in place structural reforms to improve productivity and investment in the industrial and agricultural sectors. To reap the full benefits of trade liberalization, there is an urgent need to unshackle Indian industry to enable it to compete globally. The fact that the bulk of the growth of the last decade has been concentrated in the services sector-including the impressive growth in IT services-which faced the fewest rigidities and restrictions demonstrates the benefits of liberal environment. The team agreed that priority areas are actions to extend small scale dereservation, reform labor laws and bankruptcy procedures. In particular, the requirement of government approval for retrenchments and lay-offs has impeded the flexibility to adjust the labor force, may have resulted in a substitution of capital for labor, and adversely affected employment growth. In this context, important pending economic legislation needs to be passed, especially the repeal of the Sick Industrial Companies Act and the associated Board of Industrial and Financial Restructuring, the Bill on Banking Sector Reforms and the reform of the Industrial Disputes Act and the Contract Labor Act. l As for agriculture, the team welcomed the steps to liberalize restrictions on the storage, movements and export of some agricultural products. Efforts are underway to bring about a “third revolution” in agriculture, involving comprehensive reforms of the Public Distribution System and Minimum Support Prices for foodgrain. The authorities are also reviewing their food security strategy in light of the high costs of maintaining large food stocks. In this context, the authorities emphasized the negative impact on India from industrial country agricultural subsidies and other market access restrictions, Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - V. STAFF APPRAISAL 39. The growth momentum achieved in the wake of the ambitious reform program of the early 1990s demonstrates the great potential of the Indian economy. There has been considerable improvement in poverty and other social indicators. External vulnerability has been substantially reduced and the process of strengthening the financial sector is underway. 40. The slowdown in trend growth over the past several years, however, highlights the policy challenges ahead. To be sure, India’s growth rate in recent years compares favorably with most other developing countries. Nevertheless, it falls short of the 8 percent target necessary to achieve the government’s appropriately ambitious poverty reduction objectives, especially given that some 400 million people (or 40 percent of the population) still live on less than $1 a day. Although cyclical and exogenous factors contributed, the slowdown reflects the effects of high fiscal deficits and remaining structural distortions. 41. India’s medium-term economic prospects depend critically on more rapid progress with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Without more rapid progress with fiscal adjustment and stepped up structural reforms, priority social, infrastructure, and operations and maintenance spending would continue to be crowded out, with deleterious effects on private investment. Moreover, in the event of adverse shocks, the weak fiscal situation and high government debt imply little room for maneuver in macroeconomic policies and could entrench the cycle of decelerating growth, and deteriorating fiscal balances. These conditions hold risks for the health of the financial sector through the erosion of the credibility of government support which underpins public confidence in the system. For now, external vulnerability is limited. Nonetheless, the risk that prolonged domestic weakness could spill over into balance of payments difficulties cannot be ruled out. 42. As the government well recognizes, India’s fiscal situation is unsustainable. The general government deficit is likely to continue to be over 10 percent of GDP making it among the highest in the world. General government debt (excluding contingent liabilities) stands at over 80 percent of GDP. Large primary deficits, the stagnation in government revenue, the compression of priority spending on social and economic infrastructure, and the sharp narrowing of the growth rate-interest rate differential signal a deterioration in the conditions for debt sustainability. Moreover, current budgetary policies and the large debt overhang undermine the center’s ability to play a leadership role in driving the states’ reforms process, and progressively shifts the burden of adjustment to future generations. 43. Stronger efforts are therefore needed to put the public finances firmly on a consolidation path. Given India’s very low tax-to-GDP ratio by international standards- despite the positive steps taken on excise taxes and tax administration-the adjustment strategy should focus on raising revenues, especially through broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration, The authorities could consider the establishment of a large taxpayer unit, which has proven beneficial in improving compliance and raising revenues in Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3o- other countries. On the spending side, the priority is to reduce subsidies and the wage bill, and for the latter, further progress on downsizing civil service is necessary. The recent rollback of some measures announced in the budget and the increase in wheat procurement prices impede deficit reduction. Measures need to be taken now to avoid another year of fiscal slippage and to begin the process of fiscal consolidation. 44. In light of the slippage from the adjustment path outlined last year, the government needs to clarify its intentions on medium-term fiscal consolidation. While social and political considerations will undoubtedly play a role, the consolidation plan must produce visible and sustained progress, based on a credible set of measures that is implemented consistently. At the general government level, the adjustment needed to reduce the stock of debt to a level consistent with the objectives specified in the original draft FRBM requires a reduction in the primary deficit by about 11/3 percent of GDP per annum for the next five years. Strong adjustment efforts are therefore needed both at the central and state government levels. 45. The efforts being made to strengthen the states’ finances are welcome. The high priority being given to power sector reforms is also welcome. The introduction of a state-level VAT could be a watershed reform of the tax regime, and the breathing space gained from the postponement of its introduction should be used to continue to press ahead with careful preparations so that the tax can be introduced as planned on April 1, 2003. In this context, a phased reduction in the central sales tax, and transferring to the states the authority to collect and retain some service taxes would be sensible for a rational goods and service tax structure. 46. The RBI is to be commended for its prudent conduct of monetary policy in a diffkult economic and policy environment. In light of the modest recovery in growth and the ample liquidity available to support a revival in credit demand, there is little need to ease monetary conditions further. At the same time, in light of the subdued inflation and uncertainty about the strength of the recovery, there is a good case for maintaining the current easy monetary policy environment until there are clear signs of a pick-up in growth. The strategy on exchange rate management and sterilized intervention-whereby the RBI has taken advantage of the balance of payments inflows to accumulate reserves while paying due attention to the real effective exchange rate-has been broadly appropriate especially given the expected hump in maturing bonds and bank deposits in the next 3-4 years. 47. For the medium term, the staff continues to view greater exchange rate flexibility to be more suitable for India given the trade and capital account liberalization and structural changes underway. The RI31 is encouraged to take advantage of the favorable external position to begin to allow for greater flexibility in the exchange rate. This would not only facilitate the exchange rate adjustment that would tend to accompany the welcome trade and capital liberalization, but would also enable the development of a deeper foreign exchange market, including for hedging instruments.

Making further efforts to strengthen the performance of the public sector banks and financial institutions is critical to ensuring medium-term financial stability while financing India’s developmental needs. Specifically, priority needs to be accorded to improving the performance of the PSBs through effective divestment of control in PSBs and the introduction of greater commercial orientation. Alternative approaches should be taken to ensure that rural and remote areas have access to financial services through rural credit cooperatives and other channels of micro-finance, while allowing commercial banks to develop into a modern and efficient system of financial intermediation. Consideration should also be given to bringing forward the introduction of the tighter loan classification rules from 2004 and 2005, and to strengthening provisioning regulations as a priority. Finally, a prompt corrective action framework, which imposes tight limits for management changes and for implementation of capital restoration plans for all banks, including PSBs, should be put in place without delay. 49. The proposal to establish a market for impaired assets is a step in the right direction. To be effective, the establishment of an asset reconstruction company (ARC) would need to be accompanied by laws to strengthen creditor rights and streamline bankruptcy procedures. Steps should also be taken to ensure that the ARC has operational independence and commercial orientation so that transfer and sale prices are market- determined. 50. There has been encouraging progress in some aspects of the structural reform agenda, but a large unfinished agenda remains and it is important to achieve sufficient momentum to sustain confidence and to return India to a more rapid growth path. In this context, the bold steps taken to accelerate the pace of disinvestment are particularly commendable, and it is critical-both for fiscal and structural reasons-not to lose the momentum that has been built up in the process. It is especially important to release the large amount of financial resources in public enterprises which could be used for priority social and physical infrastructure spending. Key remaining issues include: l The dismantling of the administered price mechanism for petroleum products was a major step. The recent decision to raise pump prices in the face of the increase in global oil prices is welcome as it avoids shifting losses from higher import prices onto oil companies, which are expected to be privatized before long. To underscore the break with the old administered system, it is important that the compensation paid to oil companies for losses in the period before prices were raised is recorded transparently on budget. More generally, it is also clear that the fiscal situation limits the scope to use reductions in oil and petroleum taxes to attenuate the impact on pump prices when oil prices temporarily move out of a normal range. l The steps taken to further liberalize the trade regime and increase the outward orientation of the Indian economy are welcome. However, with the high level of tariffs on a number of goods, and remaining nontariff and administrative barriers, the trade regime remains relatively restrictive. Further steps are needed to foster a more friendly Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 32 - environment for trade, including through reduction in costs associated with red tape and bureaucracy. The plans for private sector-led Special Economic Zones (SEZs) could be helpful in attracting FDI and promoting exports, particularly if close links are developed with the rest of the economy. Care is needed to avoid a complex and biased tax incentive system that also can lead to substantial revenue losses. Strong prudential measures need I be put in place to prevent offshore banking units from becoming conduits of short-term capital that could increase the vulnerability of the domestic financial sector. ;0 l There is an urgent need for reforms to unshackle Indian industry, pari passu with trade reforms, to enable it to compete effectively in a more liberal trade environment. Priority areas are the extension of small scale dereservation so as to enable Indian industries to realize their natural scale advantages, reforms of labor laws to facilitate greater labor mobility and generate larger employment opportunities, and reforms of bankruptcy laws procedures to enable critical industrial restructuring. l Building on the steps to liberalize the markets for agricultural products, it is essential now to reform the system of Minimum Support Prices and the Public Distribution System, both for budgetary reasons and to encourage the much-needed diversification within the agricultural sector. More generally, the authorities are encouraged to reexamine the size of foodstocks needed for food security in light of the costs associated with maintaining large foodstocks, the increasing access to imports, and the large stock of foreign exchange reserves. 51. With the recent participation in the Statistics ROSC, India has completed assessments under most key standards and codes. In light of the remaining weakness in data that undermine economic analysis and policy making, the authorities strongly are encouraged to give priority to improving the quality, and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics. In view of the rapid growth in the insurance sector since liberalization of entry in 2000, the authorities are encouraged to participate in an assessment of the observation of the IAIS core principles for the supervision of the insurance sector, possibly to coincide with the 2003 consultation. The priority given to formulating policies and laws to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities is welcome. The recent decision to forgive debt owed by HIPC countries is also commendable. 52. India maintains exchange restrictions which are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (Annex VI, Section VII). The authorities are encouraged to eliminate these restrictions as soon as possible. In the meantime, absent a time-frame for their removal, the staff does not recommend approval of these restrictions. 53. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with India take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Over the medium term, GDP growth is expect to increase gradually to around 6 percent, now estimated to be India’s potential growth rate (see below). l Inflation: WPI inflation decreased to an average of about 3% percent in 2001/02, reflecting weak demand and the waning effect of earlier increases in energy prices. Inflation is projected to increase to about 4 percent over the medium term as growth gradually picks up, with inflationary pressures remaining generally benign, provided oil prices do not stay high on a sustained basis. l Balance of payments: In 2001/02, the current account deficit is estimated to have fallen to ‘/4 percent of GDP, reflecting the decline in world oil prices, Over the medium term, the deficit is projected to increase gradually to 1 percent of GDP. The effect of trade liberalization and the recovery in domestic demand is expected to more than offset the effect of the rebound abroad, lower oil prices, and gains in market share in response to trade and structural reform. The upward trend in the current account deficit is expected to be interrupted in 2003/04 and 2005/06, under the assumption that nonresident Indians (NRIs) remit a portion of the redemptions of the Resurgent India Bond (RIB) and the India Millennium Deposit (IMD) scheme, respectively, as occurred with similar instruments in the past, Over the medium term, net private capital inflows are generally assumed to increase moderately, leaving the overall balance of payments in modest surplus, so that the gross reserve cover remains about 7 months of goods and services imports. l Fiscal deficit: The deficit of the consolidated public sector (comprising central and state governments and central public enterprises, as well as the oil pool account through 2001/02) is projected to remain about 11% percent of GDP in 2002/03. The combined deficit of the state governments is expected to decrease slightly, reflecting improved tax buoyancy as industrial sector growth accelerates, increased user charges, and efforts to contain expenditures. The consolidation by the state governments is offset by an increase in the central government deficit, mainly reflecting decreasing budgeted nontax revenues. Beyond 2002/03, the public sector deficit is assumed to decline by about ‘13 percent of GDP per year, with most of the consolidation occurring at the central government level.

Short-term debt is projected to remain about 2-2’/4 percent of GDP and the debt-service ratio to fall under 12 percent in the medium term, except during the years around the repayment of the RIB (estimated to be about $5.2 billion) and the IMD ($6.9 billion) in 2003/04 and 2005/06, respectively. l Key downside risks: p Considerable uncertainty attaches to estimates of potential output growth, especially in view of the marked slowdown in trend growth and investment demand in recent years. Although some estimates place potential growth at above 6 percent, these largely reflect the effect of strong growth in the mid-1990s which has not been sustained in recent years. The staffs revised estimate of potential growth is based on production function and filtering techniques. The estimate assumes an increase in both total factor productivity growth and investment demand in comparison to recent trends, under the premise of limited fiscal consolidation and a modest pickup in the pace of structural reform. 9 The economy remains vulnerable to weather conditions, with a long-run correlation of about 70 percent between agriculture output growth and rainfall. Although agricultural output accounts for only a quarter of GDP, the impact of agricultural activity is magnified through its effect on rural incomes and consumption, as more than 70 percent of the population is rural. 9 The fragile fiscal situation could lead to increased upward pressure on interest rates and/or sharp cuts in capital expenditures and infrastructure investments, as have occurred in the past, Moreover, given the large stock of government paper held by the banking sector, banks could be exposed to a sharp backup in interest rates, further weakening the sector. 9 If oil prices remain high or increase further, pressures on the balance of payments, the exchange rate, inflation, the fiscal position, and manufacturing profitability could be substantial, Staff estimates suggest that if oil prices were $5 per barrel higher than the IMF baseline forecast ($23 in 2001) GDP growth would be % percentage point lower than the baseline forecast, while inflation and the current account deficit would be, respectively, 1% percentage points and ‘/2 percent of GDP higher. With the recent dismantling of the Administered Price Mechanism for petroleum products, the pass- through from increases in world oil prices could change. Notably, the weight of energy prices (fuel, power light, and lubricants) in the WPI is 14.2 percent and of the mineral oils subcomponent is 7.0 percent. > Other external trade-related risks are considered by most analysts to be relatively modest, given that India is a relatively closed economy. On the trade side, goods and Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 50- ANNEX I services exports are only about 13 percent of GDP, and exports to the United States and IT-related exports are only around 18 percent and 10 percent of total exports, respectively. P Net private capital inflows remained strong during 2001/02, despite downgrades by ratings agencies and the shift of the MSCI index to a free float, which reduced India’s weight, Moreover, India’s experience during the Asia crisis and the 2000 turnaround in global market sentiment have illustrated India’s resilience to such shocks, especially given the relatively low level of these inflows and sizable reserves. Nonetheless, domestic weakness, particularly in the fiscal and financial sectors, could eventually lead to a loss of confidence, and capital outflows and balance of payments difficulties cannot be ruled out.

Vulnerability in India remains chiefly of a domestic nature, stemming from a large public sector deficit and a growing public indebtedness. External risks are moderated by the relatively closed nature of the economy and some favorable factors. External debt stands at 22 percent of GDP, and the current account deficit is modest. International reserves are at more than US$55 billion and exceed eight months of goods and services imports and cover five times short-term external debt. Outward capital flows by residents are restricted and, while the exchange rate is heavily managed, the authorities have shown a willingness to adjust it if necessary so that there do not appear to have been prolonged periods of misalignment (Table III. 1). 2. In the staff’s baseline scenario, India’s external outlook remains favorable and the financing requirements are expected to be comfortably filled by a combination of roll- over of short-term debt and new market financing. Over the medium term, external debt indicators are projected to improve further with the debt-to-GDP ratio decreasing gradually and the debt-service ratio falling under 14 percent, except in 2003/04 and 2005/06 when repayment of the Resurgent India Bond and the India Millennium Deposit (IMD) scheme, respectively, are due. Short-term debt is projected to remain about 2 percent of GDP. According to various early warning system (EWS) models, crisis risks in India remain low and below those projected in most other emerging economies. 3. Even with a weaker external environment-only a modest global recovery and fragile capital market sentiment-an external financing crisis remains unlikely, at least in the short run. On the trade side, India remains a relatively closed economy with goods and services exports representing only about 13 percent of GDP. Furthermore, India’s IT service export sector is highly cost competitive. On the capital side, there are no major sources of immediate vulnerabilities given the low level of net private inflows and the size of international reserves. Accordingly, the additional balance of payments financing requirements that would arise from such a scenario could be easily accommodated by a drawdown of reserves. 4. However, with a sharp increase in oil prices or with a severe loss of confidence in the domestic economy India’s external vulnerability indicators could deteriorate sharply. In the worst case, this could entail (i) a drying up of the inflows of remittances and transfers from non-resident Indians (NRI), (ii) a sharp decline in (net) portfolio investment inflows; (iii) a drawing down by NRIs of their repatriable deposits in the banking system; (iv) the cessation of roll-overs of other short-term debt; and (v) leads and lags in import payments/export receipts resulting from heightened expectations of exchange rate depreciation. In such circumstances, capital outflows could total US$40 billion, or 75-80 percent of current reserves.

The health of the banking system in India has improved considerably since reform of the financial sector began in the early 1990s. With strengthened prudential regulation and supervision, increased competition, and government recapitalization, most banks, including the systemically important ones, now satisfy the regulatory capital adequacy requirements. At end-March 2001, average capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 11% percent, gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) were 11% percent of gross credit, and net NPAs (net of provisions) accounted for around 6% percent of net credit. (Table IV. 1). 2. However, several factors suggest that the strength of the banking system may be weaker than broad indicators would suggest. l Under-recognition of impaired assets. Banks classify loans as substandard only once they have been in arrears for more than six months and as doubtful once they have been in arrears for eighteen months.’ Private sector analysts believe that NPA levels for public sector banks are significantly higher at 20 to 25 percent of total loans rather than the reported 12lYz percent if more conservative classification standards are adopted and ever- greened loans are identified as impaired assets. l Under-provisioning for losses. At less than 50 percent of gross NPAs, the current level of provisioning by public sector banks is not likely to be adequate, even though it is in line with RBI regulations. Given that enforcement of creditor claims is extremely difficult under the current legal system, such an average level of provision coverage may not adequately reflect the true likelihood of recovery. Indeed, foreign banks on average provision at a rate of about 75 percent.2 If public sector banks would provision at the same average rate as the foreign banks, their average CAR would decline by about 3 percentage points to 8% percent. l High gearing of capital. Tier 1 capital in the public sector banks is only 3.4 percent of total (non risk-weighted) assets, so that capital cushion against interest rate risks, ’ The regulation was recently changed and banks will be required to classify loans overdue 90 days as sub-standard, effective from March 2004, and loans that have been in the substandard category for twelve months as doubtful, effective from March 2005. 2 This probably understates foreign banks’ practices. Foreign banks write off NPAs more aggressively. Had they kept these assets on the books as domestic banks do, the rate of cumulative provision relative to gross NPAs would be higher. An alternative method for examining this issue is to consider the present value of nonperforming assets, taking into account the fact that court judgments against defaulters take ten years or more. If only 50 percent of the face value of the NPAs is recovered in 10 years, and assuming a discount rate of 10 percent, the loss would be 80 percent on a present value basis. Provisioning at an equivalent rate would cause the capital adequacy ratio of public sector banks to decline from 11% percent to 7% percent. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 59 - ANNEX IV operational risk, and other non-measured risks is small. There are important concerns over interest rate exposure that results from large holdings of long-dated government securities. With a weighted average duration of 5.4 years, a one percentage point upward shift in the yield curve would result in a reduction in the market value of banks’ government securities portfolio by the equivalent of close to 20 percent of total capital,3 although the actual impact on capital could be smaller given that a cushion has been built up as a result of the substantial reduction in interest rates in the past several years. l Low profitability. While the public sector banks in India have been very successful in mobilizing deposits and have maintained ample liquidity in their operations, they have had low profitability, with the return on assets well below 1 percent, due largely to their low operating efficiency, overstaffing, the remaining elements of interest rate controls such as the administered rates on small savings, and high rates of loan loss provisions, notwithstanding the possible under-provisioning as explained above. l Divergence of performance. While the financial performances of the large banks have been stable, there are pockets of weaknesses in both public and private sector banks. As of March 200 1, five banks were operating below the minimum CAR of 9 percent, three of which were insolvent. The RBI’s overall (CAMELS) rating of banks in 2001 also points to some the underlying weaknesses, with 24 banks, representing 26 percent of the banking sector assets, rated “C” or below, including 8 banks which hold close to 6 percent of total assets that have serious financial, operational and managerial weaknesses. 3. The current low level of profitability of the public sector banks raises concerns about whether these banks can generate sufficient capital to support adequate asset growth, while satisfying capital adequacy rules. Assuming that the net profits remain at the average of last three years (less than 0.5 percent of assets), and with no dividend payout, the maximum sustainable rate of asset growth would be only 10% percent. The issue then arises as to whether a rate of asset growth of around 10 percent will be adequate to support a rate of real economic growth that is higher than the current trend of 5 to 6 percent a year. 4. Further, in the absence of reforms to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the public sector banks, growing competition from new private banks, foreign banks, the more efficient NBFCs, and capital markets will most probably continue to depress lending spreads. In the event, the ability of public sector banks to raise capital on their own would be limited and their attractiveness to private investors reduced. The recurring need for recapitalization by the government may undermine confidence in banks, and the accumulating public debt burden could bring into question the credibility of continuing fiscal support. Public sector banks are, of course, not a uniform group, and some of the stronger institutions may generate sufficient profits to attract private capital. However, competition will widen the performance gap between banks so that the position of weaker banks could deteriorate further. 3 The RBI regulation requires that at least 75 percent of the securities portfolio should be marked to market.

India has an elaborate system for the compilation of economic and financial statistics, and produces a vast quantity of data covering virtually all sectors of the economy. Important progress has been made in recent years in the publication of key economic data towards meeting India’s commitments under the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). 2. Many key financial variables are available on a weekly or monthly basis, most of which are published in official documents or disseminated through press releases. Nevertheless, the statistical system suffers from a number of weaknesses, many of which have been identified in the August 2001 Report of the National Statistical Commission. These weaknesses include: l Statistical methods are cumbersome, and reporting methods have not kept pace with the shift to a more market-oriented economy following the elimination of industrial licensing. Computerization of data systems is being introduced slowly. 0 Decentralization of data collection implies that the Central Statistical Office (CSO) has little control over statistical techniques used in other agencies. This greatly complicates the task of achieving consistency across the sectoral accounts. l There are still shortcomings in the periodicity, coverage, and quality of many data series. 3. A STA mission has just completed discussions with the authorities in preparation of a data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for India. The data module of the ROSC will consist of three elements. The first element will be an assessment of India’s data dissemination practices against the SDDS requirements. The second element will be a summary assessment of the quality of six data sets based on the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed in STA. The third element will be a list of prioritized staff recommendations, that, if necessary, could be used as the basis for a program of future statistical development. 4. Recent developments and important shortcomings in the areas of national accounts, monetary and financial statistics, balance of payments, and government finance are discussed below: l National accounts: The CSO rebased the annual national accounts statistics and began publishing quarterly data from early 2000. However, quarterly data are only available from 1996Q2. Also, data are subject to substantial historical revisions, and generally when data are revised, only partial historical series are released to the public, significantly hampering analysis. Information on major expenditure categories is only available with considerable delay (at least ten months after the end of the fiscal year), providing limited guidance for short-term policies. Saving and investment estimates are particularly weak, reflecting an outdated estimation method and limited information on activity outside the organized sector of the economy. Estimation of real output in public administration and defense may be biased upwards in recent years, as it is based on the government’s wage bill Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 62 - ANNEX V (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). a Industrial production index (IIP): In May 2000, the CSO took the welcome step of releasing a completely revised time series for IIP, using the new WPI (base year 1993/94) series as a deflator. However, the new series has been subject to major errors and revisions in recent months. a Price statistics: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is based on weights that are more than fifteen years old, and do not fully capture price developments in the economy. There are three CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and non-manual employees, and agricultural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. Greater reliance is placed on the WPI, which is published weekly with a lag of about two weeks. A new WPI series was published last year with updated weights, new categories, and a revised base year (1993/94). a Balance of payments: A significant improvement has been made in the timeliness of the quarterly balance of payments data, which are now released with a lag of three months.’ However, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, Further, data on trade prices and volumes are not regularly available on a timely basis. Starting January 2001, external debt statistics are now available on a quarterly basis with a six month lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is made only occasionally (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term non- resident Indian accounts). The international investment position statistics currently do not cover the assets of the corporate or banking sectors and appear after a long lag. It is planned to publish international investment position data that comply with the SDDS requirements before the end of September 2002. l Central Bank Statistics: The RBI website and bulletin publish a wide array of financial and monetary statistics, including interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, monetary survey, and results of debt securities auctions. The frequency and quality of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years. However, some crucial data, e.g., RBI’s forward liabilities, are still published with lags of two to three months. The authorities began reporting data according to the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity for the first time in December 2000, although some items in the template, including details on reserves and reserve liabilities, were not reported until December 200 1. The template with data as of end-May 200 1, without much detail, is disseminated on the RBI website. The more up-to-date information on certain variables, i The STA missions that visited India in November/December 1997 and February 1998 made comprehensive recommendations to improve the timeliness, scope, and classification of India’s balance of payments statistics.

However, no monthly data on fiscal performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available only with an 8-10 month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local government operations. In addition, although data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag, the typical presentation of fiscal accounts does not provide a particularly useful classification for macroeconomic analysis. For example, classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. 5. Despite the improvements made to published statistical data in recent years, important shortcomings hamper the timely analysis of trends in the Indian economy, and hence the conduct of policy and Fund surveillance. India subscribed to the SDDS in January 1997 and presents its metadata on the Data Dissemination Bulletin Board. To fully meet its commitments under the SDDS, India will need to continue with a number of initiatives aimed at improving data dissemination practices.

The Bank’s program of support combines policy dialogue with a diversified lending program and economic and sector work. The latter includes formal reports and demand-driven policy notes as well as technical assistance on macroeconomic and state fiscal management issues; on sector-level reforms (governance, agriculture, education, finance, health, nutrition, and power); and on poverty. As outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy of June 2001, lending from the Bank Group is targeted to poverty reduction, human resource and infrastructure development, and the state level reform process. Particular emphasis is being made on fiscal and governance reforms in the leading reforming states. A multi-sectoral investment loan was approved in mid-1998 to support state-level fiscal reforms in Andhra Pradesh. Similar programs of assistance, comprising sub-national adjustment loans and sectoral investment operations, supported reforms in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka during 2000-2001. Second phase operations in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were approved by the Board of Directors in March 2002. Other states have also shown strong interest in programs supporting state level reforms. Financial operations since 1995/96 are summarized below. New commitments increased significantly in the year 2000/01 as sanctions on non-basic human need projects were de facto lifted.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with India On June 28, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with India.’ Background India’s impressive economic growth of the mid-l 990s has stalled in recent years, and the gains from the structural reforms and fiscal consolidation of the early 1990s appear to have abated. The trend slowdown reflects lower growth in agriculture and industry, and on the demand side, in business investment. Cyclical and exogenous factors-including recurrent weakness in the external environment, droughts, and natural disasters-contributed, but the slowdown also reflects weak business confidence, remaining structural distortions, severe infrastructure bottlenecks, and high real interest rates. Both poor infrastructure and high interest rates reflect the deterioration in the fiscal position since 1997/98-the general government deficit, the revenue (or current) deficit, and debt stock are now the same as or larger than in 1990/91, prior to the crisis. On the positive side, the external position is comfortable, with foreign exchange reserves at an all-time high, providing ample coverage of short-term debt. Within the context of the slowdown in trend growth, the economy experienced a modest recovery during 2001/02. The economy grew by around 4 percent in 2000/01, reflecting both weak agricultural growth and a significant slowdown in the service sector. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2001/02, growth recovered to around 5% percent, largely driven by the rebound in agriculture. In contrast, industrial growth continued to decelerate recording the lowes growth in a decade during 2001/02. it During the past year, inflationary pressures subsided. WPI inflation, which peaked at over 8% percent (y/y) in early 2001, declined to 1% percent in April 2002-near the lowest rate in a decade. This reflected waning effects of earlier energy price hikes and flat manufactured goods prices-which account for over 60 percent of the index-owing both to greater competitive pressures from trade liberalization and weak demand. In contrast, CPI inflation rose to over ’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the June 28, 2002 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

The external position remains comfortable, notwithstanding the slowdown in export demand and the pickup in non-oil imports. The current account deficit narrowed to near balance in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, reflecting declining world oil prices-the oil import bill fell by $2 billion in 2001/02. Transfers from Indians working abroad also remained buoyant and are reported to have increased after September 11. On the capital account, FDI inflows-especially in the telecom sector-grew strongly, albeit from a low base, and NRI deposit inflows picked up. During 2001/02, these factors resulted in a $12 billion increase in foreign exchange reserves, which now stand at an all time high of $55% billion (over 8 months of goods and services imports and five times short-term external debt). Market sentiment was volatile during the past year, reflecting both economic and political factors. After falling during 2001, the stock market staged a rally in February 2002, largely reflecting the stepped-up pace of privatization, but has since declined markedly. The main stock market index has fallen by about 10 percent since early April, and net foreign institutional investment flows have turned negative. Recent developments-including the escalation of border tensions with Pakistan and the communal violence in Gujarat-have weakened sentiment, in part because of their implications for the much-needed acceleration of economic reforms. Rating agencies cut their ratings in 2001 and are maintaining negative outlooks, citing chronic fiscal deficits and weak progress on structural reforms. In response to continued economic weakness, monetary policy began to be eased in early 2001 and an easing bias has been maintained to date. Overall, the cash reserve ratio was lowered in stages by a total of 3% percentage points to 5 percent, and the bank rate-the key signaling rate-was reduced by 150 basis points and now stands at 6% percent, its lowest level since May 1973. Market interest rates on government securities also fell sharply at all maturities. The exchange rate-which is closely managed-depreciated by about 5 percent against the U.S. dollar in the 12 months through end-April but was broadly constant in real effective terms. During most of this period, the RBI took advantage of balance of payments inflows to accumulate reserves through partially sterilized intervention. Despite the cuts in the policy interest rate, lending rates did not fall commensurately and domestic credit growth continued to decelerate. Bank lending and deposit rates fell by only about 100-l 50 basis points, and the prime lending rate remained virtually unchanged, reflecting in part the rigidities arising from administered small savings rates, which push up the cost of bank deposits, and high levels of nonperforming assets. The growth of credit to the commercial sector declined to about 12 percent (y/y) in recent months, reflecting the overall weakness in private sector demand. Thus, monetary easing has resulted in commercial banks holding government securities far in excess of statutory liquidity requirements. Public finances deteriorated again in 2001/02. The central government deficit (on the authorities’ definition, which treats privatization receipts as revenues) is estimated to have risen from 5% percent of GDP in 2000/01 to about 6 percent of GDP in 2001/02-more than 1 percent of GDP higher than the budget target. This outcome reflects severe tax shortfalls, due, in part, to the economic slowdown, and overly optimistic budget targets. While nominal spending was kept within the budget, there were overruns in food subsidies. The states’ deficit is expected to be some 4% percent of GDP-above the budget target of around 4 percent of GDP-largely owing to shortfalls in revenue transfers from the center and notwithstanding the states’ efforts to contain expenditures. The general government deficit is thus estimated to be 10% percent of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-71 - ANNEX IX GDP, and the stock of general government debt over 80 percent of GDP. Including the public sector enterprises, the consolidated public sector deficit is estimated to have exceeded 11% percent of GDP and public sector gross debt over 90 percent of GDP. The budget for 2002/03, announced in late February 2002, aimed to reduce the central government deficit to 5% percent of GDP, about ‘/2 percent of GDP less than the authorities’ expected outturn for 2001/02. On the revenue side, key initiatives included an increase in the income tax surcharge from 2 percent to 5 percent, a rationalization of excise duties, and an extension of the service tax. On the expenditure side, the main initiatives were a modest cut in fertilizer subsidies and reductions in surplus manpower, including through continuing limits on new recruitment of central government staff. In addition, the budget increased the proportion of funding from the center to the states that is conditional on fiscal and structural reforms, expanding the scope of reform-linked transfers that were initiated in 2001/02. During the year, progress was made in some aspects of structural reform. In particular, bold and pragmatic steps were taken to accelerate the pace of disinvestment. Another key achievement was the dismantling of the Administered Price Mechanism for petroleum products, together with bringing remaining subsidies on kerosene and LPG on budget and announcing a timetable for the elimination of these subsidies. Related to trade liberalization, statutory peak tariff rates were reduced, and the budget announced a commitment to reduce these rates further and move to a two-tier rate structure in the medium term. In the financial sector, loan classification and provisioning regulations were tightened, and foreign entry to the banking system was further liberalized through the lifting of limits on FDI and FII investment. Actions were taken to strengthen capital markets, including restructuring Unit Trust of India, the largest mutual fund, which also adopted net asset value-based pricing, and switching to rolling settlement in the stock market. In addition, a start was made in reforms in agriculture and industry through the removal of some commodities from the Essential Commodities Act and steps to further reduce the scope of small-scale sector reservation. In the area of infrastructure, progress was achieved in the National Highway Development program. The economy is projected to grow at 5% percent in 2002/03, assuming a modest recovery in the industrial sector to 4% percent as global demand recovers and as earlier strong rural income growth translates to domestic demand. It also incorporates the fact that leading indicators of activity are mixed and suggest only a tepid recovery in the period ahead. The projection assumes a deceleration in the agricultural sector to its historical trend growth rate of 3 percent, and a leveling-off of service sector growth at about 7% percent. Provided oil prices do not remain high on a sustained basis, inflation pressures are expected to remain subdued with both WPI and CPI inflation tracking in the range of 4 percent, and the current account deficit is expected to stay at about 1/2 percent of GDP.
