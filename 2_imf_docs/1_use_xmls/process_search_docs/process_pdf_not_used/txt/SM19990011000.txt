The 1999 Article IV consultation discussions with Italy were held in Rome from March 5 to 16, 1999.’ As in previous years, the mission’s final statement was released by the authorities and received wide press coverage. 2. In concluding the last Article IV consultation on March 13, 1998 (SUIV98/41), Directors commended the authorities on the prudent conduct of monetary policy and a prolonged and sizable fiscal correction, which together had resulted in a virtuous circle of financial convergence and set the Italian economy on course for initial participation in the final stage of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). At the same time, Directors stressed that further steps, concentrated on expenditure reduction, would be necessary to place the public finances firmly on a sound footing. Other key challenges included a reduction’ of the high public debt ratio; a social security system in need of further reform; and structural rigidities in labor and product markets. 3. The center-left government of Prime Minister D’Alema assumed office in October 1998 and has generally maintained the economic policies of its predecessor. General elections must be held by April 2001. II. BACKGRO&D AND PROSPECTS A. Macroeconomic Developments: A Decade of Slow Growth and a Stalled Recovery 4. During the 199Os, the ItaIisn economy has recorded the weakest growth performance among major industrial countries (other than Japan), with GDP growth averaging only 1% percent per annum (Figure 1; and Table l).* Slow growth resulted from a combination of relatively tight macroeconomic policies and structural rigidities. The former reflected the impact of carrying out a needed fiscal consolidation and disinflation program, after a combination of loose fiscal and tight monetary policy at the beginning of the decade had contributed to the lira’s overvaluation and eventual exit Corn the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The sharp fiscal adjustment during 1993-97 was accompanied by a tight ‘The mission---comprising Messrs. Artus (head), Krueger, Annunziata, Decressin, Halikias (all EUI), and Laxton @ES)-met with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Governor of the Bank of Italy, the Ministers of the Treasury and Budget, Finance, Labor, and Industry, other central and local government officials, representatives of regulatory agencies, research institutions, and labor and business leaders. Mr. Faini, Executive Director, participated in some of the meetings. Italy has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 (Appendix I). %ring the 199Os, the GDP growth differentials were 0.7 and 1.2 percentage points vis-h-vis the euro area and the United States, respectively; on a per capita basis, the corresponding differentials were 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. .

In addition, structural impediments also hampered the growth performance in the formal sector, including a rising tax and contribution burden, barriers to entry in a number of product and services markets, an inefficient welfare, system, and labor market rigidities that limited wage differentiation and employment flexibility. More recently, growth was also negatively affected by relatively strong repercussions from the Asian crisis (see below). 5. Owing to a sharp 4 deterioration in external conditions and the continuation of a relatively , tight monetary stance in the run-up to EMU, the recovery that began 1 in 1997 stalled in the course of 1998. GDP growth for 1998 was only 1.4 percent-just half the ’ growth rate elsewhere in the euro area-and turned negative in the final 0 quarter, as exports declined sharply. 6. The performance of the external sector was considerably lULm -w-II) --Lnll . . . * \ -- .

While the weakness may to some extent have reflected the earlier real appreciation of the lira (Figure 4), more important were repercussions from the Asian crisis. Italy’s trade with the Asian-crisis region was more affected than in European partner countries, due in part to differences in commodity structure (Table 2).3 The deterioration in the trade balance with these countries fully accounted for the overall worsening of the trade balance in 1998; in addition, there was a sharp decline in the trade balance with Japan. In all, the trade effects contributed to an estimated !A of 1 percentage point decline in the current account surplus in 1998, to 2% percent of GDP. 7. Final domestic demand strengthened through the fall of 1998 but then weakened markedly in the final quarter, along with external prospects. The recent weakening reflected foremost the behavior of investment, as firms responded to a deterioration in orders, capacity utilization, and economic prospects later in the year (Figures 5 and 6). On the . 3Textiles , garments, leather, and shoes accounted for almost 17 percent of Italy’s total exports in 1997 and their price elasticity is estimated to be relatively high. In addition, negative income effects in the Asian countries affected strongly the demand for high-quality consumer goods, an important export segment for Italy.

But some investment may have been postponed in anticipation of convergence-related cuts in interest . rates during the course of 1998, most evident in the continued weakness of the construction sector.4 Considering the phaseout, around midyear, of the incentive scheme to purchase new cars, household consumption growth remained quite robust in 1998, buoyed by strong demand for durables, which was sustained by price competition and price declines in the automobile sector, and the wealth effects of lower inflation and a booming stock market (Figure 7). However, consumption stagnated in the final quarter, following a weakening of confidence over the summer. 8. Inventory accumulation accounted for one-third of real GDP growth in 1998, with companies taking advantage of low prices on imported raw materials. Since the accumulation took place in the first half of the year, expectations of strong future demand may also have played a role. As these expectations were ultimately not fulfilled, the contribution of inventories to growth turned negative in the second half Nevertheless, the magnitude of the indicated inventory investments remains puzzling. ’ 9. Despite some structural changes in the labor market, unemployment has remained high and extraordinarily unbalanced, both regionally and demographically (Figures 8 and 9). Following the introduction of measures to foster part-time and fixed-term contracts in 1996, employment rose by ‘/z of 1 percentage point in 1998, the highest increase since the early 1990s; moreover, in contrast to previous years, this increase was concentrated in the South and among the female labor force. However, a rise in labor force participation lefi the unemployment rate in 1998 at 12.3 percent, unchanged from the previous year, compared to an average decline of almost 1 percentage point in other euro-area countries. Moreover, the regional dichotomy has remained stark, with the unemployment rate in the South-concentrated among women and the young-being well above 20 percent and almost four times higher than in the North, where unemployment is one of the lowest among European Union (XI) regions. 10. Consumer price inflation in 1998, at 2.0 percent (harmonized basis), was about 1 percentage point above the euro-area average (Figure 10). The widening of the inflation differential between Italy and the euro area in 1998 stemmed in part from Italy’s relatively slow progress in improving competition in distribution channels but also from domestic cost differentials. With contractual wage growth becoming more aligned with the rest of the euro area-the annual average increase moderated to 2.3 percent by February 1999 from 4.1 percent a year earlier-the inflation differential narrowed markedly in early 1999 as the 41n view of the structure of the Italian credit market, short-term interest rates (which converged later, see below) are more closely linked to economic activity than long-term rates. ‘In 1997 the growth contribution was even higher (two-thirds of total GDP growth)..

The prospect of durable and fiictionless nominal convergence was also enhanced by the social pact of December 1998, which not only reaf6rmed the features of the hallmark 1993 agreement but referred explicitly to euro-area inflation as a guidepost for domestic wage negotiations. B. Monetary and Fiscal Policy 11. The weak growth performance in Italy over the past year can in part be attributed to a relatively tight monetary stance during much of 1998 and earlier (Figure 2). With a large output gap-estimated by the staff at some 2% percent-and a subdued inflation outlook, Taylor-type rules would have suggested considerable room for monetary easing in late 1997 and early 1998.” But after the Bank of Italy cut official rates in April 1998, it left these rat& unchanged until October, at which point rates were well above those in other prospective euro countries (except Ireland). At the time, the Bank’s policy reflected concern about the rapid growth in its main monetary reference aggregate (M2), a rising inflation differential vis-&vis other euro aspirants, and its view that a relatively restrictive stance was required to minimize the risks of financial turbulence in the run-up to EMU. In fact, the lira came under pressure and interest differentials vis-A-vis German rates widened briefly in August in the wake of the Russian crisis. On the other hand, harmonized M3 and domestic credit aggegates, which now seem to be better indicators of inflation and output developments than M2, indicated no appreciable fiture inflationary pressure ,(Figure 11). 12. Monetary conditions eased considerably in the final quarter of 1998 and early 1999. Although intervention rates were cut sharply, Italy was the only euro-area participant whose official rates were above the initial euro rates. Subsequently, market rates also fell after the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered official interest rates in early April 1999. With the sharp decline in repo rates, short-term interest rates in mid-April, at 2.7 percent, were some 260 basis points lower than a year ago. Over the same period, the yield curve became upward sloping as the long-term yield differential vis-i-vis German rates remained broadly stable , (Figure 12); it stood at around 25 basis points in mid-April, reflecting mainly the market price of sovereign risk (as indicated by a lower credit rating on Italy’s govexmnent bonds). 13. Fiscal policy in 1998 is estimated to have had a slightly expansionary impact on economic activity (following an extraordinary 4 percentage point reduction in the deficit in the previous year). In spite of considerably lower-than-anticipated growth, the general government deficit overshot its target by only a small margin (0.1 percent of GDP), remaining at its 1997 level of 2.7 percent of GDP (Figure 13). However, the primary surplus declined by 1% percentage points to 4.9 percent of GDP in 1998 and the estimated structural primary 61n terms of the output effects, the Oxford Economic Forecasting (OEF) model suggests that a 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates in Italy leads to an 0.3 percent increase in the GDP level in the first year and an 0.7 percent increase by the second year. Staff projections assume somewhat smaller short-run effects. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 17 - Figure 11.

The decline in the primary surplus was larger than budgeted-related mainly to underperformance of the new regional tax on firms’ value added (IRAP) and overruns on health and capital spending-but these slippages were largely matched by lower-than-budgeted interest payments.’ With higher-than- expected privatization and dividend receipts, the government debt-to-GDP ratio fell by 3% percentage points, to 118.7 percent. 14. Recognizing that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) requires further fiscal consolidation, the 1999 budget targeted a deficit of 2.0 percent and a primary surplus of 5.5 percent of GDP. The budget entailed net measures of Lit 8 trillion (Euro 4.1 billion, or 0.4 percent of GDP), concentrated in primary expenditure (Table 3). These included cuts in goods and service expenditure by the state, lower transfers to regions and other local entities, and lower subsidies. On the revenue side, the budget includes 0.3 percent of GDP from the accelerated collection of social security arrears;* and a new carbon tax has been introduced. Among others, these measures are needed to offset a partial rebate of the “euro tax” and other social support initiatives, as well as an increase in capital expenditure. But with its GDP growth forecast for 1999 revised down from 2.5 percent to 1.5 percent, the government recently raised its deficit target to 2.4 percent of GDP; this incorporates interest payments that are expected to be 0.3 percent of GDP lower than budgeted (Table 4; see Section III). ‘The original deficit target was 2.8 percent of GDP, but it was tightened in the April 1998 quarterly budget document and maintained at 2.6 percent in subsequent fiscal plans. It was based on a real GDP growth assumption of 2.5 percent. Lower-than-budgeted interest payments of O.S’percent of GDP exclude a statistical adjustment of 0.2 percent of GDP, reflecting ISTAT’s reclassification of some interest payments as government consumption and the netting out of interest payments held by social security institutions against nontax revenues (without affecting the overall budget balance). sClaims on arrears to the social security fund (INPS) are to be sold to financial institutions. EUROSTAT’s approval for classifying the receipts as budget revenues is still outstanding. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-21- C. Economic Outlook , 15. The economic outlook for 1999 is subject to considerable uncertainties. On the one hand, real GDP declined at an annual rate of more than 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998, reflecting a collapse in exports but also a broad-based 12s weakness in all major demand components; and industrial production remained below the year-earlier level in the first 1zD quarter of 1999. On the other hand, indicators of industrial production expectations and 115 orders offer some signs that a rebound may take place rather quickly.

Against this background, the staffs central economic scenario for 1999 envisages GDP growth of 1% percent, in line with the latest projections by the authorities (and by Consensus Forecasts). The scenario is predicated on a stabilization of economic activity in the first part of the year and a considerable acceleration thereaRer when the full effect of the cumulative monetary easing comes to bear and external demand is also assumed to rebound. The risks to this scenario appear to be broadly balanced. On current policies, the downside risks stem mainly from (i) a firther weakening in consumer confidence and cut-backs in consumer spending, especially if unemployment were to rise; and (ii) a stronger-than- anticipated slowdown in partner countries. In addition, there could be some risk for economic activity, including tourism, should the crisis in Kosovo be prolonged. On the upside, the potential for higher growth than currently projected is foremost seen in a stronger response of economic activity, and especially construction, to the decline in interest rates. A comparison with the experience in Portugal and Spain-where interest rates declined much earlier-also suggests that the “puzzle” of Italy’s relatively slow growth experience may in part reflect the relatively late ea’sing of the policy stance, implying that considerable benefits are still to come (Table 5). However, even though such a comparison is subject to several caveats, the current boom in the Iberian countries-including in Spain following major structural reforms in the Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-22 - labor market-may also indicate that structural impediments have hampered the growth performance of the Italian economy.’ 17. The discussions with the authorities revealed a broad consensus that the role of structural factors will be critical for the performance of the Italian economy over the medium term. Under an unchanged policy scenario, the staff projects modest GDP growth of around 2% percent during 2000-04, which would gradually close the output gap (Table 6).” Domestic demand expansion, helped by a low-inflation/low-interest rate environment, would be the main engine of growth while persistent structural rigidities-such as the high tax burden and regional dichotomies -would prevent a more dynamic output performance. The closing of relative output gaps is likely to lead to a further moderate reduction in the current account surplus over the medium term. III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS A. Overview 18. As a founding member of the euro area, Italy has begun to reap some of the benefits of EMU, notably historically low inflation and interest rates. Nevertheless, the discussions were overshadowed by the prolonged poor growth performance and a further weakening of economic activity during the course of 1998 and in early 1999. Against this background, the mission focused on two closely linked issues: (i) fiscal policy-the role of fiscal stabilizers, but also longer-term fiscal adjustment and improvements in the quality of government services; and (ii) policies to reignite a more dynamic growth process, particularly in the South. There was broad agreement on the general policy requirements-which are hardly unique to Italy-although the authorities emphasized the political constraints to some elements of the reform strategy. B. Macroeconomic Stabilization: The Increased Role of Fiscal Policy 19. The discussions on the appropriate stabilizing role of fiscal policy were framed against two constraints: the current monetary conditions in the euro area and the demands of a prudent medium-term fiscal balance. ‘The boom in Spain is analyzed in more detail in the forthcoming staff report for the 1999 Article IV consultation with Spain. ‘@This assumes potential output growth of 1.8 percent per annum. Estimates of potential growth are subject to considerable uncertainty and there are some downside risks to the staffs estimate (on the other hand, the OECD’s estimate of potential output growth is 2.1 percent for 1999-200 1).

Monetary conditions have eased markedly in the context of entry into monetary union and staff estimates suggest that they reached a 15year trough following the ECB’s reduction in intervention rates in early April 1999. The Governor concurred that monetary conditions had become very supportive of economic activity and considered interest rate levels in early 1999 (even ahead of the ECB’s April action) as appropriate from a purely domestic perspective. The authorities’ analysis, as well as the staffs (reported in a background study), did not support the view of some market participants that the weakness in activity was partly related to a credit crunch, especially in the South. The authorities also took issue with the view that a faster reduction in official Italian interest rates would have been appropriate in 1997/98. They pointed out that guarding against risks that could have jeopardized euro participation had called for some bias toward a tighter stance in monetary policy. In any case, the effectiveness of monetary policy was seen as limited as structural factors were foremost in impeding the growth process. The staff was more sanguine on the effectiveness of monetary policy in an environment where the cyclical slack remained large; accordingly, the easing in official interest rates in April as well as the depreciation of the euro in the spring were expected to provide, with some lag, added support for economic activity.” On exchange rates and competitiveness, both the authorities and the stti considered the price and cost competitiveness of the Italian economy as broadly adequate and the lira’s conversion rate to the euro appeared in line with medium-term fundamentals-a view that is consistent with CGER-based estimates. Prudent medium-term balance 21. Italy’s medium-term challenges have to be taken into account in a balanced assessment of the near-term fiscal policy requirements. In this regard, the country faces two fiscal constraints that are more severe than in most other industrial countries: a high level of gross public debt (just under 120 percent of GDP) and a rapid aging of the population that is likely to result in one of the most adverse demographic trends in the first half of the next century. Preparing for the rapid aging of the population would be helped by a buildup in pension reserves and a strong net asset position of the public sector more generally, and by further reforms to reduce future pension liabilities. Against this background, the discussions focused on fiscal trends well beyond the usual medium term. 22. With respect to the general government balance, these longer-term considerations underscore the need for a relatively rapid decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratio. While mindful of the political constraints and adjustment fatigue in Italy (and in Europe more generally), the staff argued for a policy stance that would reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio to close to the Maastricht reference value of 60 percent of GDP by 2010, just ahead of a rapid “The role of monetary policy in the euro area is discussed in detail in SM/99/61 (3/5/99).

The authorities concurred that the medium-term challenges called for rapid debt reduction and a strong primary position. The Stability Programme envisaged a stable primary surplus of 5.5 percent of GDP during 1999-200 1, a target that was consistent with the staffs normative scenario (taking account of the output path and output gaps assumed in the StabiZity Programme). The staff cautioned, however, that the authorities’ revised plans for 1999 implied a weakening of the structural primary surplus from the original budget (see * below), which also jeopardized achieving the targets of the Stability Programme in 2000-01. For the period after 2001, the authorities argued that it might be politically difficult to achieve an actual primary surplus that exceeded 5.5 percent of GDP, even if the output gap was closed, as the overall balance would record a considerable surplus, helped by falling interest payments. Instead, they suggested that it would be preferable to use additional resources for increased public investment outlays rather than for more accelerated debt reduction. On the other hand, the staff pointed out that even in its normative scenario, the debt ratio would not reach the Maastricht reference value before the second decade of the next century when the rise in the dependency ratio accelerates rapidly, suggesting that this scenario may represent a minimum requirement. Near-term fiscal outlook and the stabilizing role of fiscal policy 24. The authorities’ assessment of the fiscal outlook for 1999 points to a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP and, with lower-than-budgeted interest payments, the revised estimate for the primary surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP is VI of 1 percentage point lower than budgeted. Deviations from the original deficit target of 2.0 percent of GDP reflected, first, the effect of the weaker cycle on the budget, with the impact of the fir11 operation of the automatic stabilizers estimated by the authorities (and staff) at about ‘/z of 1 percent of GDP. Second, there were deviations unrelated to cyclical developments. Some of these have only a temporary effect on the budget; most importantly, interest payments were expected to be lower-than-budgeted in 1999 (by somewhat less than ?A percent of GDP), which reflected the faster-than-anticipated impact of euro-related interest rate declines but not a revised longer- run perspective on interest rates and payments. On the other hand, the shortfall on the new IRAP tax was expected to result in a long-term revenue loss of some 0.4 percent of GDP, absent additional measures. While there was broad agreement on these aspects of the budgetary outlook, the staffs deficit projections for 1999 were, nevertheless, somewhat less sanguine and point to a deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP, mostly reflecting a lower estimated yield from improved tax administration, l4 The estimates by the authorities and staff do not incorporate additional risks to the 1999 budget that stem primarily from the possibility of a further weakening in economic activity and that some of the budget measures may not achieve the hoped-for results (e.g., the accelerated collection of outstanding social security contributions). r40n tax administration, the authorities indicated that they were implementing recommendations of recent FAD missions, whose report had been published. The report placed the highest priority on executing ongoing reforms on time (including the expansion of unified tax offices) and on new procedures for tax collection and filing.

The discussions on the appropriate role of fiscal stabilizers in 1999 and tbe circumstances that might trigger corrective measures were framed against the requirements of a prudent medium-term fiscal position discussed above--and also cognizant of the overall policy mix, including the considerable easing of monetary conditions in Italy. The authorities emphasized that automatic fiscal stabilizers could play a useful role in cushioning the present weaicening of the economy, and that the fiscal consolidation process had left sufficient room to allow for a substantial working of the stabiliiers, while observing the limits of the SGP. The staff also saw room for a substantial operation of the automatic stabilizers. Moreover, it concurred with the authorities that (i) conservative interest rate assumptions had left a cushion in the budget that almost matched in size the effects of a full operation of the automatic stabilizers; and (ii) lower-than-expected interest rates and a more depreciated exchange rate had resulted in an overall policy mix that was now considerably easier than anticipated in the 1999 budget, even before allowing for the operation of the automatic stabilizers. The staff underscored that these aspects needed to be reflected in the assessment of the appropriate fiscal stance in 1999.

With the budgetary impact from lower-than-anticipated interest payments expected to match the effects of a substantial operation of the automatic fiscal stabilizers, the issue was the extent to which the expected slippages in the overall deficit in 1999-almost fully attributable to noncyclical primary slippages, estimated at 0.4 percent of GDP (staff: 0.6 percent)-should be offset in 1999.l’ The authorities argued that some widening of the deficit was warranted in view of the weakness of the economy; indeed, part of the projected deficit overrun was accounted for by a discretionary decision to raise public investment expenditure. On the other hand, the authorities shared the staffs concern that if the 1999 deficit target were overshot by a wide margin it could raise market concerns and become difficult to limit the 2000 deficit to the 3 percent ceiling, especially if growth were not to rebound as currently envisaged. Pointing also to easy monetary conditions that were very supportive of activity, the staff argued for adopting measures, as needed, to offset slippages with permanent effects on the budget and to revert to the prudent medium-term path discussed above. The authorities already planned to eliminate some “loopholes” that had limited local transportation companies’ payments of the new IRAP tax (yielding perhaps 0.2 percent of GDP); and the staff suggested that an increase in the IRAP tax rate could also be considered to partly offset the overestimation in its yield. Moreover, the authorities concurred that if revenues performed better than anticipated, this should be used to contain deficit slippages. The staffunderscored that any additional measures should focus on expenditure cuts (along the lines discussed in Section C). It recognized that, in view of the earliest possible introduction of these cuts, it could be difftcult to secure the 2 percent budget target in 1999. However, measures should be adopted early and be sufliciently ambitious to yield substantial savings in 1999 and to fully offset the noncyclical primary slippages on a full- year basis. In 2000, this would limit the overall budget deficit to 1% percent of GDP and the structural primary surplus would be in line with the staffs normative scenario (and, indeed, a % percent of GDP smaller than implied by the authorities’ Stability Programme). . C. Policies to Support More Dynamic and Broad-Based Growth 27. Overcoming lackluster growth is the key challenge facing the Italian economy. In the discussions, there was broad agreement that structural reforms could play an important role in supporting more dynamic and broad-based growth. While some structural impediments to growth have been alleviated in recent years, the discussions sought to identify key areas that clearly required additional reform steps. In this context, the focus was on: (i) structural “At the time of the mission, the authorities’ assessment of the fiscal outlook for 1999 pointed to a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP. The subsequent upward revision to 2.4 percent was mainly due to nontax revenue shortfalls unrelated to the cyclical weakening and to an increase in capital expenditure. The revenue shortfalls reflect about equally lower capital revenues and “other” current revenues (the former due to some sales of real estate properties by the social security funds that are not expected to take place in 1999). Staff estimates have also been revised upward to reflect these new slippages.

Structural policies in other areas were also covered on a selective basis. Fiscal policies and public sector reform Reducing the burden of direct taxes and social security contributions 28. While the average tax burden in Italy is not very different from that in other European countries (a questionable standard), the system relies relatively heavily on direct taxes and social security contributions that fall on a relatively narrow tax base. In particular, the system is characterized by high marginal tax and social security contribution rates on recorded labor income. Direct taxes amounted to almost 16 percent of GDP in Italy in 1997 versus 13% percent in the euro area (Table 7), and the tax wedge is among the highest in major industrial countries (Figure 14).i6 The authorities recognized the system’s deleterious effects on labor markets and recorded activity. 29. Despite some progress in recent years, the reform agenda remains daunting if Italy’s direct tax and social security contribution rates are to be brought in line with those prevailing elsewhere in the euro area- an objective that would seem to represent a minimum first step in a more competitive euro region. Against this background, the staff . expressed disappointment with the meager progress entailed in the 1999 budget. It argued that future steps should focus in particular on (i) further reductions in the progressivity and top marginal tax rate (46 percent) of the personal income tax (IRPEF); and (ii) cuts in social security contribution rates, to be financed by expenditure savings (see below). Plans at the EU level also indicate a possible need to lower the standard withholding tax on interest income Corn 27 percent to 20 percent should this be established as the reference rate. 30. The authorities acknowledged that the 1999 budget contained no major tax reform measures but pointed out that some recent initiatives were aimed at reducing the tax burden and fostering more growth. These included, in the context of the December 1998 labor market agreement, a commitment for a phased 3 percentage points lowering of social contribution rates. Moreover, modifications of the dual income tax on corporate profits @IT.) were adopted in March 1999, which extended the reduced corporate tax rate of 19 percent to profits imputed to previously reinvested profits, resulting in a reduction in the effective tax rate on corporate profits.” There was nonetheless a broad consensus that additional steps would be needed in this area and the authorities reaflirmed their commitment to reduce the tax burden as indicated in the Stability Programme, although the specific measures remained to be ‘%ee also IMF, WorldEconomic Outlook (EBSl9913 1, 319199). ‘7Previously, the lower corporate tax rate applied only to profits imputed to new capital investment. Other profits are subject to the standard 37 percent corporate tax rate and the minimum average tax rate remains at 27 percent.

In addition, the staff argued for further simplifications of the tax system; as the authorities recognized, the wide-spread use of tax incentives, for example, contributed to difficulties in tax administration. Lowering primary current expenditure 31. A decline in the overall tax burden is only sustainable if accompanied by a reduction in primary current expenditures. The authorities pointed out that the Stability Programme targeted a fall in primary expenditure by a cumulative 1.8 percent of GDP during 1999-2001 (with most of the measures unidentified). 32. Part of a durable reduction in primary expenditures could be achieved by further ’ reductions in public sector employment, at around 20 percent of total employment still high even by EU standards. The authorities underlined that progress was being made in this area: the 1999 budget targeted a 1% percent cut in till-time public sector employment (excluding teachers); the establishment of new positions required approval at the economic cabinet level; and public sector employment had become more flexible with the use of part-time contracts. The mission welcomed the sizable cut in full-time employment but pointed out that, with new hires under other contracts, the expected budgetary savings were rather limited (for example, only Lit 0.4 trillion, or 0.02 percent of GDP, in 1999). The discussions explored whether specific targets for overall employment reductions could be established, with managers accountable for meeting these targets. The legal framework for implementing such policies had been created under the 1997 Bassanini laws and its application would require redeployment within the public sector to address arising needs in some areas and excess employment in others. There was no clear consensus among the authorities on this issue, with some arguing that different skill requirements in different public sector jobs would limit the feasibility of such a policy while most suggested that it could offer considerable room for public employment reductions. 33. Turning to cuts in specific primary expenditure categories, the authorities underscored that, in most cases, Italian expenditures (relative to GDP) were not out of line with those in other EU countries. Nevertheless, they concurred that a relatively high debt service burden and adverse demographic trends limited what Italy could afford, and saw room for improving efficiency in several expenditure categories. This could include reductions in subsidies, notably to the railways, which have continued to make sizable losses (about 1% percent of GDP per annum in 1995-97) that are largely absorbed by the state. Drawing on recent work by the OECD, the staff inquired about plans to increase fares and reduce the labor force in this sector; the authorities explained that possible reforms were being studied. In the health care sector, the discussions covered the expansion of co-payments for medical services and pharmaceuticals. The authorities underlined the considerable steps taken in this regard in recent years; further measures would be politically difficult to implement, at least at this current juncture. The discussion of the welfare system started from a general consensus that it is poorly targeted and relatively ineffective in supporting the most needy segments of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- the population. l8 However, the authorities pointed to recent progress with the introduction (on a limited scale) of a social assistance program targeted at the very poor (reddito minim0 d ‘inserimento). The staff welcomed this initiative and suggested that additional reforms in this area, in particular extensive use of means testing, could provide room for moderate overall expenditure savings while at the same time improving delivery to the truly needy. Pension reform 34. The necessary reduction in primary expenditure will be feasible only if one of its main components, that is, pension outlays, can be contained. Important steps have already been taken, which go, in many respects, beyond reforms elsewhere in Europe (Box 1). However, most public and private sector representatives saw a need for further reform steps in order to meet the authorities’ target of limiting the social expenditure-to-GDP ratio to its 1996-97 level and to prevent a sharp increase in the deficit of the public pension funds (some 5 percent of GDP in 1998). The staffs analysis, detailed in a background paper, suggests that the pension expenditure-to-GDP ratio would be likely to rise considerably in the absence of significant policy adjustments. Moreover, the pension system and public sector more broadly are ill prepared to afford such a rise in expenditure: assets have not been built up to pay for future pension obligations and gross public debt is close to 120 percent of GDP; and pension expenditures are already relatively high ahead of the most adverse aging trends. Against this background, the discussions covered inter alia steps to raise the employment-to-population. ratio and tighten the generous rules for seniority pensions, including by extending the rise in the minimum age for seniority pensions to blue collar workers.lg Among the authorities, those aware of the need for further steps emphasized that a politically opportune time had to be found when consensus could be built quickly. The staff expressed concern that, with the general public well aware of the likely need for further reform; uncertainty about future levels of disposable income and taxation might be weakening consumption, investment, and economic growth, thereby strengthening the case for more rapid action. Public sector reform 35. The authorities were well aware of shortcomings in the quality and effkacy of government services, at both the local and the central levels. Recent legal changes, notably “The failings of the system were highlighted by the Onofri Commission; see also M. Rostagno and F. Utili, Ilie Italian Social Protection System: The Poverty of Welfare (WP/98/74). lgSeniority pensions allowed retirement with a full pension after a contribution period of 36 years in 1998, irrespective of age, or a contribution period of 35 years and age of at least 54. The minimum contribution period will increase gradually to 40 years by 2008. The minimum age will rise to 57 years by 2002 but blue collar workers, which account for about three-quarter of the flow of private sector seniority retirees, have been exempted from the rise in the minimum age.

Population Aging and Pension Reform 3ignificant progress in pension reform in response to daunting challenges Faced with one of the most adverse demographic trends (see table), Italy has embarked on an ambitious pension reform program. The Amato (1992) md Dini (1995) reforms, supplemented by the November 1997 pension agreement, considerably strengthened the pension system. Key elements of these reforms included: (i) a gradual transition from au earnings-based to a :onhibution-based system; (ii) a shift from wage to CPI-based pension indexation; (iii) an increase in the minimum retirement age for seniority pensions; (iv) an increase in the retirement age for old-age pensions and incentives to postpone early retirement; (v) a gradual elimination of special provisions for public sector employees; (vi) a tightening of the rules governing invalidity and survivors’ pensions; and (vii) a gradual increase in the contribution rate of the self-employed. -Ratios YeSr Italy Euoart!a l&i 1995 23.8 21.8 19.2 imo 26.5 23.2 19.0 2035 29.3 25.1 19.2 2015 34.6 29.3 23.4 2025 41.7 371 32.6 2u35 55.6 47.7 x7 But more needs to be done to ensure macroeconomic stability and equity Even with these reforms, Italy still has one of the most generous pension systems and one of the highest pension expenditure-to- GDP ratios in the OECD. Moreover, assets have not been built up in preparation for the expected rise in the number of pensioners and the general government sector is saddled with a high level of public debt. It is widely recognized that more needs to be done to secure the viability of the pension system and to provide more room to pursue other policy objectives. The strains on the present system would become particular severe if productivity growth in Italy remained at levels typically observed in the most advanced countries in recent years, including the United States. As the left panel of the figure below shows, there has been a tendency for trend productivity growth to decline toward the U.S. growth rate as the levels of productivity in cotmtries such as ttaly have caught up to higher levels in the United States. A background paper formally tests and is unable to reject the catch-up model for Italy, suggesting that the long-run sustainable rate of productivity growth may be considerably below the 2.6 percent that is assumed in the 1998 Treasury Report on the Pension System. The right panel of the figure below shows the implications for the expenditure-to-GDP ratio if trend productivity growth were to range between 0.7 percent and 1.7 percent over the next 50 years. The mid-point of the range (1.2 percent) is the average rate of productivity growth in the United States since the mid- 1960s and is also the mid-point assumption that is currently used by the United States administration to evahrate the social security system. Starting from a weak net public debt position, it would be difficult to accommodate the implied likely rise in the pension expenditure-to-GDP ratio while leaving ticient room for other policy objectives without imposing an even larger tax and social security burden on the working population Against this background, additional measures will be needed soon and could include: eliminating seniority pensions faster, an increase in the effective retirement age; a reduction in the level of current and future benefits on existing seniority pensions; and more frequent and rules-based adjustments to the pension benefit rules (current regulations call for negotiated adjustments only every ten years). In addition, broader policies that would reduce the impact of aging on the employment-population ratio should be considered, including labor market reforms that would raise labor force participation and reduce unemployment. A goal should be to reduce net government debt in the years before the most adverse demographic developments take place. Moreover, important changes under previous pension reforms are being phased in only gradually, leaving large inequalities across generations and diierent social and economic groups. Further pension reform should aim at reducing these imbalances and providing more protection for individuals who are well below the poverty line.

These legal changes provided, inter alia, a basis for more flexible employment practices in the public sector; introduced performance-based pay in public management positions; and also laid the ground for a one-stop “shop” for investment approvals and other public service simplifications. The mission argued for a forceful implementation of these reforms and the authorities indicated their intention to move rapidly in this area. Moreover, they pointed out that these reforms could only be successful if higher-skilled employees were attracted to the public sector, requiring adequate compensation levels. Labor markets and the North-South divide: policy challenges 36. The poor performance of the labor market-characterized by low job creation and high unemployment, concentrated in the South and among the young-has led to several reform steps in recent years. These reforms have facilitated more flexible employment contracts, increased compulsory schooling and apprenticeship programs, and abolished the public monopoly on employment intermediation. The reforms-a central focus of the last consultation (see SM/98/50,2/27/98)-are beginning to bear fruit and have contributed to a considerable rise in part-time and fixed-term employment, leading also to an expansion in total employment in 1998. 37. Progress in overcoming the key challenge of the labor market-a persistent and stark regional asymmetry-would, in the view of the staff, foremost require greater regional wage differentiation. The discussions explored ways to increase regional wage differentiation, which has remained limited for at least three decades under a relatively centralized national wage bargaining system (see Box 2). The staff suggested that reforms could include confining additional government support only to regions where the social partners agreed to a derogation from nationally mandated wage guidelines. While there was only limited support for a blanket derogation, the authorities pointed out that some negotiated exemptions from nationally mandated wage agreements were already possible for depressed areas. Their impact had been very limited, though, and the staff regretted that the December 1998 labor agreement did not include any commitment on the side of employers or labor to allow for increased regional wage differentiation. Staff pointed out that while the hallmark 1993 labor agreement had served the country well in the disinflation process, it would have been preferable to go beyond reaffirming the old agreement by allowing for greater wage differentiation. The discussion revealed that both the labor unions and the authorities were divided on this issue: some saw a need for increased wage differentiation, especially at the entry level; they also recognized that this could help in bringing parts of the informal economy into the open with positive effects hot only in terms of contract security for workers but also on the fiscal front. Others argued, however, that the onus fell on different measures, including improved job training, apprenticeship programs, and public investment.

The North-South Divide Large disparities in income levels and employment opportunities between the North and the South have been a blemish on Italy’s postwar economic performance.’ Per capita GDP in the South is barely half the level elsewhere in Italy and the gap has not narrowed over the past 25 years (see table below). Despite persistently higher unemployment rates in the South, there has been little interregional migration in recent decades and wage differeutiation remains insufficient to compensate for other costs of operating a business in the South. Such costs are affected by poor governance, inefficient public utilities and transportation systems, and longer distances to major export markets. Recent developments. The disparity between the Northern and Southern economies has widened in recent years. The 1992 devaluation benefited disproportionally the more open North, where the share of exports in GDP is about five times higher than in the South. In addition, the South was negatively affected by cuts in public funding for construction in the wake of corruption scandals (tangentopol& and by reduced hiring in the public sector because of budgetary consolidation. Relative unit labor costs remained largely unchanged despite these shocks. In the ensuing recession, the share of nonperforming loans increased to close to 25 percent in the South and several banks failed. Recently, some faint signs of a turnaround have emerged, including faster growth in employment and exports than in the North in 1998, although GDP. growth in 1998 in the South (estimated at 1.1 percent) fell again short of growth in the North. Government intervention. The regional disparities have been accompanied by large fiscal transfers to the South, amounting to almost one-fifth of average household income during 1983-92. An array of special support programs, often temporary and ad hoc, is targeted at depressed areas. These programs include automatic relief for firms on taxes and social security contributions and negotiated project support under contratti diprogramma, patti territoriali, and contratti d ‘urea. Under the contratti d ‘area for areas with large unemployment problems, limited exemptions are granted from nationally mandated wage agreements. Together the schemes of negotiated support are estimated to have created fewer than 50,000 new jobs since 1986 (compared with currently about 1.7 million unemployed in the South). Weak local government administration has hampered the schemes. For similar reasons, Italy has one of the lowest utilization rates of structural funds in the EU. Recent initiatives, notabIy in the context of thepatti territoriali, have included steps to increase transparency and competition in the bidding process for public investment, while streamlining the approval process. This has considerably raised Italy’s use of its allocated EU structural funds, to about 55 percent in 1998. In addition, the 1999 budget entails several new schemes targeted at the South, including the exemption of employers from social security contributions for new hires through 2001; and the creation of a development agency, Sviluppo Italia, which absorbs existing agencies. However, there is widespread agreement that these initiatives are unlikely to achieve a major take-off of economic growth in the South In the staffs view, further changes in economic incentives are needed, centering on labor market reform that would allow for sizable, market-based wage differentiation as well as more flexible employment contracts. Strengthening training programs and the incentives to work, and improving governance and infrastructure have also an important role in an integrated development strategy for the South.

The discussion on the possible introduction of the 35-hour workweek revealed an awareness by all social partners of the potential adverse implications on the economy. While preparatory steps toward draft legislation had been initiated earlier, these plans were now shelved and the authorities assured the staff that they had no intention to adopt a legislated 3 5 -hour workweek. 39. While the labor market is the most glaring manifestation of the North-South divide, the latter also has other important dimensions (see Box 2). The authorities are considering an ambitious reform of regional fiscal arrangements, presently before parliament, which would, among others: (i) replace transfers from the state to regions for health and transportation by a revenue-sharing arrangement for the personal income tax (IRPEF), VAT, and the excise tax on fuel; and (ii) introduce an interregional equalization mechanism that ~ takes into account the revenue-raising capacity of the regions. The staff concurred that some regional devolution could enhance the efficiency of the public sector, especially if combined with improvements in local governance. Based on results reported in a background study, it also stressed that local budget control needed to be increased and budget constraints to be hardened. The authorities agreed that this would necessitate a strengthening of the present monitoring and incentive system designed to limit borrowing by local entities.*’ The financial sector and other structural issues 40. The financial sector is undergoing a far-reaching transformation that has been sparked in part by developments emanating from EMU. Banks have looked for alternative fee- generating services as interest margins declined and other financial institutions, including insurance companies, have also expanded the menu of their financial services. At the same time, falling interest rates have stimulated investors’ demand for non-interest-bearing securities. In fact, with increased competition, financial institutions have adjusted interest rates in response to the convergence of.official rates much faster than historical patterns would have suggested. 41. The banking sector has made some strides in improving its competitiveness, but from a relatively weak starting position: profitability has been hampered by high operating costs related to overstaffing and inflexible employment practices, an overly extended branch network, and a high share of nonperforming loans.*’ The discussions also addressed whether *‘At present, a national stability pact stipulates reductions in the subnational governments’ net indebtedness equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP for 1999 and no increases during 2000-01, with penalties if subnational governments’ budgetary deficits deviate from targets. However, the enforcement mechanisms are untested, partly since the presently limited revenue-raising capacity of local governments itself constrained their borrowing on capital markets. 21The share of reported nonperforming loans--sofferenze, covering loans not regularly serviced and with the borrower deemed essentially insolvent-roughly doubled during (continued.. .) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - incentives in the sector were hampered by important ownership stakes of nonprofit institutions (i.e., the public sector directly and foundations, owned by local governments). The authorities argued that some potential problems had been addressed in the 1999 budget-including tax- based incentives for foundations to encourage divestiture of their dominant positions in financial institutions within four to six years -although implementing regulations may still leave coalitions of different foundations with dominant positions. More broadly, the authorities and financial market participants argued that the financial performance of the sector had strengthened in recent years and that banks were making major strides to cope with increased competition in the euro area, including through mergers. With respect to the supervisory tiamework, most market participants considered it adequate despite some concern that competencies may not be appropriately divided between different supervisory agencies. Market participants also contended that the financial sector seemed well prepared to overcome the Y2K problem, in part because many computer systems had recently been updated with the introduction of the euro. On the other hand, surveys indicate that Italy as a whole may lag behind many other industrial countries in addressing the Y2K problem. 42. Privatization, liquidation, and the breakup of state-holding companies have considerably changed the corporate landscape in the 1990s. The government expects to raise 0.7 percent of GDP in privatization revenues in 1999 (after 1 percent in 1998), and the staff was reassured that the main state-holding company @RI) is to be liquidated by mid-2000. The authorities recognized that the economic benefits from privatization would be enhanced if accompanied by further product market deregulation. The liberalization of the electricity sector at the beginning of 1999 was an important step forward, even though the measures-especially with respect to the transmission grid-fell short of proposals by the Italian electricity authority (although they were in line with the EU directive). Preparations were also underway to extend the liberalization to the natural gas market. On the other hand, the staff shared the concern of private sector representatives that little progress was made in other areas that could benefit from increased competition, including at the distribution and retail level (where entry especially by larger entities remained difficult), and also in some professions. IV. STAFFAPPRAISAL 43. The pursuit of a well-focused policy strategy was crowned with success at the beginning of 1999 when Italy became a founding member of the euro area. This successful strategy involved a remarkable reduction in the fiscal deficit, a persistent policy of disinflation, and some structural reforms for which the goal of euro participation galvanized broad-based support. But progress in many areas remains incomplete-including in the fiscal area, where *‘(...continued) 1991-97, reaching 9.4 percent, before declining to 9.1 percent by end-1998. In the South, the share of nonperforming loans reached 25 percent at end-1997. As indicated in Table 2, the exposure of Italian banks to emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere is comparatively small.

An ambitious longer-run fiscal consolidation program and public sector reform are needed as an integral part of a growth-oriented policy strategy; this would also require far-reaching structural reforms, 44. The most visible payoff of euro participation has been an environment of low inflation and interest rates. With domestic cost increases becoming closely aligned with those in other euro-area countries, there is little risk of inflation for the period ahead. Moreover, prospects for continued wage moderation were enhanced with the December 1998 social pact, which referred explicitly to inflation in the euro area as a guidepost for domestic wage increases. 45. The introduction of the euro has, however, not been accompanied by the boost to economic activity seen in other countries in Southern Europe, even though monetary conditions have become very supportive and external competitiveness is broadly adequate. This raises the question about the appropriate policy response to address the immediate weakness of the economy, especially the role of fiscal stabilizers. It also brings to the fore the quest for policies that could help to reignite more dynamic and broad-based growth. 46. In assessing the role of fiscal policy, account must first be taken of medium-term requirements, namely the need to secure a rapid reduction in the still very high stock of public debt and to prepare for an aging population. Staff estimates suggest that prudence on both these counts requires maintaining a primary surplus of at least 6% percent of GDP over the medium term. This is consistent with the baseline primary targets for 2000-01 in the authorities’ Stability Programme. However, achieving those targets will require breaking with a tendency to let lower interest payments be reflected in slippages in the primary balance, which increases the amount of adjustment required in future years, leaves the economy vulnerable to future interest rate increases, and misses opportunities for a much-needed acceleration of debt reduction. 47. Turning to near-term requirements, with growth in 1999 now likely to turn out considerably weaker than anticipated, there is room, and indeed a useful role, for a substantial operation of the automatic stabilizers, that is, for some cyclical deterioration in the primary balance in 1999. On present estimates, however, the expected deterioration is twice as large as cyclical developments would suggest. Hence, with interest savings expected to match the budgetary impact of the operation of the automatic stabilizers, the main risk to the overall budget target stems from slippages that are unrelated to the cycle. These slippages, estimated by the authorities and the staff at 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent of GDP, respectively, cloud the medium-term fiscal outlook and could, without additional measures, push the deficit to levels that would jeopardize the 3 percent ceiling of the SGP in 2000 if growth were not to rebound. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-38 - 48. Hence, with monetary conditions having eased considerably over the past year, steps should be initiated quickly to offset the noncyclical fiscal slippages. On the revenue side, measures should address the main slippages, including on IRAP. Concerning the appropriate phasing of additional corrective measures-measures which need to be consistent with the medium-term objective of lowering current primary expenditure-their budgetary impact in 1999 may be limited in view of their earliest possible introduction. However, corrective measures should be sufficiently ambitious to still yield substantial savings in 1999 and to fully offset the noncyclical slippages on a full-year basis, holding the 1999 deficit to below 2% percent of GDP, For 2000, if output grows as currently envisaged and with the full-year effect of the measures, the deficit should be limited to 1% percent of GDP, Moreover, any stronger-than-expected revenue performance in 1999 or additional savings from lower interest rates should be used to lower the budget deficit. 49. Fiscal policy should also play an important role in fostering more dynamic growth. The tax and social security burden needs to be lowered, notably by reducing marginal tax rates on labor income. To be sustainable, however, reductions in the tax burden have to be accompanied by cuts in primary current expenditure. Durable expenditure saving would require further reductions in public sector employment, where full advantage should be taken of possibilities to redeploy civil servants within the public sector. Steps in these areas should be detailed in comprehensive and well-specified medium-term programs; this could provide a pillar of stability for private sector expectations, strengthening demand. 50. On pensions, further steps will be needed to contain the future increase in expenditure and the pension funds’ imbalances. Decisive action needs to be taken quickly in order to secure the sustainability of the system and alleviate inter- and intra-generational inequities. This should include measures to accelerate the increase in the effective retirement age and, more generally, limit the effects of aging on the employment-population ratio. Absent such ’ steps, uncertainty about levels of future disposable income is also contributing to precautionary saving, and this, combined with uncertainty about the future tax burden, is dampening consumption and investment. 51. Privatization, product market deregulation, and public sector reform have each an important role to play in strengthening the growth process. Despite considerable progress in recent years, most recently the partial liberalization of the electricity sector in early 1999, further steps are needed in each of these areas. These should include (i) further privatization in the energy sector, completion of the state’s divestiture in banks, and liquidation of IRI by mid-2000; (ii) a tight restriction on controlling interests of foundations in the banking sector in the pending implementing regulation, which would further strengthen the sector in a more competitive euro-area environment; (iii) allowing a market-based consolidation of the banking sector, with public intervention limited to enforcing prudential regulations and transparency; and (iv) a rapid deregulation of the gas market, which would introduce effective competition. With part of the reform agenda defined in a multilateral context, including at the EU and World Trade Organization, Italy is urged to advocate Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - ambitious market reforms in these fora. With respect to public sector reform, recent legal changes under the so-called Bassanini laws could lead to significant improvements in the quality and efficacy of government services. It is now imperative that the changes in the legal framework be quickly translated into concrete actions. 52. The wide gulf between the economic performance of the North and South remains a major policy challenge. Recent initiatives, especially under thepatti territoriali, are improving the transparency of the decision process for regional support programs; strengthening competition for public Curds; and enhancing local responsibilities and “ownership” of projects. A long history of unsuccessful support programs underscores, however, the enormous challenges facing the South. Successfully addressing these challenges requires an integrated policy strategy, including further steps to improve governance; a regional fiscal reform that strengthens regional accountability; and adequate infrastructure investment. Moreover, the central imperative for a durable and sharp decline in unemployment in the formal economy is that relative wages reflect relative productivity levels (including all relevant cost components of operating a business in the South). Allowances for larger regional wage differentiation should be incorporated into future labor market agreements, particularly at the entry level into the labor market. The government could also provide an added incentive in this regard by moving to limit regional support programs to those cases where an extensive derogation from nationally mandated minimum wages has been agreed for the most disadvantaged segments of the labor market. Greater wage differentiation would.strengthen the incentives for job creation in the South and could have the additional benefit of bringing part of the informal economy into the open. 53. In other areas of labor. market reform, some earlier initiatives to enhance flexibility, including through part-time and fixed-term employment, are beginning to yield results. On the other hand, concerns remain about high dismissal costs; and also about possible adverse implications for labor costs of a legislated 3 5-hour week, especially for small and medium-size firms, and the risk that it would contribute to the growth of the underground economy. The assurance not to press ahead with a legislated 35-hour week is very welcome. To tackle youth unemployment, further steps are needed to increase the scope and quality of job training and apprenticeship programs. The steps to enhance labor market flexibility should be accompanied by the introduction of a broad-based unemployment insurance system. In its design care needs to be taken to set adequate incentives for employment-including strict limits on the duration of unemployment insurance support-while providing a true safety net for the unemployed through adequately generous support payments. Moreover, the recently introduced reddito minim0 d’inserimento, a social assistance program targeted at the very poor, could in time become an important element of a more rational welfare system, provided that it remains limited to the intended target group, 54. Italy provides its core economic data to the Fund in a comprehensive fashion and data quality and timeliness are generally adequate for effective surveillance.

The staff regrets that offkial development assistance (ODA) has declined further to 0.1 percent of GNP in 1997, the second lowest ratio among DAC member countries. The authorities are urged to complement their commendable support for the international community-as exemplified by assistance to refugees from the Kosovo crisis and also the recent consent to the quota increase and the acceptance of the Fourth Amendment of the Articles-by increasing ODA toward the UN-recommended target of 0.7 percent of GNP. 56.

Economic data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see attached table) and Italy has cooperated fully with the Fund in providing monetary, international reserves, and selected other financial statistics related to its membership in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

(The ECB is now acting to facilitate compliance of EMU countries with the SDDS requirement for an advance release calendar-Italy will be subject to whatever arrangements are established between the Fund and the ECB.) Despite some improvements, transparency of fiscal data still compares unfavorably to most advanced economies and more timely data on general government operations would help surveillance.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Italy On June 3, 1999, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Italy.1 Background Economic activity remained weak in 1998, and real GDP increased by only 1.4 percent. In part, . this reflected a marked deterioration in the external environment-in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, Italy’s trade balance with the region deteriorated more than that of its European partners, reflecting to some extent differences in the commodity structure. Domestic demand weakened toward the end of the year, as investment declined and household consumption stagnated. Unemployment remained unchanged from the previous year’s peak of 12.3 percent and large regional disparities continued, with the unemployment rate in the South well above 20 percent. The inflation differential between Italy and the euro area widened during 1998, and consumer price inflation, at 2.0 percent (harmonized basis), was 1 percentage point above the euro area average. The differential narrowed significantly in early 1999, as wage growth rates converged to euro-area levels. The Bank of Italy maintained a relatively tight monetary stance during most of 1998, with a view to minimizing the risks of financial turbulence in the run up to EMU. However, monetary conditions eased considerably toward the end of 1998 and in early 1999, associated with entry into monetary union and the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) decision to reduce interest rates in April. ‘Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial iirformation, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

Lower-than- budgeted interest payments compensated for the deterioration in the primary balance, which reflected on the revenue side the underperformance of the newly introduced regional tax on firms’ value added (IRAP), and on the expenditure side overruns on health and capital spending. Gross government debt declined from 122.3 percent of GDP to 118.7 percent in 1998. in 1999, real GDP is expected to grow by 1% percent. This assumes that activity will strengthen considerably in the latter part of the year, reflecting the expected pickup in external demand and the lagged impact of the earlier easing in monetary conditions. There are, however, considerable downside risks to this growth forecast: external demand may not accelerate as envisaged; consumer demand could decelerate, especially if unemployment were to rise; and economic activity, including tourism, could also suffer should the crisis in Kosovo be prolonged. The outlook for the medium term indicates annual real GDP growth of around 2% percent during 2000-04; but growth prospects hinge crucially on progress in addressing persistent structural rigidities, notably the high tax burden and labor market rigidities, and the need for further product market deregulation and public sector reform. Some reforms have already been initiated, including several steps to increase flexibility in the labor market, which are beginning to bear fruit and contributed to an increase in employment in 1998. And schemes to stimulate investment and employment in depressed areas, notably in the South, have been strengthened. The 1999 budget targeted a deficit for the general government of 2.0 percent of GDP, predicate.d on real GDP growth of 2.5 percent. More recently, the authorities have revised their estimate upward to 2.4 percent of GDP, reflecting the impact of weaker growth and noncyclical slippages, partially offset by lower-than-originally-budgeted interest payments.
