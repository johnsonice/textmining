Introduction The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions with Sierra Leone, together with negotiations on an economic program to be supported by the second annual ESAF arrangement, were completed in October 1995. I/ 2/ The Fund staff mission met with the Head of State, Captain Strasser; the Secretary of State for Finance, Dr. Karimu; the Governor of the Bank of Sierra Leone, Mr. Swaray; and other senior officials and representatives of the private sector. In the attached letter dated November 17, 1995, and the accompanying memorandum on economic and financial policies, the Government of Sierra Leone has set out its economic program for the period 1996-98 (Appendix I). In support of this program, and in light of Sierra Leone's financing needs, the Government requests a second annual ESAF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 23.2 million (30.1 percent of quota). This would represent an augmentation of access under the second annual arrangement of SDR 13.1 million (17.0 percent of quota), of which approximately 60 percent would be made available upon Board approval of the arrangement. Access under the third annual arrangement would remain at SDR 10.1 million (13.1 percent of quota). The proposed phasing of disbursements for the remainder of the ESAF period is indicated in Table 1. As of end-October 1995, Sierra Leone's outstanding use of Fund credit amounted to SDR 99.1 million (128.3 percent of quota). If all remaining disbursements under the ESAF arrangement are made, and taking into account the repayments falling due, Sierra Leone's use of Fund resources would total SDR 128.9 million (167.0 percent of quota) at end-1997. Sierra Leone's economic program is being implemented in the context of a medium-term strategy, which has been formulated by the Government in close collaboration with the staffs of the Fund and the Bank, and which is described in an updated policy framework paper (PFP). The PFP was circulated to Executive Directors to the Executive Board of the World Bank concurrently with this report. IJ This was the culmination of several rounds of discussions with the authorities. The dates of these contacts, and the staff representatives involved, are indicated in Appendix II. This report was prepared by a staff team consisting of Mr. Nowak (head-AFR), Mr. Cowen (AFR), Mr. Ehrbeck (AFR), and Mr. Tsaveas (PDR). 2J Parallel structural adjustment facility (SAF) and enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) arrangements were approved by the Executive Board on March 28, 1994 in respective amounts of SDR 27.0 million (35.0 percent of quota) and SDR 88.8 million (115.0 percent of quota). See EBS/94/35 (3/l/94), Sup. 1, (3/24/94), and Sup. 2 (3/28/94). A total of SDR 90.5 million has been drawn to date under these arrangements.

Sierra Leone is on the standard 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations. Sierra Leone's relations with the Fund and World Bank are summarized in Appendixes II and III, respectively. An analysis of Sierra Leone's debt sustainability is presented in Appendix IV. The quality of Sierra Leone's macroeconomic database has improved considerably in recent years, in large part because of the receipt of technical assistance (Appendix VI). For purposes of program monitoring, reliable data on key monetary aggregates, the exchange rate, and official external reserves are provided to the Fund on at least a weekly basis. Fiscal &ta are provided monthly with a lag of four to six weeks. However, certain problems in timeliness and quality persist with regard to the national accounts and certain balance of payments statistics. II. Recent Economic Performance In concluding the last Article IV consultation on March 23, 1994, Directors commended Sierra Leone on the successful conclusion of its rights accumulation program and on the strides that had been taken to stabilize the economy, despite adverse external and1 domestic circumstances. Directors noted, however, that economic activity had shown little sign of. recovery and therefore welcomed the continuation alf Sierra Leone's stabilization and structural adjustment efforts in the context of an economic program for 1994-96 supported by an ESAF arrangement. They also remarked that political uncertainties in Liberia and the rebel conflict in Sierra Leone would continue to pose risks to the program. The Executive Board conducted the midterm review under the first annual ESAF arrangement on December 21, 1994. Shortly thereafter, rebel forces in Sierra Leone mounted a series of damaging attacks on key economic installations, which severely set back the Government's adjustment efforts. Production of rutile and bauxite was halted, and foreign exchange receipts and fiscal revenues fell drastically. JJ Subsequently, diamond mining operations were also disrupted by rebel activity. Business and consumer confidence in Sierra Leone was badly shaken by these events, and the repercussions for economic activity beyond the mineral sector have been considerable; the staff estimates that real GDP will contract by at least 10 percent in 1995 (Table 2). The drop in output would have been consider- ably greater but for the relatively strong performance by the agricultural sector, partly as a result of favorable rains. JJ Rutile and bauxite together account for 60 percent of Sierra Leone's officially recorded exports and contribute some 2 percent of GDP to govern- ment revenues.

Pending an improvement in security conditions, the Government adopted a "holding" program in February 1995 aimed at sustaining the momentum of economic reform and preserving the stabilization gains achieved over the previous three years. The holding program was implemented against the background of a virtual cessation of mining sector revenues, a sharp drop in imports and industrial production, and mounting pressures on the armed forces to bring the rebel war to a conclusion. Remedial action to contain the deterioration in the public finances included cuts in outlays on goods and services and capital projects. Economies were also made in the military budget to reduce overruns that had taken place. As a consequence, the overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants, increased in 1994/95 by only 1 percent of GDP (July-June), to 7.3 percent (Tables 5 and 6). This nevertheless represented considerable slippage from the original program target for 1994/95 of 5.2 percent of GDP. The Bank of Sierra Leone has been able to maintain a tight rein on money supply growth during 1995 (Table 7). This task was aided by the extremely depressed state of private sector credit demand, but open market operations were also stepped up, and treasury bill rates rose from 8 percent at the end of December 1994 to 23 percent in mid-October (Table 8). As a result, broad money growth was held down to 11 percent, at an annualized rate, during the first nine months of 1995. u However, cost-push pressures emanating from a marked depreciation of the leone and"a sharp increase in imported rice prices have contributed to disappointing inflation performance. u During the 12-month period through October, the consumer price index rose by 34 percent, although when adjusted to exclude cereal prices, the annual rate of inflation was 23 percent in the same period. 1/ The Bank of Sierra Leone has experienced a serious drain of its foreign exchange reserves, primarily as a result of the interruption to mineral exports (Table 9). After reaching a relatively healthy position of US$41 million (3.1 months of imports) at end-1994, foreign exchange reserves plummeted to US$lO million (or 0.9 month of imports) at the end of October. Despite these pressures, Sierra Leone has remained current in all its maturing external debt obligations, except those to commercial creditors, pendIng conclusion of an arrears clearance exercise. L/ The growth rate indicated is a seasonally adjusted rate based on staff calculations. The seasonally unadjusted rate of growth of broad money was only 5 percent. 2/. The leone depreciated by about 35 percent between end-May and mid-October, while rice prices in domestic currency terms have more than doubled since the beginning of the year. y The monthly rates of inflation slowed sharply in September and October to 8 percent, at an annualized rate.

By the end of September 1995, the size of the civil service (excluding military and police personnel) had been reduced by some 12 percent from the end-1994 level, bringing the cumulative cut in the labor force to 50 percent since mid-1991, when the retrenchment program was initiated. A number of public entities have been sold, including the oil refinery and the cement company, while divestiture of the national petroleum company will be completed shortly, once certain legal complications are resolved. The fisheries licensing system has been overhauled, and surveillance of Sierra Leone's fisheries is being conducted by the navy until a World Bank-supported effort: to upgrade the surveillance apparatus is completed. III. Economic ProPram for 1996-98 1. Medium-term framework While the security situation remains fragile, there have been a number of positive developments in the rebel conflict over the past several months. The armed forces have secured the rutile and bauxite mining installations, and the companies involved are expected to recommence production in mid-1996, once damage to infrastructure has been repaired. IJ The main diamond mining area has also been secured by the military, and all the country's major cities are now under government control. The Government has been assisted in its campaign against the rebels by external military support. 2/ The Government has expressed its willingness to conduct peace talks with the rebels, who have recently shown signs that they may be agreeable to this. In the meantime, the Government has reaffirmed its intention of holding multiparty elections, which are now planned for February 1996. The program for 1996-98 has been formulated on the expectation of a continued improvement in the security situation. It incorporates stabilization policies aimed at establishing a low-inflation financial environment that will set the stage for a recovery in private sector activity and contribute to a more viable external position. Structural policies will be directed at removing impediments to growth and improving the allocation of resources, including human capital. The key objectives of the program are as follows: 0 To raise real GDP growth to 5 percent and 7 percent in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Thereafter, economic growth is expected to stabilize JJ In the case of the rutile company, financing also has to be arranged to cover the cost of repairs and outlays associated with a large investment program. 2/ This support has consisted of troops of the countries in the region and hired military personnel.

This would enable Sierra Leone to maintain a relatively stable exchange rate and a strong external competitive position. l To cut the overall government budget deficit to 6.3 percent of GDP in 1995/96, and further to 3.6 percent of GDP in 1998. u Over this period, the program will seek to raise the private savings ratio by 11 percentage points. The mobilization of government and private savings will generate the additional resources needed to raise private investment, while reducing dependence on foreign savings. 0 To reconstitute Sierra Leone's foreign exchange reserves to the equivalent of around four months of imports by end-1998, which would provide a cushion against unforseen adverse shocks. 2. Fiscal policy The revised medium-term program calls for a faster pace of fiscal adjustment over the coming three-year period in order to make up the ground lost as a result of the disruption to mining activities. The underlying medium-term fiscal strategy, however, remains the same as that set out in the original program. Deficit-reduction measures will be supported by structural changes in the budget designed to place greater reliance on indirect sources of tax revenue, rather than income-based taxes. To this end, the Government is assessing, with technical assistance from the Fund, the feasibility of introducing a value-added tax. It also intends to lower the corporate income tax rate from 45 percent to 40 percent in April 1996 and undertake compensatory action in the area of expenditure taxes. Over the medium term, the peace dividend that should result from an easing of the rebel conflict will enable considerable budgetary resources to be used to fund additional development outlays and rehabilitation of the country's economic and social infrastructure. The fiscal program for 1995/96 is based on the expectation that virtually no revenue will be forthcoming from the mining sector. More- over, in light of the highly fragile state of the economy, no new major revenue-enhancing Initiatives are planned for 1995/96, although an improvement in import duty collections is expected. 2/ The bulk of the u From 1996 the budget will be presented on a calendar, rather than a July-June, basis. 2/ This projected increase in import duties reflects the real deprecia- tion of the leone that has occurred so far this fiscal year and an antici- pated pickup in import volumes, as the mining companies and businesses restock. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public_ 6 . . fiscal adjustment envisaged, therefore, will need to be borne by expendi- tures, particularly in the area of defense. The Government has identified economies that can be made in the purchase of military hardware that will enable defense spending to be cut by 0.7 percent of GDP in 1995/96, and it is confident that the economies can, and will, be realized. To help in this effort, donor assistance is being sought to recruit an advisor in the procurement of military equipment. In addition, the size of the army is to be reduced in accordance with a strategy of reshaping the army into small and well-disciplined fighting units. Other important features of the fiscal program for 1995/96 include: 0 Introduction on January 1, 1996 of a "clean wages" policy, which will tax in-kind benefits on the same basis as cash income. Transfer of the freight levy to the budget, with no earmarking of the pzoceeds. I/ 0 An increase in premium petrol prices on November 10, 1995 that raised the effective rate of excise duty from 80 percent to 112 per- cent. 1/ 0 A cap on the increase in the civil service emoluments bill (includ- ing the rice supplement} of 29 percent, implying a small real decline during 1995/96. jJ 0 A reduction of 16 percent in the amount of rice paid in kind to certain public employees (army, police, and prison personnel) as from January 1, 1996, and monetization of this benefit over a two-year period. 0 Lower development spending, from 1994/95, primarily as a result of constraints imposed by the security situation. There is at present some uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the costs associated with the organization of the elections. Because of this, and to avoid the election process being impeded by fiscal constraints, any direct funding of the elections by the Government will be recorded separately from domestic financing of the budget, which is a program performance criterion. Such funding would, however, be captured by the 1/ Previously, proceeds from the freight levy, which is a tax on the use of Sierra Leone's port facilities, did not pass through the budget and were not accounted for in a transparent manner. 2/ Effective tax rates on petroleum products had declined from mid-1995 because the sharp depreciation of the leone was not passed through to pump prices; lower consumption also served to reduce revenues. 2/ The projected average inflation rate for 1995/96 is 32 percent.

In any event, it is envisaged that virtually all of the funding required will be sought from donors, and a meeting for this purpose will be convened in New York on November 30, 1995. 3. Monetarv ~olicv To achieve the program's inflation targets, the Bank of Sierra Leone will hold the growth of broad money down to 8 percent a year during the program period. Ample resources will be available to fund a recovery in private sector activity. Open market operations, which are effected through weekly treasury bill auctions, will continue to be the primary instrument of monetary management, and interest rates will be allowed to adjust to the levels necessary to meet the central bank's monetary targets. lJ Statutory liquid asset requirements will be lowered over time to levels required for prudential purposes only. Directives governing commercial bank lending practices were issued by the Bank of Sierra Leone in May 1994 in order to address serious difficulties experienced by the banks as a result of undercapitalization and poor loan recovery records. While capital adequacy ratios have since improved considerably, the lending portfolios of the banks remain contaminated by bad debts, and the Bank of Sierra Leone intends to undertake a restructuring program for the commercial banks that involves the provision of interest-free loans to be used for the purchase of government debt at market-related rates. Allowance has been made in the government budget for the additional interest cost associated with this operation. 2J. Meridien Bank has been sold and recapitalized. 4. Structural and social Policies The thrust of Sierra Leone's structural reform strategy is set out in the updated PFP. The key actions to be taken during 1996 are as follows: 0 In order to improve the implementation capacity of the civil service, savings realized from further cuts in the size of the civil service will be used to fund increases in pay for managerial and supervisory staff, for whom present remuneration rates are highly uncompetitive. lJ The auction system for official debt was expanded in March 1995 to include one-year treasury bonds, thereby allowing the term structure of interest rates to respond to market forces. 2J The cost is projected at less than 0.2 percent of GDP, at an annual rate, .which is based on the assumption that about 40 percent of the banks' loans are nonrecoverable and on the principle that the banks' shareholders will share 25 percent of the losses. The modalities involved in the restructuring will be discussed during a joint Fund and Bank staff visit to Freetown in early December 1995.

Thereafter, petroleum taxes will be based on an ad valorem rate. 0 Fisheries surveillance will be contracted out to the private sector. 0 The Government will ensure that satisfactory security is provided in the mining areas. The role of the military in these areas will be confined to security only. 0 Government outlays in the social sectors will be raised by 5 percent per annum in real terms; observance of spending floors will constitute conditions for the release of World Bank funds. 0 Improvements in the judicial system will be made by reviving the Law Reform Commission and liberalizing laws governing the establishment, operation, and winding up of business enterprises. Because of the nature of alluvial diamond mining, it is difficult to police the trade in diamonds and bring these activities within the tax net. To encourage the export of diamonds through official channels, taxes have already been lowered to a total 2.5 percent of export value, diamonds may be purchased entirely in foreign exchange, and all surrender requirements have been abolished. Despite this, the staff estimates that only some lo-15 percent of diamonds exported from Sierra Leone are officially recorded. 2/ The Government is of the view that, while it would welcome a higher proportion of diamonds traded legally, it is the repatriation of proceeds from the sale of all diamonds, both legal and illegal, that is of the utmost importance. This can only be achieved by establishing a stable economic and political environment, which is an objective that lies at the core of the Government's structural adjustment program. Sierra Leone also possesses rich kimberlite diamond deposits; the concession to exploit u Relatively few nonutility public enterprises remain in operation, and all of these are small. They include the Sierra Leone State Lottery, Wellington Distilleries, Forest Industries, the National Insurance Company, the Sierra Leone National Shipping Company, and the Sierra Leone Trading Corporation. 2/ This estimate is based upon trade data reported by the major diamond- cutting countries in Europe.

External sector oolicies and financing a. ExchanPe and trade oolicies The Bank of Sierra Leone will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy during the ESAF period, and will be guided in its purchases and sales of foreign exchange by its international reserve targets. Despite recent balance of payments pressures, the Government remains committed to maintaining a liberal exchange regime and achieving the program's balance of payments targets without recourse to the imposition of exchange controls. To demonstrate this commitment, the Government intends to accept the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement by the end of 1995. Although quantitative limits apply on allocations of foreign exchange for travel, health, and education, they are indicative only and all bona fide requests in excess of these limits are freely provided without undue delay. Sierra Leone still maintains restrictions that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII in the form of external payments arrears owed to creditors who did not participate in a recent commercial debt buy-back operation. In order to clear these remaining arrears, the Government is planning another buy-back operation, which will probably take place in 1996 and be financed from Sierra Leone's own resources. In addition, foreign exchange approval for certain current payments is conditional upon furnishing a tax clearance certificate, a requirement that gives rise to an exchange restriction. Steps are being taken to repeal the tax legislation that requires the tax certificate. The Bank of Sierra Leone will consider the elimination of all capital controls once it has rebuilt its foreign exchange position to a more comfortable level. Sierra Leone undertook a major overhaul and streamlining of its external tariff system in 1994, and no further changes are envisaged at this time. In May 1995 the last remaining export taxes, which applied to coffee, cocoa, and ginger, were removed. b. Balance of navments outlook and debt sustainabilitv Sierra Leone's medium-term balance of payments prospects, and overall economic prospects more generally, are very much dependent on developments on the security front. The staff has developed, in conjunction with Bank staff and the Sierra Leonean authorities, a baseline balance of payments scenario that has been formulated on the expectation of continued improvement in security conditions. Under this scenario, production of rutile and bauxite will resume in mid-1996 and display moderately strong I/ Because kimberlite diamonds are deep mined, the extraction and export of kimberlite is more readily subject to Sierra Leone's laws and regulations than in the case of alluvial diamonds.

Kimberlite mining is expected to reach full production by 1999. u Sierra Leone also has significant offshore diamond deposits, the commercial viability of which is currently being assessed by private mining interests; no provision has been made in the balance of payments projections for the exploitation of these deposits. Oil consumption is expected to drop by about one fourth in 1997, once a major hydroelectric project, which is capable of supplying virtually all of Sierra Leone's electricity requirements!, comes on stream. Nonrice imports are expected to grow at a slightly higher rate than GDP over the medium term, following a sharp rebound in 1996-97 as a result of large import requirements of the mining sector and the need for restocking by businesses. On the basis of the net effect of these factors, the trade deficit is projected to narrow sharply in 1996-97 and continue to improve until the early part of the next decade. The improvement in the current account balance will be much less marked, however, since dividend and profit remittances are likely to rise strongly as mining operations return to normal. Sierra Leone's external debt strategy is being executed on two fronts. First, the authorities are intent on normalizing relations with external creditors. To this end, Sierra Leone has remained current in all obliga- tions to multilateral and official bilateral creditors, and is in full compliance with all rescheduling agreements. It also successfully concluded a buy-back operation of its commercial debt in July 1995, with funding from the World Bank and donors and with the use of its own resources. a All arrears that remain to multilateral creditors, which amount to US$22 million, will be cleared by mid-1996. w The second element of Sierra Leone's debt strategy involves an easing in the debt service burden by means of a progressive reduction in real resource requirements through adjustment, which will permit reduced dependence on external borrowing. Any new borrowing will be undertaken strictly on concessional terms. On the basis of projected resource requirements and financing avail- ability, a cumulative external financing gap of some US$90 million is expected for 1996-98 (Table 10). This gap could be filled by debt relief from the Paris Club and other bilateral and commercial creditors (approxi- mately US$43 million in debt payments will be eligible for relief), addttional donor support in the context of a Consultative Group meeting u Technical studies indicate a kimberlite output potentLa1 of at least US$SO million at today's prices, but in the interest of caution, the staff projections have assumed a maximum production level of US$25 million. u. This operation cleared about 80 percent of Sierra Leone's commercial debt through a combination of cash payments and discounts from the credi- tors. Further details are contained in Appendix IV. 1/ These creditors are the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the Islamic Development Bank, and the OPEC Fund.

Both liquidity and solvency indicators of debt sustainability indicate that, while Sierra Leone's debt burden is extremely onerous at present, it should become much more manageable within three to four years' time. lJ The scheduled debt service ratio is projected to decline from 80 percent in 1995 to 15 percent by 1998, although it will rebound slightly, to about 20 percent, during 1999-2001 when the bulk of the ESAF repayments fall due. The net present value of debt payments as a ratio of exports of goods and services is expected to fall below 200 percent in 1998. This improvement in Sierra Leone's debt-servicing capacity primarily reflects the impact of the adjustment program and is contingent upon the assumptions made regarding the security outlook and the resumption of mining activities. The staff has carried out a number of sensitivity tests to assess the impact of changes in underlying program assumptions on Sierra Leone's foreign reserve position and debt-servicing capacity (Tables 11 and 12). Certain of the scenarios (such as those dealing with lower rutile and bauxite exports) may be interpreted as measuring the sensitivity of Sierra Leone's balance of payments to adverse developments in the security situation. Since the buildup of reserves in the baseline scenario is reasonably strong, the sensitivity tests indicate that Sierra Leone could sustain moderate adverse shocks and still enjoy some reserve accumulation. The results nonetheless point to the need for corrective policy action, such as further fiscal adjustment, in order to ensure that economic'growth performance is sustained in the event that the baseline scenario does not unfold as anticipated. In summary, while noting the uncertainties associated with the security situation and the margins of error inherent in forecasting so far into the future, the long-term balance of payments outlook appears relatively favorable. With strong policy implementation, the debt service burden should shrink to manageable proportions well before the end of the decade, and Sierra Leone should be able to fulfil1 its obligations to the Fund without major difficulties (Table 13).

Structural performance criteria and benchmarks relate to: (a) the retail pricing of petroleum products; (b) civil service retrenchment; and (c) the government wage bill (Table 15). Performance criteria will apply at end-March 1996. Benchmarks will apply at end-December 1995 and end-June 1996, and indicative benchmarks for end- September and end-December 1996. In addition, there will be a midterm review under the second annual ESAF arrangement, to be completed no later than June 30, 1996. v. Staff Appraisal For several years now, economic reform in Sierra Leone has taken place against the background of a serious rebel conflict, which has dislocated economic activity and imposed severe strains on the country's social fabric. In spite of this, however, the Government has pressed on with its adjustment program and accomplished considerable progress in stabilizing and restruc- turing the economy. The rebel attacks on Sierra Leone's major mining installations that took place at the very end of 1994 and into 1995 posed a particularly damaging setback to the economic reform process, depriving the country of some 60 percent of its exports and costing the Government the equivalent of 2 percent of GDP in lost fiscal revenues. In response to these developments, the Government adopted a "holding" program aimed at limiting the adverse impact on the budget, so that policy implementation could be brought quickly back on track once the security situation improved. Unavoidably, however, Sierra Leone's foreign exchange reserves were run down to uncomfortably low levels, and the exchange rate was subject to acute downward pressure. The inflationary impact of the currency depreciation was compounded by large increases in imported rice prices. With recent gains on the security .front and the prospect of a recovery in mineral production, the staff believes that there is now a basis for a resumption of Fund financial support for Sierra Leone's adjustment efforts, which have been cast in the context of a comprehensive medium-term frame- work. This staff is, in particular, impressed with the degree of fiscal adjustment contemplated (around 2 percent of GDP, after adjustment for the loss of mining revenues). Significant downside risks persist, however, and developments in certain critical areas will need to be monitored with the, utmost vigilance. First, and most notably, the rebel conflict continues to pose a major threat to the Government's ability to effectively carry out the stabilization program. The staff would therefore urge the Government to fulfil1 its commitment to undertake further organizational and administra- tive steps to improve both the strategic and cost effectiveness of its military operations. It will be difficult for Sierra Leone to enjoy significant per capita income growth, or make substantive inroads into alleviating its pressing social problems, until the security situation has been brought fully under control.

In addition to developments on the security front, this timing will depend on certain other factors, such as international market conditions for the minerals and, in the case of rutile, securing the financing necessary to fund a large-scale investment project and the cost of repairs to infra- structure. Delays in the timing envisaged, or slippages in any other area of program implementation, would require offsetting fiscal action, which would take the form of further adjustments in petroleum taxes, cuts in the rice supplement, or additional savings in recurrent spending. Sierra Leone's capacity to effectively implement the program is conditional upon the presence of a well-trained and motivated civil service. In light of overall fiscal constraints, increases in pay for managerial staff from their present highly uncompetitive levels can only be funded from savings realized from the retrenchment program; successful execution of this program is therefore essential. The Government has undertaken to hold multiparty elections in February 1996, and the economLc program will help provide the successor government with a strong strategy and framework for economic reform. Sierra Leonean citizens and the international diplomatic community have been involved in the planning of the elections with the aim of ensuring as broad a represen- tation of the population as possible, Establishing stable and democratic civilian rule will strengthen the Government's hand in its efforts to successfully prosecute the rebel war and contribute to the restoration of consumer and investor confidence. It should also help facilitate broader financial support among the donor community for Sierra Leone's adjustment efforts. The Government has indicated that it intends to make a renewed effort in 1996 to clear the external payments arrears that remained outstanding following conclusion of a recent debt buy-back operation. Moreover, it intends to repeal legislation that requires a tax clearance certificate to be furnished for certain current account payments. In light of these considerations, the staff recommends that approval for the retention of the exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII be extended until mid-June 1996. The staff welcomes Sierra Leone's intention to accept by the end of 1995 the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. Sierra Leone is presently facing a very serious shortfall in foreign exchange earnings, which threatens to derail the momentum of economic reform. Lost revenues from rutile and bauxite, net of related import and service payments, amount to US$25 million in 1995, while higher rice prices have raised the annual import bill by over US$lO million. In response to the gravity of the situation, the Government is endeavoring to mobilize additional concessional resources, and it has requested that access under the second annual ESAF arrangement be augmented by SDR 13.1 million (17.0 percent of quota). The staff considers the shortfall to be primarily Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 14 - temporary in nature, pending the resumption of rutile and bauxite production in mid-1996 and an anticipated softening in international rice prices.. In view of this, and on the basis of Sierra Leone's immediate financing requirements, its economic track record, and the strength of its adjustment pros-, the staff is of the view that the increase in access requested is warranted, notwithstandIng the considerable uncertainties regarding the security situation. There would still remain a relatively modest financing gap for 1996, which could be filled by debt relief from the Paris Club creditors and by additional donor support, in the context of the Consultative Group; the augmentation of access under the ESAF should help mobilize these donor funds. The staff's debt sustainability analysis suggests that Sierra Leone should be able to discharge its obligations to the Fund without major difficulties through the end of the ESAF repayment period. The staff believes that Sierra Leone's current macroeconomic database provides an adequate basis upon which to monitor economic performance under the program. In the areas where weakness persist, notably the national and balance of payments statistics, remedial action is being taken by the authorities with technical assistance support. It is proposed that Sierra Leone remain on the standard 12-month cycle. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 15 - VI. Proposed Decisions The following draft decisions are proposed for adoption by the Executive Board: A. Sierra Leone: 1995 Consultation 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Sierra Leone's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a) in light of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone conducted under Decision No. 5392- (77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Sierra Leone maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) in the form of (i) limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the payment of external debt obligations, as evidenced by some external payments arrears, and (ii) tax clearance certificates required for payments and transfers for certain types of current international transactions. In view of Sierra Leone's intention to eliminate these exchange restrictions, the Fund grants approval of the retention of these measures until June 30, 1996, or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation, whichever is earlier. B. Sierra Leone: Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility - Reauest for Second Annual Arrangement 1. The Government of Sierra Leone has requested: (a) the second annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility, and (b) that the amount for the second annual arrangement be increased to the equivalent of SDR 23.236 million.

The objectives of Sierra Leone's three-year program of economic and financial adjustment are set out in the updated policy framework paper for the period 1995-98, which has been prepared in close collaboration with the staffs of the Fund and World Bank. 2. The attached memorandum on the economic and financial policies of Sierra Leone, based on the PFP referred to above, presents the Government's economic policy intentions and quantitative targets for 1996. In support of these objectives and policies, the Government of Sierra Leone hereby requests the second annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 23.2 million (30.1 percent of quota). This would include an augmentation of access of SDR 13.1 million (17.0 percent of quota) under the second annual arrangement, which has proven necessary in light of the magnitude and nature of Sierra Leone's balance of payments needs. 3. The Government of Sierra Leone remains fully committed to its three-year program of economic and financial adjustment set out in its policy framework paper for the period 1995-98. Despite continued adverse conditions, economic performance and policy implementation remain broadly on track. 4. The Government of Sierra Leone will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program. 5. The Government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become necessary for this purpose. During the period of the second annual ESAF arrangement, the Government will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at the initiative of the Government or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation. Moreover, after the period of the second annual arrangement, and while Sierra Leone has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund arising from loans made under that arrangement, the Government will consult with the Fund from time to time, at the initiative of the Government or whenever the Managing Director requests consultation on Sierra Leone's economic and financial policies.

Introduction and Recent Economic Performance 1. This memorandum provides a progress report on Sierra Leone's economic performance since the midterm review under the first annual arrangement of the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). It also sets out the Government's policy objectives for 1996 and presents financial and struc- tural performance criteria and benchmarks intended to guide and monitor policy implementation. 2. The Government's economic program for 1994 was cast in a medium-term framework and formulated on the expectation of a major improvement in the security situation. In the event, unfortunately, hostilities intensified throughout the country and, in December 1994 and January 1995, rebels staged attacks on strategic economic installations, most notably the bauxite and rutile mines. The subsequent closure of these mines involved significant losses of fiscal revenue and foreign exchange earnings; the insurgency also precipitated shortfalls in donor flows. I/ Diamond mining was also disrupted by rebel attacks. These developments rendered the targets set out in the ESAF arrangement unattainable and the Government adopted, with assistance from Fund and World Bank staff, a "holding program"., which was formulated with a view to containing the adverse impact of the deterioration in the security situation. 3. As a result of the closure of the mines, sluggish import demand, and overruns in military spending, the overall government budget deficit (excluding grants) for 1994/95 (July-June) widened to 7.3 percent,of GDP, compared with the program target of 5.2 percent and an outturn in 1993/94 of 6.3 percent of GDP. Monetary growth, however, has remained essentially on target, largely because of slack demand for private sector credit and a step up in open market operations by the central bank. Inflation performance nevertheless has been badly affected by various cost-push factors; reflecting the foreign exchange shortage, the exchange rate depreciated by around 35 percent between end-May and mid-October 1995, while food prices jumped, following sharp increases in the cost of cereal imports. As a result, the consumer price index rose by 30 percent at an annual rate in September 1995, although the monthly increase was only 6 percent at an annualized rate. The Bank of Sierra Leone's foreign exchange reserves have 1/ During the initial attacks on the rutile and bauxite mines, the rebels took several key expatriate management personnel hostage, which subsequently proved a major obstacle in mobilizing donor support.

Fisheries surveillance operations have been conducted by the naval wing of the Sierra Leonean armed forces, and this arrangement has worked reasonably well, enabling the sector to contribute to revenue for the first time in many years. The pace of civil service retrenchment has been accelerated and the size of the civil service (excluding military and police) is now one-half of its level in mid-1991, when the retrenchment program began. With regard to public enterprise reform, the oil refinery, cement company and Bennimix Food Company have been sold, while the divestiture of Sierra Leone National Petroleum Company is near completion. II. Policies for 1996 5. There have been a number of positive developments on the security front in recent months. The rebels have been dislodged from the rutile, bauxite, and diamond mining areas, and the country's main road arteries are now open. Diamond mining activities are expected to return to normal early in 1996, while rutile and bauxite production should resume around the middle of the year. The Government has attempted to establish a dialogue with the rebel forces, but is intent in the meantime on moving ahead with multiparty elections that are set for February 1996. 6. The Government is determined to recover from the setbacks it has experienced on the security front and in economic performance during 1995. It intends to ensure that there is no reversal of the stabilization gains achieved since 1992 and will aim to provide a base upon which economic recovery may proceed once the nation returns to democratic rule and the rebel hostilities are concluded. In view of the disruptions to mining activity, however, it has proven necessary to revise the program's economic growth targets for 1995-97. Despite a strong policy stance, real GDP is now projected to decline by 10 percent in 1995, but should recover by 5 percent in 1996 and by 7 percent in 1997, as mining activities return to normal. In light of recent price developments, it has also been necessary to adjust the inflation target for 1995 upwards from 8 percent to 35 percent. Thereafter, inflation is targeted to fall sharply to 10 percent as the rate of deprecia- tion of the leone slows and international rice prices weaken. Sierra Leone urgently needs to replenish its foreign exchange reserves, which it intends to accomplish through maintenance of tight demand management conditions and a flexible exchange rate policy and through the mobilization of external assistance.

The Government recognizes that strict financial discipline is the key to success in the stabilization effort, particularly under current condi- tions when the economy is being buffeted by such severe adverse shocks. The fiscal slippages that occurred last year will therefore necessitate stronger adjustment in 1995/96 than previously envisaged. The Government's 1995/96 budget is being executed against the background of depressed domestic demand conditions and little prospect of any significant revenue from the mining sector. It calls for a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit to 6.3 per- cent of GDP and, to meet this target, the bulk of adjustment will need to fall on expenditures, particularly defense spending. In 1995/96, the Government will aim to reduce total military expenditure, including arrears payments, from 4.6 percent of GDP to 3.9 percent. Economies are to be made in the purchase of military hardware, while the size of the army is to be cut significantly. Other savings will be realized through a reduction in the rice supplement and its monetization over a two-year period. Develop- ment spending will be sharply lower because of the difficulties involved in working on projects in upcountry areas. Expenditures in the social and economic sectors, where spending cuts in the past have led to a deteriora- tion in the quality of services provided, are to be raised in real terms. The Government also intends to clear most of its remaining arrears to parastatals, in large part through an offset against overdue tax liabilities of the parastatals. The Government is seeking donors' assistance to help finance the cost of holding the forthcoming elections. 8. The increase in the civil service wage bill, excluding the rice supplement, for 1995/96 will be capped at 17 percent. However, the present uncompetitive level of government pay scales is impairing the ability of the civil service to effectively carry out the economic recovery program. The Government, therefore, intends to cut the size of the civil service (including military and police) further by around 20 percent between end-May 1995 and end-June 1996; savings from this retrenchment program will be used to fund increases in rates of civil service pay, particularly for managerial and supervisory staff. 9. Revenue measures for 1995/96 include an increase in the effective rate of petroleum taxation in November and introduction of a "clean wages" policy, effective January 1, 1996. u Receipts from the freight levy have been incorporated into the budget and all related revenues now flow through the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In line with the Government's strategy of reducing its dependance on direct taxation, effective April 1996, the rate I/ The "clean wages" policy will tax in-kind benefits and other salary supplements at the same rate as cash income. Although its introduction will be accompanied by an increase in the income tax threshold, this measure is expected to result in a small increase in revenues from personal income taxes.

B. Monetary and financial sector policies 10. The overall stance of monetary policy will continue to be guided b:y the need to meet the program's broad money growth and inflation targets, while ensuring that sufficient bank credit is available to finance the anticipated recovery in private sector activity. In doing so, the Bank of Sierra Leone will continue to exercise monetary control through the use of indirect instruments. Although this strategy has been working well, certain steps to sharpen further the effectiveness of open market operations and foster the development of financial markets are being taken. The auction system for official debt was expanded in March 1995 to include one-year treasury bonds, thereby allowing the term structure of interest rates to respond to market forces. Official debt instruments of varying maturities, in addition to the present three-month treasury bills and one-year bond, will be introduced. In addition, with technical assistance from the Fund, the Bank of Sierra Leone is looking at ways of deepening the secondary market. 11. In early 1994, the Government initiated a comprehensive review of the regulatory framework governing the operation of the financial sector, wl.th a view to clarifying the mandate and independence of the Bank of Sierra Leone, strengthening its supervisory functions, and tightening the prudential requirements for commercial banks. To this end, draft banking legislati.on is being prepared with technical assistance from the Fund and the World Bank. 12. In response to the financial difficulties experienced by some commer- cial banks beginning in late 1993, the Bank of Sierra Leone prepared a program of corrective action to strengthen the banking sector. Remedial diagnostic studies of the commercial banks, aimed at improving their operating efficiency, have revealed shortcomings in management practices and serious under-capitalization. Most commercial banks have now taken steps to restructure themselves in line with the recommendations of these studies and improved their capital adequacy, although loan recovery performance remains weak. The Government intends to undertake a commercial bank restructuring operation, whereby the Bank of Sierra Leone will extend interest-free loans to the commercial banks for the purchase of government debt at market- related yields. In the wake of the closing of Heridien International Bank Limited earlier this year, Meridien BIAO (SL) Ltd. began experiencing financial difficulties; the Bank of Sierra Leone took measures to ensure the continued viability of the bank. In August a newly formed bank (Union Trust Bank) bought Meridien BIAO (SL) Ltd. on an ongoing concern basis. C. External oolicies and the balance of oavments 13. The Bank of Sierra Leone will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy, only intervening in the interbank market to meet its international reserve targets and to maintain orderly market conditions. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 43 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT The Bank continues to encourage greater depth in the foreign exchange market by encouraging the establishment of foreign exchange bureaux (11 are presently in operation) and by maintaining a liberal exchange system. In this connection, while quantitative limits apply on the availability of foreign exchange for travel and other current payments and transfers, approval is readily granted for all bona fide requests in excess of these limits. Some external payments arrears on commercial debt remain following completion of a buy-back operation in July 1995; efforts will be made to clear these arrears through a further buy-back exercise. The Government also intends to repeal legislation by September 1996, which requires a tax clearance certificate to be produced for certain current account payments. Sierra Leone intends to accept the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement in December 1995. In addition, the Bank of Sierra Leone is considering the removal of all restrictions on capital flows once its international reserves have reached more comfortable levels. 14. Sierra Leone expects its foreign exchange position to remain difficult until exports of rutile and bauxite resume in mid-1996. The external current account deficit (including official transfers) is expected to narrow slightly from 15 percent of GDP in 1995 to just under 14 percent in 1996, but over the medium term it should improve markedly as rutile exports respond to planned new investments and as production from a new kimberlite mine comes on stream. 15. Sierra Leone recognizes that the regularization of relations with its external creditors is essential if it is to enjoy access to new flows of external assistance. Considerable efforts have been undertaken to this end, including the clearance of arrears to the Fund in early 1994, the conclusion of a Paris Club agreement in July 1994, and successful completion of the commercial debt buy-back operation. u Furthermore, financial obligations falling due to all official bilateral and multilateral creditors are being discharged on schedule. Arrears amounting to US$22 million still remain outstanding to certain multilateral creditors. u Sierra Leone is seeking to clear these arrears before end-June 1996 through bridge loans and cash payments. As a performance criterion, for the remainder of the program, no new external payments arrears will be accumulated, except on debts to commercial creditors who did not participate in the debt-buy back operation. To ensure that Sierra Leone's debt service burden is kept to manageable proportions, the Government will not contract or guarantee any new medium- or long-term loans on nonconcessional terms. It will also cap its stock of external short-term debt. L/ The debt buy-back, which was funded by IDA, bilateral donors, and Sierra Leone's own resources, reduced the country's outstanding public debt by about US$350 million, or one third of the total. 2/ The creditors are the Arab Bank of Economic Development in Africa, the Islamic Development Bank, and the OPEC Special Fund. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 44 - APPENDIX I ATTACHMENT 16. Sierra Leone is seeking to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves to the equivalent of 1.9 months of imports by end-1996, from 0.9 month at end- Cctober 1995. To assist in this effort, and to help arrest the sharp real depreciation that has occurred in the exchange rate, the Government is requesting an increase in access under the second annual of the ESAF arrangement. The Government is also seeking additional flows of balance of payments assistance, or an acceleration in this assistance, from other members of the international financial community. III. Eroeram Monitoring 17. Performance under the second annual ESAF arrangement would be monitored on the basis of the performance criteria and benchmarks set out in Tables 1 and 2. Performance criteria would apply to end-March 1996, benchmarks to end-December 1995 and end-June 1996, and indicative benchmarks to end- September and end-December 1996. The second disbursement under the second annual ESAF arrangement would be conditional upon observance of the performance criteria at end-March 1996 and completion of the midterm review, which would take place no later than June 30, 1996. 18. The Government has received, and will continue to seek, technical assistance to achieve further improvements in macroeconomic data management to ensure effective program monitoring.

Commercial banks may buy and sell foreign exchange from/to individual customers as well as trade between themselves or with the Bank of Sierra L,eone (BSL) on a freely negotiable basis. The Bank of Sierra Leone fixes an official exchange rate every Friday morning, at the weighted average rate of commercial bank transactions in the previous week, for customs valuation purposes and for official transactions. As of October 31, 1995, the BSL rate was Le 931.0 - US$l. VIII. 1994 Articie IV Consultation Sierra Leone is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation c.ycle. The staff report for the 1994 Article IV consultation (EBS/94/35) was discussed by the Executive Board on March 23, 1994; the following decision was adopted: 1. The Fund takes this decision relating to Sierra Leone's exchange measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 1994 Article XIV consultation with Sierra Leone, in the light of the 1994 Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone conducted under Decision No. 5392- (77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies). 2. Sierra Leone maintains exchange restrictions in the form of limits on the availability of foreign exchange for travel under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2, and exchange measures subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, in the form of (i) limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the payment of external debt obligations under prospective rescheduling, and as evidenced by some external payments arrears; (ii) a two-year limitation on t:he remittances of profits from capital investment made in accordance with the capital investment code; (iii) bilateral payments agreements with two Fund members; and (iv) a multiple currency practice arising from the different exchange rates applicable to capital investment transactions made in accordance with the debt-equity conversion code. The Fund welcomes Sierra Leone's intention to eliminate before November 15, 1994 the exchange measures that are subject to Article VIII. In the meantime, the Fund grants approval for the retention of those measures until November 15, 1994.

Exchange System: Midterm Review Under the First Annual ESAF Arranpement On the occasion of the midterm review under the first annual ESAF arrangement (EBS 94/226) on December 21, 1994, the Board took the following decision regarding the exchange system: Sierra Leone maintains an exchange measure subject to Fund approval under Artcile VIII, Sections 2(a) in the form of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the payment of external debt obligations, as evidenced by some external payments arrears. The Fund welcomes Sierra Leone's intention to eliminate this exchange measure before June 30, 1995. 1; the meantime the Fund grants approval for the retention of the measure until the conclusion of the 1995 Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone or June 30, 1995, whichever is earlier. X. 1995 Article IV Consultation The dates of missions for discussions on the 1995 Article IV consultation and the second annual ESAF arrangement were January 26- February 11, 1995 and June 10-24, 1995.

The Bank has worked closely with the Fund in its discussions with the Government on economic reform over the past two years. Following clearance of arrears to the IBRD and IDA of USs13.4 million in April 1992, the Bank approved a Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC) of USS43.4 million, a Power rehabilitation project of US$21 mil- lion, a Road rehabilitation project of US$45 million, an Infrastructure rehabilitation project of US$26 million, and a Technical assistance project of US$lO million. Disbursements on existing projects in agriculture, education, and health, and power have also been resumed. On October 14, 1993, the Bank approved an IDA structural adjustment credit for US$50 mil- lion; the first tranche of US$20 million was made available upon approval and the second tranche of US$15 million was released on February 10, 1995. Sierra Leone completed a commercial debt buy-back operation in July 1995, which was partially financed by the IDA Debt Buy-Back Facility. A grant of US$21 million was allocated under this facility, of which US$l million was used in preparation of the debt buy-back proposal.

Over the past few months, there have been positive indications that the security situation is improving and, assuming that this trend continues and policy implementation remains on track, Sierra Leone should be able to achieve sustainable growth, while moving to a viable external position. The baseline scenario that the staff has used for its debt sustainability analysis is based on relatively conservative assumptions, but there remain substantial downside risks related primarily to developments on the security front. The overall conclusion is that, while financing gaps will continue to persist until the middle of the next decade, Sierra Leone's ability to service its debt without jeopardizing its growth potential should improve significantly over the next three to four years. Table 1 of this Appendix summarizes the export and import assumptions underlying the baseline scenario for the long-term balance of payments prnjections. On the basis of these assumptions, net resource transfers (i.e., the current account, excluding interest and official transfers) are expected to decline from 15 percent of GDP in 1995 to 6 percent by 2005. The baseline scenario also incorporates Sierra Leone's debt management strategy. Its medium- and long-term external debt (disbursed) at the end of 1995 is projected at 'US$890 million, of which around 62 percent is owed to multilateral institutions (19 percent to the Fund), 37 percent to bilateral (mainly Paris Club) creditors, and the remainder to commercial creditors (Table 2). In July 1995 it concluded a buyback of its outstanding debt to commercial creditors that cleared US$346 million in debt (including interest arrears); this covered over 9;! percent of direct debt and more than 50 percent of "pipeline" debt. The authorities plan to take steps in 1996 to clear the remaining commercial debt, u Since 1992 Sierra Leone has moved to regularize its arrears with all bilateral and multilateral creditors. After the clearance of arrears to the Fund in early 1994, the 1/ The staff has dlscussed the debt sustainability analysis with World Bank staff, who are currently working on this issue. The Bank has not expressed any objections to the main elements of this analysis nor its basic conclusions and, based on preliminary comparisons, the Fund staff expects no substantive differences to arise. 2/ The direct debt relates to obligations contracted by the Government and the Bank of Sierra Leone, while "pFpeline" debt refers to maturing trade credits, for which the Bank of Sierra Leone was unable to make foreign exchange available. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 53 - APPENDIX IV only other arrears that remain relate to three multilateral institutions (Islamic Development Bank, OPEC Fund, and Arab Bank for the Economic Development of Africa); the authorities are pursuing discussions on eliminating these arrears before end-June 1996 through bridging loans and cash payments. Sierra Leone is current on all maturing obligations, other than commercial debt payments that remain outstanding after the debt buy- back exercise. It will not undertake any new medium- or long-term borrowing on nonconcessional terms. Sierra Leone faces substantial debt service obligations in 1996-97 on pre-cutoff-date debt to bilateral creditors and on debt that was previously rescheduled on nonconcessional terms. In 1998 and beyond, however, these obligations drop off sharply. The current Paris Club consolidation period runs through the end of 1995, and the projections assume that Sierra Leone will receive cash-flow relief on concessional terms (i.e., a 67 percent net present value reduction) for pre-cutoff date debt and debt previously rescheduled on nonconcessional terms for the remaining period covered by the present ESAF arrangement. It is also assumed that Sierra Leone will receive cash flow relief on nonconcessional terms for payments due on debt previously rescheduled on concessional terms (i.e., Paris Club reschedulings of 1992 and 1994). This cash flow relief will not cover previously re- scheduled short-term arrears, but would be needed to cover the anticipated financing gaps. The projections do not allow for the possibility of a "top- up" for debt that was rescheduled on London terms (i.e., increasing the degree of concessionality from 50 percent to 67 percent). 1/ In addition to debt service payments, Sierra Leone's financing requirements cover the need to reconstitute the central banks foreign reserve position. The program aims at raising Sierra Leone's foreign exchange reserves to the equivalent of about five months of imports by the end of the decade, a level that is considered necessary given the variability of the country's exports. The foreign aid projections take into account existing commitments and disbursement under new commitments that can safely be relied upon. It is, however, possible that the move to multiparty democracy in 1996 and a termination of the rebel hostilities will lead to additional flows of aid, but such flows have not been built into the program. The projections indicate some fall-off in balance of payments assistance, largely reflecting uncertainties surrounding the availability of future financing from the African Development Fund and reduced dependence on aid. Project grants are expected to fall off progressively at a rate of about 2 percent a year in nominal terms, while project loans should rise until 1998 and stay constant in nominal terms thereafter. Foreign direct investment should pick up modestly from current depressed levels, in response to the Government's 1/ Since payments on debt that is reschedulable on concessional terms are minimal after 1998, a stock-of-debt operation would make little difference relative to the baseline assumption.

Sierra Leone will still be faced with moderately sized financing gaps for the next ten years or so. It is envisaged that these gaps will be filled by a rescheduling of pre-cutoff date debt, additional donor support, and the possible further use of the Fund's concessional resources when the present ESAF arrangement expires. If Sierra Leone continues to confine its external financing to grants and concessional loans only, and if it is able to attract a moderate increase in non-debt-creating inflows, the baseline scenario indicates that it will be able to move to a more sustainable external debt path while still generating the investment resources needed to meet the growth targets of at least 2 percent per capita each year. Sierra Leone's stock of external debt was reduced by about one-third, to the equivalent of 111 percent of GDP at end-1995, as a result of the commercial debt buy-back exercise (Table 3, Appendix IV). Under the baseline scenario, external debt is expected to rise slightly to 120 percent of GDP in 1996 before declining progressively to 73 percent by 2005. The ratio of debt service payments to exports of goods and services would decline from 80 percent in 1995 to about 11 percent by 2005. The net present value of future debt service payments would drop from 65 percent of GDP to 25 percent over this same period. In addition, the staff projections indicate that the fiscal debt service burden would decline from 30 percent of government revenue in 1995 to 12 percent by 2000.

Inflation to decline to 5 percent in 1998 and beyond. 3. Rutile and bauxite production to return to normal by 1997. Rutile production to rise by an average of 12 percent a year in dollar terms during 1998-2001 in response to completion of new investment project, but increase of only 2-3 percent a year thereafter. Bauxite output to grow by 3 percent a year. 4. Alluvial diamond mining to return to normal by early 1996, and exports to grow by 3 percent thereafter. Kimberlite exports to commence in 1997, to rise to US$25 million in 1999, and remain at that level in real terms. 5. Other exports, which are primarily cocoa and coffee, to grow by 12 percent per annum in U.S. dollar terms (although they would still not reach the level recorded in 1988 until early in the next decade). 6. Petroleum imports to fall by 25 percent in 1997 when the Bumbuna hydroelectric power facility comes on stream. Rice import costs to remain at present levels through 1997, but to decline gradually over time as policy measures in agricultural sector take hold and the security situation improves. Other imports to rise sharply in 1996-97 as a result of mining sector investments and business stock replenishment.

'The generation of monetary, balance of payments, external debt, and public finance statistics is sufficient for the purpose of program monitoring; this i.s' in large measure due to the support provided under external assistance programs, including the Fund/UNDP technical assistance project. u The authorities are cooperating fully in regularly providing program monitoring data to the Fund and responding to specific requests, either directly or through the office of the resident representative. Because of inadequate resources and the lack of well trained personnel, however, a number of weaknesses in data management persist. There are few statistical ptiblicationsand no fully articulated publication policy. 1. National accounts Historical national accounts data (,annual only, July-June) are prepared by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) on the basis of information received from government departments, agencies, and public enterprises, as well as through its own occasional surveys. A major project is under way to improve the system of national income accounts and socioeconomic indicators with the support of the Fund/UNDP technical assistance project. 2/ Fund missions typically make their own estimates and proj,ections of key national accounts concepts, which at times entails ,adjusting historical data on the basis of available information. 2/ Prior to 1991, national accounts data served reasonably well as broad indicators of movements in output; since then, however, the informational content has declined markedly. The sectoral breakdown by expenditure category is largely estimated and probably unreliable, particularly as regards the private saving/investment balance. 2. Prices The consumer price index (CPI) for Freetown is prepared monthly by the CSO and published with a lag of approximately two to three weeks. The CPI covers only the capital city, but the CSO is developing a plan to extend the survey's reach to towns and selected rural areas once rebel hostilities 1/ The Fund/UNDP technical assistance project was started in January 1990 in anticipation of the need to produce statistics in the above-mentioned areas for monitoring a rights accumulation program, which subsequently began in April 1992. u This project aims to review the CSO's current methods, introduce conceptual and statistical improvements where practical, computerize procedures where possible, and, finally, produce updated national income estimates. u Typically, such adjustments are made to account for the illegal trade in diamonds or, since 1991, the impact of the rebel war. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 76 - APPENDIX VI cease. Estimates for the GDP deflator are constructed on the basis of the CPI, as is information on movements in government prices, prices of capital goods (which are largely imported), and prices of exports and imports. In January 1995, the CSO began publishing a revised CPI, rectifying the technical problems related to the price of whiting (a locally consumed fish), which are described in the staff report for the 1994 Article IV consultation. u 3. Public finance statistica The budget reporting system was established with technical assistance provided under the Fund/UNDP technical assistance project. The European Union is also providing technical assistance to computerize the government payroll system. The staff receives on a monthly basis the appropriately disaggregated data on government fiscal operations. The data are forwarded to the staff with a lag of four to six weeks. Annual data covering the recurrent and development budget of the central government are reported regularly to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. However, no monthly data are reported to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics. 4. Honetarv statisticg Key components of the central bank balance sheet are reported on a daily basis, while the main elements of the monetary survey can usually be prepared shortly after the end of the reference period. This provides an early warning.system on key financial targets. The full monetary survey is prepared with a lag of about six weeks, including comprehensive coverage of commercial banks. From time to time, there have been difficulties in reconciling budget financing data from the Department of Finance and credit to government from the Central Bank, but such differences have remained tolerably small and have been eventually resolved. Lags are longer, however, in the reporting of Sierra Leone's monetary data to STA, although they have been reduced from four months to two months. The need persists to disaggregate a large "other items net" for the central bank, but some improvement is expected since the Bank of Sierra Leone has recently re-instituted its *economic balance sheet" project, which stems from a STA money and banking statistics mission in May 1993. 5. Balance of uyments statistics Sierra Leone's external transactions are characterized by a large volume of activity in the informal sector, owing principally to the smuggling of diamonds. A considerable share of imports is financed by these 1/ See EBS/94/35, 3/l/94. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 77 - APPENDIX VI unrecorded exports. As a result, official balance of payments statistics tend to understate transactions. The CSO.has recently begun addressing this problem through the use of third country (principally European Union members) import data. Information on official grant and loan receipts is relatively good and is prepared by the staff on the basis of contact with the Sierra Leonean authorities and official agencies. On the other hand, data on private capital flows tend to be very poor. Some information on private banking flows can be derived from the monetary survey. Other private capital flows, and especially those linked to the diamond trade, are effectively captured only in errors and omissions. Data on the gross and net official reserves position of the BSL are provided monthly to STA and AFR with a short lag. Because of,the prevailing security situation in the country, the authorities have had many difficulties in the collection of data. As a result, balance of payments data have been so far reported to STA with some delay (only data for 1993 are available 'at this time). Information on the public external debt is good. A comprehensive debt reporting system has been in operation for the past year, monitoring offi- cial external debt and related interest payments. Data on debt contracted on concessional terms are monitored closely by Fund staff on the basis of contacts with the authorities, as well as the various multilateral and bilateral agencies. Data on the present stock of private sector external debt are now satisfactory, following a verification exercise that was conducted in connection with the recently concluded commercial debt buy-back operation.
