At a time when some recovery in growth had been in prospect, the economy was hit hard by the events of 9-l 1. Tourism fell sharply with adverse implications for other sectors, and the global economic situation deteriorated. Reflecting these factors, growth slowed further to about 2 percent. Balance of payments shortfalls on account of lower tourism and other inflows complicated exchange rate management. While a significant depreciation and greater flexibility of the exchange rate since mid-2000 had strengthened business confidence and offered prospects for restoring external balance, adjustments to the currency band did not keep pace with market developments after 9-l 1. As a result, currency shortages in the official market intensified and exchange transactions were diverted to a more depreciated parallel exchange market. The fiscal deficit widened slightly, largely reflecting the automatic stabilizers as activity slowed. While banks’ loan portfolios have continued to deteriorate, the FSAP review sees the situation as manageable. Policy issues l The key challenge is to establish sustained strong growth, to absorb Egypt’s rapidly growing labor force. A modest upturn in activity may be underway, but this is not yet deep-rooted. Although the potential for stimulus through expansionary macroeconomic policies has largely been exhausted, structural reforms can play an important role, including through steps to unify and restore liquidity to the foreign exchange market. l While the current stance of monetary policy is broadly appropriate, greater exchange rate flexibility will require a further strengthening of monetary policy as an alternative nominal anchor. Improvements will be important in policy design and communication, the tools of liquidity management, and market functioning. l Egypt’s financial system has been considerably strengthened in recent years, but further progress is needed to eliminate market rigidities and modernize the state banks. The FSAP review identified priorities for reform. l The authorities are implementing important fiscal reforms to address the deteriorating fiscal accounts. Particular emphasis is being given to tackling the lack of buoyancy in general government revenues. The operations of the social insurance system will also be reviewed. l Further progress in strengthening the macroeconomic database is important. Key priorities are the fiscal and real sector databases. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-5- 1. BACKGROUND 1. The events of 9-11 represented a setback for Egypt’s efforts to restore growth and external balance. During the preceding three-year period, external shocks and a deteriorating policy mix had resulted in balance of payments pressures, a sizable loss of reserves, and slowing economic growth. By mid-2001, appropriate macroeconomic policies were being put in place: credit growth had been slowed; exchange rate flexibility had permitted a 25 percent depreciation against the U.S. dollar (after a decade-long peg); and a program of fiscal structural reforms had been launched to address lagging revenue performance. However, experience with managing the flexible exchange rate was limited, and market credibility was low, leaving the regime vulnerable to external shocks. Following 9-l 1, adjustments to the currency band failed to keep pace with market developments, and shortages of foreign currency in the official exchange market led to a growing diversion of currency transactions to a more depreciated parallel exchange market. At the same time, lower tourism and other spending contributed to a further slowing of growth to about 2 percent. 2. Fund surveillance in recent years has focused on policies to address Egypt’s balance of payments pressures, the design of supportive monetary and fiscal policies, fostering resumed strong growth, managing banking sector vulnerability, and improving the macroeconomic database. ’ On external policies, the 1998 and 2000 consultations urged a more flexible currency regime, a policy implemented starting in mid-2000. Credit growth was also slowed significantly from mid-2000, and has remained modest, following earlier discussions on its adverse impact on the balance of payments. On fiscal policy, the 2000 and 2001 consultations both welcomed plans for modest consolidation in the year ahead as a contribution to medium-term fiscal sustainability; sharp corrections were not advocated, given the need to encourage resumed economic growth. Outcomes were less favorable than projected, however, with the fiscal deficit rising in both 2000/01 and 2001/02, in part reflecting the impact of the automatic stabilizers as growth failed to recover.2 Recent consultations have pointed to the limited scope for expansionary macroeconomic policies, and have urged steps to reinvigorate structural reforms to help strengthen growth. While a number of measures were taken to improve the business environment, this remains an area where strong, well-communicated policies could be very beneficial. With slowing growth adversely affecting banking sector indicators, Egypt has been urged in recent years to participate in the FSAP, a step taken in 2002. Last, data quality, in particular regarding the fiscal accounts, has been a recurring theme in recent consultations. While progress has been made, there is still some way to go. ’ Article IV consultation discussions were held during October 1998, April-May 2000, and July 2001. There was no Article IV consultation in 1999. 2 Egypt’s fiscal years cover the period July 1 to June 30. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-6- 3. Discussions on how to nurture a recovery in growth remained central to the 2002 consultation, reflecting the further slowing of growth in 2001/02. There remains little leeway for stimulus from fiscal or monetary policies, and the recommended focus on structural issues is in line with recent consultations, with a particular emphasis on the importance of strengthening exchange rate management. The 2002 consultation discussions also benefited from Egypt’s participation in the FSAP during May-June 2002. Building on the findings of the FSAP review, areas of focus included the development of monetary policy as an alternative nominal anchor, and how to address weaknesses in the state-owned banks. The 2002 consultation also focused on issues of medium-term fiscal sustainability and external competitiveness, drawing on analytical work in the selected issues paper circulated in parallel with this report. Steps to improve macroeconomic data quality remained key to the consultation. II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2001/02 A. Activity and Inflation 4. Growth slowed further in 2001/02, while inflation remained low. Although analysis of the real economy continues to be hampered by significant data weaknesses, preliminary unpublished figures on industrial production suggest broadly flat activity in 2001/02 compared to a year earlier. In addition, tourism nights fell by 11 percent, with an initial fall of over 40 percent-after 9-l 1 largely reversed by end-year.3 Against this, agricultural production is projected to have seen continuing modest growth, together with the non-tourism services sector. As a result, real GDP is estimated to increased by perhaps 2 percent, compared to 3.3 percent a year earlier (Table 1). Consumer price inflation remained below 3 percent in 2001/02, with only a limited response, so far, to Egypt’s sizeable currency depreciation against the U.S. dollar. This likely reflects the weakness of the domestic economy and the relatively small size of the imported goods sector in relation to overall demand. B. Fiscal Sector Monitoring and Developments 5. The fiscal deficit widened slightly in 2001/02, partly reflecting the operation of the automatic stabilizers after 9-11. Fiscal estimates for 2001/02 developed with the authorities show an overall deficit of 5.8 percent of GDP at the level of the budget sector and 2.5 percent of GDP at the level of the consolidated general government.4 These projected 3 Spending per night has yet to fully recover, and is estimated to remain 10 percent lower than a year earlier. 4 The consolidated general government is defined as the budget sector, General Authority for Supply of Commodities (GASC), National Investment Bank (NIB), and social insurance funds (SIFs). The fiscal deficit at the level of the consolidated general government is smaller than that at the level of the budget sector primarily due to the inclusion of the operating surpluses of the SIFs.

While, in principle, the general government accounts give the most complete and meaningful presentation of fiscal operations, they are probably less reliable than for the budget sector alone, due to the remaining uncertainties about the accounts of the NIB (paragraph 28). 6. Despite some reduction in 2001/02, hank financing of the government remained high. At the level of the budget sector, resort to bank financing was equivalent to 5.4 percent of GDP in 2OOUO2, or about one-half of total bank credit expansion (Table 4). This outcome was down from 6.1 percent of GDP a year earlier, reflecting higher foreign financing.6 Bank financing of the consolidated general government was also high in 2001/02, at close to 5 percent of GDP.7 C. Monetary and Financial Sector Developments 7. Monetary conditions were initially eased following 9-11 to help support economic activity. Following a reduction in reserve requirements in October 2001, interbank interest averaged a little under 7 percent in the October-December quarter, a decline of about 1% percentage points from a quarter earlier. This easing was reversed from end-200 1, however, partly in response to mounting pressure in the exchange market (see below). Broad money rose about 11 percent in 2001/02, adjusted for exchange rate effects on foreign currency accounts, about 2 percentage points higher than the year before (Table 4). This accommodated the higher-than-budgeted level of government borrowing as the automatic stabilizers worked, while also permitting private sector credit growth of about 8 percent, excluding exchange rate revaluation effects, up from 7.4 percent a year earlier. 8. The more difficult economic environment in 2001/02 contributed to a deterioration in hank performance indicators. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) approached 17 percentage of total loans at end-March 2002, up from 15% percent a year earlier (Table 5). More importantly, provisioning has deteriorated to about two-thirds of NPLs, down from about 83 percent in 1999. Although the average risk-weighted capital asset ratio remains in the 10 percent range, it has edged downward in recent years. The trend decline in Egypt’s 5 The downward revision to current revenues in 2000/01 continued a trend decline, from 22.2 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to 19.5 percent in 2000101, at the level of the budget sector (Table 3). Revenue yields in 2001/02 were lower than initially projected, reflecting this lower base. 6 In July 2001, the government issued US$lS billion in Eurobonds. US$O.5 billion were 5-year bonds priced 275 basis points (bp) over U.S. treasury bonds, and US$l billion were lo-year bonds priced at a 335 bp premium. During the year, US$O.4 billion of the bonds were repurchased. 7 Despite the modest fiscal deficit of the consolidated general government (about 2% percent of GDP), financing needs are increased by a number of negative financing transactions, including arrears repayments and asset accumulation in the NIB accounts.

Exchange rate management was complicated in 2001/02 by the impact of 9-11. Following a cumulative 14 percent devaluation between mid-2000 and mid-200 1, the authorities permitted a further 8 percent depreciation in August 2001 and intervened heavily in the foreign currency market to stabilize expectations and meet a backlog of currency demand.* The new regime was quickly overtaken, however, by the impact of 9-l 1, and despite further intervention (totaling US$l.6 billion over 3 months), the pound remained under pressure. A further 9 percent depreciation in December 2001, combined with more modest intervention (US$O.6 billion over 2 months), also proved inadequate to eliminate currency shortages in the official market. As a result, currency transactions were increasingly diverted to a parallel currency market in which the exchange rate depreciated briefly as far as LE 6 per U.S. dollar in January 2002 (almost 30 percent more depreciated than in the official market). Given expectations that the decline in foreign currency incomes post-9-l 1 would prove temporary, and with concerns that a further (sixth) depreciation of the official band could strengthen expectations of a “one-way bet”, the authorities decided not to depreciate the official rate toward the parallel rate. At the same time, given the earlier large official ’ Between June 2000 and end-January 2001, the pound depreciated from LE 3.43 to LE 3.85 per U.S. dollar. In January 2001, an adjustable currency band vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar was adopted, with a central rate of LE 3.85 per U.S. dollar. The central rate has subsequently been depreciated on live occasions: to LE 3.86 in June 2001, LE 3.90 in July 2001, LE 4.15 in August 2001, LE 4.50 in December 2001, and LE 4.51 in January 2002. The currency band, originally +l percent, was widened to +1.5 percent from July 2001, and to +3 percent from August 2001 (Figure 2).

With some improvement in the balance of payments and a depreciation of the pound (with the U.S. dollar) against the euro and other currencies, the parallel market exchange rate has appreciated to about LE 5 per U.S. dollar in recent months (about 5-10 percent more depreciated than the official market).’ The implications of this currency adjustment for competitiveness are discussed in Box 1.

Although significant, the impact of 9-11 on Egypt’s balance of payments was smaller than initially projected. Balance of payments projections developed with the authorities after 9-l 1 showed an overall deficit of US$1.8 billion in 2001/02 (2.1 percent of GDP), while the outturn was just US$O.4 billion (0.5 percent of GDP; Table 6). This partly reflected a faster-than-projected recovery in tourism, with earnings falling only one-half of the initially projected amount. However, the largest contribution to the stronger external outcome came from an 11 percent decline in merchandise imports, compared to initial projections for a 2 percent decline. lo The import shortfall, which exceeded what would have been expected given Egypt’s slowing growth and more depreciated exchange rate, may partly have reflected the impact of the foreign currency shortages discussed above. 11. External debt indicators remain healthy, and the FSAP review concluded that Egypt does not appear vulnerable to sudden disruptive capital outflows. Total external debt amounted to about 32 percent of GDP at end-March 2002, with net debt accumulation of 9 Although the pound has remained unchanged against the dollar in the official market since the end of 2001, the nominal depreciation of the U.S. dollar through June 2002 contributed to a further 8.5 percent real effective depreciation of the Egyptian pound, producing a cumulative real effective depreciation of 21 percent since mid-2000 (Figure 3). ‘” The lower level of imports strengthened the balance of payments by US$1.6 billion, compared to US$O.4 billion on account of the upward revision to tourism. Revisions to capital flows, including errors and omissions, partly offset these changes. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16- Table 6.

Assessing Competitiveness The depreciation of the pound since mid-2000 has reversed about one-half of the real effective appreciation of the 199Os, returning the real exchange rate (RER) to its level in 1996. Despite this, the RER remains 40 percent more appreciated than in early-1991. This raises the question of whether the pound is now appropriately valued, or whether a further strengthening of competitiveness is needed. These issues are discussed in depth in Chapter IV of the selected issues paper prepared for the 2002 Article IV consultation. A summary of the findings is presented below. Influences on the equilibrium real exchange rate. A large number of factors determine the appropriate (or equilibrium) RER at any point in time. Over the long run (last 20-30 years), Egypt’s RER has been broadly stable, or on a slight downward trend, the latter possibly compensating for slower productivity growth than in its industrialized trading partners. Over shorter periods, other variables influence the equilibrium RER, including Egypt’s debt service position, its terms of trade, oil production capacity, and the extent of impediments to trade. Paris Club debt relief through the 1990s produced debt service savings of up to US$O.4 billion per annum, while also attracting new capital inflows; other things equal, this would have contributed to an appreciation of Egypt’s equilibrium RER. Against this, however, Egypt’s crude oil exports fell by around 30 percent in volume terms, while net exports of petroleum products also declined significantly; these trends moderated, and possibly offset, the impact of debt relief. Separately, Egypt’s RER may have been undervalued in the very early 1990s implying some scope for appreciation toward its equilibrium level. Tentative estimates suggest, however, that this undervaluation was quickly eliminated by the observed real appreciation during the 1990s resulting a significant over-valuation by the late 1990s. Effects of the real effective appreciation of the 1990s. The appreciation of the real exchange rate in the late 1990s appears to have had some adverse effect on trade performance. On some measures, Egypt’s merchandise export market share declined, while import penetration rose significantly after 1997. Despite this, the tourism sector appears to have remained competitive, seeing a sizeable increase in its market share through the 1990s. Is the Egyptian pound now under- or over-valued? The depreciation of the pound since 2000 has substantially reduced the risk of overvaluation. However, the existence of an active, more depreciated parallel exchange market implies that the official rate would depreciate somewhat further under a more flexible regime. Notwithstanding this, the remaining need for competitiveness improvements is difficult to measure with any accuracy. The appropriate level of the exchange rate needs to be seen in the context of other influences on external performance. On the one hand, the ongoing recovery of tourism and other external inflows will help strengthen the pound in the period ahead. Against this, structural reforms to improve trade openness are needed, which could require supporting changes in the RER. Given these uncertainties, the priority is to establish an exchange regime in which the exchange rate can respond flexibly to evolving market conditions.

At end-June 2002, net international reserves of over US$l4 billion represented over 8 months of imports of goods and services, and substantially exceeded potential short-term foreign currency drams of about US$7 billion (Table 8). The recent downgrade by Fitch and Standard and Poor’s of Egypt’s sovereign debt rating to below investment grade did not have an appreciable effect on Egypt’s bond yields since the downgrade was widely expected. * ’ III. MACROECONOMIC Pomy Issues A. Restoring Strong Economic Growth 12. The overriding issue for the medium term is to achieve strong economic growth to create employment for Egypt’s rapidly growing labor force. ln 2001/02, Egypt saw its second year of slow growth, and unemployment has begun to increase. The authorities agreed there is now limited leeway for expansionary macroeconomic policies, as the budget deficit already absorbs a large share of total bank credit and a cautious monetary stance will be important to support moves to greater exchange rate flexibility. There was also agreement that no single issue would be sufficient to stimulate growth and that a balanced mix of macroeconomic and structural reform would be required. 13. Some signs of recovery-are evident. The authorities noted that advance tourism bookings are favorable, commodity exports are growing, the energy sector is attracting increasing investment, and recent business surveys point to a tentative recovery of domestic confidence. l2 With appropriate policies and a continued improvement in confidence, and abstracting from further external shocks, growth is tentatively projected to recover to the 3?&4 percent range in 2002/03, strengthening further in subsequent years (Box 2 and Table 9). 14. Downside risks remain important, however. Restoring and maintaining business confidence will be key to the growth outcome outlined above. At a minimum this will require a substantial strengthening of policies, especially in regard to exchange rate management. While the recent improvements in balance of payments performance provide a window of opportunity, uncertainty in the markets about the direction of exchange rate and other reform policies could contribute to a less favorable growth outcome (Box 2 and Table 10). ” Although yields on Egyptian eurobonds increased by 125-145 bp between end-May and end- September 2002, this likely reflected increased general risk aversion by investors, and was less than one-third the increase of nearly 400 bp in the EMBI+ index. l2 The independent ECES bi-annual survey of business conditions, conducted in July 2002, indicates that, on balance, respondents project increases in production, sales, and investment in the second half of 2002, compared to the fist half. This marks an improvement from more negative readings in earlier surveys Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19- Table 7.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook To illustrate the implications of alternative policy courses, the staff has developed two medium-term macroeconomic scenarios. Assuming rapid progress with reforms, and with supportive macroeconomic policies, including a unified liquid foreign exchange market, economic growth could potentially rise to the 5-5X percent range over the medium term. This baseline growth forecast would be sufficient, over time, to reverse the recent increases in unemployment, deliver a steady increase in real wages, and resume the reduction of poverty seen in the second half of the 1990s (Table below). Though even higher real GDP growth would be desirable, this baseline already assumes a more favorable policy environment than the preceding decade, contributing to an increase in real GDP growth of about 1 percentage point (1 standard deviation). Policies needed to achieve this goal would include supportive fiscal and monetary policies, as well as a clearly communicated and strongly implemented program of structural reforms. A key focus in the latter would need to be on achieving a more business-friendly environment, including a unified, liquid currency market at a competitive exchange rate; a liberal trade and investment regime; a streamlined tax system; and reduced bureaucracy. Under a less supportive policy framework, growth might remain around &I% percent, little changed from the past decade. This would fall short of the 5 percent minimum required to absorb the annual increase in the labor force of about 600 thousand persons (3 percent per annum). As a result, unemployment would continue to edge higher, while real wage growth would remain modest. Outcome in 2006/07 10 years Baseline Unfavorable to 2oollo2 Scenario scenario GDP growth (percent) 4.4 5--l% 44% Employment growth (‘OOOs, p.a.) 460 600-700 500-600 Unemployment growth (‘OOOs, p.a.) 40 0 to -100 0 to 100 Real wage growth (percent) l/ 1% 2 1% The baseline (stronger growth) scenario would be associated with higher growth in trade, foreign direct investment, and other capital inflows. With rising investment and growth, the current account would be expected to return to a modest deficit (up to 1% percent of GDP, Table 6). This should be manageable given the prospects for a strengthening of foreign direct investment and other capital inflows, provided there is good progress with structural reforms. Under the unfavorable scenario, the projected expansion of FDI and market-based financing would likely be more limited, acting as a constraint on imports, investment, and economic growth. Lower external financing would also have implications for public debt management. Domestic borrowing by the public sector could rise substantially if the current fiscal dynamics are not strengthened (Box 3). This could crowd out private investment, and increase the concentration of public debt in the banking system. I/ Real wages are assumed to increase in line with labor productivity.

B. Fiscal policy 15. On fiscal policy, discussions focused on the appropriate fiscal stance for the current year, as well as the importance of strengthening fiscal performance over the longer term. The modest widening of the fiscal deficit in the last two years has helped cushion growth, including against the adverse impacts of 9-l 1. At the same time, net public debt has risen from 48 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to 57 percent in 2001/02, reflecting both high levels of government borrowing as well as the impact of the recent currency depreciation on the foreign currency debt burden. Preliminary staff calculations suggest that even with a strong recovery in economic growth to the 5-5% percent range, tighter fiscal policies would be needed to ensure sustainability over the longer term. Without adjustment, public debt would continue to rise, reaching 65 percent of GDP by 2006/07 and over 80 percent of GDP a decade later (Box 3). These adverse debt dynamics are even more marked under less favorable macroeconomic scenarios,~including when economic growth is closer to that over the past decade (Box 2), or when continuing high levels of financing are needed to cover below-the-line budgetary outlays parallel to those in recent years. 16. Fiscal sustainability will require a multi-year strengthening of fiscal performance. Given Egypt’s already moderately high level of public debt in relation to GDP, the government’s heavy resort to bank financing, and the unfavorable debt dynamics projected under a continuation of current policies, measures to strengthen fiscal performance are a priority. At the same time, Egypt’s debt dynamics are not yet sufficiently severe that a sharp fiscal consolidation would be needed, which would risk undermining the incipient economic upturn. Against this background, a multi-year fiscal consolidation appears appropriate, starting in 2002/03, and continuing through additional measures to strengthen budget performance, over perhaps a further two- to three-year time frame. Under the baseline scenario, a phased cumulative strengthening of the primary balance by about 2% percentage points of GDP would be sufficient to broadly stabilize the debt-GDP ratio over the next two decades (Box 3). The magnitude and timing of the fiscal adjustment would need to be kept under review, as an even larger adjustment would be needed in the event that economic performance proved less favorable than in the baseline scenario, or if the budget is required to meet contingent liabilities in the public enterprise or financial sectors. Options for achieving fiscal savings include more restrained public sector wage growth, tighter benefit policies under the social insurance system, a reduction of the implicit subsidy on domestic petroleum sales, and new revenue measures. l3 The authorities agreed that fiscal sustainability requires close attention, and noted that steps are underway to strengthen underlying fiscal l3 For example, the fiscal projections assume that public sector wages will continue to increase at recent rates of close to 10 percent for the next 5 years. If this were scaled back to 5 percent, public expenditures would be reduced by about 1 percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 26 - Box 3. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability Over the past three years, the government’s debt-GDP has increased by 10 percentage points. This reflected a declining revenue-GDP ratio, rapid growth in the wage bill, increases in social security benefits in excess of contributions growth, and various recurrent below-the-line fiscal outlays. This trend raises questions about the sustainability of current fiscal policies. To analyze fiscal sustainability in the long run, including the impact of Egypt’s demographics on the social insurance system, a model has been constructed to simulate the evolution of government finances over the next 25 years. This box summarizes the more detailed findings in the accompanying selected issues paper. Consistent with baseline economic scenario outlined in Box 2, real GDP growth rises to 5-5s percent over the medium term, before easing to around 4 percent from about 2015 as the growth in Egypt’s labor force slows. Real interest rates are assumed to remain around 6 percent and CPI inflation around 3 percent. Fiscal projections are broadly according to “current policies”. Government employment is projected to continue to grow at around 1.7 percent per annum, while public sector wages increase by 10 percent annually for the next 5 years before converging with average wage growth. The revenue-GDP ratio is expected to remain essentially constant in the long run, with tariff reductions offset by new revenue measures. On the Social Insurance Funds, contributions are projected to remain broadly stable as a share of GDP, while benefits payments increase as the population ages. The baseline scenario, which includes the projected reduction of the fiscal deficit in 2002/03, shows unfavorable debt dynamics, with th* debt-GDP ratio doubling to over llopercent by 2025 (Table below). With rising interest payments, the overall fiscal deficit widens to over 9 percent of GDP. To achieve a more sustainable debt trajectory, fiscal measures would be needed to strengthen the primary balance by a further 2 percentage points of GDP over the next few years (over and above the one-half point increase in 2002/03). This would leave the debt-GDP ratio only modestly higher at about 68 percent in 2025, consistent with an overall fiscal deficit of about 3-4 percent of GDP at the level of the consolidated general government. Even after additional fiscal consolidation, risks would remain, however. If real GDP growth were to be weaker by 0.5-1.0 percentage points, the debt-GDP ratio would again rise sharply, requiring further fiscal measures. Higher debt levels might also arise in the event that support is needed to restructure public sector entities, including banks. Moreover, the debt sustainability analysis remains preliminary, reflecting the need for additional information on some aspects of public finances, including the operations of the NIB and the public enterprise sector.

A number of fiscal reforms are in train which will help strengthen revenue performance over the medium term, while plans for the reform of the NIB and social security system are being developed (paragraph 39). In addition, a public expenditure review to be conducted during 2002/03 in collaboration with the World Bank will identify scope for expenditure savings. 17. Fiscal projections developed with the authorities confirm prospects for some modest initial fiscal tightening in 2002/03. Under the staff’s projections, the fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 5.8 to 5.0 percent of GDP at the level of the butll$et sector, and from 2.5 to 2.2 percent of GDP for the consolidated general government. (The authorities’ own projections show a slightly larger deficit correction.) These projections reflect a modest reversal of the trend decline in revenues in relation to GDP which would more than offset increases relative to GDP in the wage and salary bill and interest expenditures. General sales tax (GST) receipts are projected to increase in relation to GDP on account of cigarette tax increases announced in July 2002, the clarification of the taxation of services under the GST, and the full year impact of the extension of the GST to the wholesale and retail sectors at the start of 2001/02. Other taxes and revenue receipts are also projected to rise on account of measures to be implemented in the coming few months. 18. Despite the smaller deficit, the budget will continue to require substantial bank financing in 2002/03, representing a large share of overall credit expansion. With some further clearance of arrears and modest foreign borrowing, domestic bank financing of the budget sector is projected at about 4% percent of GDP, down by one percentage point of GDP from a year earlier (Table 4). Notwithstanding some uncertainties regarding money demand and the budget’s access to non-bank financing, the above deficit should be manageable. A larger deficit would be difficult to accommodate, however, implying either a crowding-out of private credit or pressures on the foreign exchange market. The authorities are aware of this risk, and are prepared to curb expenditures with a view to limiting any increase in the deficit. l5 C. Foreign Exchange Policy and External Sector Outlook 19. There was broad agreement that Egypt is best served by a flexible exchange rate. While the adjustable currency band regime adopted in early 2001 was intended to ensure such flexibility, the band is currently out of alignment with market conditions, and exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice have emerged (Box 4). The staff emphasized that the business sector’s need to resort to parallel market transactions (which were strictly illegal) to supplement the limited liquidity in the official currency market was having an l4 The fiscal consolidation is slightly smaller at the level of consolidated general government due to a higher deticit in the NIB on account of increased net lending and a lower surplus in the social insurance funds due to higher benefit payments. l5 Under the low growth scenario discussed above, the fiscal deficit could deteriorate by more than one-half of one percent of GDP. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-28 - adverse impact on confidence, and hampering economic activity dependent on the reliable availability of foreign exchange. Accordingly, the authorities were urged to give the highest priority to quickly unifying and restoring liquidity to the exchange market.16 While the authorities were of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the present two-tier currency regime should not be overstated, they agreed on the importance of an early move to greater exchange rate flexibility. In this context, they shared the view that the strengthening of the balance of payments in recent months has created more favorable conditions for establishing a unified and flexible exchange market. They noted that work is underway to put in place the supporting institutional arrangements for a move to greater flexibility, including by strengthening exchange market intervention and monetary management. Technical assistance has been requested from the Fund in these areas. The staff agreed that some institutional strengthening could help the functioning of a more flexible exchange rate system; however, these measures could be adopted in parallel with the move to greater flexibility, and should not be allowed to delay the latter. Box 4. Jurisdictional Aspects of Egypt’s Exchange Regime The present exchange regime gives rise to an exchange restriction, as not all current account transactions can be satisfied at the prevailing exchange rate in the official exchange market. Banks are not legally permitted to depreciate the exchange rate to a market-clearing rate, while official intervention has not been adequate to clear the market in the absence of exchange rate adjustment. Although, in practice, some of the current account transactions that are unsatisfied in the official market may be financed in the parallel market, the latter transactions are strictly illegal. The exchange regime also gives rise to a multiple currency practice. Specifically, a difference of over 2 percent exists between the central bank exchange rate used for certain official transactions (LE 4.50/52 per U.S. dollar) and the rate applied by commercial banks in the official currency market (LE 4.62/64 per U.S. dollar). As a separate issue, Egypt maintains bilateral payments arrangements with Sudan and Russia (the latter non-operative) which represent exchange restrictions under the Fund’s jurisdiction. It also maintains an official exchange rate for settling balances under the arrangements, which gives rise to a multiple currency practice. 20. The balance of payments position is expected to prove manageable in 2002/03. Under a baseline scenario, assuming greater exchange rate flexibility and improved liquidity in the official exchange marker, a significant upturn in imports is projected. However, this is expected to be largely offset by growing tourism receipts and an increase in non-oil exports, l6 A complementary short technical assistance mission to evaluate the operations of Egypt’s exchange market was provided in July 2002. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - limiting the current account to a slight deficit, compared to a balance in 2001/02. Under this scenario, the need for a further drawdown in net international reserves is expected to be modest, primarily focused on limited smoothing of foreign currency market conditions. Without exchange market reforms, capital inflows would be lower, but so also would be economic growth and imports. Over the medium term, growth will depend more crucially on strong access to international capital markets, which will require robust macroeconomic and structural policies (Box 2). 21. Given uncertainties in the region, consideration should he given to broad strategies for coping with shocks that could again disrupt tourism and other foreign exchange receipts. Appropriate responses to temporary shocks would include some draw down of official reserves together with additional external financing, should this be available, coupled with exchange rate flexibility. Consideration might also be given to some limited use of the fiscal stabilizers, though, given Egypt’s already moderately high level of public debt and heavy reliance on bank borrowing, this would need to be balanced against the desirability of strengthening the public finances and judged in light of financing opportunities. Monetary policy would need to remain cautious to constrain pressures on the exchange rate. D. Monetary Policy 22. Although the current stance of monetary policy appears broadly appropriate, it will be important to strengthen the monetary policy framework as an alternative nominal anchor to support a move to greater exchange rate flexibility. In preparation for a move to a formal inflation targeting framework with interest rates as the intermediate target, the central bank concurred on the need to develop its policy instruments, policy- making infrastructure, and the transparency of the monetary framework. A new monetary policy unit has been established in the central bank, and a statement of monetary policies is to be published later in 2002. In the latter connection, the staff encouraged the authorities to focus liquidity management on the monetary aggregates which may, at the present time, be the most useful intermediate target.17 Given uncertainties relating to the projection of money demand and the links between reserve and broad money, this approach would need to be operated with a degree of flexibility, taking account of evidence on possible shifts in money demand from a range of indicators, including the exchange rate, inflation, real sector developments, and interbank interest rates. Regarding the latter, the new operating procedures for monetary policy, together with efforts to strengthen liquidity forecastin should be expected to result in a somewhat smoother path for interbank interest rates. IF l7 This might involve targeting M2 (either including or excluding foreign currency deposits) using base money. In the past, liquidity management has focused on managing the level of excess reserves in the banking system, which could be consistent with a range of outcomes for the monetary aggregates. lx The challenge of liquidity management for commercial banks has also been eased through the introduction of faster, automated check clearance in the Cairo clearing house, and through extension of the reserve averaging period from 1 to 2 weeks. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 30 - 23. Consistent with the above approach, the staff discussed with the authorities a monetary scenario designed to support the economic recovery while maintaining low inflation. The staff share the view of the central bank that broad money growth of about 9% percent is a reasonable target for the coming year (Table 4). Based on a projected fiscal deficit for the budget sector of no more than 5 percent of GDP, this would provide scope for an increase in private sector credit of S--W2 percent, while also limiting the pressure on the external accounts that could require currency depreciation or substantial declines in net international reserves. 24. Steps to strengthen liquidity management are important. The authorities’ capacity to absorb liquidity from the banking system has been particularly limited, relying mainly on asking banks to make deposits with the central bank or asking the Ministry of Finance to over-finance the budget through treasury bill sales. In light of this, the introduction in September 2002 of an auction-based two-week deposit facility at the central bank is an important step, which the authorities intend to extend to other maturities. Consideration is also being given to central bank open market operations, which would be facilitated by the establishment at the central bank of a portfolio of marketable government securities, perhaps through the conversion of government debt held by the central bank. 25. Money markets need further development. The transmission of monetary policy is presently hampered by the limited depth of the money markets, and by interest rate inflexibility. The authorities have taken steps to address these shortcomings, including by establishing a debt management unit in the Ministry of Finance, dematerializing the trading of treasury bills, and developing a primary dealer system for treasury bills which should be operational shortly. The staff would also recommend making treasury bonds tradable, including outside of the stock exchange. Greater interest rate flexibility is also needed: while interest rates are market-determined and flexible in the interbank market, they have been inflexible elsewhere. The pending introduction of a primary dealer market for treasury bills could help establish increased interest rate responsiveness in the government debt market, but parallel steps are also needed to encourage flexibility in the credit and savings markets. E. Data Issues 26. Progress continues to be made in strengthening the macroeconomic database. However, further improvements are needed, both to provide a stronger foundation for macroeconomic management, and to help expand access to foreign direct investment and financing inflows by improving information about developments in the economy. The staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to subscribe to the SDDS, and urged progress in resolving the key outstanding issues. l9 I9 These include the compilation and publication of the International Investment Position, the reserve template, and quarterly GDP data. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-3l- 27. In the real sector, the recent introduction of a monthly industrial production index promises to be a major advance in monitoring activity. The staff urged that priority be given to disseminating these estimates, and that surveys be initiated to permit the compilation of more timely and frequent estimates of activity in other sectors. 28. Further progress was made during 2001102 in strengthening the fiscal reporting framework adopted last year. In particular, improved estimates of bank and non-bank financing have been developed.20 At the same time, concerns remain regarding the extent to which fiscal developments are comprehensively reflected in the new database. In particular, there is a difference between above-the-line and below-the-line estimates of the fiscal deficit at all levels of consolidation;21 the largely paper-based system of record keeping complicates the process of updating the reported accounts for revised historic component data; and there is a need for the timely publication of the audited final accounts.22 Uncertainties also arise in relation to the accounts of the NlB . Strengthened data on the operations of the former are unlikely to be available in advance of the conclusion of the ongoing audit of the accounts of the NIB, which is also needed to resolve issues relating to fiscal reporting in 1997/98 and earlier years (Box 5). Box 5. Possible Issues Related to Fiscal Reporting Under Past Fund Arrangements Fiscal data revisions. In 1999/2000, the fiscal deficit for 1998/99 was revised upwardssubstantially, in part following the identification of sizable discrepancies between the financing and debt data. Although similar discrepancies existed for 1997/98 and earlier years, the fiscal data were not revised. Accuracy of past fiscal reporting. The revision to the 1998199 fiscal data did not raise issues of misreporting. However, if the previously reported data for 1997198 and earlier years were to be incorrect, it might raise issues under Article VIII, Section 5 as the data involved were relevant for the performance criteria for the fiscal deficit and its domestic financing under arrangements in place through 1997/98. Strengthening fiscal reporting. The authorities have indicated that, given the heavy workload of the Ministry of Finance, their priority is to establish a comprehensive and transparent fiscal reporting framework that reflects the stance of fiscal policy in Egypt and which strengthens fiscal reporting in the future. Accordingly, they have continued to collaborate with the staff in strengthening the fiscal data for 1998/99 and subsequent years. In regard to the fiscal accounts for 1997/98 and earlier years, they have indicated that a review of the data will not be possible before completing the audit of the activities of the National Investment Bank (NIB), which is scheduled for completion later in 2002. ‘” For further details on the new fiscal reporting system see the 2001 Article IV staff report (SM/O1/303, pp. 6-10). Recent fiscal data improvements are described in more detail in Appendix III of this report. 2’ For the budget sector, errors and omission in the fiscal accounts were equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2001/02. While this discrepancy may reflect an underestimation of the fiscal deficit, it is presently recorded below the line, pending further discussions on the possible nature of the errors and omissions. 22 The staff has not been provided with the audited statement of the treasury accounts for 1998/99 and 1999/00, which have been discussed by the parliament, but are not yet fully approved.

Structural reform across a broad front will be needed to deliver a sustained improvement in economic performance. Policy discussions for the 2002 Article IV consultation focused on expanding the role of the private sector through privatization; reforming the state banks and further strengthening the financial system; the authorities’ program for modernizing the tax system; and liberalizing the trade regime. A. Privatization 30. Over the past decade, Egypt’s non-financial state enterprise sector has declined from 7 percent to 2% percent of total impact of early retirement schemes.23 employment, reflecting privatization and the At the same time, public companies continue to account for about 12 percent of corporate borrowing, and enterprise restructuring will be critical not only to increase competition and efficiency, but also to complement modernization of the state-owned banks (see below). The pace of privatizations slowed from 2001, paralleling a global downturn in sales (Figure 4). In this more difficult environment, the mission welcomed innovative approaches being adopted to support enterprise reform, including through pre-sale early retirements, deferred purchase arrangements, and asset leasing or unbundling. A particular challenge will arise in dealing with around 18 large companies (many in the textile sector) which account for the majority of the operating losses of the state enterprise sector as-well as 40 percent of its borrowing from the banking system (about 3 percent of GDP). The mission urged that the privatization effort be extended to certain public authorities and utilities, where consideration is still, for the most part, at a very early stage. 125,000 Figure 4.

Egypt’s participation in the FSAP earlier this year confirms a considerable institutional strengthening in the financial system, both in terms of the regulatory authorities and market participants. Legislative underpinnings have been improved and technical aspects ranging from payments mechanisms to the trading of securities have been modernized. The FSAP assessment of Egypt’s corn regulation of the various sectors is generally good. 2r liance with the core principles of good At the same time, however, progress has been held back by market rigidities and the continued dominant presence of state- owned institutions. 32. The authorities welcomed the FSAP exercise, noting that it had been instrumental in helping the supervisory authorities further advance their oversight and stress-testing procedures. As regards the banking sector, they agreed that the recent deterioration in loan portfolios appears manageable. Stress tests conducted under the FSAP suggest that interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and first-round foreign exchange risk are limited.25 Credit risk is more significant, including potentially as a result of the direct and indirect consequences of currency depreciation. Based on the existing loan classifications, stress tests suggest that bank insolvencies would be small unless NPL ratios rise substantially. 33. Strengthening the performance of the state banks is priority. Lending by the big four state-owned banks to the public enterprise sector is likely to have reflected both commercial and social considerations with implications for loan quality. Although their nonperforming loan ratios have been in line with the banking sector average in recent years (Table 5), this partly reflects the transfer of some nonperforming claims to the government.26 At the same time, the FSAP review found indications that actual and potential losses by the public banks are worse than reflected in their financial statements, with restructured underperforming loans giving rise to low rates of profitability, leaving the banks vulnerable to further shocks. Given their implicit government backing, and the efforts thus far expended to address bank loan problems, weaknesses in the state banks do not seem to pose current systemic vulnerabilities.27 However, if not addressed decisively, the burden of actual and 24 As a further measure, a new banking law has been approved by cabinet and will be submitted to parliament in the next session. 25 Interest risk appears low, on preliminary data, reflecting the relatively short maturity of banks’ assets; liquidity ratios are high by international standards; and first-round foreign exchange risk is low as banks have only a small (long) open foreign currency position. 26 The government assumed state cotton company debts to the banking system amounting to LE 4.3 billion in 1997/98 and LE 3.3 billion in 2000/01. The combined debt assumption was equivalent to 6 percent of the outstanding credits of the state commercial banks at end-2000/01. 27 In an effort to address credit quality problems, the public sector banks have recently allocated a substantial share of profits to provisioning, and a program has been initiated for strengthening the operations of the banks, including through the introduction of new management. It has also been announced that the central bank will (continued) Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 34 - potential losses in the public banks would likely increase, distorting the functioning of financial markets and increasing the banks’ potential liability to the budget. The FSAP team recommended audits to identify the extent of loans at risk and any possible need for recapitalization, and steps to bring the state bank operations onto a more sound commercial footing.28 These steps would provide a basis for a subsequent transition toward privatization. The joint-venture banks, mostly subject to minority holdings by the state banks or insurance companies, are in a relatively stronger position, and their privatization should be completed at an early date. 29 The authorities concurred on the need to strengthen the state banks, and are giving a high priority to appointing new management to the banks and conducting the necessary audits. At the same time, pending the results of the audits, they noted that there was no firm evidence, as yet, that the restructured loans of these banks were contributing to the banks’ sub-par performance. Indeed, other factors were important, including their high operating and upgrading costs. 34. In May 2002, Egypt enacted a law dealing with anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AMLKFT) and is now largely compliant with the legal and institutional framework of AML/CFT requirements.30 A detailed AMLKFT assessment conducted during the FSAP commended the government for its responsiveness to the international call for AMWCFT measures, including concerted efforts in quickly passing legislation and establishing plans for a financial intelligence unit (FIU) in the central bank. However, implementing regulations and other follow-through actions are needed, and the authorities have requested technical assistance, including in regard to making the FIU functional.31 35. The insurance and stock markets, while sound, would benefit from further privatization. The insurance sector, while solid and reasonably efficient, is dominated by large state-owned companies, and subject to low product innovation. Evaluations for privatizing these institutions have been conducted, and the staff supports the authorities’ plans to complete the sales speedily, when market conditions permit. The stock market is a relatively dynamic institution, though prices and volumes have been in decline in recent years. While market capitalization is high, the pool of traded, liquid shares is more modest, and acceleration of the privatization program could help deepen the market. report, in the future, to the President, rather than the Prime Minister, in part to strengthen the hand of the central bank in dealing with loan problems arising from banking fraud. 2X This would involve addressing the currently excessive operating costs of the banks, and making loans only on commercial terms (rather than based on social or other grounds). Parallel steps to strengthen the operation of the largest loss-making state enterprises would also be important, as discussed above. 29 In the banking sector, the FSAP recommendations also include a tightening of connected lending rules, and a progressive reduction of the high reserve requirements (as monetary conditions permit). 3o In June 2001, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) included Egypt in its list on non-cooperating countries and territories that do not meet FATF requirements for anti-money laundering. 3’ A number of countries have offered expertise on operating the FIU.

The money market has been handicapped by market rigidities, but reforms are in train. The treasury bill market is undeveloped, with auctions that have been highly managed, resulting in inflexible interest rates that have diverged substantially from time-to- time from interbank rates. The dematerialization of trading in government debt from mid-2002, and the prospective establishment shortly of a primary dealer market for treasury bills may help improve the functioning of the government debt market, but only if the interest rate is freely market determined. 37. Credit markets could also be developed by better enforcement of creditor rights and strengthening the functioning of legal and judicial systems. The FSAP assessment recommended improving credit information, through expanded scope and access to the credit registry run by the Central Bank of Egypt, in addition to the technical improvements expected to be in place by the end of the year. The authorities welcomed the FSAP review in these broader financial areas, and asked the staff to provide a draft action plan for financial sector reform. C. Fiscal Reform 38. A number of important steps are being taken to address the deteriorating fiscal accounts. Particular emphasis is being given to tackling the lack of buoyancy in general government current revenues, which have declined from 29 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to an estimated 26 percent of GDP in 2001/02. The general sales tax (GST) was extended to the wholesale and retail sectors in 2001 and consideration is being given to reducing the number of GST rates as a transition toward unification. The staff has urged the authorities to convert the GST to a full VAT, which would involve introducing input crediting at all stages of the production process and unifying the treatment of all goods and services under the tax. A new income tax law is expected to be submitted to parliament in late-2002. The draft law will seek to streamline the number of personal tax bands and unify the treatment of personal incomes; unify corporate tax rates (with the exception of the oil sector); and streamline the range of tax exemptions granted in the areas of corporate investment, employment, pension contributions, and listing on the stock exchange. The tax-exempt nature of interest earnings is also being reviewed. In addition, important efforts to strengthen tax administration are in progress. The “Model Customs and Tax Center” (MCTC), which should be operational in the months ahead, will integrate the incomes, sales, and customs taxation of the largest taxpayers and could be a testing ground for new tax procedures. A program of customs administration and tariff reform has also been launched (paragraph 40). 39. The social insurance system will be reviewed in 2002/03 to identify the reforms needed to ensure medium-term sustainability. Over the past three years, benefit payments under the state social insurance system have risen at a 15-20 percent annual rate, reflecting annual adjustments to pensions well in excess of inflation as well as the early retirement Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 36 - program. This has substantially exceeded the growth rate of contributions, requiring a growing allocation from the budget. The authorities intend to review the sustainability of the contribution and benefit rates under the current regime, as well as the institutional arrangements for managing the social insurance funds’ investment portfolios. This review will address, among other things, the role of the National Investment Bank (NIB) in managing the investments of the social insurance system. Consideration will also be given to the need for technical assistance. D. Strengthening the Business Environment 40. Reforms of tariff policy and customs administration are being launched to improve the business environment in the trade sector. The authorities have initiated a three-year work plan, with Fund technical assistance, to modernize and streamline Egypt’s customs administration.32 Within the first six months of the plan (by end-March 2003), short-term operational improvements will be introduced, including pilot testing new customs procedures in the MCTC, extending customs operating hours in the port of Alexandria, and streamlining data entry and payment arrangements. In addition, the drafting of a new customs law will be completed by end-December 2002, and will be presented to parliament in 2003. At the same time, technical assistance in the coming months will help in the design of tariff reform, which is intended to reduce the number of tariff rates, narrow dispersion, and, over time, lower the average rate. This approach should be applied on a multilateral basis, ideally ahead of the liberalization envisaged under the association agreement with the European Union.33 The authorities intend to give a high priority to these reforms and an action plan has been developed, which may be supported by the EU and USAID. A new export promotion law simplifies drawback and technical inspections procedures. A new labor law, expected to be promulgated in the next parliamentary session, introduces some measure of labor market flexibility. Further, an economic zones law providing a reformed system of tax incentives to businesses and an intellectual property rights law were passed in 2002. E. Poverty Alleviation 41. The authorities completed in June 2002, in collaboration with the World Bank, an updated survey of poverty in Egypt. This survey found a decline of almost 3 percentage points in the percentage of households in poverty between 1995/96 and 1999/2000 (Table 11). This reflected a substantial decline in poverty in the cities and the north of Egypt, more than offsetting a deterioration in the south. Inequality, measured by the GINI coefficient, increased slightly between 1995/96 and 1999/2000, but remained comparable to levels in other middle-income countries. 32 The program will introduce modern customs procedures based on full self-assessment, selective verification, automated processing, and post-release audits and controls.

In this regard, the report emphasizes the importance of education and the further development of Egypt’s safety net arrangements. V. STAFF APPRAISAL 42. Efforts to establish supportive policies for economic recovery were set back in 2001/02 in the context of the adverse impact of 9-11. Although a modest economic recovery may be in train, this is not yet deep-rooted, and a further strengthening will be critical. There is presently little leeway for expansionary fiscal or monetary policy, given the budget’s already high use of bank financing and the need for cautious monetary policy to underpin the move to greater exchange rate flexibility. Structural reforms focused on improving the business environment could make an important contribution, however. A recovery in real GDP growth to around 3%--4 percent this year and 5-5lY2 percent over the medium term appears achievable, though this would require a substantial strengthening of policies, including in the structural area. This growth outcome would be sufficient to strengthen living standards through rising real wages while also reducing unemployment over time. Without efforts to strengthen policies, or with further external shocks, the recovery in growth might be more muted, and insufficient to prevent a continuing increase in unemployment. Given the uncertain regional situation, consideration should be given to designing a policy framework for coping with further shocks that could again disrupt tourism and other foreign exchange receipts. 43. Greater exchange rate flexibility is a priority. The staff welcomes the exchange rate adjustment achieved over the past 2 years, which has reversed about one-half of the real effective appreciation of the pound during the 1990s. However, the exchange rate regime has not kept pace with market developments since 9-l 1. The resulting segmentation of the exchange market appears to represent a significant business impediment, partly eroding the gains in competitiveness resulting from the more depreciated exchange rate. The authorities are urged to give a high priority to early reunification of the exchange market and establishment of a regime under which the exchange rate is appropriately responsive to market conditions. While a number of supporting institutional reforms will be needed over time, many can be adopted in parallel with, or subsequent to exchange rate flexibility, and they should not be a cause for significant delay. The authorities are also urged to eliminate Egypt’s exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices, and to move toward accepting the obligations of Article VIII. The staff does not recommend approval of the identified exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices, given the absence of a clear timetable for their removal. 44. Greater exchange rate flexibility should be accompanied by steps to strengthen monetary policy as an alternative nominal anchor. As a step toward inflation targeting, the authorities are encouraged to focus liquidity management on the monetary aggregates, which may, at the present time, be the most useful intermediate target. This approach would need to be operated flexibly, with a range of indicators monitored closely to identify possible Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 39 - shifts in money demand. The conduct of an effective independent monetary policy will require further flexibility in domestic interest rates, as well as new tools for central bank liquidity management. 45. Following some easing of monetary policy after 9-11 to help support economic activity, somewhat slower broad money growth would be appropriate in 2002/03. Macroeconomic projections consistent with the 2002/03 fiscal outlook suggest broad money growth of about 9% percent would provide for an increase in private credit growth to support economic recovery, while, at the same time, limiting liquidity expansion to an amount consistent with a move to greater exchange rate flexibility. 46. The modest fiscal consolidation projected for 2002/03 is welcome as an initial contribution to strengthened fiscal performance, and should be consistent with supporting the incipient recovery in economic growth. In this connection, the authorities are urged to ensure the timely adoption of the remaining fiscal measures on which the projected 2002/03 fiscal outcome is based. Beyond 2002103, further fiscal strengthening appears necessary to address a number of strains on the budget, including a lack of revenue buoyancy, rapidly rising wage and domestic interest payments, and a deteriorating operating position in the social insurance funds. While a phased, multi-year adjustment appears appropriate, an emphasis should be given to early implementation, given the potential for less-favorable-than-projected economic performance or adverse fiscal developments. The authorities recognize these challenges, and are committed to a range of important structural fiscal reforms that could reinforce public finances over the next few years. The extension of the GST to the wholesale and retail levels was an important step forward and the authorities are encouraged to take the remaining steps to convert it to a full VAT. The proposed reforms of the income tax regime to unify the tax treatment of personal incomes and reduce income tax exemptions will also be important. Further, strong public expenditure management will be critical to ensuring fiscal sustainability and a key contribution will be made by the public expenditure review to be conducted in the year ahead with World Bank assistance. The development of a poverty reduction strategy with the Bank will also identify spending needs in priority social areas. Given Egypt’s already moderately high public debt ratio, and the potential for adverse dynamics as further borrowing adds to interest costs, the adequacy of the government’s measures to strengthen fiscal performance will need to be kept under close review, and reconsidered, as necessary, in light of new information on fiscal and macroeconomic performance. 47. Further structural reforms will be needed to establish Egypt as a prime business location in the MENA region. Egypt has many advantages, including a large domestic market, a low-cost and generally well-educated labor force, and a favorable location between the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. However, its competitiveness is currently hampered by very high tariff and nontariff trade barriers, burdensome procedures for tax compliance, extensive bureaucracy and red tape, and the current inflexibility of the exchange regime which prevents the exchange rate from adjusting to a level that can ensure competitiveness. While steps have been taken to mitigate these problems for new investors through various tax, tariff, and other exemptions, this has narrowed the tax base and introduced market Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 40 - distortions. Recent progress in developing an action plan for modernizing and streamlining customs administration is welcome. The authorities are urged to complement this with a substantial reduction in Egypt’s excessively high tariffs and further measures to eliminate burdensome nontariff trade impediments. Looking forward, the focus should be on strengthening the business environment across-the-board. To support this goal, early planning is needed on managing the transition of inefficient enterprises to a more open, competitive economy. 48. Privatization and enterprise restructuring remain important. Although the public enterprise sector is much smaller than a decade ago, further downsizing will be important as part of the move to a more market-oriented economy. The recent downturn in privatization proceeds partly reflects the more difficult global environment, and the authorities’ willingness to explore new restructuring options are welcome. At the same time, the opportunity should be taken to develop and initiate plans for longer-term restructuring and privatization, including of the large loss-making public enterprises, the large state banks and insurance companies, and selected public economic authorities and utilities. 49. Egypt’s participation in the FSAP has been welcome, and confirms that considerable progress has already been made in strengthening financial institutions. The joint work between the FSAP team and authorities contributed to the further development of existing supervisory procedures, and identified priorities for reform. Although banking indicators have deteriorated over the past three years, the risks of financial crisis appear low, with major bank failures seen as unlikely except in the event of a very substantial further worsening in loan performance. At the same time, weaknesses in the largest state commercial banks prevent them from playing the central role that they should in financial development. Reflecting a history of restructured loans and high operating costs, their profitability is low, and loan recovery rates could prove lower than currently allowed for in the statements of accounts. If not addressed, these conditions could become a growing liability to the budget, and the authorities are strongly urged to conduct intensified audits to clarify loan quality, further strengthen management, and shift more clearly to market-based performance goals for the state banks. These steps would pave the way for subsequent bank privatization. More immediately, progress should be made in selling public holdings in the joint venture banks, which are in a relatively stronger financial position. 50. While progress is underway in improving Egypt’s macroeconomic database, further improvements are needed. In the fiscal sector, concerns remain about the ability of the reporting system to adequately capture fiscal developments in a comprehensive and timely manner. As data weaknesses continue to complicate fiscal analysis, including of the medium-term fiscal outlook, further improvements are needed, and discussions will continue on discrepancy and other items in the accounts. The need for strengthened fiscal transparency, highlighted in earlier consultations, remains a priority, including for the NIB and other off-budget fiscal entities. The public and staff should be provided with supporting fiscal information, including the audited year-end treasury statements, after parliamentary approval. A review of the fiscal data for 1997/98 and earlier years for which discrepancies remain in the fiscal and debt data is needed to resolve issues relating to the reporting of fiscal Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-4l- data under past arrangements. As the authorities have indicated that this will only be possible after the ongoing audit of the activities of the NIB, completion of which has been delayed until later this year, the audit should be given a high priority and further delays avoided. The revision of the fiscal data for 1997/98 and earlier years should be implemented promptly on completion of the NIE3 audit. The authorities have indicated that they are considering publication of the fiscal ROSC, completed in 2001; this would be welcome. 51. In the real sector, the new monthly index of industrial production should be disseminated, and surveys launched to measure activity in the service sector: tbis will assist in the development of quarterly GDP data. In the external sector, accounts for Egypt’s international investment position should be developed, and the data template recently developed on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity should be disseminated. The authorities are encouraged to move toward subscription to the SDDS at an early date. 52. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

Given the country’s cautious external borrowing strategy and Egypt’s graduation from IDA in 1999, the Bank’s lending is modest in relation to the size and importance of the country. However, the Government values Bank lending because of: (i) the technical expertise and experience of other countries it brings with it; and (ii) its service as a catalyst for mobilizing soft loan packages for well-designed and high priority projects. As the size of the Bank portfolio decreases, the Bank will channel the share of its resources to knowledge- based, non-lending activities which are high priority for the Government. 2. The World Bank’s Board of Directors endorsed on July 3, 2001 the Country Assistance Strategy for Egypt for the period FY02-FY04. In view of Egypt’s goal to reduce unemployment and raising living standards, two areas were identified for Bank lending: (i) development of human resources; and (ii) natural resource management. In support of these objectives, the Bank Group will provide a range of financial instruments (loans, credits, guarantees, etc.), and assistance in aid coordination and economic policy advice. On February 5-6, 2002, the Bank co-chaired a donor Consultative Group meeting, which was successful in raising about US$lO billion for Egypt for the period 2002-2004. 3. As of May 3 1,2002, the World Bank had financed for Egypt about 105 projects, totaling about US$5.1 billion (excluding grants and cancellations), of which US$4.3 billion has been disbursed and about US$707 million remain undisbursed. Sectoral composition of the current portfolio is as follows: 48 percent by value for Agriculture, 23 percent for Education, 13 percent for Health/Nutrition/Population, 7 percent for Urban Development, 5 percent for Social Protection, and 4 percent for Environment. Although the disbursement ratio has improved (from 5.9 percent in FY2001 to 6.4 percent and will reach 7.5 percent by the end of FY2002), overall portfolio performance has somewhat deteriorated in FY2002, reflecting problems with effectiveness delays and largely the implementation issues of six out of 18 projects in the portfolio. A country portfolio performance review (CPPR) in May 2002 addressed the issues that affect the implementation of projects in the portfolio. 4. IFC is actively involved in Egypt with 20 operations in the portfolio. Current held exposure amounts to US$330 million for IFC’s own account (excluding the risk management and guarantee products which amount to US$48 million) and another US$305 million for the account of participants in IFC’s B-loan program (see below--Statement of IFC Held & Disbursed Portfolio). Recently, IFC has focused on infrastructure and financial sectors with investment in a leasing company, a life insurance company, an investment bank, and a credit rating agency. 5.

National accounts data are compiled annually by the Ministry of Planning, on fiscal year basis, in current and constant prices. Their shortcomings in terms of timeliness and availability pose serious challenges for macroeconomic management and surveillance in Egypt. A multi-sector statistics mission by STA in February 1999 found that much work still needs to be done to improve national accounts statistics, a conclusion confirmed by an August 2000 STA mission. As part of the ongoing USAID project on national accounts statistics, a training program is in place and a new computer system is being developed, under the supervision of a team of long-term USAID experts. Quarterly national accounts estimates are not compiled on a regular basis, in part because of the absence of timely, high frequency data on economic activity. Progress on the latter is underway, with the launch in 2002 of a monthly survey to compile an index of industrial production. This index is not yet published. 2. Price and employment statistics. The CPI weights were revised in July 1998 to eliminate a calculation error identified by a February 1997 STA mission.* Further efforts are still required to replace the wholesale price index with a producer price index and to improve the external trade price indices (the latter are unreliable and available only annually). Data on employment are available with a lag. 3. Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics. The BOP statistics compiled by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and reported to the Fund have been revised with Fund technical assistance in accordance with the methodology suggested in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The 1999 multisector statistics mission found that coverage and classification of the BOP data seemed to have deteriorated following the liberalization of the exchange regime as evidenced by the sharp increase in net errors and omissions;’ subsequently, the latter have diminished, however. The February 1999 STA mission left a number of recommendations, which included that (i) the CBE explore using trade statistics compiled by Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) in cooperation with the Customs Administration; no progress has been made on this to date; (ii) trade data be adjusted by including the free zones’ export and imports with the rest of the world; (iii) commercial banks be requested to improve the coverage and classification of foreign exchange transactions conducted through them; and .(iv) the CBE be empowered with legal authority to collect data from nonbanking sectors of the economy; this was required to enable the CBE to conduct surveys of major enterprises needed to improve the coverage of foreign direct investment and private nonguaranteed debt. ’ The revised series shows a slightly higher increase in prices-O.7 percent over a 1Zmonth period. ’ With foreign exchange liberalization, banks do not get full details of transactions either from the customers or from the overseas correspondents. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:58 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public-47 - APPENDIX III 4. External Debt and International investment position data. Comprehensive data are compiled on public-and publicly guaranteed external debt through a mandatory reporting system. However, reporting on, nonguaranteed debt is voluntary and incomplete. The authorities are drawing on advice from Fund staff and other outside advisers on forming a strategy to strengthen the reporting system. The compilation of data on the BP, primarily a responsibility of the CBE, appears to be critically hampered by the almost complete lack of data on FDI stocks. At the time of the STA mission in late May 2002, a commitment was made by the CBE to address this issue, which requires inter-agency coordination. 6. Fiscal data. Questions arose in the 2000 Article IV consultation as to whether the fiscal data provided by the authorities were adequate for surveillance.3 Subsequently, an updated comprehensive fiscal reporting framework has been developed with the authorities, covering fiscal data from 1998/99 onwards. Data for earlier years, for which discrepancies between debt and financing data also exist, have not been revised. In 2001, the authorities began to use the new fiscal reporting framework for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data. Refinements in the calculations of government financing were made in early 2002, but further progress is needed to ensure the accuracy and internal consistency of different source data on interactions between the budget, National Investment Bank (NIB) and social insurance funds (SIFs), and to compile data on the operations of the public economic authorities. Egypt does not report fiscal data for publication in IFS; annual data in IFS are obtained from the GFS Yearbook. Fiscal data are reported primarily on a cash basis. However investment expenditures in the budget sector and the accounts of the NIB and the SIFs are reported on an accruals basis. 7. Monetary statistics. The statistics are comprehensive and reported regularly. 8. Data dissemination. The authorities are working with USAID-financed resident experts on a comprehensive program for subscribing to the SDDS. Draft metadata sheets were provided in early 2002 for review by the Fund, and STA held preliminary discussions with the Egyptian SDDS team in Cairo in May 2002. Based on this assessment, subscription to the SDDS appears possible as early as January 2003 (though more likely in mid-2003). This goal would require progress on two key issues-ompilation and dissemination of data on Egypt’s international investment position (BP) (which could take considerable work) and dissemination of a reserve template (which should be more straightforward, as a draft was compiled in collaboration with the staff in January 2002). 9. Data ROSC. Consideration is being given to Egypt’s participation in the data ROSC program, possibly in February/March 2003 to prepare for SDDS subscription expected in mid-2003. 3 A key issue was the apparent discrepancy between data on government financing and on government debt, which led to upward revision of the fiscal deficit for 1998/99.

C. 20431 USA IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt On [Month, dd, yyyy], the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt.’ Background The events of 9-11 represented a setback for Egypt’s efforts to restore growth and external balance. During the preceding three-year period, external shocks and a deteriorating policy mix had resulted in balance of payments pressures, a sizeable loss of reserves, and slowing economic growth. By mid-2001, appropriate macroeconomic policies were being put in place: credit growth had been slowed; exchange rate flexibility had permitted a 25 percent depreciation against the U.S. dollar (after a decade-long peg); and a program of fiscal structural reforms had been launched to address lagging revenue performance. However, following 9-l 1, adjustments to the currency band failed to keep pace with market developments, and shortages of foreign currency in the official exchange market gave rise to a somewhat more depreciated parallel exchange market. At the same time, lower l Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the [Month, dd, yyyy] Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Consumer price inflation remained low, at under 3 percent. The fiscal deficit widened slightly in 2001/02, partly reflecting the operation of the automatic stabilizers as growth slowed after 9-11. Fiscal estimates for 2001/02 developed with the authorities show an overall deficit of 5.8 percent of GDP at the level of the budget sector and 2.5 percent of GDP at the level of the consolidated general government (which includes the outlays of the National Investment Bank (NIB) and the General Authority for Supply of Commodities (GASC), as well as financing received by the Social Insurance Funds (SIFs)); both outcomes represent increases of about 0.3 percent of GDP relative to a year earlier. Despite some reduction compared to last year, bank financing of the budget remained high, at around 5.4 percent of GDP, representing around half of total credit expansion by the banking sector. At the level of the government, after netting out obligations to the SIFs, and public sector claims on the central bank against foreign liabilities, public debt amounted to around 57 percent at end-2001/02. Monetary conditions were initially relaxed following 9-l 1 to help support economic activity, although this easing was reversed from end-2001. Broad money growth increased by 2 percentage point compared to last year, to about 11 percent in 2001/02, adjusted for exchange rate effects on foreign currency accounts. This permitted private sector credit growth of about 8 percent, excluding exchange rate revaluation effects, up from 7.4 percent a year earlier. Exchange rate management was complicated in 2001/02 by the impact of 9-l 1. A 9 percent depreciation in December 2001 proved inadequate to eliminate currency shortages in the official market and a parallel currency market has become established. After considerable volatility in the parallel market exchange rate in early 2002, the exchange rate has subsequently stabilized at a level 5-10 percent more depreciated than in the official market. Although significant, the impact of 9-l 1 on Egypt’s balance of payments was smaller than initially projected. Balance of payments projections developed with the authorities after 9-l 1 showed an overall deficit of US$I .8 billion in 2001/02 (2.1 percent of GDP), while the outturn was just US$O.8 billion (0.9 percent of GDP). While this partly reflected a faster- than-projected recovery in tourism, the largest factor was a larger-than-projected decline in non-oil imports, reflecting Egypt’s slowing growth, more depreciated exchange rate, and the impact of foreign currency shortages. Net international reserves amounted to about US$14 billion at end-June 2002, largely unchanged from a year earlier, and over three times the level of short-term foreign debt.
