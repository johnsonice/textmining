The context l The adjustment effort has been intensified in 1995 mainly through substantial increases in prices of publicly supplied goods and services. The budget and the external current account deficits are expected to be halved to 5 percent and 4 percent of GDP, respectively. Foreign debt has been repaid and payment delays to domestic contractors regularized. The differential between domestic and international market interest rates has narrowed to 16-27 basis points. However, reflecting budgetary developments, domestic public debt grew rapidly to 77 percent of GDP et end-1994 and is projected to rise to 81 percent of GDP at end-1995. Moreover, the real non- oil GDP is expected to remain flat after a small decline in 1994. . Despite the commendable adjustment in 1995, under unchanged policies, domestic public debt would increase deepening structural rigidities of the budget, and reducing the availability of resources for the private sector investment. Such developments would increase pressures on foreign assets with possible adverse effects on exchange rate stability. These developments would be inconsistent with the authorities' objective of achieving self-sustaining growth of the non-oil private sector which is crucial to providing productive employment to the rapidly expanding indigenous population. . Responding to these challenges, the authorities intend to eliminate the budget deficit by the year 2000 as specified in the Sixth Development Plan (1995-2000) mainly through further expenditure rationalization, upward adjustments in the utility rates and fees and charges, and improved collection, while taking steps to establish a solid basis for economic growth in the period ahead. 2. Policv discussions l The policy discussions focused on 0 fiscal policies to eliminate macroeconomic imbalances in the medium term and improve the structure of the budget; . structural reform policies to promote self-sustaining growth; and . the need to further improve the data base. l In view of the risks associated with oil price volatility and the need to improve the structure of the budget, the staff supports a front- loaded strengthening of the adjustment effort through measures to increase the size of non-oil revenues, reduce expenditures, and increase the share devoted to capital outlays and manpower training.

Increases in utility prices and elimination of subsidies to facilitate a better resource allocation need to be accompanied by liberalization of rules on foreign portfolio investment, reforms aimed at deepening and widening financial and securities markets. and a well-defined privatization program. l Important improvements have been made in the currentness and coverage of data and their provision to the staff. Fund technical assistance can help in improving balance of payments statistics. The ongoing review of developments in Saudi Arabia in-between consultations vould benefit from the more frequent provision of data on core economic indicators.

Introduction u In concluding the 1994 Article IV consultation with Saudi Arabia on October 27, 1994 (SUR/94/125), Executive Directors emphasized that en early intensification of fiscal adjustment was needed to reduce the budget end external current account deficits end to preserve a noninflationary environment with exchange rate stability. Such adjustment was particularly necessary because of the volatility of oil revenues and the need to increase capital outlays. They celled for measures to raise non-oil revenues, accelerate privatization. and further cut unproductive expenditure. Self- sustaining private sector activity was viewed as essential if employment opportunities for the growing population were to be created. Directors also emphasized that, given the size and global importance of the Saudi Arabian economy, there was need for the provision of more detailed end current information to the Fund on developments in the economy. The 1995 Article IV consultation discussions covered: (1) recent economic end policy developments; (2) scenarios of additional macroeconomic adjustment efforts; (3) steps to further improve the climate for private sector activity; end (4) statistical issues. u The consultation discussions benefited from an improvement in the currentness end quality of data. II. Background After the Gulf war, the authorities resumed their budgetary adjustment efforts in order to contain the buildup of public debt, reduce the external current account deficit, and limit the loss of foreign assets. However, with the weakening of oil prices, the budget end the external current account deficits remained large. Total public debt rose rapidly while non- oil GDP stagnated and net official foreign assets declined. I/ Saudi Arabia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, end 4 on March 22, 1961. Saudi Arabia's relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II, respectively, end background data are presented in Appendix III. g The 1995 Article consultation discussions with Saudi Arabia were held in Riyadh during June 29.July 5, 1995. The staff representatives were: Messrs. Chabrier (Head), Iqbal, Erbas, Enger. Mukhopadhyay (all of MED), Smith (RES), end Ms. Allen (Administrative Assistant-SEC). Mr. El-Erian (MED) also participated in some of the meetings. The authorities were represented by H.E. Sheikh Mohammed Abalkhail, Minist*!r of Finance and National Economy; H.E. Sheikh Hamad Al-Sayari, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA); the Vice Minister of Finance and National Economy; Deputy Ministers of the Ministries of Finance and National Economy, Agriculture. and Petroleum; end other senior government officials.

The reduction reflected broad-based cuts in expenditure--in particular. outlays on services and supplies, operations and maintenance, and subsidies. As in the pest, the budget was financed through sales of government bonds and treasury bills to the Autonomous Government Institutions (AGIs) and the commercial banks. Domestic debt rose to the equivalent of 77 percent of GDP at end-1994, up from 65 percent of GDP et end-1993. of which about three fourths was owed to the AGIs (Table 2). Despite a 13 percent expansion of credit, growth of broad money remained low et about 3 percent in 1994 as commercial banks drew down their net foreign assets. 1/ Reflecting these developments, commercial banks' loans/deposits ratio slightly exceeded the SAMA guidelines (60 percent), while foreign assets/total assets ratio dropped further to 31 percent from 37 percent in 1993. Real non-oil GDP was stagnant in 1994 as the coming on stream of private sector investment undertaken during 1992.93 was offset by the impact of the fiscal retrenchment (Appendix III, Chart 1). The savings/investment balance also underwent significant changes (Table 3). According to preliminary data. while aggregate domestic savings remained nearly unchanged at 29 percent of GDP, investment declined to 20 percent of GDP from en average of 23 percent during 1992-93 as a result of the decline in government investment es well es the decline in private investment reflecting the drawdown of inventories end the completion of investment projects. Inflation, es measured by the cost of living index, remained low et less then 1 percent in 1994. The external current account deficit was almost halved to 8 percent of GDP in 1994 (Table 4). The decline in oil export receipts was matched by an 18 percent increase in non-oil exports owing largely to the increase in exports of petrochemicals end other manufactures. At the same time, merchandise end service imports fell by 16 percent, due mainly to the lower government expenditure, the drawdown of the existing stock of imported capital goods, end the real effective depreciation of the Saudi Arabian riyal. While commercial banks' net foreign assets were drawn down by about US$4 billion, net official foreign assets rose by about USS1.3 billion to US$70 billion (or the equivalent of more than three years of merchandise imports) of which about a quarter is held as currency cover. IJ The increase in credit to the private sector in 1994 reflected in part the delay in government payments to private contractors amounting to SRls 3.5 billion which were regularized in early 1995 through the issue of special medium-term bonds to commercial banks.

At the same time, the structure of the budget continued to be weak owing to the heavy dependence on oil revenues, the growing costs of debt servicing, and the downward inflexibility of the wage bill. Accordingly, the adjustment effort was intensified in 1995. In a break from the past, the budget involved significant steps to raise non- oil revenue through substantial increases in the domestic price of petroleum products; water, electricity. postal, and telephone charges; and in various licenses and other fees applied to foreign workers to be paid by domestic employers. As a result, and given further expenditure reduction plans, the budget envisaged a reduction in the overall deficit to 2 percent of GDP. Staff estimates based on fiscal developments in the first quarter of the year and other indicators suggest that, for the year as a whole, oil revenues would be higher than budgeted and the non-oil revenue target would be achieved. HOWeVe+ ( as expenditure reductions are likely to fall short of the budgeted level due to downward rigidities in some current outlays (especially wages and salaries), the budget deficit is projected by the staff at 5 percent of GDP. Reflecting a brisk pickup in oil export prices. oil export receipts are projected to increase in 1995 by 9 percent to about US$40 billion. while imports would continue at about the same level as in 1994 on account of the budgetary restraint, the external current account deficit would further decline to 4 percent of GDP. At end-March 1995, the latest period for which data are available, net official foreign assets had increased to US$73 billion. Real non-oil GDP is projected to be broadly unchanged and the underlying rate of inflation would remain low while the cost of living index would reach about 5 percent in 1995 on account of the upward adjustments in the prices of publicly supplied goods and services. Reflecting the continued slow output growth, broad money is expected to expand at about the same rate as in 1994. The differential between domestic and international interest rates narrowed to 16-27 basis points by Hay 1995 and narrowed further in June. 1/ Saudi Arabia maintains an exchange and trade system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current and international transactions and on capital transactions. 2/ Its exchange rate policy has remained unchanged for several years and has been guided by the broad 1/ As a result of speculative pressures prior to the 1994 budget announcement, the average differential between the 3-month Saudi riyal deposit rate and the 3.month Eurodollar deposit rate rose to 1.24 percent in the last quarter of 1993. to decline to 0.45 percent in the first quarter of 1994. For similar reasons, the average differential rose to 0.89 percent in the fourth quarter of 1994. u Except for those notified to the Fund by the authorities in accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144.(52/51) in connection with restrictions vis-8-vis the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Hontenegro) and Iraq.

In line with these objectives, the Saudi riyal has been effectively pegged at the exchange rate of SRls 3.745 - US$l.OO. implying a real effective depreciation of the riyal by about 7 percent during the 12-month period ended in May 1995 (Chart 2). III. Medium-Term Prospects and Discussion of Policies The authorities stressed that the measures taken in 1995 had been favorably received by the private sector and that there was a general consensus in the society for continued adjustment efforts. Accordingly, they reaffirmed their determination to eliminate the budget deficit by the year 2000 as specified in the just announced Sixth Development Plan (1995. 2000) and to establish a solid base for ensuring self-sustaining private sector-led growth. This would be undertaken through increased private sector participation and economic diversification. The Plan also calls for an improvement in the performance of utilities, the completion of ongoing infrastructural projects to support private sector growth, and the development of human resources in order to meet the skill requirements of the economy and to facilitate Saudiization of the labor force. In order to assist the discussion on the required adjustment effort, mediumterm projections were prepared. Based on the latest WE0 assumptions, these projections showed that, in the absence of further policy reinforcement. the budget deficit would grow by the year 2000 to about 10 percent of GDP and the public debt to 110 percent of GDP (Table 1 and Appendix IV). This reflects, in part, the upward drift in expenditures on the wage bill and interest payments. The projected weakness of oil prices is also *n important factor. The external current account deficit would increase to an annual average of about 7 percent of GDP, implying a cumulative current account deficit of about US$50 billion during 1995.2000 (Table 4). Since it is official policy not to draw down net official foreign assets from the end-1994 level, this would need to be matched by private capital inflows or official external borrowing. Such macroeconomic imbalances would worsen the structural rigidities of the budget, increase its vulnerability to oil price developments, and prevent the needed increase in maintenance and capital outlays. lJ This would crowd out the private sector. refuel pressures on the exchange rate and, more generally, be inconsistent with the authorities' objective of achieving self-sustaining growth of the non-oil private sector. I/ A US$l per barrel change in oil export price would, other things remaining unchanged, imply a change in oil export receipts of USS2.7 billion per year during 1995-2000.

On the demand side, uncertainties relate to possible increases in carbon taxes, the magnitude of global economic expansion, and the level of natural gas production. On the supply side, uncertainties concern the level of exports from the Former Soviet Union, Iraq's possible re-entry into the oil market, as well as developments in the production capacity of non-OPEC producers. In this overall framework, policy discussions focused on (1) fiscal policies to eliminate macroeconomic imbalances and improve the structure of the budget, and (2) policies in the financial and real sectors to promote self-sustaining grovth. The staff also reviewed with the authorities the need to further improve the data base. 1. Financial uolicies a. Fiscal policies The authorities are committed to further adjustment efforts by building on the measures implemented in 1995. Recognizing the vulnerability of the economy to the potential volatility of oil export earnings, the official adjustment strategy will focus on further increasing non-oil revenues and the containment of expenditures. Revenues would be mobilized mainly through adjustments in the fees and charges for publicly supplied goods and services (including utilities) rather than through new taxes. Such an approach would also improve resource allocation and promote efficiency. Moreover, there is ample scope for improving revenue collection. The objective of reducing expenditures would be pursued irrespective of oil price developments. To this end, the Government intends to continuously review administrative measures (such as mergers of government departments), re-prioritize projects, and further reduce subsidies (especially to wheat production). However. the authorities noted that lowering the wage bill, as called for in the Sixth Plan, was a difficult task that would have to be Linked to the process of enhancing employment opportunities in the private sector. The mission supported the thrust of the official strategy but cautioned that it might not be sufficient to fully achieve the medium-term targets. It presented to the authorities an alternative scenario under which fiscal policy aims at a more ambitious improvement in the budget structure. The revenue structure could be strengthened by the introduction of a consumption tax, a turnover tax, selected excise duties, and further increases in the domestic prices of petroleum products as well as fees and charges. These measures would be supplemented by a reduction in expenditures--in particular the wage bill--and shift in composition toward infrastructure and education. Since the introduction of some of the proposed tax measures would require considerable preparation, expenditure reductions and price increases would have to be accorded a greater role in the short run. If adopted, these measures could result in revenue enhancement of 2-3 percent of GDP while reducing expenditures by about 4 percent of GDP over the next five years.

The intensified fiscal retrenchment would initially have a dampening effect on growth. However, by increasing access to financing for the private sector. and if accompanied by additional structural reforms in the real and financial sectors, it would allow a recovery in real non-oil GDP growth to 2-3 percent per year in 1997-2000. The external current account would improve to near balance by 2000. Consequently, the cumulative current account deficit during 1995-2000 would be reduced to about US$16 billion which could be financed through private capital inflows. The authorities indicated that B number of the adjustment measures recommended by the mission were already under consideration by the Cabinet. some of which could be included in the 1996 budget. However, no new taxes were likely to be adopted; indeed, the prevailing opinion was that the existing customs duties served as an adequate tax on consumption. b. Monetarv uolicv and the financial sector The authorities underscored that monetary policy would continue to be directed toward supporting the tightened fiscal policy in order to ensure the stability of the exchange rate and to maintain confidence in the domestic financial system. These objectives would be addressed through prudent regulation of liquidity in an environment free of restrictions and effective bank regulation and supervision. A significant part of the recent government borrowing has been financed by commercial banks. This, along with the brisk rise in credit to the private sector. has led to a drawdown of commercial banks' foreign assets and an increase in their loans-to-deposit ratio above the 60 percent guideline. lJ The authorities believe that these developments do not undermine the stability of the banks' portfolio or weaken their asset position since their domestic assets (including government bonds and loans) were of high quality and offered higher yields than foreign assets. The authorities viewed that, given the tightened fiscal stance in 1995, banks would be able to meet the additional private sector credit demand without unbalancing their asset portfolios. Although no significant changes had taken place in bank regulation and supervision, the Government was closely scrutinfzing banks' involvement in the international derivatives markets with a view to adopting regulatory measures in line with those in major industrial countries. u The ratio of foreign currency liabilities (including foreign currency deposits) to foreign assets rose from 77 percent in 1993 to 83 percent in 1994, owing in large part to the drawdown of foreign assets. This trend continued in the first quarter of 1995. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- ,3- Table 5.

The staff indicated that opening the stock market to foreign competition and creating secondary markets for government bonds would enhance liquidity. Similarly, improvements in accounting and disclosure requirements would enhance the efficiency of the stock market. The authorities indicated that, vhile there are few restrictions on capital movements. banks are expected to seek, for prudential reasons, SAMA’s approval for foreign loan syndications and syndications with foreign banks for domestic investments. They stressed that the banking system was flexible enough to provide a wide spectrum of services. While they viewed the available services in the ares of investment banking as adequate, they were striving for further development in the retail sector. The authorities asserted that since the economy was adequately banked and foreign banks were already effectively present through joint venture banks, there was no need to expand the sector through the establishment of additional domestic banks or permitting foreign banks to directly operate in the market. Turning to the stock market, the authorities indicated that there were no plans at present to open up the domestic stock market to direct international participation. Increased stock market activity would be encouraged through further expansion of the already available electronic trading network. Moreover, while the establishment of secondary markets for government bonds was favored, it had proved difficult due to the AGIs’ reluctance to trade their bond holdings and the banks’ access to a quasi- secondary market through the repurchase facility with SAMA; nevertheless, efforts toward establishing secondary markets would be continued. 2. Real sector policies The authorities recognise that the planned intensification of the adjustment effort would have a dampening effect on the growth of non-oil GDP, at least in the short run. This accentuates the importance of policies to facilitate self-sustaining private sector activity so that employment opportunities are developed for the rapidly growing Saudi population. lJ The growth strategy, as specified in the Sixth Development Plan, aims at instituting realistic prices for the publicly supplied utilities, progressively reducing implicit and explicit product subsidies, and privatizing State enterprises. There would be increasing reliance on direct income subsidies and social security payments to provide protection for the vulnerable groups. Public sector investment would focus on ensuring the availability of infrastructure and utilities. Spending on education and training would increase. lJ The authorities stressed that, although the Saudiization of the labor force was a priority. the Government’s liberal policy toward expatriate labor would remain unchanged. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 16 The authorities are in the process of developing a privatization program which covers, inter alla, the electricity and telecommunication companies and the national airline. At the same time, the policy of gradually increasing the private sector share in the equity of the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) is to be continued. Saudi Arabia's oil policies continue to aim at stabilizing crude oil prices and preserving the share of petroleum in the world primary energy market. The focus would be on collaboration with other major oil producers to ensure adequate supplies and avoid sharp fluctuations in prices. The authorities stressed the need for reciprocal policies in oil importing countries to foster stability in the global oil markets. They strongly oppose discriminatory carbon taxes in major oil importing countries which they view as inconsistent with long-term price stability. With domestic production capacity having reached 10 million barrels per d*y Wd). compared with actual production of 8 mbd. production is being shifted toward the more valuable lighter crudes. Production capacity would be expanded only if market developments suggested a durable increase in the world oil demand. In order to diversify the oil sector and to facilitate stability in oil earnings, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) is continuing with the acquisition of downstream foreign refining and marketing operations--including oil storage facilities in major oil markets. 3. External sector issues and policies The authorities reaffirmed their policy of maintaining a" open exchange and trade system. They intend to continue, for the time being, with the policy of effectively pegging the riyal to the U.S. dollar. By facilitating a rapid expansion in non-oil exports, which grew by 22 percent in 1994, this policy has helped in the adjustment effort. The authorities emphasized that, while a restrictive fiscal policy supported by prudent monetary policy would continue to underpin the stability of the exchange rate, the choice of exchange rate policy in the period ahead would be guided, as in the past, by the need to preserve competitiveness of the non-oil sector. Saudi Arabia's reserve management policies remained ""changed and continued to be directed at maintaining a stable currency and maturity composition of official foreign **sets. The authorities also noted that the process for accession to the World Trade Organization ('WTO) was underway. Owing to the increased financial constraints, Saudi Arabia's official external economic assistance declined in 1994 to less than 1 percent of GDP. The authorities indicated that the level of future assistance would be determined by the Government's budgetary situation. They added, however, that the assistance would remain highly concessional, untied, and directed mainly at promoting private sector-led growth in recipient countries.

Renional Issues tiring 1994. steps to foster greater economic integration among members of the GCC included: (1) extension of national treatment to all GCC citizens for equity-trading purposes; JJ (2) streamlining of regulations governing wholesale trade; and (3) authorisation for GCC nationals to engage in certain professional practices relating to health services in all member countries. Progress was also made in harmonising rules governing intellectual property rights and the settlement of business disputes within the GCC. In the period ahead, the focus will be on: (1) steps to generate employment opportunities for the growing populations of GCC countries; (2) expansion of industrial activity and intra-CCC trade; (3) increased technological cooperation and joint ventures; (4) extension of rules governing wholesale trade to retail trade; and (5) revitalisation of efforts toward the establishment of the Common External Tariff schedule. The European Union (ElJ)-CCC negotiations for the establishment of a free-trade area have remained stalled. The authorities indicated that the main problematic sreas related to (1) the discriminatory treatment of petroleum products relative to other sources of energy within the EU. and (2) inadequate access to EU countries for petrochemical exports from the GCC countries. V. Statistical Issues Progress has been made in 1995 to improve the currentness and coverage of data provided on the budgetary, monetary, and external accounts. The time lag has been shortened to three months for most financial statistics (Appendix V). Nevertheless, the authorities recognise that the coverage of certain data series remains weak owing to institutional limitations, inadequate statistical systems, and the openness of the economy which hinders data collection. In particular, estimates of the external current account and private capital flows remain incomplete due to the nonavailability of information about the size of private capital flows, private sector foreign assets. and investment income earned abroad. The authorities are fully cognizant of the need to further improve the quality and currentness of data. The staff discussed with the authorities a two-track approach to simultaneously address limitations of statistical systems, as well as the provision of data on a few core economic indicators on a more frequent basis. The authorities agreed to follow up on the staff's proposals. Brief staff visits between consultation discussions to collect data and exchange views with the authorities would also be useful. lJ While the decision concerning equity share trading would not formally link national stock exchanges, it will facilitate regional market convergence.

Staff ADDsSiSal Saudi Arabia made important progress during 1991-94 to reduce its macroeconomic imbalances through expenditure reduction. However, imbalances have remained large, resulting in a further increase in domestic public debt and a decline in net official foreign assets. In response, the authorities intensified the adjustment effort in 1995 by taking steps to raise non-oil revenues and further contain expenditure. These measures, aided by higher oil export prices, are projected to halve the fiscal and external current account deficits in 1995. The authorities are to be commended for the intensification of their adjustment effort in 1995. Not only does it create a firmer basis for reducing the budget deficit while improving its structure, but it also advances reforms needed to encourage private sector activity. The authorities are aware that, in the absence of further adjustment measures, substantial macroeconomic imbalances will persist. This is inconsistent with the realization of the objectives specified in the Sixth Development Plan (1995-2000). Domestic public debt would further increase, deepening the structural rigidities of the budget and reducing the availability of resources for private sector investment. Such developments would increase pressures on foreign assets with possible adverse effects on rhe exchange rate stability. In this context, the staff supports the authorities' objective of eliminating the budget deficit by the year 2000. Given large oil market uncertainties. which expose the economy to risks, the staff would emphasise the importance of a front-loaded adjustment effort building on the measures introduced in 1995. Such an effort should be based on measures to broaden the revenue base and reduce expenditure. While the authorities' plans in these areas are encouraging, the vulnerability of revenue to volatile oil prices calls for further increasing the size of non-oil revenues. Accordingly, the staff encourages the authorities to adopt broad-based consumption and turnover taxes. excise duties, and build upon the recent increase in domestic prices of petroleum products. Given the long gestation period required to implement some of the proposed tax measures. the balance in the short run to reduce the fiscal deficit would have to be in favor of price adjustments and additional expenditure cuts. This should also allow greater emphasis to be placed on capital outlays necessary for infra- structural development and the training of indigenous labor. The staff agrees with the authorities' intention to continue pursuing a prudent financial policy in support of their exchange rate policy aimed at ensuring the competitiveness of the non-oil sector. In order to address the possible short-term adverse effects of fiscal retrenchment on the non-oil sector and to establish a solid foundation for self-sustaining growth, the staff would encourage the authorities to speedily implement the structural reforms imbedded in the Sixth Development Plan. In particular, steps should be taken to establish a program for early privatization of state enterprises, relax rules governing foreign Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 19 portfolio investment, and continue efforts aimed at deepening and widening financial markets. Moreover, rationalizing incentive policies would help promote private sector growth and employment opportunities for the rapidly expanding population. Saudi Arabia is to be commended for having maintained a sizable foreign economic assistance program despite difficult financial constraints. The staff also commends the authorities on the maintenance of an open exchange and trade system. The staff welcomes the improvements in the currentness and coverage of data provided to the mission. However, some deficiencies remain which are largely attributable to weak statistical systems. The staff recommends a two-track approach to address data issues: First, to improve the quality and coverage of data on external transactions, Fund technical assistance will be useful in reviewing the balance of payments methodology and helping to establish appropriate institutional structures and procedures to collect data. Second, in order to facilitate the ongoing review of developments and prospects, the staff would encourage the authorities to provide to the Fund, with greater frequency, latest data on core economic indicators. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will take place on the standard 12.month cycle.

The program peaked at 32 staff years in FY 1985 and, in the last few years, stabilised at between 11 to 12 staff years. The allocation for FY 1995 is 12 staff years and is expected to do a little over 11 staff years. The World Bank's main counterpart has been the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (HOF). The major ongoing project is the Enhanced Financial System which aims at developing and integrating the budgeting and accounting systems of the MOF with a view to Saudiization of operations. Other continuing technical assistance activities are: the review of statistical processes and enhancement of computer systems of the Central Department of Statistics; National Plan follow-up and evaluation for the Ministry of Planning; completion of the housing sample survey for the Ministry of Public Works and Housing; a study to review available services and harmonize tariffs/fees in the GCC countries (requested by the General Secretariat of the GCC and financed through the Saudi Technical Cooperation Program); and technical assistance for national budget forecasting. New 1995 activities include a review of the efficiency of power systems operations and materials management, export promotion strategy, and operations and maintenance of public school facilities. It is expected that next year's program will include technical assistance for privatisation and PSD issues.

Summarv of findinas The purpose of the exercise was to project a possible progression for the budget and external current account deficits in order to ascertain whether the non-oil revenue measures adopted with the 1995 budget were sufficient to contain and eventually eliminate the internal and external imbalances in the absence of additional measures over the medium term. Consequently, the sensitivity of the internal and external imbalances to fiscal measures was evaluated. The projections under an unchanged policy stance (that is, in the absence of additional measures) indicated that the adjustment impetus of the 1995 measures would be eroded over time by the upward drift in expenditure on wages and domestic interest payments. Consequently, the budget deficit would decline in 1995 and gradually rise thereafter. Similarly, the external current account deficit, although improved in 1995, would exhibit a less pronounced upward drift than the drift in the budget deficit, reflecting the counter-balancing effects of the decrease in government expenditure and the continued high levels of private consumption. For adjustment, a set of additional fiscal measures, including substantial reductions in the wage bill and increases in non-oil revenues, were formulated and incorporated into the medium-term projections. These projections indicated that, if the impetus of the 1995 measures were vigorously reinforced over the medium term, both the budget and external current account deficit could be eliminated by 2000, in line with the objectives of the authorities' Sixth Development Plan. 2. Main uroiection assumutions under an unchanaed uolicv stance a. GDP proiections (1) Through regression analysis, certain sensitivity relationships (elasticities) were established between private sector and government sector GDP growth and government expenditures. Oil sector growth was correlated with the growth of oil production and exports. (2) Based on historical data, the oil GDP deflator was projected on the basis of the projected oil prices and non-oil GDP deflator growth was assumed to be the same as the rate?. projected by the WE0 for the GDP deflator growth in Saudi Arabia's industrial trading partners. b. Budgetary projections (1) Oil revenue was projected to be 67 percent of the projected oil export receipts, the ratio observed in 1994. Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 27 - APPENDIX IV (2) Non-oil revenue in 1995 was projected to be the same as in the 1995 budget, as confirmed by independent staff estimates. During 1996. 2000, the growth of non-oil revenues reflect nearly the private GDP growth. (3) Wages were assumed to increase by 4 percent per year, reflecting the standard annual increase as well as the impact of possible increases in the government payroll as observed in 1994. (4) Domestic interest payments were projected on the basis of the projected domestic debt level in the current year and the previous year, with the interest rate corresponding to the U.S. dollar interest rate on U.S. dollar deposits projected by the WEO. Amortization payments are assumed to move along with the projected net domestic debt level. (5) Other expenditure was assumed to remain nearly constant in real terms. (6) Budgetary financing was assumed to come entireLy from domestic government bond sales and loans, as intended by the authorities. c. Balance of payments projections (1) Oil export receipts were projected on the basis of the average Saudi Arabian oil export price, based on the WE0 projections and industry estimates, and on the basis of the staff estimates made in consultation with the authorities concerning production capacity and oil export volume, Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota, and domestic oil consumption levels. (2) Non-oil export receipts were assumed to reflect largely the growth in the private sector, with a small surge in 1995 and expected to continue in 1996, as anticipated by the authorities in view of the brisk growth observed in 1994. (3) As regards service receipts, investment income was assumed to be constant in nominal terms through 1995-2000 and other service receipts were projected to reflect foreign interest rate movements and private GDP growth. (4) Imports of goods and services were assumed to move in line with total non-oil GDP and the private sector and government sector GDP. (5) Official transfers (foreign aid) were assumed to remain constant in nominal terms and private transfers were assumed to move in line with private sector GDP. (6) Net capital inflows were projected on the assumption that foreign asset transfers by the commercial banks would remain steady in 1995 at the level observed in the first quarter of 1995 and official foreign borrowing for balance of payments purposes would be nil, as intended by the authorities. It was assumed that, as of 1996, the external financing Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 28 - APPENDIX IV requirement would be met by private capital inflows, including the projected flows for project financing associated with Saudi Aramco, SABIC, and Saudia. In the event private capital inflows are not realized to the extent that the balance of payments achieves an overall balance, the implication is that either net official foreign assets will be drawn down or external debt will be incurred. 3. Hain projection assumptions under adiustment a. GDP proiections The projection methodology under an unchanged policy stance was maintained. However, owing to the impact of the retrenchment in the government sector, private sector GDP growth was projected to pick up substantially as of 1997, compensating for lower growth of the government sector GDP than under the projections without adjustment. With the oil sector projections and the assumed inflation rates remaining the same. the GDP deflator projections were not changed. b. Budgetary proiections Oil revenue projections were maintained as under the projections without adjustment. Non-oil revenues were projected to increase as a result of the following revenue and expenditure measures proposed by the staff: (1) imposition of a broad-based tax on consumption at the rate of 5 percent; (2) imposition of excises et the rate of 10 percent on selective goods, such as textiles and clothing, jewelry. and motor vehicles; (3) imposition of a turnover tax on domestically and foreign- owned companies at the rate of 2 percent; (4) further increases in the domestic gasoline and diesel fuel prices by 20 percent in 1996 and increasing these prices in line with inflation through 2000; (5) reductions in the budgetary wage bill by 1 percent per year during 1996-97 and further cutbacks by 2 percent per year during 1998-2000; (6) reduction in subsidies as of 1996 to the minimum level corresponding to payments associated with the social safety net; (7) maintenance of the remaining expenditure (excluding domestic interest payments) at a constant level in real terms through 2000. The remaining assumptions concerning budgetary projections were maintained as under the projections without adjustment, except for investment income which was projected to increase reflecting the improvement in the foreign assets position that could be anticipated as a result of Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 29 - APPENDIX IV sustained adjustment. Corresponding to the decline in budgetary financing requirements, interest payments were projected to decline in real terms as of 1998. resulting in a decline in the level of domestic government indebtedness. c. Balance of Dayments prelections With the projections for oil export receipts remaining unchanged, non- oil exports were projected to increase rapidly as of 1997, reflecting the broadening of and the pickup in the growth of the private sector. At the same time, investment income was also projected to rise reflecting the possible improvement in the official and private foreign assets. The remaining projections assumptions were maintained as under the projections without adjustment.

Data reDorting The currentness of data made available to the Fund improved considerably during the 1995 Article IV consultation discussions. Data on the budgetary, monetary. and balance of payments were provided up to end- March 1995. New data for deposit money banks, based on a new methodology implemented by the Saudi Arabian ?fonetary Agency (SAHA). were included in the March 1995 issue of IFS after extensive correspondence with the authorities to clarify methodological end sectoral issues. Financial data are reported to the Statistics Department (STA) on a regular basis. However, legs and gaps in such data provision exist: (a) real sector data are reported to STA by SAMA with a one-year delay; (b) no data on industrial production, employment. and earnings are reported to STA; (c) fiscal data are not reported to STA; (d) monetary data on SAMA's balance sheet are not current and are updated in the IFS up to September 1992 only; (e) data on balance of payments are reported to STA with a one- year delay: however, the coverage of services and capital accounts is not comprehensive. Generally, available data continue to be sufficient to make a realistic assessment of Saudi Arabia's macroeconomic balances and medium-term prospects for the purposes of Article IV consultation discussions. However, more up-to-date data reporting is desirable in-between consultations in order for the Fund to keep abreast of economic developments on a more current basis. 2. Data publication policy While date provided to MED missions are made available in the Fund documents intended for internal circulation, the authorities favor only the publication of officially finalized and approved data, in particular. those on the balance of payments and the balance sheet of SAW, including the data on the net official reserves; data on the budgetary accounts are published in official publications such as the SAMA annual report and the Central Department of Statistics' The Statistical Indicators. 3. Data issues in each sector a. Financial sector The statistics reported to the Middle Eastern Department (MED) during consultations on the consolidated government's fiscal operations are generally satisfactory in terms of coverage and quality. Currentness of such data has been improved as of 1994 when the authorities started Download Date: 9/25/2017 - 3:55 PMCurrent Classification: Available to the Public- 31 - APPENDIX V reporting the current year's outcome on a quarterly basis for the latest available quarter. Similarly, coverage was improved through reporting of domestic and foreign interest payments and amortization. Detailed data are provided on the financing of the budget deficit by sources, maturity structure, and interest rates. b. Honetarv sector The statistics reported to MED during consultations have generally adequate coverage. There has been some improvement in 1995 as monetary data were provided up to end-March 1994 and data for the previous years were reported on a finalized basis. c. Oil sector Oil sector data are lacking in currentness. Although the data on oil export receipts and budgetary oil revenues are available from the corresponding accounts, current data on oil production, exports, and prices have not been made available recently; however, the authorities provided estimates. d. Balance of Dawnents The openness of the Saudi Arabian economy and the historical convertibility of the external current and capital accounts combined with the absence of detailed procedures to obtain information on transactions continue to hinder data collection by the authorities, in particular, in the areas of private sector assets and earnings abroad, private capital inflows from abroad, and service payments abroad. Data are reported regularly to STA on an annual basis. However, no breakdowns of international reserves and of net foreign assets are reported. e. National accounts and price indices Data on the national accounts are available on a yearly basis as are the data on GDP deflators. However, these data have not been reported to STA since 1992. With regard to price statistics, the data are available on a monthly basis and are regularly reported to STA. The consumer price index (CPI) covers the ten largest cities; its weights are derived from a 1988 household budget survey of middle-income population. Although the data on external trade have recently improved, they are still uncurrent. The latest data on exports refer to 1993.
